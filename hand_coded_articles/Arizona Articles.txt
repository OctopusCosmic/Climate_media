With Arizona's annual electricity demands projected to double to 32,000 megawatts by 2030, the state must have more renewable-energy resources such as solar and wind power, said Kris Mayes, former chairwoman of the Arizona Corporation Commission.

 

"It used to be that nobody at utilities wanted to work in the renewable-energy department, but now, everybody wants to work there," said Mayes, speaking earlier this month at the Curbing Carbon Forum, sponsored by the Southwest Renewable Energy Institute and held at the Hyatt Regency hotel in downtown Phoenix.

 

"We're going to be doing more solar rooftops in the state of Arizona than any other state except California," Mayes said.

 

If Arizona had to support its growth in the same old-fashioned way, Mayes said, it would have to build eight new Hoover Dams, 28 new combined-cycle natural-gas plants, or four new Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Stations.

 

The Curbing Carbon Forum focused on issues from coal plants nearing the end of their design life to a discussion of what a future would look like with renewable- energy resources.

 

Like Mayes, Kurt Yeager, vice chairman of Galvin Electricity Institute, said America cannot build "a 21st- century economy with a 20th-century electricity system."

 

Because of the unreliability, inefficiency and productivity penalties of our current system, billions of dollars of value is being lost in the U.S. economy, he said.

 

Arizona Public Service and Salt River Project both are working toward more renewable-energy sources for the state.

 

"We project we're going to add approximately 750,000 new homes and businesses to our grid by 2030 (about a 65percent increase)," said Jenna Shaver, an APS spokeswoman. "And we plan to meet the demand that customer growth is going to have for electricity through renewable energy and our energy-efficiency program."

 

Shaver said that:

 

In less than a decade, APS' renewable portfolio has grown from less than 1 megawatt to more than 900megawatts in operation or in development.

 

More than 17,500 customers have participated in the APS Renewable Energy Incentive Program, helping them offset the costs of installing renewable resources to their homes or businesses.

 

Solar development can power Arizona's economy, attracting new companies, projects and quality jobs. For example, she said, APS' AZ Sun Program is creating more than 3,000 construction jobs over the next five years and will bring 200 megawatts of solar power to APS customers.

 

For its part, SRP in May had a public process in which it solicited input from stakeholders and customers about what level of investment they would like to see from SRP.

 

What came out of the process is that it's really important for customers, stakeholders and SRP's board to move even further than they already have in sustainable investments, said Barry Petrey, manager of Resource Acquisition and Analysis Group.

 

"As a result, SRP has increased its sustainable portfolio from a target of 15 percent to a more aggressive target," Petrey said. "Twenty percent of the energy that we produce for our retail customers will need to come from sustainable resources by 2020. We're doing more, and we're doing more sooner."

 

Additionally, Petrey talked about SRP's approach.

 

"Our board understands the importance of doing this in a cost-effective manner for our customers and has afforded us a tremendous amount of flexibility," he said. "So, we are able to pursue the most cost-effective mix and balance for our customers and be able to hit that target in a way that can still leave our pricing as reasonable as possible."

 

Dave Olsen, managing director of the Western Grid Group, said at the conference that the move to a clean-energy economy is the best way to create jobs and spur revitalization. His group seeks to accelerate the incorporation of a broad range of low-carbon technologies into the electric system in the western U.S. As an example, he cited the U.S. Army, which has set goals to reduce energy consumption, increase efficiency and reduce adverse impacts on the environment.

 

"Energy now really matters to the people in Arizona," Mayes told conference attendees. She noted that Deer Valley High School students demanded that their school building be solarized. In addition, the Gila Bend community is becoming the solar-energy capital not only in the country but also potentially the world because of its innovative policy on solar-power project permits.

 

"You can walk into a restaurant or any gas station in Gila Bend and talk to a waitress or a gas-station employee, and they'll speak with you intelligently about solar energy," Mayes said. "Why? Because they've come to believe that solar energy can help make their lives better economically and that renewable energy is Arizona's economic destiny."

 

This will not come from a "magical" vote by Congress or a single Environmental Protection Agency decision; it will be the people who will drive the transition away from coal, Mayes said.

 

Here's what Mayes said Arizona needs to be doing now:

 

Audit its coal fleet to see which plants are least efficient and most polluting. These would make the most sense to ramp down

 

Formulate a plan that involves stakeholder input.

 

Treat renewables as a mainstream resource.

 

Put its focus on renewables.

 

But Mayes recognized that politics might hinder this transition.

 

She said there is "a political problem in this country and in the West" in advancing the diversification of energy portfolios. The federal government must do a better job, she said, because this is the top threat to advancing renewable energy throughout the West.

 

To discuss the efficient integration of renewable resources, the Western Conference of Public Service Commissioners will hold a joint meeting in Sunriver, Ore., in the spring.

A committee in the Arizona Senate approved a measure that would freeze the state's renewable-energy standard at 15percent by 2025.

 

The Republican-sponsored bill passed on a 4-2 party-line vote with one member of the Government Reform Committee not voting.

 

House Bill 2789 originally had sought to get the state Legislature and governor more involved in regulations regarding alternative energy, rules that currently are made by the Arizona Corporation Commission.

 

But a striker amendment simplified the bill to state that no public utility can be held to a higher renewable-energy standard than those already in place.

 

The Corporation Commission, five elected statewide officials who oversee utility rates, voted in 2006 to require utilities such as Arizona Public Service Co. to get 15percent of their power from renewable sources such as solar and wind by 2025.

24,000 at US Airways to share $12 mil in profits

 

Eligible US Airways employees received profit-sharing checks totaling $12million Wednesday.

 

About 24,000 of US Airways' 32,000 employees received the payments, based on the company's $111million profit for 2011.

 

The $12million pool is less than the $47million shared by employees last year before rising fuel costs began cutting into the company's profit.

 

Chairman and CEO Doug Parker said in a statement that committed employees helped make US Airways profitable in 2011 despite higher fuel costs and that the company is pleased to share its financial success with them.

Company's co-founder due honor at Pentagon

 

Joyce Stewart, co-founder of AGM Container Controls Inc. in Tucson, is being honored for providing service and leadership in military packaging and handling for 50 years.

 

She is the first woman to receive the NIPHLE Special Award from the National Institute of Packaging, Handling and Logistics Engineers. The award will be presented at the Pentagon during a March 27-29 conference.

 

Stewart and her husband, Roger Stewart, founded the company in 1970 and initially manufactured environmental- control hardware for containers holding missiles and other sensitive equipment. Since then, the company has branched out to design and make products that control and monitor moisture, pressure and vacuum changes, and shock and vibration for a variety of industries.

 

The Stewarts retired from their business last year. Their son, Howard, who has been with the company since 1971, is the president.

Climate-change skeptic to talk to 'tea party' groups 

Wright, Lesley . Arizona Republic ; Phoenix, Ariz. [Phoenix, Ariz]26 May 2012: B.3.

ABSTRACT

  

While denying that he is a "birther," Monckton told syndicated radio host Dennis Miller in March that he believes the birth certificate posted by the White House is a forgery that can be taken apart with software.

FULL TEXT

 

The Surprise Tea Party Patriots, which won national exposure this month by continuing to question President Barack Obama's birth certificate, will host a speech by British global-warming skeptic Lord Christopher Monckton on Monday.

 

The talk will be at Sun City West Foundation Plaza, 14465 W. R.H. Johnson Blvd., and donations will go to Sheriff Joe Arpaio's cold-case posse.

 

Monckton and conservative author Tom Ballantyne also will speak to the Red Mountain Tea Party. That talk will be Tuesday at East Valley High School, 7420 E. Main St., in Mesa.

 

Arpaio has cited petitions from the Surprise group as the impetus to send his cold-case posse to Hawaii to investigate Obama's birth certificate.

 

Monckton, the third viscount of Brenchley, also has waded into the controversy. While denying that he is a "birther," Monckton told syndicated radio host Dennis Miller in March that he believes the birth certificate posted by the White House is a forgery that can be taken apart with software.

 

The controversial speaker has had a varied career in journalism, politics and business. His biography states that he served as a science-policy adviser to former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.

 

He has given speeches around the world based on his theory that the increasing concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere essentially is harmless and that scientists and politicians have manipulated data to exaggerate the problem.

 

Mainstream scientists around the world disagree.

 

Surprise Tea Party founder Jim Wise said Monckton was invited because the group seeks out alternate views.

 

"Our main thrust is education, and he has a perspective on climate change," Wise said.

 

Ballantyne, who wrote "Oh Really, O'Reilly! The Spin Starts Here ... Apparently!" will precede Monckton.

 

Ballantyne said his talk will focus on "the identity fraud being committed by the president of the United States."

 

Ballantyne said he is adding a chapter to his book about the investigation by Arpaio's cold-case posse called "One Mean Hombre -- America's Last Best Hope: Another Lawman from Arizona."

West Valley embracing renewable energy, sustainability 

Publication info: Arizona Republic ; Phoenix, Ariz. [Phoenix, Ariz]03 Oct 2012: 30.

ProQuest document link 



 





ABSTRACT

  

Buckeye Public Works Director Scott Lowe said the town is trying to be as efficient as possible through solar power, LED bulbs in its traffic lights and streetlights and reuse of waste water to irrigate baseball fields.

Green is such a good color on Arizona. On Sunday, public-interest organization Valley Forward Association announced the winners of its Environmental Excellence Awards. Bravo to the West Valley organizations that hit the mark and showed just what sustainability and renewable energy mean to the region.

 

To their credit, several West Valley cities have embraced renewable energy as a way of life and for economic development reasons.

 

Although they didn't make the list of Valley Forward's winners, other West Valley residents were acknowledged for their dedication to the environment. Goodyear, Buckeye and Sun City West were crowned "Arizona Solar Community" by Arizona SmartPower, a non-profit that promotes clean, renewable energy.

 

More than 1,150 Buckeye homeowners have installed solar photovoltaic panels on their homes. SmartPower challenged 14 Arizona communities to install such panels in 5percent of homes by 2015, but the three West Valley communities rose to the challenge faster than imagined.

 

State director of Arizona SmartPower Toni Bouchard said she never imagined communities would complete the goal so quickly but believes it is a sign of the future for Arizona.

 

"There's a growing understanding that the sun is a resource for Arizona," she said, adding that solar energy is especially embraced by retirees on fixed incomes for economic reasons.

 

Buckeye Public Works Director Scott Lowe said the town is trying to be as efficient as possible through solar power, LED bulbs in its traffic lights and streetlights and reuse of waste water to irrigate baseball fields. Goodyear's Mayor Georgia Lord has installed solar panels on her house and has been praising solar power for quite some time.

 

Residents in the three areas have embraced solar power, but they are not alone in their mission. Several West Valley towns and cities operate on a "green" schedule, with extended hours Mondays through Thursdays. That means the communities save a bit of energy on Fridays.

 

Avondale is such a city, and it is also making other strides to become more environmentally friendly. Avondale spokeswoman Ingrid Melle said the city has green initiatives such as the "Clean Air Make More"' campaign for air-pollution prevention through promoting carpooling and bus services to residents and city employees.

 

Some cities and towns have community gardens and farmers markets as well. Surprise is opening a garden at Lizard Run Park on Oct. 26.

 

Renewable energy and sustainability are growing trends in the West Valley, and green is the new color of choice for many. Let's hope it doesn't go out of style.

Climate-change film 'Bastards' screams to the choir 

VanDenburgh, Barbara . Arizona Republic ; Phoenix, Ariz. [Phoenix, Ariz]08 Mar 2013: P.3.

ProQuest document link 



 





ABSTRACT

  

After a failed attempt to get ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson on the phone for an interview ("I guess he was busy with world domination that day" he quips, self-satisfied), Rosebraugh decides to crash the company's annual shareholders' meeting, Michael Moore-style, to ask Tillerson point-blank about his stance on global warming in front of an audience and a few secret cameras.

FULL TEXT

 

There comes a point in some arguments where politeness just isn't an option anymore. Filmmaker Craig Scott Rosebraugh is clearly past the point of pleasantries, right down to the title of his documentary, "Greedy Lying Bastards," named for the businesspeople, politicians and shareholders who have a vested, monetary interest in preventing any progress in environmental policy.

 

Rosebraugh has a point -- there's plenty to be mad about. Much of the film plays out like a disaster-film montage: tornadoes tearing swaths through the Midwest, Hurricane Katrina laying waste to New Orleans, wildfires destroying hundreds of homes in Colorado, the severity and intensity of which are attributable to human-influenced increases in global temperatures.

 

Unlike Al Gore's 2006 climate-change documentary, "An Inconvenient Truth," the film's not interested in arguing the reality of human-caused climate change, frontloading the film with grave expertise in the form of infographics and interviews to establish the scientific certainty of climate change. Instead, the film explores why nothing is being done to change humanity's destructive habits when we've suspected the consequences of our consumption for decades (particularly cute is a clip of a science film from the 1950s predicting the ecological disasters we currently face).

 

To find the answer, Rosebraugh follows the money trail. It leads from the bottom-feeding TV carnival barkers who make the rounds on cable news channels spouting lies, to such politicians as Sen. James Inhofe who line their pockets with campaign cash from the oil industry, all the way up to the villainous Koch brothers, billionaire bogeymen of the liberal left, with pot shots at Fox News and the "tea party" along the way.

 

In Rosebraugh's uncompromising hands, it plays out like a strident screed for those already burning with righteous indignation. It isn't interested in making friends and influencing people, but in firing up the base. It can be off-putting, even for those playing on the same team, and that's unfortunate, because the film is at its most convincing when Rosebraugh gets out of the way and dispenses with the snide commentary to let the tearful interviews with families who've lost their homes, or farmers who've lost their crops, make the case for making change.

 

There's even little catharsis in Rosebraugh's big "gotcha" moment. After a failed attempt to get ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson on the phone for an interview ("I guess he was busy with world domination that day" he quips, self-satisfied), Rosebraugh decides to crash the company's annual shareholders' meeting, Michael Moore-style, to ask Tillerson point-blank about his stance on global warming in front of an audience and a few secret cameras.

 

And what does he get from Tillerson? Some well-rehearsed, polite platitudes about the seriousness of global warming and the importance of keeping an open dialogue.

 

Rosebraugh's conclusion? "These companies care more about making money than they do about our lives and the health of the planet." Contemptible? Yes. But it hardly qualifies as a game-changing bombshell. Who ever thought corporations cared about people?

 

Again, there's a lot to be angry about. And though Rosebraugh shines a light on plenty of jaw-dropping corruption, it plays out like a shrill rallying cry without catharsis for the already initiated.

Climate change is a moral issue, as well; we need leadership from all levels 

Bland, Doug . Arizona Republic ; Phoenix, Ariz. [Phoenix, Ariz]20 Apr 2013: 25.

ProQuest document link 



 





ABSTRACT

  

"The global nature of the problem ... means that effective action requires leadership at the local, state and national levels to form policies and strategies that address responsible energy use to ensure that we protect creation and its most vulnerable populations from the significant threats posed by global climate change."

 



LINKS

FULL TEXT

 

In honor of Earth Day next Monday, more than 100 religious leaders in Arizona affirm that "climate change is one of the most pressing challenges facing our world today." We urge other religious leaders in Arizona and members of mosques, churches, temples and synagogues across the state to join us.

 

The debate about climate change usually centers on economics and politics. We assert that climate disruption is, first and foremost, a spiritual and moral issue, rooted in our relationship with God and our neighbors.

 

Our materialism and energy consumption threaten life as we know it. All of our sacred scriptures -- Torah, Bible, Quran -- declare that the Earth is a sacred gift of God and that human beings are charged with protecting and preserving Earth's beauty and bounty.

 

Whether our fellow creatures have two legs or four, wings or paws, fur or feathers or skin, soft leaves or sharp spines, they are our neighbors. They sustain and enrich our lives. We are called to love and care for them.

 

Where some see irreconcilable division between faith and science, we recognize that scientists are sometimes God's contemporary prophets. Christians, Muslims, Jews and Buddhists across Arizona agree with the scientific consensus that "global climate patterns are bringing more extreme weather events to Arizona, the United States and our world."

 

These events include droughts, extreme temperatures, floods, storm surges and wildfires. Global climate disruption threatens our economy, national security, agriculture, our health and safety, and the well-being of our children and future generations. Those who are least able to adapt to climate change and who contribute least to the problem suffer the worst consequences.

 

We affirm: "There are many actions that can be taken by individuals, families, congregations, businesses, local communities and the state to reduce the threat of worldwide climate disruptions, such as reducing energy use in our homes and vehicles and using renewable energy sources."

 

But signers of the statement believe that individual actions, though necessary and important, are not enough. "The global nature of the problem ... means that effective action requires leadership at the local, state and national levels to form policies and strategies that address responsible energy use to ensure that we protect creation and its most vulnerable populations from the significant threats posed by global climate change."

 

We urge our state Legislature and the Arizona Corporation Commission to lead with courage and wisdom.

 

Support clean renewable-energy and energy-efficiency programs. Protect and help recover endangered species. Care for and restore our rivers and our streams. Stop pitting jobs against environmental stewardship. Our jobs and economy depend on a healthy environment.

 

This Earth Day, get outside. Take a walk. Drive less. Live more simply. Find a faith community or environmental organization protecting the Earth and get involved. Celebrate God's good Earth!

Phoenix makes inroads on renewable energy 

Reid, Betty . Arizona Republic ; Phoenix, Ariz. [Phoenix, Ariz]06 Dec 2013: 3.

ProQuest document link 



 





ABSTRACT

  

Twenty-four Phoenix-owned properties have solar panels, which moves the nation's sixth-largest city closer to its goal of harnessing more renewable energy. The city then added solar panels to other facilities, such as the North Transfer Station, the Phoenix Convention Center's west building and Camp Colley, 50 miles north of Payson, in 2009.

Twenty-four Phoenix-owned properties have solar panels, which moves the nation's sixth-largest city closer to its goal of harnessing more renewable energy.

 

City officials hope that at least 15percent of the city's energy use comes from "green" sources, including solar, by 2025.

 

The solar projects account for about 4percent of the city's energy use.

 

That is progress, said Vice Mayor Bill Gates, who leads the City Council's sustainability subcommittee.

 

"I think the city is very serious about reaching that goal of 15percent.... I think we made great strides by adding solar panels to buildings," Gates said. "What I've been pushing the city is to develop other forms of renewable energy."

 

City officials are considering other options, such as harnessing energy from the gasses coming from landfills or producing electricity by using treated wastewater.

 

But the most prominent renewable resource the city uses comes from the Arizona sun.

 

Gates said the city will outfit two other Phoenix parking garageswith solar panels early next year.

 

Solar contracts

 

Phoenix has installed some of the systems itself, using grants or city funds to finance the projects.

 

The projects aren't cheap. For example, the solar panels at the Sunnyslope Community Center cost $480,000, city officials said.

 

But the city also has more recently worked with SunPower Corporation. SunPower installed the panels on aviation facilities, a water-treatment plant and downtown garages, city officials said.

 

SunPower owns the solar systems. It pays for the design, construction and installation, and then operates and maintains them. Phoenix commits to buy the energy output, city officials said.

 

Dimitrios Laloudakis, the acting director of Phoenix's Public Works Department, said the 24 facilities generate an estimated 14,056 kilowatts. The city estimates it will save about $9million for 13 megawatts over 20 years, he said.

 

"There is a net savings over time," Laloudakis said. "We pay less for energy."

 

Solar history

 

Phoenix began to place solar equipment on its properties during the late 1990s, city officials said. The first included smaller panels on bus stations along Central Avenue.

 

Phoenix started the big solar push in 2007, when the city put larger panels at the Pecos Park and Ride, near Pecos Road and 40th Street in Ahwatukee.

 

The city then added solar panels to other facilities, such as the North Transfer Station, the Phoenix Convention Center's west building and Camp Colley, 50 miles north of Payson, in 2009.

 

Last year, the city placed a nine solar-panel systems on buildings.

 

City officials had to weigh facility layout and potential output of energy when deciding where to place the panels. Officials looked at whether a building had a plenty of space, faced the sun and could be committed to a long-term solar-project installation.

Seven of city's 10 hottest years have come since 2000. Experts say Valley's 'heat island' effect, climate change may be to blame.

ABSTRACT

  

The effects of climate change are hard to gauge, he said, but theories common among scientists predict wider swings in the region's future weather.

FULL TEXT

 

The hottest summer on record helped make 2013 the eighth-warmest year ever in Phoenix, according to a National Weather Service review of data released Monday.

 

The city's average temperature, combining night and day year-round, was 75.9. The average high of 87.6 was the 10th-warmest, while the average low (64.2) was the sixth-warmest low temperature.

 

A hotter summer and streaky precipitation throughout the year contributed to a lack of clarity about what's really normal anymore.

 

Whether climate change or the urban "heat island" effect are contributing to rising average temperatures, 2013 was hot in Tucson, too, where it was the fifth-warmest year, averaging 70.9 degrees. Tucson also experienced a record 81 consecutive nights at 70 degrees or warmer.

 

A year that started with an unusual cold spell for Phoenix, including a 29-degree reading on Jan. 15, was broiling by June. At 94.8 degrees, an average of 4 degrees above normal, it was hotter than any previous June. At 119 degrees, June29 was the fourth-hottest day in recorded Phoenix history.

 

With seven of the city's 10 hottest years coming since 2000, the thermometer seems to be trending increasingly upward. This hotter stretch of years has coincided with a fierce drought and wildfires statewide.

 

State Climatologist Nancy Selover said climate change may be playing a role. "Exactly how much, I don't know," she said.

 

One thing she's sure of, though, is that an odd pattern of humid nights broken by sporadic monsoon rains helped store heat overnight for long stretches of time last summer.

 

A major contributor to the sweltering summer likely was the Valley's continued growth and the heat-trapping qualities of urban environments, said Michael Leuthold, a University of Arizona research meteorologist. Blacktop and buildings collect warmth that once dissipated overnight.

 

"If you start out the morning 2 or 3 degrees warmer than it was 20 years ago," Leuthold said, "you're certainly going to get hotter."

 

The effects of climate change are hard to gauge, he said, but theories common among scientists predict wider swings in the region's future weather.

 

"It's never cut-and-dried with weather," Leuthold said, "but I think the majority of it is growth in the Phoenix valley."

 

Hotter summers mean higher energy bills for air-conditioning and greater water use as outdoor plants are stressed.

 

In Phoenix in 2013, there were 115 days that exceeded 100 degrees and 25 days above 110 degrees -- both measures outpacing the average since 1981.

 

The city finished 2013 with 8.42 inches of rain, pushed over the average of 8.03 by an unusual late-November storm in which much of Maricopa County got more than 2 inches.

 

That was welcome relief in the 15th year of the Southwest's most-intense drought in recorded history. But the region's water supply will remain troubled until some big winters pile up snow in northern Arizona and in the Rocky Mountains.

 

The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation on Monday listed Lake Powell as 44percent full, which is low enough that managers will start slowing releases downstream to Lake Mead this year. Without a rebound, these major reservoirs could face a shortage that would reduce the state's share of Colorado River water.

 

That wouldn't put the Phoenix area's municipal systems at risk for immediate shortage, though. The state has stored river water in aquifers, and Salt River Project expects that even a slightly dry winter would fill its in-state reservoirs to about 80 percent of capacity.

 

High temperatures didn't just affect urban areas. Prescott experienced a late-June heat wave, which wildfire investigators determined affected the deadly Yarnell Hill Fire. Temperatures for the year at Prescott's airport were a half-degree above normal.

 

But not all the state suffered sustained heat. In the northern forests, where years of drought and warming winters have contributed to tree-killing beetle outbreaks, many locations logged average temperatures slightly cooler than usual.

 

Flagstaff was 0.6-degree cooler than usual.

 

Page, Bellemont, and Walnut Canyon and Wupatki national monuments all had their wettest monsoon seasons, while Flagstaff, Tusayan and Grand Canyon's Phantom Ranch had their second-wettest monsoons, said Megan Schwitzer, a Weather Service meteorologist.

 

"The wet monsoon season definitely helped our annual water budget," she said.

Climate change real in Ariz., too

ABSTRACT

  

A recent report from the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says greenhouse-gas emissions need to be drastically cut worldwide in order to avert a major climate catastrophe. Environmental Protection Agency orders to reduce pollution from northern Arizona's Navajo Generating Station -- the largest coal-fired energy plant in the West -- threatened to do just that.

Arizona faces significant threats from climate change. That gives us a big stake in moving beyond denial and into productive problem-solving.

 

A focus on addressing climate change requires finding effective strategies for well-known Arizona problems. It means protecting human health, the environment and economic development.

 

Vetted, peer-reviewed studies have shown that global warming is happening, caused by human activities, primarily burning oil, gas and coal. A recent report from the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says greenhouse-gas emissions need to be drastically cut worldwide in order to avert a major climate catastrophe. That won't be easy.

 

Scientists working on an update of the congressionally mandated National Climate Assessment say Arizona faces a number of major challenges. Most involve known problems. All need to be addressed, regardless of whether politicians accept what scientists are saying.

 

As a desert state, Arizona will feel the effects of climate change most severely around "water, water, water" as the state gets hotter and drier, says Don Wuebbles, professor of atmospheric science at the University of Illinois and one of many respected scientists working on the update of the climate assessment.

 

Arizona water experts, such as former Sen. Jon Kyl, urge that planning start now for water shortages. Climate scientists' predictions of prolonged droughts make it more important to look beyond current overallocated sources.

 

The non-profit Environmental and Energy Study Institute says snowpack levels and stream flow are already down measurably in the Southwest. This impacts one of Arizona's major water sources, the Colorado River.

 

Arizona needs a serious and sustained discussion about balancing the needs of agriculture with growing urban centers. Water conservation and reclamation must be creatively and vigorously pursued, along with new sources of water.

 

Drier conditions, more severe insect infestations and increasingly intense fires threaten our forests. Arizona talks about the need to thin forests and address pests, such as bark beetles. But little real progress has been made. The state moves into yet another fire season without having met the human-safety needs identified after the deaths of 19 hotshots last year.

 

Climate change means increasingly severe weather events, including haboobs and highway dust storms. This, too, involves an existing problem. Yet nothing has been done to address stretches of Interstate 10 that are particularly subject to deadly flash dust storms.

 

Hotter conditions will result in more heat-related deaths. This is of particular concern because the elderly are among the most vulnerable, and Baby Boomers are aging. How does Arizona ensure that homes are properly insulated and that affordable cooling is available?

 

This is dicey. The price of electricity affects individuals and economic development, but cutting greenhouse-gas emissions can push up costs.

 

Environmental Protection Agency orders to reduce pollution from northern Arizona's Navajo Generating Station -- the largest coal-fired energy plant in the West -- threatened to do just that. The EPA agreed to a solution last year that does not unduly raise costs. But President Barack Obama is moving forward with proposed plans to further limit carbon emissions.

 

Arizona needs to be ready with ideas and solutions, not just arguments about whether global warming is a figment of Al Gore's imagination.

 

Climate change is real. It's a threat to Arizona. Facing that scientific fact can give added urgency to tackling long-standing state needs.

Let's have a legitimate debate on climate change 

Robb, Robert . Arizona Republic ; Phoenix, Ariz. [Phoenix, Ariz]09 May 2014: A.18.

ProQuest document link 



 





ABSTRACT

  

[...]they are proliferating, as more scientists get into the act. [...]there are unexplained anomalies. In its most recent report, the IPCC offers a sensible summary: "Responding to climate-related risks involves decision-making in a changing world, with continuing uncertainty about the severity and timing of climate-change impacts."

FULL TEXT

 

It's always amusing when laymen declare the scientific debate about climate change to be over.

 

What in the world does that mean?

 

It can't mean climate science has become fixed and unchanging. Scientists express their views about climate change and its effects in terms of ranges and probabilities, which constantly change. Climate computer models are continuously refined. And they are proliferating, as more scientists get into the act.

 

Moreover, there are unexplained anomalies. Global warming has been pretty flat the past 15 years. That's acknowledged by the latest assessment of the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the U.S. National Climate Assessment, whose release this week triggered a tornado of "the debate is over" proclamations.

 

The climate models don't predict this. There are a variety of theories as to why it has happened, but nothing the scientists claim is proven. And then there is the three-decade cooling period between 1940 and 1970, when the Industrial Revolution was fully humming. There are theories about that, as well, but again nothing regarded as proven. Those are some big anomalies.

 

There is tension between the IPCC assessment and the National Climate Assessment. The U.S. document makes bold predictions about regional effects and links to extreme weather events that the IPCC is far more cautious about.

 

The most prominent layman declaring the debate over is President Barack Obama. But there could be a robust debate between the Obama who ran for president in 2008 and the Obama who ran for re-election in 2012. The 2008 Obama was an anti-fossil-fuel warrior, pledging to slow the rise of the oceans and begin healing the planet. The 2012 Obama ran as an all-of-the-above energy guy, bragging about an increase in oil and natural-gas production.

 

In its most recent report, the IPCC offers a sensible summary: "Responding to climate-related risks involves decision-making in a changing world, with continuing uncertainty about the severity and timing of climate-change impacts."

 

That hardly describes a debate that is over. But it offers a useful starting point for a discussion about what the laymen who are politicians should be doing about it.

 

There should be healthy skepticism about the precision of computer models of something as complex as the climate of the entire world.

 

Still, the natural atmosphere serves us well. Unleashing man-made greenhouse gases changes it. Doing less of that is better than doing more of it.

 

The Obama administration is trying to choke coal to death through regulation. That might be OK if it were simultaneously removing barriers to natural-gas exploration, production and export.

 

Fracking has been the most effective climate-change response to date. Expanding the supply and reducing the cost of cleaner-burning natural gas has substantially reduced U.S. greenhouse emissions. The most effective thing the U.S. government could do to reduce global emissions would be to unleash U.S. natural-gas exports.

 

Domestically, it's unclear what the Obama administration is trying to accomplish by breathing political life back into the climate-change issue. Obama ran away from the issue in 2012. There doesn't seem to be a political advantage to raising its profile before the 2014 election, when Democrats from energy-producing states are highly vulnerable.

 

Other than strangling coal through regulation, the administration isn't promoting a big climate-change initiative. The administration couldn't get cap-and-trade passed when Democrats had firm control of Congress. Since then, cap-and-trade has proved a bust in Western Europe, where it has done much more to reward rent-seekers than to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions.

 

I continue to believe the most appropriate policy response would be the establishment of a small, revenue-neutral carbon tax. Working through the mechanics of a carbon tax would be a giant step forward.

 

A carbon tax, even a small one, would be a signal that carbon emissions have become a variable cost to be minimized. And a U.S.-designed carbon tax would be an exportable policy idea, to the extent other countries are willing to do something.

 

A carbon tax isn't on the table, either. Rather than declaring the debate over, maybe we should start having one.

Study links climate change to rise in devastating wildfires 

Ruiz, Celeste . Arizona Republic ; Phoenix, Ariz. [Phoenix, Ariz]21 May 2014: A.26.

ProQuest document link 



 





ABSTRACT

  

A previous study from the non-profit research group Headwaters Economics found that an increase in temperatures of 1 degree Fahrenheit when a fire is burning translates to 35 percent more acreage burned, according to the group's survey of California's Sierra Nevada and its foothill forests.

FULL TEXT

 

A new study shows wildfires have become increasingly common and more devastating since the 1970s, and researchers linked the spikes in fire activity to global climate change.

 

Climate Central, a group that researches climate change, compiled information from wildfires in the United States that have burned more than 1,000 acres since the 1970s and found that wildfires have become more common in recent years.

 

The number has increased from fewer than 50 wildfires in the Western U.S. in the 1970s to a peak of 150 in the last four years, according to the study.

 

The Climate Central study appears to bolster another research project that linked rising temperatures and fire activity.

 

Release of the latest study immediately drew criticism from climate-change skeptics who took to the group's website to air their view that the Climate Central study was simply a way to broach the topic of global warming.

 

Others on the group's site said the study did not adequately take into account U.S. Forest Service policies that might have changed through the decades to discourage wildland-fire managers from taking a direct approach on blazes that do not threaten people or homes.

 

A previous study from the non-profit research group Headwaters Economics found that an increase in temperatures of 1 degree Fahrenheit when a fire is burning translates to 35 percent more acreage burned, according to the group's survey of California's Sierra Nevada and its foothill forests.

 

Analysis of the temperatures in the new study by Climate Central showed that spring and summer seasons in Arizona are on average, 3 degrees warmer now than they were in the 1970s.

 

The average number of acres that burn in Arizona annually has also increased to almost 10 times more than what used to be the average in the '70s, according to Climate Central. The increase went from about 10,000 acres in the 1970s to an average of 95,000 acres annually.

 

In Arizona, nearly 1 million acres burned in 2011 alone.

 

That year, three notable wildfires, including the biggest fire in Arizona history, hit the state.

 

The Horseshoe Two Fire in the Chiricahua Mountains started on May 8 and spread to more than 220,000 acres. A little more than a month later, on June 12, the Monument Fire blazed in the canyons of the Huachuca Mountains, forcing evacuations and burning more than 30,500 acres. Around the same time, the Wallow Fire, the largest wildfire to date, burned in the White Mountains area of eastern Arizona. It charred more than 469,000 acres.

 

Alyson Kenward, lead researcher in the study, said that dramatic one-year spikes, like that in 2011, do not affect their overall analysis of annual wildfire reports.

 

"It's also important to keep in mind that a one-year spike in wildfires can be symptomatic of long-term changes in factors that affect wildfires, and aren't necessarily random," Kenward said.

 

For example, several years of drought or rising temperatures can successively increase wildfire risk, Kenward said.

Follow tribes' lead, join EPA plan to combat climate change 

Richardson, Bill . Arizona Republic ; Phoenix, Ariz. [Phoenix, Ariz]20 Nov 2014: A.13.

ProQuest document link 



 





ABSTRACT

  

The Environmental Protection Agency unveiled its Clean Power Plan this year, the most significant policy to date for addressing carbon pollution from power plants, the primary cause of climate change in the U.S. Climate change affects different communities in different ways, some more significantly than others.

 



LINKS

FULL TEXT

 

As the governor of New Mexico for eight years, I understand the challenges facing Native American communities and in particular how climate change disproportionately affects these communities.

 

As a former U.S. Energy secretary, I also have an intimate understanding of the benefits and opportunities that accrue from policies that help us transition to cleaner sources of energy.

 

The Environmental Protection Agency unveiled its Clean Power Plan this year, the most significant policy to date for addressing carbon pollution from power plants, the primary cause of climate change in the U.S. Climate change affects different communities in different ways, some more significantly than others. Tribal communities know the impacts more significantly than most.

 

That is why the EPA hearing in Phoenix this week, regarding the supplemental proposal to the Clean Power Plan addressing carbon pollution from affected plants in Indian Country and U.S. territories, was so important.

 

Tribes have already experienced significant negative effects of climate change, both from extreme weather and, particularly, health impacts.

 

Climate change and rising temperatures increase smog, a key trigger for asthma. A recent report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that asthma affects almost 12 percent of people living in tribal communities. That's almost double the national average -- one key reason we need to reduce dangerous carbon pollution and the climate change it's fueling. The problem will only grow with unmitigated climate change.

 

Climate change endangers not only the health but also the economic stability of tribal communities. Extreme drought is lowering water levels and impairing agricultural productivity. Extreme rainfall and snowfall has also led to flooding and dislocation.

 

The Navajo Nation and Hopi Tribe were severely affected by a 2010 snowstorm that produced several feet of snow. Many members of both tribes were stranded, and food and supplies had to be flown in to provide for those in remote areas.

 

Tribal communities are well aware of the imminent threat that climate change poses, and tribes are taking action to prevent devastation. In the Southwest and across the nation, tribes are trying to find ways to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions by implementing renewable energy, energy efficiency and weatherization measures. In a model case, the Gila River Indian Community hired a climate-projects specialist and coordinated a renewable energy team to implement energy- conservation projects.

 

Some tribes in Arizona and New Mexico have also worked to develop their wind energy resources with wind farms and solar energy through utility-scale solar projects. They have also explored the potential for developing geothermal energy resources.

 

Our nation's tribal communities are taking action to fight climate change, and the rest of the country needs to follow suit. Supporting the administration's Clean Power Plan is one surefire way to start. The proposal would cut carbon pollution by 30 percent from 2005 levels by 2030.

 

Reducing our carbon pollution needs to be a priority for everyone because climate change affects everyone. Although some communities are impacted more significantly than others by climate change, it is a national and global crisis. The EPA projects that its plan will prevent over 6,000 premature deaths, up to 150,000 asthma attacks in children, and more than 3,000 heart attacks.

 

I have promoted policies that protect communities while creating economic opportunities. The Clean Power Plan fights climate change in a manner that is good for our economy and our public health. It should be implemented without delay.

Climate change cited in Ariz. wildfire forecast 

Pitzl, Mary Jo . Arizona Republic ; Phoenix, Ariz. [Phoenix, Ariz]01 May 2015: A.5.

ProQuest document link 



 





ABSTRACT

  

Arizona faces a "fairly standard" wildfire season, with risk highest in the pine forests, along riverbeds and in the southeastern grasslands, state officials said.

 



LINKS

Climate change is contributing to the risk of wildfires across Arizona, state officials acknowledged Thursday. But they dodged questions about what is causing the changing environment, which has contributed to massive wildfires in Arizona over the last two decades.

 

They urged Arizonans to take precautions while in the state's forests and chaparral. That includes extinguishing campfires completely and reporting violations of fire-safety practices.

 

"I think that there is climate change," Gov. Doug Ducey told reporters. "What I am skeptical about is what human activity has to do with it."

 

Arizona faces a "fairly standard" wildfire season, with risk highest in the pine forests, along riverbeds and in the southeastern grasslands, state officials said.

 

Jeff Whitney, Ducey's appointee as state forester, also ducked a question about the origins of the shifting climate.

 

"Let's not get into why the climate is changing," Whitney said. "But it is climate."

 

Already, 300 fires have burned across 1,000 acres in Arizona, Whitney said. The fire season is expected to begin around Memorial Day and run until the monsoon brings rain and humidity, usually in July.

 

Whitney touted the Firewise program, which encourages property owners to keep brush, tree limbs and other flammable materials away from their homes. This clears a safe zone around a property where an approaching wildfirewould have a good chance to "lay down" instead of being fueled by the materials around a home.

 

Whitney said he's seeing an eerie similarity in fire conditions to two major fires that occurred in the last two decades: the Rio fire of 1995 in the McDowell Mountains of north Scottsdale, and the Cave Creek Complex fire of 2005, which burned north of Cave Creek and Carefree. Those fires were fueled by tinder-dry grasses and scrub that grew rapidly after a fairly wet winter, he said.

 

Chuck Maxwell, a meteorologist with the Southwest Coordination Center, said there will be some relief in that officials are not expecting high winds this season, which can quickly turn a small blaze into a major conflagration.

 

"This is not going to be a windy, driving, take-off-quickly fire season," he said. However, the center's forecast predicts a greater likelihood of lightning strikes igniting fires, especially in dry, grassy areas, he said.

 

But even with lightning posing a potentially greater risk this year than last, Ducey and others noted most fires are human-caused, and therefore, preventable.

 

"I caution everyone to follow the law," Ducey said. "Be safe, be smart, have fun and practice common sense."

Climate-change skeptics offer flawed forecast

ProQuest document link 



 





ABSTRACT

  

According to a University of Arizona and Stanford University study, more than 70 percent of Arizona residents believe the government should limit greenhouse gases.

 



LINKS

FULL TEXT

 

Gov. Doug Ducey and the Legislature might want to rethink those $100 million in cuts to education and put some of that cash into a science class ... for themselves.

 

Ducey is "skeptical" about human-caused climate change. Likewise, the Legislature sent 10 anti-environmental resolutions to Congress and also is loaded with science deniers.

 

Speaking a while back after a meeting on fire danger during summer, Ducey said, "We just went through a great briefing of all the experts. They informed me that the climate is changing. It's going to get warmer here."

 

Then he added, "What I am skeptical about is what human activity has to do with it."

 

I'm not scientifically equipped to illuminate the governor on this issue. However, I have read a few things that might help. For example, he might review a report available on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) website. It deals with the human-caused aspect of climate change and reads in part:

 

"In its Fourth Assessment Report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group of 1,300 independent scientific experts from countries all over the world under the auspices of the United Nations, concluded there's a more than 90 percent probability that human activities over the past 250 years have warmed our planet. ... The panel also concluded there's a better than 90 percent probability that human-produced greenhouse gases ... have caused much of the observed increase in Earth's temperatures over the past 50 years."

 

This is one of many scientific studies on the subject, studies that deal in facts, not supposition, not superstition and not political philosophy.

 

There are reports from the United States Environmental Protection Agency. From the Environmental Defense Fund. From the Union of Concerned Scientists. They all conclude, as the EPA reports, "Human activities are contributing to climate change, primarily by releasing billions of tons of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases, known as greenhouse gases, into the atmosphere every year."

 

If reading a scientific report is too daunting, Ducey might watch the documentary "Chasing Ice," featuring the work of National Geographic photographer James Balog and his Extreme Ice Survey. Or, if that film is too daunting, Ducey and lawmakers could watch any number of TED talks in which esteemed scientists briefly explain the human role in climate change.

 

According to a University of Arizona and Stanford University study, more than 70 percent of Arizona residents believe the government should limit greenhouse gases. The conclusions of the scientists cited above are based on methodical study of the natural world, not on whether they belong to the Republican Party or are Democrats. We live a state where climate change will have a huge impact on our lives. We need elected officials who are educated in the changes.

 

Ducey is skeptical of the science.

 

I'm skeptical of politicians.

FULL TEXT

 

Pope Francis' call for action on climate change represents wise use of a big bully pulpit. In making this a moral issue, he points out the dangers of the reckless pursuit of profits. He dings political shortsightedness. As head of the Catholic Church, his voice rises above the politics. He can reach a worldwide audience in a way that few people can match. By using his position for the good of the people and the planet, he's showing his own deep morality.

The dirty little secret about renewable energy 

Publication info: Arizona Republic ; Phoenix, Ariz. [Phoenix, Ariz]10 July 2015: A.15.

ProQuest document link 



 





LINKS

FULL TEXT

 

The debate over renewable energy -- aka, the "future" -- invariably skips past the harsh part about wind and solar power not being "dispatchable." That is, you can't always send it where you need it whenever you need it. Advocates talk as though still-unsolvable hurdles like storage and delivery capacity already are resolved. They aren't. But, it's worse than that. The cost of building capacity for wind and solar make gas energy more carbon efficient, too.

Five actions we can take to impact climate change 

Publication info: Arizona Republic ; Phoenix, Ariz. [Phoenix, Ariz]15 July 2015: Z.24.

ProQuest document link 



 





ABSTRACT

  

Promote "smart growth" community design, including complete streets and more mixed use developments.

 



LINKS

FULL TEXT

 

Many people believe the world is facing climate change that is likely to impact life as we know it here in the West Valley.

 

Is this fact or fancy?

 

Not being a climatologist, I do not claim to be an expert on the subject. But I do know that something like 95 percent of scientists who study this sort of thing believe we are in a long term secular warming trend. And in May, The Arizona Republic reported the results of a public opinion poll that indicated something like 75 percent of Arizonans think there is a problem.

 

Heck, even the pope has now announced he is a believer!

 

But, according to the same Republic article, those in state leadership positions, including our governor and most of our state legislators, do not believe this is an issue.

 

Being an empirical kind of guy, all I can go by is the reading on the thermometer outside my office window -- and the indicator arm on that device has been virtually maxed out since the first of June.

 

So, for the sake of argument, let's suppose we do have a climate change issue on our hands -- one which could significantly impact our quality of life in the years ahead. If this is the case, this is almost certainly a nation-wide issue and most likely a global issue. But climate change also has a regional dimension.

 

We here in the Valley of the Sun are not powerless to confront this hypothetical situation if we choose.

 

In the spirit of "think globally and act locally," here are some actions we can take to get ahead of this freight train. Let's start with five of the most local action items and work towards those where we can only have an influence in our larger communities.

 

Five ways we can help

 

Plant more shade trees. Shade trees can have a significant impact on the ambient heat in our communities and are something we can all plant on our own properties and encourage our communities to do. For an excellent guide on the climate benefits of shade trees and information on various types of shade trees, I recommend Avondale's "Street Trees Master Plan" on the city website.

 

Reduce pavement in favor of permeable ground cover. Areas covered by asphalt and other types of pavement tend to radiate heat into the atmosphere. Almost any sort of permeable ground cover will reduce heat radiation, including grass, but also drought-tolerant ground cover and even permeable paving materials that absorb heat rather than reflect it.

 

Consider applying a white elastomeric covering to the flat portions of your roof --- These roof coverings are reputed to reflect more of the sun's energy and maintain lower roof temperatures.

 

Drive more fuel-efficient, low-emission vehicles and expand your use of public transit.

 

Promote "smart growth" community design, including complete streets and more mixed use developments.

 

Once we have exhausted the readily-available means to address climate change in our own environment, we can support our communities in moving as quickly as possible towards more "climate-friendly" design concepts: Mixed use developments minimize the transportation needed for daily tasks and can be constructed in a more fuel-efficient manner. We can also complement mixed-use development with more complete streets, that embrace bicycles and other forms of transportation and decrease our dependence on automobiles.

 

By adopting some of these local actions, we can at least get a start in combating any climate change that might be occurring here in the Valley.

Obama to speak 'frankly' on 11-day climate change tour 

Korte, Gregory . Arizona Republic ; Phoenix, Ariz. [Phoenix, Ariz]25 Aug 2015: B.2.

ProQuest document link 



 





ABSTRACT

  

[...]while climate change won't be the sole focus of the trip, Obama is expected to talk about the need to rebuild from disasters in ways that make communities more resistant to the effects of rising seas, more frequent storms, deeper droughts and increased wildfires.

 



LINKS

FULL TEXT

 

"I'm going because Alaskans are on the front lines of one of the greatest challenges we face this century: Climate change. It's our wake-up call. The alarm bells are ringing, and as long as I'm president, America will lead the world to meet this threat before it's too late."

 

President Obama

 

washington -- President Obama will log more than 14,000 miles on Air Force One over the next 11 days in a tour on climate change that will take him from the desert West to the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Circle.

 

In Las Vegas, New Orleans and in the small Alaska fishing village of Kotzebue, Obama will deliver a three-pronged message: The U.S. needs to increase the use of alternative energy sources, make coastal communities more resilient and urge a global response to climate change.

 

The three major climate-themed events are part of an effort by Obama to speak "frequently and frankly" about the issue over his second term, said Brian Deese, a senior Obama adviser who handles environmental and energy issues for the White House.

 

They come three weeks after the White House launched a plan for cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 32% over 25 years.

 

In Las Vegas on Monday night, Obama was likely to tout new executive actions to make alternative energy sources more affordable in a speech to the National Clean Energy Summit. On Monday, the Department of Energy announced it would issue $1billion in loan guarantees for "distributed energy" projects -- technologies that allow consumers to generate their own electricity or obtain it from a nearby source.

 

The idea, officials said, was not just to invest in new technologies, but to make it easier for those technologies to get a foothold in the market. For example, the Federal Housing Administration announced a policy Monday that will allow the buyer of an energy-efficient home to assume the cost of those improvements through assessments using a federal mortgage.

 

In New Orleans on Thursday, Obama will mark the 10th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. And while climate change won't be the sole focus of the trip, Obama is expected to talk about the need to rebuild from disasters in ways that make communities more resistant to the effects of rising seas, more frequent storms, deeper droughts and increased wildfires.

 

"We've all tremendously increased our focus on how we build our modern infrastructure to be more resilient to all kinds of risks, including that of extreme weather," Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz said.

 

In a three-day trip to Alaska next week, Obama will crisscross the state, visiting the villages of Seward, Dellingham and Kotzebue to meet with local communities -- including Alaska Natives -- about the effect that melting glaciers and softening permafrost are having. His visit to Kotzebue, a largely Inupiat native village 33 miles above the Arctic Circle on the edge of the Chukchi Sea, will mark the northernmost trek of any sitting president in the United States.

 

"I'm going because Alaskans are on the front lines of one of the greatest challenges we face this century: Climate change," Obama said in a video released by the White House.

 

"It's our wake-up call. The alarm bells are ringing, and as long as I'm president, America will lead the world to meet this threat before it's too late."

 

He'll also address the State Department's Conference on Global Leadership in the Arctic, also known as the Glacier Conference, which is bringing together leaders from Arctic nations to grapple with climate issues.

 

But the Arctic trip also highlights some of the tensions in Obama's energy policy. Environmental groups have been sharply critical of the Interior Department's granting of permits to Royal Dutch Shell to drill for oil in the Arctic Ocean, with the final permit coming just last week.

 

But Deese brushed off that criticism Monday, saying Shell was operating under a lease granted under the George W. Bush administration, and the Obama administration had delayed and narrowed the permit, allowing a single well with "unprecedented, high levels of safety standards for Shell or any other company to meet."

 

Moniz said the Obama administration was also trying to lessen U.S. dependence on foreign oil, which the nation imports at the rate of 7 million barrels a day.

 

Climate change is also likely to be a major topic when Pope Francis visits the White House in September.

 

"I'm going because Alaskans are on the front lines of one of the greatest challenges we face this century: Climate change. It's our wake-up call. The alarm bells are ringing, and as long as I'm president, America will lead the world to meet this threat before it's too late."

Arizona uranium mining can battle climate change 

Publication info: Arizona Republic ; Phoenix, Ariz. [Phoenix, Ariz]31 Aug 2015: A.12.

ProQuest document link 



 





ABSTRACT

  

America's nuclear power plants are clean and release no carbon emissions, making these deposits in northern Arizona an almost perfect solution for our electricity-hungry nation.

 



LINKS

FULL TEXT

 

We are writing, as elected officials whose counties represent areas directly impacted by uranium mining, in response to former Grand Canyon National Park Superintendent Steve Martin ( "Plug loopholes and protect Grand Canyon from mining," Aug. 17 My Turn).

 

The underlying theme of Martin's column is that uranium mining is bad and has no redeeming value to the public and the nation.

 

To the contrary, it has been our experience that the uranium mining industry in the last 25 years has gone out of its way to protect the environment in which it operates. Reclamation work by uranium producers on former mine sites, unlike the fiasco in Colorado caused by the EPA within the past few weeks, has been conducted with great professional care, leaving these sites in safe and sound condition.

 

Northern Arizona's unique breccia pipe geological formations represent the nation's largest source of high-grade uranium ore. At a time when the current administration has concluded that climate change is real this uranium supply represents a curing balm for a sick world.

 

America's nuclear power plants are clean and release no carbon emissions, making these deposits in northern Arizona an almost perfect solution for our electricity-hungry nation.

 

Environmental groups cannot have it both ways. Either global warming is real and we need clean nuclear power fueled by uranium, or these groups are denying us access to a homegrown solution to the largest environmental problem of our time.

 

Rather than closing off this northern Arizona treasure, wouldn't using it make more sense?

 

The reality is that America's nuclear power industry imports over 92 percent of the uranium it uses from foreign sources. Given the availability of this northern Arizona uranium, that level of imports defies reason.

 

We do not have the luxury, as the Park Service does, to write off safe, reliable resources of fuel that pose no threat to the Grand Canyon. We say this as the elected officials who are responsible for the health and well-being of our citizens who live closest to these uranium deposits.

Antarctica gaining ice despite climate change, study says 

Publication info: Arizona Republic ; Phoenix, Ariz. [Phoenix, Ariz]05 Nov 2015: B.1.

ProQuest document link 



 





ABSTRACT

  

[...]another study out Monday said the eventual collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet would lead to as much as a nine-foot sea level rise worldwide.

 



LINKS

FULL TEXT

 

Considering it's a barren, unimaginably cold wasteland at the bottom of the world -- where penguins far outnumber people -- Antarctica is sure making a lot of news these days.

 

A recent study in the Journal of Glaciology reported that despite the effects of man-made global warming, the frozen continent is gaining ice.

 

The study, led by Jay Zwally, a NASA glaciologist, says that an increase in Antarctic snow accumulation that began 10,000 years ago is adding enough ice to the continent to outweigh the increased losses from its thinning glaciers.

 

Meanwhile, another study out Monday said the eventual collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet would lead to as much as a nine-foot sea level rise worldwide.

 

"In our simulations, 60 years of melting at the presently observed rate are enough to launch a process which is then unstoppable and goes on for thousands of years," said Johannes Feldmann of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. Feldmann is lead author of the second study, which appeared in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

 

Can both studies be true?

 

Yes, said Ted Scambos, a scientist with the National Snow and Ice Data Center.

 

Scambos said that the first study is more of a short-term look at what's happening today and over the next couple decades in Antarctica. The other is looking long-term at what will happen over centuries or even millennia if the planet continues to warm.

Website to focus on Arctic climate change

ProQuest document link 



 





ABSTRACT

  

In March 2014, she told me that her second site would be Arctic Deeply, focusing on the melting polar ice caps and set to debut that summer. Providing that original content will be Managing Editor Hannah Hoag, who has written about climate change for a variety of publications for more than a decade.

I guess Lara Setrakian was serious.

 

Setrakian is the poet laureate of the deeply immersive, single-topic website perhaps best illustrated by her acclaimed Syria Deeply, which she launched three years ago. In March 2014, she told me that her second site would be Arctic Deeply, focusing on the melting polar ice caps and set to debut that summer.

 

Then the Ebola crisis erupted, followed by the California drought, and they became the topics for Deeplies No. 2 and No. 3.

 

Now, at last, Arctic Deeply will debut Dec. 8, and Setrakian says she is "extremely excited." The venture is a partnership with the Centre for International Governance Innovation, a Canadian think-tank.

 

"The Arctic has been a huge priority for us for quite a while," says Setrakian, a former correspondent for ABC News and Bloomberg TV.

 

The timing seems right: The United States chairs the Arctic Council, and the temperature in the Arctic is rising at twice the rate as in the rest of the world.

 

The Deeplies are designed to address an all-too-familiar phenomenon in the news business. When a story explodes, there is saturation coverage. Then something else explodes, and the parade moves on, and the aftermath of Explosion No. 1 is too often ignored. That's what inspired Setrakian, a former Middle East correspondent, to create Syria Deeply, which was widely applauded from the start.

 

On its first day, Fast Company proclaimed, "SYRIA DEEPLY OUTSMARTS THE NEWS, REDEFINES CONFLICT COVERAGE."

 

Setrakian says there are many other subjects that have a "Syria problem."

 

Setrakian looks for topics that are "generally underreported and extremely consequential for our time."

 

Setrakian says the episodic approach "is how our industry is built. You can't cover everything at the same time." That said, "there are people who want to know what happens on Day Four. We're here to fill in the gaps."

 

Arctic Deeply will follow the model of its three predecessors. It will offer a mix of original content, links to top-flight coverage from other news outlets, news summaries, maps, op-eds, backgrounders, timelines, data visualization, you name it. All on the Arctic.

 

Providing that original content will be Managing Editor Hannah Hoag, who has written about climate change for a variety of publications for more than a decade. Setrakian describes Hoag's role as "hyperactive beat reporter."

 

For Hoag, the mission is personal.

 

She has visited the Arctic, and she has witnessed the impact of climate change on the population, the rising sea levels and "villages falling into the ocean."

 

"I've seen the changes firsthand," Hoag says.

 

Though she will be based in Toronto, Hoag plans to make frequent trips to the Arctic.

 

Hoag says she was attracted to Arctic Deeply because "it checked a lot of boxes for me."

 

She sees the new gig as an opportunity to take her climate change reporting to a, yes, deeper level.

 

"I want to talk to the people affected by climate change," Hoag says. "It's a chance to focus on a niche issue that's really important now and in the future."

 

Setrakian says that, three years in, she's more convinced than ever that her approach works. "We have fantastic engagement metrics," she says. "There has been a lot of validation of the single-topic model."

 

Though News Deeply has gotten some grants, it supports itself in part by building platforms for other companies.

 

It has eight full-time employees devoted to all of the sites, including copy editors and digital staffers, and eight for specific projects.

 

Though traffic spikes at times of crisis, Setrakian says, the sites maintain a devoted cadre of regular visitors. "For the diehards, there is a home," she says.

 

Should we look for more Deeplies in the future?

 

Setrakian says, "Refugees Deeply is definitely on the agenda."

Climate change problem needs a Churchill 

Publication info: Arizona Republic ; Phoenix, Ariz. [Phoenix, Ariz]15 Dec 2015: A.10.

ProQuest document link 



 





ABSTRACT

  

(Other polls show far lower levels of concern among Republicans, it must be noted.) The survey was ordered by Jay Faison, a wealthy Republican from North Carolina determined to sell his party on the need for confronting climate change. [...]it will give a boost to the good developments -- improvements in green energy technology, conservation and the very exciting field of "negative emissions" technology (taking planet-warming gases out of the air).

FULL TEXT

 

"This is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning." Those were Winston Churchill's words of battle-weary comfort when World War II started decisively shifting in the Allies' favor.

 

They could also be applied to the climate accord just reached in Paris -- 196 countries all agreeing to cut or limit greenhouse gas emissions. The long slog to slow global warming and avoid its worst environmental, economic and security consequences is hard and often thankless political work.

 

Republicans running for president are obviously not keen on picking up that shovel. They treat the issue as not a problem, a problem for others to solve or unsolvable. Ted Cruz: "Climate change is not science. It's religion." Donald Trump: "I don't believe in climate change." Ben Carson at least concedes its existence but says that there is "no overwhelming science" that humans are involved.

 

It may be true that the electorate is focused on the more immediate and dramatic threat of terrorism, and not just Republicans. Global warming can seem boring by comparison.

 

But terrorism was pretty much ignored until Sept. 11, 2001. Then disaster struck domestically, and the public erupted. Trying to prevent the awful things from happening in the future is what mature leaders do. Sadly, their efforts go largely unappreciated by a public too busy or detached to take notice.

 

It would be unfair to paint all Republicans as limp on climate change. A survey released in September found that 54 percent of self-described Republican conservatives believe that climate change is happening and that humans play a part in it. Only 9 percent don't think the planet is warming. (Other polls show far lower levels of concern among Republicans, it must be noted.)

 

The survey was ordered by Jay Faison, a wealthy Republican from North Carolina determined to sell his party on the need for confronting climate change.

 

One thing the agreement can do is make the bad things happen more slowly and perhaps buy time. And it will give a boost to the good developments -- improvements in green energy technology, conservation and the very exciting field of "negative emissions" technology (taking planet-warming gases out of the air).

 

Here's where American ingenuity can save the world and make big money at the same time. That's a conservative talking point, free for the taking.

 

Think Churchill: The agreement is not the end of the problem, But it gives hope that something resembling victory is possible.

Don't ignore link of allergy season and climate change 

Publication info: Arizona Republic ; Phoenix, Ariz. [Phoenix, Ariz]16 Mar 2016: A.27.

ProQuest document link 



 





ABSTRACT

  

Assertion of vouchers hurting Hispanic students inaccurate Linda Valdez (March 11) asserted that Arizona's school choice options have been undermining the education of Hispanic students attending district schools. The National Assessment of Educational Progress shows that Arizona Hispanic students have made large academic gains. Since all states began participating in NAEP in 2003, Arizona Hispanic students tied for first for the highest Hispanic on eighth-grade math, third among states in eighth-grade reading gains.

Thanks for Weldon Johnson's "Rough Allergy Season in Valley" (March 12).

 

Allergies have been the big topic in my neighborhood, at work and in my house, where the only member of our family who is not sniffling, sneezing and rubbing their eyes is our dog.

 

I missed two days of work recently because my symptoms were so severe. Like many neighbors, I now have to use allergy medications.

 

What is disappointing is that we are failing to make the connection to climate change. December, January and February were all record-breaking warm months. Warming means pollen-producing plants don't die off in the winter, have longer growing seasons, and higher carbon dioxide levels also mean each plant produces more pollen.

 

With our air pollution, which is also worsened by higher temperatures, it becomes a miserable one-two punch. For those with respiratory conditions like asthma or COPD, or breathing for two during pregnancy, or the more vulnerable lungs of our children.

 

It becomes a dangerous and expensive problem. It's time to stop ignoring the many ways that climate change is costing us. Time to find solutions such as a carbon fee and dividend that protect our economy without costing our health.

 

--Ronda Seifert, RN, Phoenix

 

Can we get over this Daylight Saving Time thing every year?

 

There are two ways to look at it. Every year, Arizona goes on Pacific Daylight Saving Time in March and returns to Mountain Standard Time in November. Or, Arizona uses Pacific Daylight Saving Time year around.

 

All you have to do is to put a little sign on your clocks that says, PDT. I did reside in Phoenix during the one year that we changed our clocks to Mountain Daylight Saving Time.

 

After that one year of that silly experimentation, the state government made one of the more brilliant decisions ever. The official opt out of the annual clock altering madness for Arizona is brilliant.

Assertion of vouchers hurting Hispanic students inaccurate

 

Linda Valdez (March 11) asserted that Arizona's school choice options have been undermining the education of Hispanic students attending district schools.

 

This assertion cannot, however, withstand scrutiny. The National Assessment of Educational Progress shows that Arizona Hispanic students have made large academic gains.

 

Since all states began participating in NAEP in 2003, Arizona Hispanic students tied for first for the highest Hispanic on eighth-grade math, third among states in eighth-grade reading gains. Arizona Hispanic students tied for 6th in fourth-grade math and reading gains.

 

Arizona charter schools have more than done their part with a majority-minority student population and gains above and beyond the statewide average. Arizona Hispanic students attending charter schools, for instance, tied the statewide average for Delaware on eighth-grade math in 2015 on NAEP.

 

We have ample reason to desire a faster rate of progress, and I agree with Valdez that Arizona's future rests heavily upon the success of Hispanic students. District schools, however, remain the most generously funded of Arizona's school options by a wide margin and outcomes for Hispanic students have been trending in a positive direction.

The many reasons why a mother would abandon her newborn

 

I was disappointed in Laurie Roberts' commentary Saturday ("What sort of mom abandons a baby?").

 

Ms. Roberts appears to assume that everyone in Arizona knows, or should know, about Arizona's Safe Haven law. What sort of mom abandons a baby?

 

Could it be that the mom is: uneducated, isolated, abused, uninformed, frightened, manipulated, underage, intimidated, poor and lacking in emotional and/or financial support?

 

How can Ms. Roberts assume that the mother knew about the safe haven law? How can Ms. Roberts assume that the mother acted alone or even of her own choice?

 

I agree with Ms. Roberts that more than one child was hurting that day.

 

--Gerri Hether, CITY

 

On whose watch did ISIL, N. Korea threats take center stage?

 

ISIL uses chemicals to kill and harm Iraqi town of Taza, 100,000 immigrates to invade Greece this month, 470,000 killed in Syria in last 4 years, North Korea threatens S.Korea and Japan with nuclear threats.

 

What Secretary of State's foreign policy set up this disaster?

 

--Bob Breen, Scottsdale

 

Parallels between forces against Goldwater, Trump campaigns

 

I see a situation has developed that is very similar to the presidential election of 1964 when those opposed to Barry Goldwater used every dirty trick to undermine his positions.

 

He was called racist, extremist, war monger and every other horrible thing that his enemies could think of. Interestingly, one of the chief detractors was George Romney - the apple didn't fall far from the tree.

 

It is also noteworthy that the loudest "no vote for Trump" voices were a few months ago demanding Trump's pledge to support the nominee of the party. Of course the party elites know better than the voters, so we will probably continue to send spineless Republicans to Washington that won't keep their promises. God help us.

 

--Joe Gossen, Tempe

 

We could be insuring more poor children in this state except ...

 

What is the matter? How difficult is it to agree to take care of our children?

 

You don't care about their health? You don't care about their future? Put people first. When you or any member of your family is ill, they receive the best health care money can buy. And then some.

 

The federal Children's Health Insurance Program, called KidsCare in Arizona, once enrolled nearly 50,000 children in our state. It was financed by a 3-to-1 federal match of state dollars. Today, KidsCare serves about 775 children.

 

Attrition will bring that number to zero unless the Legislature acts. There's no reason not to act.

 

Except you are a Republican. Anti-women, anti-gay, anti-immigrant, anti-poor, anti-education, anti-young, anti-old, anti-arts, anti-people with disabilities, anti-equal pay, anti-minimum wage, anti-environment, anti-voting rights ...

 

--Peter Bisschop, Tucson

 

A brighter future for Arizona lies in a changed political landscape

 

Born in Snowflake, 5-1-36. Consider myself an old Arizona mountain boy. Love the state and visit when I can.

 

What concerns me is the Far Right wing movement that seems to be controlling the political agenda. The utterances from such as Sylvia Allen seems to demean the great people I know and have known in your great state.

 

The Arizona voters need to make better decisions on the mental/intellectual attributes of the candidates ... also true of the nation, as we are seeing. Hope the future holds better results.

 

--Bob Scarber, Seattle

Climate change hurts Vietnamese farmers 

Maresca, Thomas . Arizona Republic ; Phoenix, Ariz. [Phoenix, Ariz]24 Apr 2016: B.4.

ProQuest document link 



 





ABSTRACT

  

"The biggest impact is the trapping of silt," said Richard Cronin, director of the Southeast Asia program at the Stimson Center, a think tank in Washington, D.C. He said the silt is needed to replenish nutrients that wash away during monsoon season in the delta and southern Cambodia, as well as to sustain the delta against rising sea levels.

can tho, vietnam -- Huynh Van Loi, 50, a farmer who spent most his life in the same small Mekong Delta district, has experienced good weather and bad, droughts and floods. But this year brought something he'd never seen.

 

"The water is salty," he said. "I've been living here since my childhood but this is the first time we've had salty water. All my crops were destroyed."

 

The worst drought in 90 years, rising sea levels and rampant development are causing a crisis in the Mekong Delta, known as Vietnam's rice bowl. The delta is home to 20 million people and accounts for more than half of Vietnam's rice and fruit production, 90% of its rice exports and 60% of fishery exports.

 

But this year, paddy rice fields resemble parched desertscapes as farmers wait for a rainy season that is late to arrive. Small farmers such as Loi, who grows watermelons and orange trees about 40 miles from the South China Sea, have seen crop-ruining salinity intrude farther inland than ever before.

 

The drought, caused by El Nino weather patterns, is hitting the entire region from Thailand to Cambodia to Vietnam's central highlands. The impact is most acute here in the Mekong Delta, where the Mekong River ends its 2,700-mile journey from the Tibetan plateau through six Asian countries.

 

A United Nations report released in March about the drought estimated that 393,000 acres of rice in Vietnam was already lost, with an additional 1.2 million acres likely to be damaged. Almost 1 million people lack water for daily consumption.

 

The figures are alarming but could grow worse if weather extremes become more common in years to come.

 

"This year is not a special case," said Duong Van Ni, an environmental management professor at Can Tho University. "It will happen more in the future."

 

Ni said the rapid agricultural development that turned postwar Vietnam from a famine-stricken country into one of the world's leading rice exporters has exacerbated the effects of climate change.

 

"A long time ago, there were also typhoons, also saltwater intrusion, also drought," Ni said. "But the impact was not as severe as now, because at that time the ecosystem wasn't changed by humans. Now the system is already damaged: by canals, by dikes, by water management, by land use."

 

Then there are the dams. China has built seven hydropower dams on the upper Mekong, known locally as the Lancang, and plans to add 21 more. Laos and Cambodia intend to build 11 hydropower dams on the lower Mekong, with two in Laos already under construction.

 

China's existing dams already hurt the Mekong, affecting water levels, water temperature and fish migration patterns. They also trap as much as 80% of the sediment that reaches them. The sediment is needed to fertilize downstream floodplains and protect against coastal erosion.

 

"The biggest impact is the trapping of silt," said Richard Cronin, director of the Southeast Asia program at the Stimson Center, a think tank in Washington, D.C. He said the silt is needed to replenish nutrients that wash away during monsoon season in the delta and southern Cambodia, as well as to sustain the delta against rising sea levels.

 

Without the sediment, the low-lying delta is eroding and actually sinking. Vietnam's Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment estimated that a 1-meter rise in the sea level would submerge nearly 40% of the Mekong Delta and more than 20% of Ho Chi Minh City, a metropolis of 10 million people.

 

Vietnam is introducing salt-resistant rice and increasing autumn and winter rice crop quotas to make up for this year's shortfall. The Ministry of Agriculture and Development is seeking $4.5billion from the government to build an irrigation system, and work is underway on a decades-long plan to construct sea walls and dikes along the coast.

 

"I find it difficult to be optimistic," said Dan Spencer, associate professor of environmental studies at the University of Montana. "Like many poor nations, Vietnam generates very little of the climate change problem but suffers from the brunt of many of the effects."

 

Ni called the problem alarming. "I wonder if the situation of the Mekong basin, especially the Mekong River, should be upgraded as a global issue, as soon as possible," he said. "It's not isolated to six countries in Asia."

 

On a recent day, farmer Nguyen Tran Ngoc was digging a canal to try to irrigate some new crops: watermelon, flowers, squash, pumpkin and cabbage. He stopped growing rice because of the lack of water. He doesn't know how much longer he can make a living from farming.

 

"Worry or don't worry, it's all the same," he said. "Change is coming and we can't control it."

Officials support renewable-energy bill 

Zentner, Emily . Arizona Republic ; Phoenix, Ariz. [Phoenix, Ariz]15 July 2016: A.12.

ABSTRACT

  

The bill would "level the playing field" between renewable and fossil fuel projects on federal lands by creating a streamlined leasing process for wind and solar energy projects like the one in place for oil, gas and geothermal energy.

FULL TEXT

 

WASHINGTON -- State and federal officials praised a bipartisan bill Wednesday that would encourage renewable-energy development on public land by streamlining the permitting process and letting local governments share in revenue from the projects.

 

The bill would "level the playing field" between renewable and fossil fuel projects on federal lands by creating a streamlined leasing process for wind and solar energy projects like the one in place for oil, gas and geothermal energy.

 

That is of special importance to Arizona, witnesses told the House Natural Resources Subcommittee hearing, because of the large amount of federal land in the state and its potential for renewable energy.

 

"We just need to remove some of the barriers and incentivize counties," said Ian Dowdy, director of the Sonoran Institute's Sun Corridor project. Those incentives -- giving counties 25 percent of the revenue from any project on federal lands within the county's borders -- are a large part of the attraction for Mohave County Supervisor Buster Johnson.

 

Johnson, who was also testifying on behalf of the National Association of Counties and several other groups, said he would "probably not" support the bill if it were not for the revenue-sharing program. The bill's revenue-sharing provisions would also apply to existing projects, which could give Mohave County $519,375 in payments, Johnson said, and about $4.6 million to the state as a whole.

 

Johnson said his county has "some of the highest solar and wind energy potential in the nation." But he and Dowdy said many rural residents have opposed such developments in the past over concerns that the county budget would have to cover roads, water, police and other costs associated with the projects.

 

The bill by Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., which already has 67 co-sponsors, including every member of Arizona's delegation, would give counties revenue to help cover these costs.

 

"The 25 percent share of revenue for local counties as described in this legislation should not only offset the burdens that development may bring, but it may also allow innovative rural counties to benefit from a new economic-development opportunity," he said.

 

Gosar's bill would also create a Renewable Energy Resource Conservation Fund, which would get 35 percent of revenue from any project. Money from the fund will go toward offsetting the environmental impact of these new solar and wind developments, something Gosar, who called himself a "passionate fisherman," said was very important to him.

 

Johnson said the legislation "strikes a careful balance" between encouraging renewable-energy development and offsetting its environmental and monetary costs.

 

There is no hope of action on the bill before Congress leaves for its two-month recess Friday, and only a few months left in this Congress after that. But Gosar said he is very hopeful the bill will succeed due to its bipartisan support.

A bird's-eye view of climate change

ABSTRACT

  

Thursday night, Gene Karpinski, head of the League of Conservation Voters, will speak to climate change at the Democratic National Convention.

FULL TEXT

 

On a remote, craggy cliff 18 miles off the coast of Maine, a parent waits. Weepy-eyed and web-footed, the pudgy, painted puffin braces against a capricious wind -- and fickle foothold.

 

At last count, hardscrabble Eastern Egg Rock was home to 150 breeding pairs of Atlantic puffins, each vying to incubate a one-per-season puffball in burrows carved beneath boulders. Having clawed back from the brink -- in 1901, only one puffin pair remained in Maine -- climate change is now poised to do its own number on these charismatic birds. As last month's scientific audit, "The State of North America's Birds" warns, 49% of the continent's seabirds are caught up in the crisis.

 

Thursday night, Gene Karpinski, head of the League of Conservation Voters, will speak to climate change at the Democratic National Convention. The issue has put politicians at odds, galvanized voters and saddled scientists with a burden of proof.

 

Birds are used to being in human's sights. Not too long ago, our American bald eagle was in danger of vanishing in a puff. Patriotic symbolism couldn't shield it from human activity: hunting, habitat squandering, pesticide use. It took the Endangered Species Act of 1973 to restore that bird to its perch of power.

 

Also in 1973, a young ornithologist -- a diminutive Don Quixote named Stephen Kress -- got into the recovery act.

 

"It was love at first sight," Kress, 70, says of first viewing puffins as a teen near the U.S.-Canadian border. He learned they once flourished in Maine, the southernmost limit of their range, but by 1885 the effects of agri-fishers raiding the henhouse, daily plucking eggs from rocky crevices and laying nets on ledges to snare meaty adults, had taken a grievous toll.

 

Not abiding by fate, Kress negotiated with the Canadians for six puffin chicks to try re-colonizing 7-acre Eastern Egg Rock. Backed by the National Audubon Society and Barbara's, maker of Puffins cereal, he worked through the decades-long "jigsaw puzzle" of Project Puffin. Their team hand-reared "pufflings" with vitamin-fortified fish in man-made burrows and stationed interns from May to August to keep predators, like eagles, at bay. Fledged puffins set out on two- to three-year sea cruises while scientists set up sound recordings, decoys and mirrors to lure them home.

 

And waited.

 

Eight years later, the first prodigal puffin pair returned to roost. Things were looking pretty peachy until waters in the Gulf of Maine began rising faster than 99% of the Earth's oceans, Kress says, throwing delicate fish populations out of whack.

 

Audubon's annual Christmas bird count reveals nearly 350 North American birds are "climate-affected," moving farther north. "For those species that are already farther north, they've got nowhere to go," Kress says. "Their fate, their future, really is in our hands."

 

Last weekend, I saw it firsthand, setting foot on the puffins' hallowed breeding grounds, a towering babble of gulls, guillemots and terns situated 17 precarious feet above sea level.

 

An all-female summer squad yanked us ashore. Among their duties: Daily at 0600, one climbs atop the shack, ironically dubbed "The Hilton," for a bird census. They label active burrows, tag birds and monitor avian diets and growth. By luck, we spy an adult puffin whiz by at high speed, a bowtie of sushi dangling from its slack-jawed rainbow beak, only to disappear underground. Interns fish out the baby for inspection. Puffin chicks' weights are steadily declining, they sadly report.

 

The changes for these colorful birds come in dribs and drabs.

 

"Ocean conservation is a hard thing for people to understand because it's happening underwater, and you can't see most of it," Kress explains. "But seabirds are above ground, so we can see through their eyes."

 

Dimpled, tears-of-a-clown eyes. In ill-fitting waistcoats, they wait. For a meal. A mate. Another morning.

 

Ever facing forward, because, to quote Emily Dickinson, "hope is the thing with feathers."

ABSTRACT

  

The American Academy of Pediatrics, the World Health Organization and dozens of national and international medical societies recognize climate change as an urgent threat to our children.

Caring for children is a basic American value.

 

From high-tech strollers, to chemical-free clothes, sunscreen and cleaning products, to thousands of "mommy blogs" on making the best school lunches, we give it our all when it comes to our kids.

 

Children are vulnerable, and our urge is to protect them. We know that our children are our future. And that future is rapidly being shaped by climate change.

 

Our precious children are at the highest risk from many effects of climate change. Particularly dangerous in Arizona are heat waves: Young children are more likely to die in extreme heat than older kids or healthy adults.

 

Ozone increased by higher temperatures and smoke from more severe and frequent wildfires exacerbate asthma, the most common pediatric disease. Changes in temperature and air quality are increasing airborne allergens, damaging lung function and development. More asthma attacks means more time out of school, and more parents leaving work to care for their children.

 

Arizona is in the midst of a 20-year drought. Nowadays, the rain we so desperately need often comes quickly and violently, producing floods and overwhelming stormwater systems. Contaminated water leads to disease outbreaks, shown by a direct correlation between flooding and emergency-room visits for intestinal infections, most commonly in children.

 

Infections spread by insects, such as Lyme disease, plague, West Nile and others, are already increasing as the ticks, fleas and mosquitoes that carry them expand their range under warmer conditions. Northern Arizona has nearly three more weeks above freezing per year than it did a century ago, allowing insects to overwinter in places they once couldn't tolerate.

 

The mosquitoes that carry Zika live in states they didn't used to, opening the door for further spread of a virus linked to devastating birth defects and abnormal brain development. Children's mental well-being is also threatened by worsening extreme events, such as hurricanes, flooding and wildfires.

 

During these "natural" disasters, kids are more likely to suffer injury or death, and lose track of their caregivers and homes. They miss school and can take months or years to catch up. They suffer post-traumatic stress disorder, which impacts their emotional and intellectual development. These documented impacts of climate change on our children's health and well-being are expected to worsen if we don't take action. The American Academy of Pediatrics, the World Health Organization and dozens of national and international medical societies recognize climate change as an urgent threat to our children.

 

An understanding of these effects, as well as the ethical implications of bestowing an increasingly unpredictable world on the next generation, is crucial to any conversation about climate change and potential solutions.

 

On Sunday in Phoenix, there's an opportunity to learn more about the impact of climate change on children, and what you can do about it. Sonja Klinsky, an assistant professor with Arizona State University's School of Sustainability, and I will lead a symposium on this issue. Now is the time to act as if our children's lives depend on it. Because they do.

States, private sector don't need Trump on climate change

It would be nice if President-elect Donald Trump took one of the most serious threats to life on Earth seriously, but he does not. Trump called global warming a Chinese "hoax" on Twitter years ago, and he's assigned a science dunce to lead the transition at the Environmental Protection Agency.

 

The comforting news is that America can move past the black hole of ignorance in Trump's Washington -- or New York or wherever he is. Enlightened state and city governments, as well as the private sector, can provide the leadership. As it happens, they're already on the case.

 

Huge example: During the Paris climate-change conference last December, Bill Gates organized a handful of billionaires and came up with $15 billion for his Breakthrough Energy Coalition. The group's mission is to fund research on radical new clean-energy technologies.

 

"Ten guys in a room produced more money than the entire world community of nations in commitment of resources," Daniel Esty, professor of environmental law and policy at Yale Law School, told me.

 

"I'm not as sad or crushed as some people (that Trump was elected)," he added. "When the federal government collapses, state governments step up."

 

California's war on greenhouse gases is already 10 years old. Its original goal was to reduce the state's carbon footprint to the 1990 level by the year 2020. The new goal is to shrink the carbon footprint to 40 percent below the 1990 level by 2030.

 

After the election, Gov. Jerry Brown rejected the notion of defeat or backsliding. "We will protect the precious rights of our people and continue to confront the existential threat of our time -- devastating climate change," he announced.

 

Brown is not without economic firepower. California is the world's sixth-biggest economy.

 

Can Trump be educated on this issue -- or at least tamed by forces he can't control?

 

Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy, again running for the office, vows to slap a carbon tax on American imports if Trump pulls us out of the Paris climate deal. Could that happen?

 

Absolutely, according to Esty. Countries failing to meet international standards that form the baseline for fair competition can be punished. And 195 nations have joined the Paris agreement.

 

Last summer, Brown told climate-change deniers: "Bring it on. We'll have more battles, and we'll have more victories." Can Jerry Brown be our alt-president?

When you buy a home, ponder climate change

FULL TEXT

 

With blizzards rocking the Midwest, we are seeing the usual influx of folks looking for homes in our more hospitable climate. But what will climate change mean for prospective home-buyers?

 

Last year was the hottest on record and the warming trend is likely to be a reality for the foreseeable future, so it makes sense to shop for homes with an eye toward future climate considerations.

 

In the Valley, warmer temperatures are sure to mean higher energy consumption as we try to cool down and an increased demand for water at the same time supplies shrink from increased evaporation.

 

Will the Valley will be uninhabitable or unsustainable? No, not at all. But we'll need to adapt our lifestyles and the micro-environments within which we live to maintain our quality of life.

 

So what factors should home-buyers consider?

 

No oceanfront property in Arizona

 

If you're looking for a home in a warm-weather climate, the Valley is probably your best choice.

 

This may seem paradoxical, but not if you consider the alternatives such as coastal areas. These areas, whether on the East or the West Coast, are not preferred locations in an era of climate change as all indications are that they will almost certainly be subject to extensive and frequent flooding due to rising sea levels. Securing often costly flood insurance will be a consistent issue.

 

For a warm weather location in an era of climate change, you are actually better off selecting the hot, dry Valley of the Sun.

 

Keep the cool inside

 

Once you have narrowed your search to a home in the Valley, there are many features to consider. From a climate change perspective, the objective is to find a home that is as tight and as impervious to the climate as possible. Some homes just seem to be tighter or better sealed then others, thereby minimizing the loss of cool air in the summer and the loss of heat in the winter.

 

Where's the sun?

 

Exposure to the sun is also of significant importance.

 

For me, the southern exposure of my house and outdoor patio area is ideal as the sun is directly overhead during the summer and slanting into the interior of the house during the winter. If your favored house does not have southern exposure, look for well-established trees and other vegetation to block the sun's rays from the east and especially from the west.

 

Other heat-mitigating options

 

Beyond these basics, Linda Allison at Russ Lyon/Sotheby's realty suggests the following features to mitigate the effects of climate change:

 

Updated, efficient heating and cooling systems.

 

Additional attic insulation.

 

Energy-efficient windows and doors.

 

Roof solar panels, which generate energy and reduce the sun rays hitting the roof.

 

With just a little attention to some of these features, home-buyers can count on continuing to enjoy life here in the Valley for years to come.

Climate change is adding to drought's already wide-ranging role in declining water flows along the Colorado River 

McKinnon, Shaun . Arizona Republic ; Phoenix, Ariz. [Phoenix, Ariz]23 Feb 2017: A.6.

ProQuest document link 



 





ABSTRACT (ENGLISH) 

"The future of Colorado River is far less rosy than other recent assessments have portrayed," said Bradley Udall, the study's co-author and a senior water and climate scientist at Colorado State University's Colorado Water Institute.

FULL TEXT

Record-setting drought reduced flows on the Colorado River by nearly 20 percent for the first 15 years of this century, but scientists say drought is not the only reason the water has slowed.

Climate change made a bad situation worse, and points to a sobering future for one of the West's most critical natural resources.

Higher temperatures on the river -- which lead to more evaporation, more use by plants, more water gone -- accounted for the loss of at least a half-million acre-feet of water a year, the scientists said in a study released this week.

That's about the amount of water needed to support 2 million people.

It's the first time researchers have quantified the effect of heat on the river's flow, said Jonathan Overpeck, one of the study's authors and the director of the University of Arizona's Institute of the Environment.

The study's conclusion, Overpeck said: "Warming alone could cause Colorado River flow declines of 30 percent by midcentury and over 50 percent by the end of the century if greenhouse gas emissions continue unabated."

Forty million people in seven states and Mexico rely on the Colorado River for water and electricity. It is a significant source of water in Arizona, supplying almost half the demand of metropolitan Phoenix.

For the study, researchers examined conditions on the river from 2000 to 2014, a period marked by one of the worst droughts in modern history. The river's flow during those years declined by 19 percent, about 2.9 million acre-feet per year compared with the long-term average from 1906 to 1999.

At the same time, temperatures in the river's upper basin, where the largest amounts of snow runoff originate, averaged 1.6 degrees higher.

Researchers said the higher temperatures accounted for at least one-sixth of the water losses, or about half a million acre-feet per year. (An acre-foot is enough water to support about two households for one year.)

That was a conservative estimate. The heat's effects could have been much higher, accounting for as much as one-half of the losses, the researchers said.

"The future of Colorado River is far less rosy than other recent assessments have portrayed," said Bradley Udall, the study's co-author and a senior water and climate scientist at Colorado State University's Colorado Water Institute. " A clear message to water managers is that they need to plan for significantly lower river flows."

Udall and Overpeck looked at climate models for the river basin and found agreement that temperatures are likely to continue to climb if greenhouse-gas emissions remain at current levels. The models were less certain about snow and rain in the basin, Overpeck said.

"Even if the precipitation does increase, our work indicates that there are likely to be drought periods as long as several decades when precipitation will still fall below normal," he said.

Udall said current water planning underestimates the potential effects of climate change on future resources.

The study was published in the American Geophysical Union journal Water Resources Research.

Climate change is making us sick

FULL TEXT

From increases in deadly diseases to choking air pollution and onslaughts of violent weather, man-made climate change is making Americans sicker, according to a report released Wednesday by 11 of the nation's top medical societies.

The report was prepared by the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health, a new group that represents more than 400,000 doctors.

"Doctors in every part of our country see that climate change is making Americans sicker," said Mona Sarfaty, the director of the new consortium and a professor at George Mason University.

"Physicians are on the front lines and see the impacts in exam rooms," she said. "What's worse is that the harms are felt most by children, the elderly, Americans with low income or chronic illnesses, and people in communities of color."

The report pinpointed three types of harms from climate change:

Direct harms, such as injuries and deaths due to increasingly violent weather; asthma and other lung diseases exacerbated by extremely hot weather and wildfires; and longer allergy seasons.

Increased spread of disease through insects that carry infections like Lyme disease or Zika virus and through contaminated food and water.

The effects on mental health resulting from the damage climate change can do to society, such as increasing depression and anxiety.

Disputes remain after G-7 summit 

Jackson, David . Arizona Republic ; Phoenix, Ariz. [Phoenix, Ariz]28 May 2017: B.2.

ProQuest document link

"His basis for decision ultimately will be what's best for the United States."

Gary Cohn, director of Trump's

National Economic Council

taormina, italy -- Wrapping up his first foreign trip as commander in chief, President Trump left the G-7 summit Saturday amid ongoing international deadlocks on trade, climate change and the fate of a global treaty on restricting heat-trapping carbon emissions.

While the American president and G-7 allies agreed to increase efforts to fight terrorism, Trump, his aides and other world leaders acknowledged ongoing disputes about trade rules and whether the United States should remain part of the historic Paris climate change agreement.

Climate talks in particular were "very unsatisfactory," German Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters.

Trump, who received conflicting advice on climate change from aides, tweeted after the G-7 meetings that "I will make my final decision on the Paris Accord next week!"

The precise date is uncertain, and he has delayed previous plans to make that announcement.

Speaking later to U.S. military personnel before heading back to Washington, Trump said many countries have "a large number of disagreements" with the U.S., but he believes he hit "a home run" during his trip.

"We made a lot of good friends this week," Trump said.

His voyage began in the Middle East, continued to the Vatican for a meeting with Pope Francis, led to NATO headquarters in Brussels and wound up on the Sicilian coast for the Group of Seven industrial nations summit.

Trump took to Twitter to say that "lots of very important matters" were discussed at the G-7, but "first on the list, of course, is terrorism."

He also cited pledges by members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to "step up payments considerably, as they should," on their defense budgets.

While some analysts criticized Trump for not endorsing the alliance's mutual defense pledge, the president tweeted that "money is beginning to pour in - NATO will be much stronger."

In addition to protesting Trump's views on climate change, Germany and other G-7 members pushed back on Trump's claims that other countries engage in unfair trade practices against the United States.

The back-and-forth ended what European Union President Donald Tusk called "the most challenging G-7 summit in years."

Hanging over the president's entire trip: ongoing investigations back home of any links between Trump's campaign last year and Russians who sought to influence the presidential election by hacking Democrats.

Trump and his aides have denied collusion and described the investigations as "witch hunts."

While other leaders held traditional post-G-7 news conferences Saturday, Trump did not.

Instead, he spoke to U.S. military personnel at the nearby Naval Air Station Sigonella, from which Air Force One departed.

He was scheduled to return to the White House late Saturday.

Trump focused on terrorism, NATO

Recounting his trip, Trump stressed the need to win the fight against terrorism.

Citing this week's attacks in the United Kingdom and Egypt, Trump said the U.S. is resolved to defeat terrorism, which he called "a bad threat to all humanity."

In the Middle East, a more conciliatory Trump praised prospects for new peace talks and urged Muslim leaders to help defeat terrorism; during a more combative visit to Brussels, Trump demanded changes to the U.S. financial relationship with NATO. Both visits drew some criticisms.

During the president's sojourn through Saudi Arabia, Israel and the Palestinian Authority, analyst Aaron David Miller -- a Middle East negotiator in both Republican and Democratic administrations -- said his head "was spinning" over Trump's hopes for a peace deal.

"Never has a US President expressed so much confidence in a conflict-ending peace agreement w/so little prospect of success," tweeted Miller, vice president with the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.

In Brussels, Trump surprised NATO leaders by avoiding an explicit endorsement of "Article 5," the mutual defense provision of the NATO charter that requires members to regard an attack on one member as an attack on all.

"The president chose instead to alienate our European and Canadian allies by publicly berating them over their defense spending," said Kori Schake, a former National Security Council official and now a research fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. "He's just made it an awful lot easier for allies to refuse anything he ever needs from them."

Aides said Trump fully supports NATO, noting that he spoke at a memorial dedicated to the invocation of Article 5 after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001.

"It's clear that the president is committed to Article 5 and the alliance," National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster said. "That's why he was there for the leaders' meeting."

During his speech in Brussels, Trump also demanded that NATO members increase defense spending, arguing that the United States is carrying too much of the financial burden. He echoed those comments to the troops at Naval Air Station Sigonella, saying that "other nations must pay more" for common defense.

"We're behind NATO all the way," the president said, "but we want to be treated fairly."

Despite Trump's suggestions to the contrary, NATO countries do not owe money to the United States; alliance members have agreed to increase their own defense spending to 2% of gross domestic product and say they are making progress toward that goal.

Trip ends without final decision on Paris Accord

At the G-7, held at a hilly seaside village, the issues of terrorism, trade and climate change dominated meetings mostly closed to the press.

European officials have long sought to pressure Trump to stay in the Paris agreement. During their meeting at the Vatican, Pope Francis gave Trump a book he wrote on climate change.

In backing the pact reached in Paris in 2015, supporters say countries should be required to reduce carbon emissions as to way to mitigate the threats of global warming.

While some Trump aides want the U.S. to stay in the Paris framework, other officials say new regulations will hurt the American energy industry, thereby reducing economic growth.

The G-7 was unable to come to a consensus on the topic. The annual G-7 communique -- shorter than usual at only six pages -- said nearly all the members agree on climate change, with one exception: "The United States of America is in the process of reviewing its policies on climate change and on the Paris Agreement and thus is not in a position to join the consensus on these topics."

Gary Cohn, director of Trump's National Economic Council, said that Trump's views on climate change are "evolving" and that he came to the G-7 "to learn and get smarter" ahead of his decision on the Paris deal.

"His basis for decision ultimately will be what's best for the United States," he said.

With trade, Trump reportedly criticized the Germans as "very bad" on the process and made other complaints about the global trading system during G-7 meetings.

Other countries said they are following mutually agreed upon rules. Merkel pointed out that her country couldn't renegotiate rules with the United States if it wanted to, as Germany is a member of the European Union.

"We have a currency union," Merkel said. "We are practically a common market. To pick out one country is, I think, not so appropriate."

"His basis for decision ultimately will be what's best for the United States."

FULL TEXT

washington -- Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt refused to say whether President Trump still believes that climate change is a hoax, one day after the president promised to withdraw from the landmark Paris climate agreement.

Pruitt sidestepped reporters' questions about Trump's views on climate change three times during a White House news conference on Friday.

"The discussions we had, through the last several weeks, have been focused on one singular issue: Is Paris good or not for this country? That's the discussions I've had with the president. So that's been my focus."

In a highly anticipated announcement from the Rose Garden on Thursday, Trump pledged to pull out of the international agreement to reduce greenhouse gases because it would cost the U.S. millions of jobs -- sparking an outcry from European allies and even some high-profile American business leaders.

While Trump said he would be willing to renegotiate the agreement to be more "fair" to the U.S., he has been a longtime critic of climate change, including in a 2012 tweet when he called it a Chinese creation to make the U.S. less competitive.

According to a review by Vox.com, Trump has tweeted climate change skepticism at least 115 times, even accusing scientists of manipulating data.

White House press secretary Sean Spicer also said he did not know the answer to whether Trump believes in climate change. "I have not had an opportunity to have that discussion. Administrator Pruitt pointed out what the president is focused on is making sure we have clean water, clean air" and the best deal for U.S. businesses, Spicer added.

Spicer vowed to track down the answer "if possible."

During his Thursday announcement on the climate pact, Trump cited statistics from a Massachusetts Institute of Technology report in concluding that the agreement would only reduce emissions by a "tiny, tiny amount."

The report's author subsequently said that conclusion shows Trump misunderstood their findings. "If we don't do anything, we might shoot over 5 degrees or more, and that would be catastrophic," said John Reilly, co-director of the MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change.

Pruitt insisted there was additional scientific research backing up Trump's claim that the accord would have a minimal impact on reducing carbon emissions -- without providing examples. "They didn't have a corner on the market," he said of the MIT study. "There were many at the time," and "we can provide those to you," Pruitt said.

Later, Pruitt was asked his own personal opinions about whether global warming is real, and he acknowledged "global warming is occurring" and "human activity contributes to it."

"The president made a very courageous decision yesterday for America," Pruitt said. "We have nothing to be apologetic about as a country," he said, stating that the U.S. has reduced its "carbon footprint" to 1990 levels through innovation and technology.

Congress' shrinking role in climate change, war 

Publication info: Arizona Republic ; Phoenix, Ariz. [Phoenix, Ariz]04 June 2017: E.7.

ProQuest document link

FULL TEXT

The founders intended the conduct of foreign policy, or "the intercourse with foreign nations" as they put it, to be a joint venture between the president and Congress.

The intended role of Congress has atrophied, as illustrated by the uproar over Donald Trump "withdrawing" from the Paris Climate Accord and the resolution by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake and Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine authorizing the use of force against terrorist organizations.

Under the constitutional framework vouchsafed by the founders, Trump could not "withdraw" from the Paris Climate Accord because the United States had never actually joined it to begin with.

The Constitution gives the president wide authority to manage foreign policy without congressional interference. But the president doesn't have unilateral authority to bind the United States. That requires a treaty ratified by two-thirds of the members of the U.S. Senate.

President Barack Obama never submitted the Paris Climate Accord to the Senate for approval. As Bill Clinton failed to do for the accord's predecessor, the Kyoto Protocol.

Neither would have obtained the two-thirds approval required by the Constitution. The Wall Street Journal editorialists mischievously suggested that Trump actually submit the Paris Accord to the Senate for ratification, to watch Democrats from energy-producing states, many of whom are up for re-election, squirm.

After the 9/11 attacks, Congress authorized the use of force against al-Qaida, affiliates and anyone else implicated in them. Today, that authorization has been used to justify military action in 14 countries, and against terrorist organizations that didn't exist in 2001 and are themselves engaged in armed conflict with al-Qaida.

The Constitution gives Congress the responsibility to declare war. Flake and Kaine believe, correctly, that Congress is shirking this responsibility. So, they have crafted a new authorization of force against terrorist organizations.

These are fundamental elements of the separation of powers in our constitutional system of government. Presidents were to have a generally free hand in the management of foreign relations and the conduct of military hostilities. But Congress was to make the final decision about binding international commitments or engaging in military action.

These fundamentals shouldn't be ignored or washed away through semantic games, such as deeming the Paris Accord not a "treaty" or arguing that dropping bombs and killing combatants through drone attacks doesn't constitute a "war" against Islamic State.

Nor through legal pettifogging, such as claiming that the Paris Accord simply flows from a previously approved treaty or that, somehow, Islamic State is a derivative of al-Qaida.

Simply put, the founders didn't intend for a president to have the authority to commit to other countries to restructure the domestic energy sector without explicit approval of two-thirds of the U.S. Senate. Or to engage in combat without the explicit authorization of Congress. A constitution establishing such a presidency never would have been ratified.

Concern for the constitutional order should supersede specific issues.

I don't think the United States should ignore climate change. I continue to believe that a small carbon tax is the most appropriate step given what is known, and what remains unknown.

And, in reality, the United States will achieve most of the Obama commitment in the Paris Accord through the continued substitution of natural gas for coal through market mechanisms. The uproar is mostly over symbolism.

While I believe that Flake and Kaine are right about the appropriateness of a new authorization of force resolution, their approach doesn't really fit the protean nature of the terrorism that threatens us.

The Flake-Kaine resolution identifies specific groups to target and specific countries in which combat can take place.

It then provides a process by which the president can add groups and countries, subject to the disapproval of Congress. That's a geographic specific approach to a transnational threat.

The important point, however, is that the role of Congress in climate change and fighting terrorism shouldn't be ignored or sidestepped.

Sadly, the views of the two major political parties about the authority that should be vested in the president depends on whether they currently occupy it.

The founders had a longer view. They regarded the separation of powers they established for "intercourse with foreign nations" as indispensible to ordered liberty at home.

Al Gore's 'Inconvenient Sequel' brings climate change to the trump era 

Ryan, Patrick . Arizona Republic ; Phoenix, Ariz. [Phoenix, Ariz]25 July 2017: B.6.

ProQuest document link 



 





LINKS

FULL TEXT

On June 1, President Trump announced his decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord, an international agreement aimed at helping countries reduce the effects of climate change.

It was a devastating blow for former vice president Al Gore, a tireless environmental activist who drew heat for his Oscar-winning global-warming documentary An Inconvenient Truth in 2006. He's back with its follow-up, An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power (in theaters Friday in New York and Los Angeles, expands nationwide Aug. 4), which premiered at Sundance Film Festival in January to respectable reviews.

Despite having several conversations with the president, Gore has been unable to sway Trump, who has called global warming an "expensive hoax."

"I tried as hard as I could, and even though hope springs eternal, I don't think there's any realistic prospect of Donald Trump coming to his senses on climate," Gore says. "I would love to be proven wrong, but I'm not going to hold my breath. We'll just have to work around him."

Like Truth, Sequel is loosely framed around a presentation Gore gives to environmental activists-in-training, listing findings about climate-related weather events and touting alternatives to burning fossil fuels. But the documentary also moves into the real world, as filmmaking duo Bonni Cohen and Jon Shenk follow Gore across the globe as he meets with political leaders and typhoon survivors, and attends the United Nations' climate-change summit in Paris in 2015.

"For so long, it was very difficult for people in the environmental movement to personalize the issue and make it immediate for people's everyday lives," Shenk says. "As storytellers, we had an 'aha' moment of 'If we tell the stories of people who are actually suffering and dealing with the front-line issues of climate change, then it could be film drama.'"

It was jarring at first for the politician to be shadowed so closely.

"It does take a little adjusting to have them following your every move practically for two years," Gore says.

With the sequel, Gore wanted to show what's changed, both good and bad, in the decade since Truth. At the original film's release, he was criticized for using a simulation depicting the flooding of lower Manhattan to illustrate how cities could feel the effects of rising sea levels. That came to pass in 2012, when the World Trade Center memorial was underwater during Hurricane Sandy.

But Gore has reason to be optimistic. As shown in the film, Georgetown, Texas, is one of the first cities in America to be 100% powered by renewable energy, with others such as Atlanta and Pittsburgh pledging to follow suit.

"The will to survive is itself a renewable resource," Gore says. "With Mother Nature playing an increasingly prominent role in the discussions about the climate, more and more people are realizing if the president won't lead, the American people must."

Future depends on fast passage of renewable energy measure

FULL TEXT

It's almost unheard of in Washington: Renewable-energy legislation with support from both parties. Yet, on July 26, legislation passed through markup in the House Natural Resources Committee that will help create clean, renewable energy and local jobs in the West.

 

The Public Land Renewable Development Act has been bouncing around Congress for several years, and it may finally have the momentum it needs to pass. PLREDA will provide significant renewable energy development opportunities for Arizona and other states in the West that have an abundance of public lands.

 

For the past few years, stakeholders in Arizona and the West have been working to encourage siting of large-scale renewable-energy generation and transmission on public lands through regional and statewide planning processes like the Western Solar Plan and Arizona's Restoration Design Energy Project. Now it is time to provide a more comprehensive suite of incentives that allow communities throughout the West to benefit from renewable energy resources.

 

Passage of PLREDA will have a number of benefits for communities in Arizona and the West:

 

Revenue for local communities. The new revenue-distribution formula will provide economic value to states and counties from leasing and royalty revenue to reward the implementation of a thoughtful and robust renewable energy industry on public lands.

 

New conservation and recreation opportunities. PLREDA will establish a conservation fund, fed by revenues from renewable energy projects on public lands, which will protect natural resources and create valuable outdoor recreation opportunities.

 

Priority areas for development. By selecting areas that are best suited to renewable energy projects, similar to the successful Western Solar Plan, PLREDA will allow permitting and planning to be expedited, and environmental impacts to be minimized.

 

Accountability. The requirement for periodic review of energy policy will track success and address challenges to the implementation of a renewable energy industry.

 

In an era that has been characterized by significant division over the value and benefit of publicly owned lands in the West, this bipartisan legislation is like an ice-cold glass of water on a 115-degree August Arizona afternoon. The House version of the bill, HR 825, enjoys 38 cosponsors, 15 of whom are Republicans, while the Senate version, S 1407, has seven co-sponsors, four of whom are Democrats. Arizonans should be proud that Reps. Andy Biggs, Trent Franks, Raúl Grijalva, David Schweikert, and Kyrsten Sinema have joined Rep. Paul Gosar in moving this legislation forward.

 

The bill has seen tremendous support across the West from a wide variety of stakeholders, including sportsmen and conservation groups, and could usher in a new sustainable economy of well-planned and locally supported energy development.

 

The future of Arizona and the West relies on a thoughtful and robust renewable-energy industry in order to take advantage of nearby resources, respond to threatening drought conditions and promote sustainable economic opportunities.

 

The bipartisan Public Land Renewable Energy Development Act is an essential step in moving our nation in the right direction. Please join us in urging its expeditious passage.
