0,"With Arizona's annual electricity demands projected to double to 32,000 megawatts by 2030, the state must have more renewable-energy resources such as solar and wind power, said Kris Mayes, former chairwoman of the Arizona Corporation Commission.\""It used to be that nobody at utilities wanted to work in the renewable-energy department, but now, everybody wants to work there,"" said Mayes, speaking earlier this month at the Curbing Carbon Forum, sponsored by the Southwest Renewable Energy Institute and held at the Hyatt Regency hotel in downtown Phoenix.\""We're going to be doing more solar rooftops in the state of Arizona than any other state except California,"" Mayes said.\If Arizona had to support its growth in the same old-fashioned way, Mayes said, it would have to build eight new Hoover Dams, 28 new combined-cycle natural-gas plants, or four new Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Stations.\The Curbing Carbon Forum focused on issues from coal plants nearing the end of their design life to a discussion of what a future would look like with renewable- energy resources.\Like Mayes, Kurt Yeager, vice chairman of Galvin Electricity Institute, said America cannot build ""a 21st- century economy with a 20th-century electricity system.""\Because of the unreliability, inefficiency and productivity penalties of our current system, billions of dollars of value is being lost in the U.S. economy, he said.\Arizona Public Service and Salt River Project both are working toward more renewable-energy sources for the state.\""We project we're going to add approximately 750,000 new homes and businesses to our grid by 2030 (about a 65percent increase),"" said Jenna Shaver, an APS spokeswoman. ""And we plan to meet the demand that customer growth is going to have for electricity through renewable energy and our energy-efficiency program.""\Shaver said that:\In less than a decade, APS' renewable portfolio has grown from less than 1 megawatt to more than 900megawatts in operation or in development.\More than 17,500 customers have participated in the APS Renewable Energy Incentive Program, helping them offset the costs of installing renewable resources to their homes or businesses.\Solar development can power Arizona's economy, attracting new companies, projects and quality jobs. For example, she said, APS' AZ Sun Program is creating more than 3,000 construction jobs over the next five years and will bring 200 megawatts of solar power to APS customers.\For its part, SRP in May had a public process in which it solicited input from stakeholders and customers about what level of investment they would like to see from SRP.\What came out of the process is that it's really important for customers, stakeholders and SRP's board to move even further than they already have in sustainable investments, said Barry Petrey, manager of Resource Acquisition and Analysis Group.\""As a result, SRP has increased its sustainable portfolio from a target of 15 percent to a more aggressive target,"" Petrey said. ""Twenty percent of the energy that we produce for our retail customers will need to come from sustainable resources by 2020. We're doing more, and we're doing more sooner.""\Additionally, Petrey talked about SRP's approach.\""Our board understands the importance of doing this in a cost-effective manner for our customers and has afforded us a tremendous amount of flexibility,"" he said. ""So, we are able to pursue the most cost-effective mix and balance for our customers and be able to hit that target in a way that can still leave our pricing as reasonable as possible.""\Dave Olsen, managing director of the Western Grid Group, said at the conference that the move to a clean-energy economy is the best way to create jobs and spur revitalization. His group seeks to accelerate the incorporation of a broad range of low-carbon technologies into the electric system in the western U.S. As an example, he cited the U.S. Army, which has set goals to reduce energy consumption, increase efficiency and reduce adverse impacts on the environment.\""Energy now really matters to the people in Arizona,"" Mayes told conference attendees. She noted that Deer Valley High School students demanded that their school building be solarized. In addition, the Gila Bend community is becoming the solar-energy capital not only in the country but also potentially the world because of its innovative policy on solar-power project permits.\""You can walk into a restaurant or any gas station in Gila Bend and talk to a waitress or a gas-station employee, and they'll speak with you intelligently about solar energy,"" Mayes said. ""Why? Because they've come to believe that solar energy can help make their lives better economically and that renewable energy is Arizona's economic destiny.""\This will not come from a ""magical"" vote by Congress or a single Environmental Protection Agency decision; it will be the people who will drive the transition away from coal, Mayes said.\Here's what Mayes said Arizona needs to be doing now:\Audit its coal fleet to see which plants are least efficient and most polluting. These would make the most sense to ramp down\Formulate a plan that involves stakeholder input.\Treat renewables as a mainstream resource.\Put its focus on renewables.\But Mayes recognized that politics might hinder this transition.\She said there is ""a political problem in this country and in the West"" in advancing the diversification of energy portfolios. The federal government must do a better job, she said, because this is the top threat to advancing renewable energy throughout the West.\To discuss the efficient integration of renewable resources, the Western Conference of Public Service Commissioners will hold a joint meeting in Sunriver, Ore., in the spring."
1,"A committee in the Arizona Senate approved a measure that would freeze the state's renewable-energy standard at 15percent by 2025.\The Republican-sponsored bill passed on a 4-2 party-line vote with one member of the Government Reform Committee not voting.\House Bill 2789 originally had sought to get the state Legislature and governor more involved in regulations regarding alternative energy, rules that currently are made by the Arizona Corporation Commission.\But a striker amendment simplified the bill to state that no public utility can be held to a higher renewable-energy standard than those already in place.\The Corporation Commission, five elected statewide officials who oversee utility rates, voted in 2006 to require utilities such as Arizona Public Service Co. to get 15percent of their power from renewable sources such as solar and wind by 2025.\|\24,000 at US Airways to share $12 mil in profits\Eligible US Airways employees received profit-sharing checks totaling $12million Wednesday.\About 24,000 of US Airways' 32,000 employees received the payments, based on the company's $111million profit for 2011.\The $12million pool is less than the $47million shared by employees last year before rising fuel costs began cutting into the company's profit.\Chairman and CEO Doug Parker said in a statement that committed employees helped make US Airways profitable in 2011 despite higher fuel costs and that the company is pleased to share its financial success with them.\usairways.com\|\Company's co-founder due honor at Pentagon\Joyce Stewart, co-founder of AGM Container Controls Inc. in Tucson, is being honored for providing service and leadership in military packaging and handling for 50 years.\She is the first woman to receive the NIPHLE Special Award from the National Institute of Packaging, Handling and Logistics Engineers. The award will be presented at the Pentagon during a March 27-29 conference.\Stewart and her husband, Roger Stewart, founded the company in 1970 and initially manufactured environmental- control hardware for containers holding missiles and other sensitive equipment.

2,"The Surprise Tea Party Patriots, which won national exposure this month by continuing to question President Barack Obama's birth certificate, will host a speech by British global-warming skeptic Lord Christopher Monckton on Monday.\The talk will be at Sun City West Foundation Plaza, 14465 W. R.H. Johnson Blvd., and donations will go to Sheriff Joe Arpaio's cold-case posse.\Monckton and conservative author Tom Ballantyne also will speak to the Red Mountain Tea Party. That talk will be Tuesday at East Valley High School, 7420 E. Main St., in Mesa.\Arpaio has cited petitions from the Surprise group as the impetus to send his cold-case posse to Hawaii to investigate Obama's birth certificate.\Monckton, the third viscount of Brenchley, also has waded into the controversy. While denying that he is a ""birther,"" Monckton told syndicated radio host Dennis Miller in March that he believes the birth certificate posted by the White House is a forgery that can be taken apart with software.\The controversial speaker has had a varied career in journalism, politics and business. His biography states that he served as a science-policy adviser to former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.\He has given speeches around the world based on his theory that the increasing concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere essentially is harmless and that scientists and politicians have manipulated data to exaggerate the problem.\Mainstream scientists around the world disagree.\Surprise Tea Party founder Jim Wise said Monckton was invited because the group seeks out alternate views.\""Our main thrust is education, and he has a perspective on climate change,"" Wise said.\Ballantyne, who wrote ""Oh Really, O'Reilly! The Spin Starts Here ... Apparently!"" will precede Monckton.\Ballantyne said his talk will focus on ""the identity fraud being committed by the president of the United States.""\Ballantyne said he is adding a chapter to his book about the investigation by Arpaio's cold-case posse called ""One Mean Hombre -- America's Last Best Hope: Another Lawman from Arizona.""\|\'Tea Party' speeches\Surprise Tea Party Patriots speech: 6:30p.m. Monday.

3,"Green is such a good color on Arizona. On Sunday, public-interest organization Valley Forward Association announced the winners of its Environmental Excellence Awards. Bravo to the West Valley organizations that hit the mark and showed just what sustainability and renewable energy mean to the region.\To their credit, several West Valley cities have embraced renewable energy as a way of life and for economic development reasons.\Although they didn't make the list of Valley Forward's winners, other West Valley residents were acknowledged for their dedication to the environment. Goodyear, Buckeye and Sun City West were crowned ""Arizona Solar Community"" by Arizona SmartPower, a non-profit that promotes clean, renewable energy.\More than 1,150 Buckeye homeowners have installed solar photovoltaic panels on their homes. SmartPower challenged 14 Arizona communities to install such panels in 5percent of homes by 2015, but the three West Valley communities rose to the challenge faster than imagined.\State director of Arizona SmartPower Toni Bouchard said she never imagined communities would complete the goal so quickly but believes it is a sign of the future for Arizona.\""There's a growing understanding that the sun is a resource for Arizona,"" she said, adding that solar energy is especially embraced by retirees on fixed incomes for economic reasons.\Buckeye Public Works Director Scott Lowe said the town is trying to be as efficient as possible through solar power, LED bulbs in its traffic lights and streetlights and reuse of waste water to irrigate baseball fields. Goodyear's Mayor Georgia Lord has installed solar panels on her house and has been praising solar power for quite some time.\Residents in the three areas have embraced solar power, but they are not alone in their mission. Several West Valley towns and cities operate on a ""green"" schedule, with extended hours Mondays through Thursdays. That means the communities save a bit of energy on Fridays.\Avondale is such a city, and it is also making other strides to become more environmentally friendly. Avondale spokeswoman Ingrid Melle said the city has green initiatives such as the ""Clean Air Make More""' campaign for air-pollution prevention through promoting carpooling and bus services to residents and city employees.\Some cities and towns have community gardens and farmers markets as well. Surprise is opening a garden at Lizard Run Park on Oct. 26.\Renewable energy and sustainability are growing trends in the West Valley, and green is the new color of choice for many. Let's hope it doesn't go out of style."
4,"There comes a point in some arguments where politeness just isn't an option anymore. Filmmaker Craig Scott Rosebraugh is clearly past the point of pleasantries, right down to the title of his documentary, ""Greedy Lying Bastards,"" named for the businesspeople, politicians and shareholders who have a vested, monetary interest in preventing any progress in environmental policy.\Rosebraugh has a point -- there's plenty to be mad about. Much of the film plays out like a disaster-film montage: tornadoes tearing swaths through the Midwest, Hurricane Katrina laying waste to New Orleans, wildfires destroying hundreds of homes in Colorado, the severity and intensity of which are attributable to human-influenced increases in global temperatures.\Unlike Al Gore's 2006 climate-change documentary, ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" the film's not interested in arguing the reality of human-caused climate change, frontloading the film with grave expertise in the form of infographics and interviews to establish the scientific certainty of climate change. Instead, the film explores why nothing is being done to change humanity's destructive habits when we've suspected the consequences of our consumption for decades (particularly cute is a clip of a science film from the 1950s predicting the ecological disasters we currently face).\To find the answer, Rosebraugh follows the money trail. It leads from the bottom-feeding TV carnival barkers who make the rounds on cable news channels spouting lies, to such politicians as Sen. James Inhofe who line their pockets with campaign cash from the oil industry, all the way up to the villainous Koch brothers, billionaire bogeymen of the liberal left, with pot shots at Fox News and the ""tea party"" along the way.\In Rosebraugh's uncompromising hands, it plays out like a strident screed for those already burning with righteous indignation. It isn't interested in making friends and influencing people, but in firing up the base. It can be off-putting, even for those playing on the same team, and that's unfortunate, because the film is at its most convincing when Rosebraugh gets out of the way and dispenses with the snide commentary to let the tearful interviews with families who've lost their homes, or farmers who've lost their crops, make the case for making change.\There's even little catharsis in Rosebraugh's big ""gotcha"" moment. After a failed attempt to get ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson on the phone for an interview (""I guess he was busy with world domination that day"" he quips, self-satisfied), Rosebraugh decides to crash the company's annual shareholders' meeting, Michael Moore-style, to ask Tillerson point-blank about his stance on global warming in front of an audience and a few secret cameras.\And what does he get from Tillerson? Some well-rehearsed, polite platitudes about the seriousness of global warming and the importance of keeping an open dialogue.\Rosebraugh's conclusion? ""These companies care more about making money than they do about our lives and the health of the planet."" Contemptible? Yes. But it hardly qualifies as a game-changing bombshell. Who ever thought corporations cared about people?\Again, there's a lot to be angry about. And though Rosebraugh shines a light on plenty of jaw-dropping corruption, it plays out like a shrill rallying cry without catharsis for the already initiated.\|\'Greedy Lying Bastards'\***\Director: Craig Scott Rosebraugh.\Rating: PG-13 for brief strong language.\Note: At Harkins Valley Art.\Great ***** Good **** Fair *** Bad ** Bomb *\|\Reach the writer at barbara.vandenburgh@arizonarepublic.com."
5,"In honor of Earth Day next Monday, more than 100 religious leaders in Arizona affirm that ""climate change is one of the most pressing challenges facing our world today."" We urge other religious leaders in Arizona and members of mosques, churches, temples and synagogues across the state to join us.\The debate about climate change usually centers on economics and politics. We assert that climate disruption is, first and foremost, a spiritual and moral issue, rooted in our relationship with God and our neighbors.\Our materialism and energy consumption threaten life as we know it. All of our sacred scriptures -- Torah, Bible, Quran -- declare that the Earth is a sacred gift of God and that human beings are charged with protecting and preserving Earth's beauty and bounty.\Whether our fellow creatures have two legs or four, wings or paws, fur or feathers or skin, soft leaves or sharp spines, they are our neighbors. They sustain and enrich our lives. We are called to love and care for them.\Where some see irreconcilable division between faith and science, we recognize that scientists are sometimes God's contemporary prophets. Christians, Muslims, Jews and Buddhists across Arizona agree with the scientific consensus that ""global climate patterns are bringing more extreme weather events to Arizona, the United States and our world.""\These events include droughts, extreme temperatures, floods, storm surges and wildfires. Global climate disruption threatens our economy, national security, agriculture, our health and safety, and the well-being of our children and future generations. Those who are least able to adapt to climate change and who contribute least to the problem suffer the worst consequences.\We affirm: ""There are many actions that can be taken by individuals, families, congregations, businesses, local communities and the state to reduce the threat of worldwide climate disruptions, such as reducing energy use in our homes and vehicles and using renewable energy sources.""\But signers of the statement believe that individual actions, though necessary and important, are not enough. ""The global nature of the problem ... means that effective action requires leadership at the local, state and national levels to form policies and strategies that address responsible energy use to ensure that we protect creation and its most vulnerable populations from the significant threats posed by global climate change.""\We urge our state Legislature and the Arizona Corporation Commission to lead with courage and wisdom.\Support clean renewable-energy and energy-efficiency programs. Protect and help recover endangered species. Care for and restore our rivers and our streams. Stop pitting jobs against environmental stewardship. Our jobs and economy depend on a healthy environment.\This Earth Day, get outside. Take a walk. Drive less. Live more simply. Find a faith community or environmental organization protecting the Earth and get involved. Celebrate God's good Earth!\**\The Rev. Doug Bland is the co-executive director of Arizona Interfaith Power & Light, www.azipl.org."
6,"Twenty-four Phoenix-owned properties have solar panels, which moves the nation's sixth-largest city closer to its goal of harnessing more renewable energy.\City officials hope that at least 15percent of the city's energy use comes from ""green"" sources, including solar, by 2025.\The solar projects account for about 4percent of the city's energy use.\That is progress, said Vice Mayor Bill Gates, who leads the City Council's sustainability subcommittee.\""I think the city is very serious about reaching that goal of 15percent.... I think we made great strides by adding solar panels to buildings,"" Gates said. ""What I've been pushing the city is to develop other forms of renewable energy.""\City officials are considering other options, such as harnessing energy from the gasses coming from landfills or producing electricity by using treated wastewater.\But the most prominent renewable resource the city uses comes from the Arizona sun.\Gates said the city will outfit two other Phoenix parking garageswith solar panels early next year.\Solar contracts\Phoenix has installed some of the systems itself, using grants or city funds to finance the projects.\The projects aren't cheap. For example, the solar panels at the Sunnyslope Community Center cost $480,000, city officials said.\But the city also has more recently worked with SunPower Corporation. SunPower installed the panels on aviation facilities, a water-treatment plant and downtown garages, city officials said.\SunPower owns the solar systems. It pays for the design, construction and installation, and then operates and maintains them. Phoenix commits to buy the energy output, city officials said.\Dimitrios Laloudakis, the acting director of Phoenix's Public Works Department, said the 24 facilities generate an estimated 14,056 kilowatts. The city estimates it will save about $9million for 13 megawatts over 20 years, he said.\""There is a net savings over time,"" Laloudakis said. ""We pay less for energy.""\Solar history\Phoenix began to place solar equipment on its properties during the late 1990s, city officials said. The first included smaller panels on bus stations along Central Avenue.\Phoenix started the big solar push in 2007, when the city put larger panels at the Pecos Park and Ride, near Pecos Road and 40th Street in Ahwatukee.\The city then added solar panels to other facilities, such as the North Transfer Station, the Phoenix Convention Center's west building and Camp Colley, 50 miles north of Payson, in 2009.\Last year, the city placed a nine solar-panel systems on buildings.\City officials had to weigh facility layout and potential output of energy when deciding where to place the panels. Officials looked at whether a building had a plenty of space, faced the sun and could be committed to a long-term solar-project installation.\|\Phoenix properties with solar panels\Pecos Park and Ride.\North Transfer Station/parking lot.\Camp Colley.\North Mountain Park Visitor Center.\Pecos Community Center.\Phoenix Convention Center-west building.\Washington Adult Center.\Audubon Visitor Center.\Fire Training Academy.\Fire Station No.72.\Fire Station No.1.\Paradise Village Apartments.\McCarty on Monroe.\Maryvale pool.\Sunnyslope Community Center.\Downtown Transit Building.\US Airways parking garage.\Arizona State University Downtown-Walter Cronkite School of Journalism.\Metro Facilities Building.\Burton Barr Central Library.\Phoenix Children's Museum.\Sky Harbor International Airport's east economy garages and rental-car center.\Lake Pleasant.\Walker Building."
7,"The hottest summer on record helped make 2013 the eighth-warmest year ever in Phoenix, according to a National Weather Service review of data released Monday.\The city's average temperature, combining night and day year-round, was 75.9. The average high of 87.6 was the 10th-warmest, while the average low (64.2) was the sixth-warmest low temperature.\A hotter summer and streaky precipitation throughout the year contributed to a lack of clarity about what's really normal anymore.\Whether climate change or the urban ""heat island"" effect are contributing to rising average temperatures, 2013 was hot in Tucson, too, where it was the fifth-warmest year, averaging 70.9 degrees. Tucson also experienced a record 81 consecutive nights at 70 degrees or warmer.\A year that started with an unusual cold spell for Phoenix, including a 29-degree reading on Jan. 15, was broiling by June. At 94.8 degrees, an average of 4 degrees above normal, it was hotter than any previous June. At 119 degrees, June29 was the fourth-hottest day in recorded Phoenix history.\With seven of the city's 10 hottest years coming since 2000, the thermometer seems to be trending increasingly upward. This hotter stretch of years has coincided with a fierce drought and wildfires statewide.\State Climatologist Nancy Selover said climate change may be playing a role. ""Exactly how much, I don't know,"" she said.\One thing she's sure of, though, is that an odd pattern of humid nights broken by sporadic monsoon rains helped store heat overnight for long stretches of time last summer.\A major contributor to the sweltering summer likely was the Valley's continued growth and the heat-trapping qualities of urban environments, said Michael Leuthold, a University of Arizona research meteorologist. Blacktop and buildings collect warmth that once dissipated overnight.\""If you start out the morning 2 or 3 degrees warmer than it was 20 years ago,"" Leuthold said, ""you're certainly going to get hotter.""\The effects of climate change are hard to gauge, he said, but theories common among scientists predict wider swings in the region's future weather.\""It's never cut-and-dried with weather,"" Leuthold said, ""but I think the majority of it is growth in the Phoenix valley.""\Hotter summers mean higher energy bills for air-conditioning and greater water use as outdoor plants are stressed.\In Phoenix in 2013, there were 115 days that exceeded 100 degrees and 25 days above 110 degrees -- both measures outpacing the average since 1981.\The city finished 2013 with 8.42 inches of rain, pushed over the average of 8.03 by an unusual late-November storm in which much of Maricopa County got more than 2 inches.\That was welcome relief in the 15th year of the Southwest's most-intense drought in recorded history. But the region's water supply will remain troubled until some big winters pile up snow in northern Arizona and in the Rocky Mountains.\The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation on Monday listed Lake Powell as 44percent full, which is low enough that managers will start slowing releases downstream to Lake Mead this year. Without a rebound, these major reservoirs could face a shortage that would reduce the state's share of Colorado River water.\That wouldn't put the Phoenix area's municipal systems at risk for immediate shortage, though. The state has stored river water in aquifers, and Salt River Project expects that even a slightly dry winter would fill its in-state reservoirs to about 80 percent of capacity.\High temperatures didn't just affect urban areas. Prescott experienced a late-June heat wave, which wildfire investigators determined affected the deadly Yarnell Hill Fire. Temperatures for the year at Prescott's airport were a half-degree above normal.\But not all the state suffered sustained heat. In the northern forests, where years of drought and warming winters have contributed to tree-killing beetle outbreaks, many locations logged average temperatures slightly cooler than usual.\Flagstaff was 0.6-degree cooler than usual.\Page, Bellemont, and Walnut Canyon and Wupatki national monuments all had their wettest monsoon seasons, while Flagstaff, Tusayan and Grand Canyon's Phantom Ranch had their second-wettest monsoons, said Megan Schwitzer, a Weather Service meteorologist.\""The wet monsoon season definitely helped our annual water budget,"" she said."
8,"Arizona faces significant threats from climate change. That gives us a big stake in moving beyond denial and into productive problem-solving.\A focus on addressing climate change requires finding effective strategies for well-known Arizona problems. It means protecting human health, the environment and economic development.\Vetted, peer-reviewed studies have shown that global warming is happening, caused by human activities, primarily burning oil, gas and coal. A recent report from the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says greenhouse-gas emissions need to be drastically cut worldwide in order to avert a major climate catastrophe. That won't be easy.\Scientists working on an update of the congressionally mandated National Climate Assessment say Arizona faces a number of major challenges. Most involve known problems. All need to be addressed, regardless of whether politicians accept what scientists are saying.\As a desert state, Arizona will feel the effects of climate change most severely around ""water, water, water"" as the state gets hotter and drier, says Don Wuebbles, professor of atmospheric science at the University of Illinois and one of many respected scientists working on the update of the climate assessment.\Arizona water experts, such as former Sen. Jon Kyl, urge that planning start now for water shortages. Climate scientists' predictions of prolonged droughts make it more important to look beyond current overallocated sources.\The non-profit Environmental and Energy Study Institute says snowpack levels and stream flow are already down measurably in the Southwest. This impacts one of Arizona's major water sources, the Colorado River.\Arizona needs a serious and sustained discussion about balancing the needs of agriculture with growing urban centers. Water conservation and reclamation must be creatively and vigorously pursued, along with new sources of water.\Drier conditions, more severe insect infestations and increasingly intense fires threaten our forests. Arizona talks about the need to thin forests and address pests, such as bark beetles. But little real progress has been made. The state moves into yet another fire season without having met the human-safety needs identified after the deaths of 19 hotshots last year.\Climate change means increasingly severe weather events, including haboobs and highway dust storms. This, too, involves an existing problem. Yet nothing has been done to address stretches of Interstate 10 that are particularly subject to deadly flash dust storms.\Hotter conditions will result in more heat-related deaths. This is of particular concern because the elderly are among the most vulnerable, and Baby Boomers are aging. How does Arizona ensure that homes are properly insulated and that affordable cooling is available?\This is dicey. The price of electricity affects individuals and economic development, but cutting greenhouse-gas emissions can push up costs.\Environmental Protection Agency orders to reduce pollution from northern Arizona's Navajo Generating Station -- the largest coal-fired energy plant in the West -- threatened to do just that. The EPA agreed to a solution last year that does not unduly raise costs. But President Barack Obama is moving forward with proposed plans to further limit carbon emissions.\Arizona needs to be ready with ideas and solutions, not just arguments about whether global warming is a figment of Al Gore's imagination.\Climate change is real. It's a threat to Arizona. Facing that scientific fact can give added urgency to tackling long-standing state needs.\|\REPUBLIC EDITORIAL BOARD: John Zidich, Joanna Allhands, Steve Benson, Phil Boas, Jennifer Dokes, Robert Leger, Randy Lovely, Doug MacEachern, Robert Robb and Linda Valdez"
9,"It's always amusing when laymen declare the scientific debate about climate change to be over.\What in the world does that mean?\It can't mean climate science has become fixed and unchanging. Scientists express their views about climate change and its effects in terms of ranges and probabilities, which constantly change. Climate computer models are continuously refined. And they are proliferating, as more scientists get into the act.\Moreover, there are unexplained anomalies. Global warming has been pretty flat the past 15 years. That's acknowledged by the latest assessment of the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the U.S. National Climate Assessment, whose release this week triggered a tornado of ""the debate is over"" proclamations.\The climate models don't predict this. There are a variety of theories as to why it has happened, but nothing the scientists claim is proven. And then there is the three-decade cooling period between 1940 and 1970, when the Industrial Revolution was fully humming. There are theories about that, as well, but again nothing regarded as proven. Those are some big anomalies.\There is tension between the IPCC assessment and the National Climate Assessment. The U.S. document makes bold predictions about regional effects and links to extreme weather events that the IPCC is far more cautious about.\The most prominent layman declaring the debate over is President Barack Obama. But there could be a robust debate between the Obama who ran for president in 2008 and the Obama who ran for re-election in 2012. The 2008 Obama was an anti-fossil-fuel warrior, pledging to slow the rise of the oceans and begin healing the planet. The 2012 Obama ran as an all-of-the-above energy guy, bragging about an increase in oil and natural-gas production.\In its most recent report, the IPCC offers a sensible summary: ""Responding to climate-related risks involves decision-making in a changing world, with continuing uncertainty about the severity and timing of climate-change impacts.""\That hardly describes a debate that is over. But it offers a useful starting point for a discussion about what the laymen who are politicians should be doing about it.\There should be healthy skepticism about the precision of computer models of something as complex as the climate of the entire world.\Still, the natural atmosphere serves us well. Unleashing man-made greenhouse gases changes it. Doing less of that is better than doing more of it.\The Obama administration is trying to choke coal to death through regulation. That might be OK if it were simultaneously removing barriers to natural-gas exploration, production and export.\Fracking has been the most effective climate-change response to date. Expanding the supply and reducing the cost of cleaner-burning natural gas has substantially reduced U.S. greenhouse emissions. The most effective thing the U.S. government could do to reduce global emissions would be to unleash U.S. natural-gas exports.\Domestically, it's unclear what the Obama administration is trying to accomplish by breathing political life back into the climate-change issue. Obama ran away from the issue in 2012. There doesn't seem to be a political advantage to raising its profile before the 2014 election, when Democrats from energy-producing states are highly vulnerable.\Other than strangling coal through regulation, the administration isn't promoting a big climate-change initiative. The administration couldn't get cap-and-trade passed when Democrats had firm control of Congress. Since then, cap-and-trade has proved a bust in Western Europe, where it has done much more to reward rent-seekers than to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions.\I continue to believe the most appropriate policy response would be the establishment of a small, revenue-neutral carbon tax. Working through the mechanics of a carbon tax would be a giant step forward.\A carbon tax, even a small one, would be a signal that carbon emissions have become a variable cost to be minimized.

10,"A new study shows wildfires have become increasingly common and more devastating since the 1970s, and researchers linked the spikes in fire activity to global climate change.\Climate Central, a group that researches climate change, compiled information from wildfires in the United States that have burned more than 1,000 acres since the 1970s and found that wildfires have become more common in recent years.\The number has increased from fewer than 50 wildfires in the Western U.S. in the 1970s to a peak of 150 in the last four years, according to the study.\The Climate Central study appears to bolster another research project that linked rising temperatures and fire activity.\Release of the latest study immediately drew criticism from climate-change skeptics who took to the group's website to air their view that the Climate Central study was simply a way to broach the topic of global warming.\Others on the group's site said the study did not adequately take into account U.S. Forest Service policies that might have changed through the decades to discourage wildland-fire managers from taking a direct approach on blazes that do not threaten people or homes.\A previous study from the non-profit research group Headwaters Economics found that an increase in temperatures of 1 degree Fahrenheit when a fire is burning translates to 35 percent more acreage burned, according to the group's survey of California's Sierra Nevada and its foothill forests.\Analysis of the temperatures in the new study by Climate Central showed that spring and summer seasons in Arizona are on average, 3 degrees warmer now than they were in the 1970s.\The average number of acres that burn in Arizona annually has also increased to almost 10 times more than what used to be the average in the '70s, according to Climate Central. The increase went from about 10,000 acres in the 1970s to an average of 95,000 acres annually.\In Arizona, nearly 1 million acres burned in 2011 alone.\That year, three notable wildfires, including the biggest fire in Arizona history, hit the state.\The Horseshoe Two Fire in the Chiricahua Mountains started on May 8 and spread to more than 220,000 acres. A little more than a month later, on June 12, the Monument Fire blazed in the canyons of the Huachuca Mountains, forcing evacuations and burning more than 30,500 acres. Around the same time, the Wallow Fire, the largest wildfire to date, burned in the White Mountains area of eastern Arizona. It charred more than 469,000 acres.\Alyson Kenward, lead researcher in the study, said that dramatic one-year spikes, like that in 2011, do not affect their overall analysis of annual wildfire reports.\""It's also important to keep in mind that a one-year spike in wildfires can be symptomatic of long-term changes in factors that affect wildfires, and aren't necessarily random,"" Kenward said.\For example, several years of drought or rising temperatures can successively increase wildfire risk, Kenward said."
11,"As the governor of New Mexico for eight years, I understand the challenges facing Native American communities and in particular how climate change disproportionately affects these communities.\As a former U.S. Energy secretary, I also have an intimate understanding of the benefits and opportunities that accrue from policies that help us transition to cleaner sources of energy.\The Environmental Protection Agency unveiled its Clean Power Plan this year, the most significant policy to date for addressing carbon pollution from power plants, the primary cause of climate change in the U.S. Climate change affects different communities in different ways, some more significantly than others. Tribal communities know the impacts more significantly than most.\That is why the EPA hearing in Phoenix this week, regarding the supplemental proposal to the Clean Power Plan addressing carbon pollution from affected plants in Indian Country and U.S. territories, was so important.\Tribes have already experienced significant negative effects of climate change, both from extreme weather and, particularly, health impacts.\Climate change and rising temperatures increase smog, a key trigger for asthma. A recent report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that asthma affects almost 12 percent of people living in tribal communities. That's almost double the national average -- one key reason we need to reduce dangerous carbon pollution and the climate change it's fueling. The problem will only grow with unmitigated climate change.\Climate change endangers not only the health but also the economic stability of tribal communities. Extreme drought is lowering water levels and impairing agricultural productivity. Extreme rainfall and snowfall has also led to flooding and dislocation.\The Navajo Nation and Hopi Tribe were severely affected by a 2010 snowstorm that produced several feet of snow. Many members of both tribes were stranded, and food and supplies had to be flown in to provide for those in remote areas.\Tribal communities are well aware of the imminent threat that climate change poses, and tribes are taking action to prevent devastation. In the Southwest and across the nation, tribes are trying to find ways to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions by implementing renewable energy, energy efficiency and weatherization measures. In a model case, the Gila River Indian Community hired a climate-projects specialist and coordinated a renewable energy team to implement energy- conservation projects.\Some tribes in Arizona and New Mexico have also worked to develop their wind energy resources with wind farms and solar energy through utility-scale solar projects. They have also explored the potential for developing geothermal energy resources.\Our nation's tribal communities are taking action to fight climate change, and the rest of the country needs to follow suit. Supporting the administration's Clean Power Plan is one surefire way to start. The proposal would cut carbon pollution by 30 percent from 2005 levels by 2030.\Reducing our carbon pollution needs to be a priority for everyone because climate change affects everyone. Although some communities are impacted more significantly than others by climate change, it is a national and global crisis. The EPA projects that its plan will prevent over 6,000 premature deaths, up to 150,000 asthma attacks in children, and more than 3,000 heart attacks.\I have promoted policies that protect communities while creating economic opportunities. The Clean Power Plan fights climate change in a manner that is good for our economy and our public health. It should be implemented without delay.\|\Bill Richardson, a former New Mexico governor, served as Energy secretary and U.N. ambassador in the Clinton administration."
12,"Climate change is contributing to the risk of wildfires across Arizona, state officials acknowledged Thursday. But they dodged questions about what is causing the changing environment, which has contributed to massive wildfires in Arizona over the last two decades.\They urged Arizonans to take precautions while in the state's forests and chaparral. That includes extinguishing campfires completely and reporting violations of fire-safety practices.\""I think that there is climate change,"" Gov. Doug Ducey told reporters. ""What I am skeptical about is what human activity has to do with it.""\Arizona faces a ""fairly standard"" wildfire season, with risk highest in the pine forests, along riverbeds and in the southeastern grasslands, state officials said.\Jeff Whitney, Ducey's appointee as state forester, also ducked a question about the origins of the shifting climate.\""Let's not get into why the climate is changing,"" Whitney said. ""But it is climate.""\Already, 300 fires have burned across 1,000 acres in Arizona, Whitney said. The fire season is expected to begin around Memorial Day and run until the monsoon brings rain and humidity, usually in July.\Whitney touted the Firewise program, which encourages property owners to keep brush, tree limbs and other flammable materials away from their homes. This clears a safe zone around a property where an approaching wildfirewould have a good chance to ""lay down"" instead of being fueled by the materials around a home.\Whitney said he's seeing an eerie similarity in fire conditions to two major fires that occurred in the last two decades: the Rio fire of 1995 in the McDowell Mountains of north Scottsdale, and the Cave Creek Complex fire of 2005, which burned north of Cave Creek and Carefree. Those fires were fueled by tinder-dry grasses and scrub that grew rapidly after a fairly wet winter, he said.\Chuck Maxwell, a meteorologist with the Southwest Coordination Center, said there will be some relief in that officials are not expecting high winds this season, which can quickly turn a small blaze into a major conflagration.\""This is not going to be a windy, driving, take-off-quickly fire season,"" he said. However, the center's forecast predicts a greater likelihood of lightning strikes igniting fires, especially in dry, grassy areas, he said.\But even with lightning posing a potentially greater risk this year than last, Ducey and others noted most fires are human-caused, and therefore, preventable.\""I caution everyone to follow the law,"" Ducey said. ""Be safe, be smart, have fun and practice common sense.""\Reach the reporter at maryjo.pitzl@arizonarepublic.com or at 602-444-8963."
13,"Gov. Doug Ducey and the Legislature might want to rethink those $100 million in cuts to education and put some of that cash into a science class ... for themselves.\Ducey is ""skeptical"" about human-caused climate change. Likewise, the Legislature sent 10 anti-environmental resolutions to Congress and also is loaded with science deniers.\Speaking a while back after a meeting on fire danger during summer, Ducey said, ""We just went through a great briefing of all the experts. They informed me that the climate is changing. It's going to get warmer here.""\Then he added, ""What I am skeptical about is what human activity has to do with it.""\I'm not scientifically equipped to illuminate the governor on this issue. However, I have read a few things that might help. For example, he might review a report available on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) website. It deals with the human-caused aspect of climate change and reads in part:\""In its Fourth Assessment Report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group of 1,300 independent scientific experts from countries all over the world under the auspices of the United Nations, concluded there's a more than 90 percent probability that human activities over the past 250 years have warmed our planet. ... The panel also concluded there's a better than 90 percent probability that human-produced greenhouse gases ... have caused much of the observed increase in Earth's temperatures over the past 50 years.""\This is one of many scientific studies on the subject, studies that deal in facts, not supposition, not superstition and not political philosophy.\There are reports from the United States Environmental Protection Agency. From the Environmental Defense Fund. From the Union of Concerned Scientists. They all conclude, as the EPA reports, ""Human activities are contributing to climate change, primarily by releasing billions of tons of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases, known as greenhouse gases, into the atmosphere every year.""\If reading a scientific report is too daunting, Ducey might watch the documentary ""Chasing Ice,"" featuring the work of National Geographic photographer James Balog and his Extreme Ice Survey. Or, if that film is too daunting, Ducey and lawmakers could watch any number of TED talks in which esteemed scientists briefly explain the human role in climate change.\According to a University of Arizona and Stanford University study, more than 70 percent of Arizona residents believe the government should limit greenhouse gases. The conclusions of the scientists cited above are based on methodical study of the natural world, not on whether they belong to the Republican Party or are Democrats. We live a state where climate change will have a huge impact on our lives. We need elected officials who are educated in the changes.\Ducey is skeptical of the science.\I'm skeptical of politicians."
14,"Pope Francis' call for action on climate change represents wise use of a big bully pulpit. In making this a moral issue, he points out the dangers of the reckless pursuit of profits. He dings political shortsightedness. As head of the Catholic Church, his voice rises above the politics. He can reach a worldwide audience in a way that few people can match. By using his position for the good of the people and the planet, he's showing his own deep morality."
15,"The debate over renewable energy -- aka, the ""future"" -- invariably skips past the harsh part about wind and solar power not being ""dispatchable."" That is, you can't always send it where you need it whenever you need it. Advocates talk as though still-unsolvable hurdles like storage and delivery capacity already are resolved. They aren't. But, it's worse than that. The cost of building capacity for wind and solar make gas energy more carbon efficient, too."
16,"Many people believe the world is facing climate change that is likely to impact life as we know it here in the West Valley.\Is this fact or fancy?\Not being a climatologist, I do not claim to be an expert on the subject. But I do know that something like 95 percent of scientists who study this sort of thing believe we are in a long term secular warming trend. And in May, The Arizona Republic reported the results of a public opinion poll that indicated something like 75 percent of Arizonans think there is a problem.\Heck, even the pope has now announced he is a believer!\But, according to the same Republic article, those in state leadership positions, including our governor and most of our state legislators, do not believe this is an issue.\Being an empirical kind of guy, all I can go by is the reading on the thermometer outside my office window -- and the indicator arm on that device has been virtually maxed out since the first of June.\So, for the sake of argument, let's suppose we do have a climate change issue on our hands -- one which could significantly impact our quality of life in the years ahead. If this is the case, this is almost certainly a nation-wide issue and most likely a global issue. But climate change also has a regional dimension.\We here in the Valley of the Sun are not powerless to confront this hypothetical situation if we choose.\In the spirit of ""think globally and act locally,"" here are some actions we can take to get ahead of this freight train. Let's start with five of the most local action items and work towards those where we can only have an influence in our larger communities.\Five ways we can help\Plant more shade trees. Shade trees can have a significant impact on the ambient heat in our communities and are something we can all plant on our own properties and encourage our communities to do. For an excellent guide on the climate benefits of shade trees and information on various types of shade trees, I recommend Avondale's ""Street Trees Master Plan"" on the city website.\Reduce pavement in favor of permeable ground cover. Areas covered by asphalt and other types of pavement tend to radiate heat into the atmosphere. Almost any sort of permeable ground cover will reduce heat radiation, including grass, but also drought-tolerant ground cover and even permeable paving materials that absorb heat rather than reflect it.\Consider applying a white elastomeric covering to the flat portions of your roof --- These roof coverings are reputed to reflect more of the sun's energy and maintain lower roof temperatures.\Drive more fuel-efficient, low-emission vehicles and expand your use of public transit.\Promote ""smart growth"" community design, including complete streets and more mixed use developments.\Once we have exhausted the readily-available means to address climate change in our own environment, we can support our communities in moving as quickly as possible towards more ""climate-friendly"" design concepts: Mixed use developments minimize the transportation needed for daily tasks and can be constructed in a more fuel-efficient manner. We can also complement mixed-use development with more complete streets, that embrace bicycles and other forms of transportation and decrease our dependence on automobiles.\By adopting some of these local actions, we can at least get a start in combating any climate change that might be occurring here in the Valley.\Jeff Gibbs is a former Litchfield Park planning commissioner who has lived throughout the West Valley and now resides in Surprise.

17,"""I'm going because Alaskans are on the front lines of one of the greatest challenges we face this century: Climate change. It's our wake-up call. The alarm bells are ringing, and as long as I'm president, America will lead the world to meet this threat before it's too late.""\President Obama\washington -- President Obama will log more than 14,000 miles on Air Force One over the next 11 days in a tour on climate change that will take him from the desert West to the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Circle.\In Las Vegas, New Orleans and in the small Alaska fishing village of Kotzebue, Obama will deliver a three-pronged message: The U.S. needs to increase the use of alternative energy sources, make coastal communities more resilient and urge a global response to climate change.\The three major climate-themed events are part of an effort by Obama to speak ""frequently and frankly"" about the issue over his second term, said Brian Deese, a senior Obama adviser who handles environmental and energy issues for the White House.\They come three weeks after the White House launched a plan for cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 32% over 25 years.\In Las Vegas on Monday night, Obama was likely to tout new executive actions to make alternative energy sources more affordable in a speech to the National Clean Energy Summit. On Monday, the Department of Energy announced it would issue $1billion in loan guarantees for ""distributed energy"" projects -- technologies that allow consumers to generate their own electricity or obtain it from a nearby source.\The idea, officials said, was not just to invest in new technologies, but to make it easier for those technologies to get a foothold in the market. For example, the Federal Housing Administration announced a policy Monday that will allow the buyer of an energy-efficient home to assume the cost of those improvements through assessments using a federal mortgage.\In New Orleans on Thursday, Obama will mark the 10th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. And while climate change won't be the sole focus of the trip, Obama is expected to talk about the need to rebuild from disasters in ways that make communities more resistant to the effects of rising seas, more frequent storms, deeper droughts and increased wildfires.\""We've all tremendously increased our focus on how we build our modern infrastructure to be more resilient to all kinds of risks, including that of extreme weather,"" Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz said.\In a three-day trip to Alaska next week, Obama will crisscross the state, visiting the villages of Seward, Dellingham and Kotzebue to meet with local communities -- including Alaska Natives -- about the effect that melting glaciers and softening permafrost are having. His visit to Kotzebue, a largely Inupiat native village 33 miles above the Arctic Circle on the edge of the Chukchi Sea, will mark the northernmost trek of any sitting president in the United States.\""I'm going because Alaskans are on the front lines of one of the greatest challenges we face this century: Climate change,"" Obama said in a video released by the White House.\""It's our wake-up call. The alarm bells are ringing, and as long as I'm president, America will lead the world to meet this threat before it's too late.""\He'll also address the State Department's Conference on Global Leadership in the Arctic, also known as the Glacier Conference, which is bringing together leaders from Arctic nations to grapple with climate issues.\But the Arctic trip also highlights some of the tensions in Obama's energy policy. Environmental groups have been sharply critical of the Interior Department's granting of permits to Royal Dutch Shell to drill for oil in the Arctic Ocean, with the final permit coming just last week.\But Deese brushed off that criticism Monday, saying Shell was operating under a lease granted under the George W. Bush administration, and the Obama administration had delayed and narrowed the permit, allowing a single well with ""unprecedented, high levels of safety standards for Shell or any other company to meet.""\Moniz said the Obama administration was also trying to lessen U.S. dependence on foreign oil, which the nation imports at the rate of 7 million barrels a day.\Climate change is also likely to be a major topic when Pope Francis visits the White House in September.\""I'm going because Alaskans are on the front lines of one of the greatest challenges we face this century: Climate change.

18,"We are writing, as elected officials whose counties represent areas directly impacted by uranium mining, in response to former Grand Canyon National Park Superintendent Steve Martin ( ""Plug loopholes and protect Grand Canyon from mining,"" Aug. 17 My Turn).\The underlying theme of Martin's column is that uranium mining is bad and has no redeeming value to the public and the nation.\To the contrary, it has been our experience that the uranium mining industry in the last 25 years has gone out of its way to protect the environment in which it operates. Reclamation work by uranium producers on former mine sites, unlike the fiasco in Colorado caused by the EPA within the past few weeks, has been conducted with great professional care, leaving these sites in safe and sound condition.\Northern Arizona's unique breccia pipe geological formations represent the nation's largest source of high-grade uranium ore. At a time when the current administration has concluded that climate change is real this uranium supply represents a curing balm for a sick world.\America's nuclear power plants are clean and release no carbon emissions, making these deposits in northern Arizona an almost perfect solution for our electricity-hungry nation.\Environmental groups cannot have it both ways. Either global warming is real and we need clean nuclear power fueled by uranium, or these groups are denying us access to a homegrown solution to the largest environmental problem of our time.\Rather than closing off this northern Arizona treasure, wouldn't using it make more sense?\The reality is that America's nuclear power industry imports over 92 percent of the uranium it uses from foreign sources. Given the availability of this northern Arizona uranium, that level of imports defies reason.\We do not have the luxury, as the Park Service does, to write off safe, reliable resources of fuel that pose no threat to the Grand Canyon.

Feldmann is lead author of the second study, which appeared in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\Can both studies be true?\Yes, said Ted Scambos, a scientist with the National Snow and Ice Data Center.\Scambos said that the first study is more of a short-term look at what's happening today and over the next couple decades in Antarctica.

21,"""This is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning."" Those were Winston Churchill's words of battle-weary comfort when World War II started decisively shifting in the Allies' favor.\They could also be applied to the climate accord just reached in Paris -- 196 countries all agreeing to cut or limit greenhouse gas emissions. The long slog to slow global warming and avoid its worst environmental, economic and security consequences is hard and often thankless political work.\Republicans running for president are obviously not keen on picking up that shovel. They treat the issue as not a problem, a problem for others to solve or unsolvable. Ted Cruz: ""Climate change is not science. It's religion."" Donald Trump: ""I don't believe in climate change."" Ben Carson at least concedes its existence but says that there is ""no overwhelming science"" that humans are involved.\It may be true that the electorate is focused on the more immediate and dramatic threat of terrorism, and not just Republicans. Global warming can seem boring by comparison.\But terrorism was pretty much ignored until Sept. 11, 2001. Then disaster struck domestically, and the public erupted. Trying to prevent the awful things from happening in the future is what mature leaders do. Sadly, their efforts go largely unappreciated by a public too busy or detached to take notice.\It would be unfair to paint all Republicans as limp on climate change. A survey released in September found that 54 percent of self-described Republican conservatives believe that climate change is happening and that humans play a part in it. Only 9 percent don't think the planet is warming. (Other polls show far lower levels of concern among Republicans, it must be noted.)\The survey was ordered by Jay Faison, a wealthy Republican from North Carolina determined to sell his party on the need for confronting climate change.\One thing the agreement can do is make the bad things happen more slowly and perhaps buy time. And it will give a boost to the good developments -- improvements in green energy technology, conservation and the very exciting field of ""negative emissions"" technology (taking planet-warming gases out of the air).\Here's where American ingenuity can save the world and make big money at the same time. That's a conservative talking point, free for the taking.\Think Churchill: The agreement is not the end of the problem, But it gives hope that something resembling victory is possible."

Like many neighbors, I now have to use allergy medications.\What is disappointing is that we are failing to make the connection to climate change. December, January and February were all record-breaking warm months. Warming means pollen-producing plants don't die off in the winter, have longer growing seasons, and higher carbon dioxide levels also mean each plant produces more pollen.\With our air pollution, which is also worsened by higher temperatures, it becomes a miserable one-two punch. For those with respiratory conditions like asthma or COPD, or breathing for two during pregnancy, or the more vulnerable lungs of our children.\It becomes a dangerous and expensive problem.

The National Assessment of Educational Progress shows that Arizona Hispanic students have made large academic gains.\Since all states began participating in NAEP in 2003, Arizona Hispanic students tied for first for the highest Hispanic on eighth-grade math, third among states in eighth-grade reading gains. Arizona Hispanic students tied for 6th in fourth-grade math and reading gains.\Arizona charter schools have more than done their part with a majority-minority student population and gains above and beyond the statewide average. Arizona Hispanic students attending charter schools, for instance, tied the statewide average for Delaware on eighth-grade math in 2015 on NAEP.\We have ample reason to desire a faster rate of progress, and I agree with Valdez that Arizona's future rests heavily upon the success of Hispanic students. District schools, however, remain the most generously funded of Arizona's school options by a wide margin and outcomes for Hispanic students have been trending in a positive direction.\--Matthew Ladner, Phoenix\The many reasons why a mother would abandon her newborn\I was disappointed in Laurie Roberts' commentary Saturday (""What sort of mom abandons a baby?"").\Ms. Roberts appears to assume that everyone in Arizona knows, or should know, about Arizona's Safe Haven law.

23,"can tho, vietnam -- Huynh Van Loi, 50, a farmer who spent most his life in the same small Mekong Delta district, has experienced good weather and bad, droughts and floods. But this year brought something he'd never seen.\""The water is salty,"" he said. ""I've been living here since my childhood but this is the first time we've had salty water. All my crops were destroyed.""\The worst drought in 90 years, rising sea levels and rampant development are causing a crisis in the Mekong Delta, known as Vietnam's rice bowl. The delta is home to 20 million people and accounts for more than half of Vietnam's rice and fruit production, 90% of its rice exports and 60% of fishery exports.\But this year, paddy rice fields resemble parched desertscapes as farmers wait for a rainy season that is late to arrive. Small farmers such as Loi, who grows watermelons and orange trees about 40 miles from the South China Sea, have seen crop-ruining salinity intrude farther inland than ever before.\The drought, caused by El Nino weather patterns, is hitting the entire region from Thailand to Cambodia to Vietnam's central highlands. The impact is most acute here in the Mekong Delta, where the Mekong River ends its 2,700-mile journey from the Tibetan plateau through six Asian countries.\A United Nations report released in March about the drought estimated that 393,000 acres of rice in Vietnam was already lost, with an additional 1.2 million acres likely to be damaged. Almost 1 million people lack water for daily consumption.\The figures are alarming but could grow worse if weather extremes become more common in years to come.\""This year is not a special case,"" said Duong Van Ni, an environmental management professor at Can Tho University. ""It will happen more in the future.""\Ni said the rapid agricultural development that turned postwar Vietnam from a famine-stricken country into one of the world's leading rice exporters has exacerbated the effects of climate change.\""A long time ago, there were also typhoons, also saltwater intrusion, also drought,"" Ni said. ""But the impact was not as severe as now, because at that time the ecosystem wasn't changed by humans. Now the system is already damaged: by canals, by dikes, by water management, by land use.""\Then there are the dams. China has built seven hydropower dams on the upper Mekong, known locally as the Lancang, and plans to add 21 more. Laos and Cambodia intend to build 11 hydropower dams on the lower Mekong, with two in Laos already under construction.\China's existing dams already hurt the Mekong, affecting water levels, water temperature and fish migration patterns. They also trap as much as 80% of the sediment that reaches them. The sediment is needed to fertilize downstream floodplains and protect against coastal erosion.\""The biggest impact is the trapping of silt,"" said Richard Cronin, director of the Southeast Asia program at the Stimson Center, a think tank in Washington, D.C. He said the silt is needed to replenish nutrients that wash away during monsoon season in the delta and southern Cambodia, as well as to sustain the delta against rising sea levels.\Without the sediment, the low-lying delta is eroding and actually sinking. Vietnam's Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment estimated that a 1-meter rise in the sea level would submerge nearly 40% of the Mekong Delta and more than 20% of Ho Chi Minh City, a metropolis of 10 million people.\Vietnam is introducing salt-resistant rice and increasing autumn and winter rice crop quotas to make up for this year's shortfall. The Ministry of Agriculture and Development is seeking $4.5billion from the government to build an irrigation system, and work is underway on a decades-long plan to construct sea walls and dikes along the coast.\""I find it difficult to be optimistic,"" said Dan Spencer, associate professor of environmental studies at the University of Montana. ""Like many poor nations, Vietnam generates very little of the climate change problem but suffers from the brunt of many of the effects.""\Ni called the problem alarming. ""I wonder if the situation of the Mekong basin, especially the Mekong River, should be upgraded as a global issue, as soon as possible,"" he said. ""It's not isolated to six countries in Asia.""\On a recent day, farmer Nguyen Tran Ngoc was digging a canal to try to irrigate some new crops: watermelon, flowers, squash, pumpkin and cabbage. He stopped growing rice because of the lack of water. He doesn't know how much longer he can make a living from farming.\""Worry or don't worry, it's all the same,"" he said. ""Change is coming and we can't control it."""
24,"WASHINGTON -- State and federal officials praised a bipartisan bill Wednesday that would encourage renewable-energy development on public land by streamlining the permitting process and letting local governments share in revenue from the projects.\The bill would ""level the playing field"" between renewable and fossil fuel projects on federal lands by creating a streamlined leasing process for wind and solar energy projects like the one in place for oil, gas and geothermal energy.\That is of special importance to Arizona, witnesses told the House Natural Resources Subcommittee hearing, because of the large amount of federal land in the state and its potential for renewable energy.\""We just need to remove some of the barriers and incentivize counties,"" said Ian Dowdy, director of the Sonoran Institute's Sun Corridor project. Those incentives -- giving counties 25 percent of the revenue from any project on federal lands within the county's borders -- are a large part of the attraction for Mohave County Supervisor Buster Johnson.\Johnson, who was also testifying on behalf of the National Association of Counties and several other groups, said he would ""probably not"" support the bill if it were not for the revenue-sharing program. The bill's revenue-sharing provisions would also apply to existing projects, which could give Mohave County $519,375 in payments, Johnson said, and about $4.6 million to the state as a whole.\Johnson said his county has ""some of the highest solar and wind energy potential in the nation."" But he and Dowdy said many rural residents have opposed such developments in the past over concerns that the county budget would have to cover roads, water, police and other costs associated with the projects.\The bill by Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., which already has 67 co-sponsors, including every member of Arizona's delegation, would give counties revenue to help cover these costs.\""The 25 percent share of revenue for local counties as described in this legislation should not only offset the burdens that development may bring, but it may also allow innovative rural counties to benefit from a new economic-development opportunity,"" he said.\Gosar's bill would also create a Renewable Energy Resource Conservation Fund, which would get 35 percent of revenue from any project. Money from the fund will go toward offsetting the environmental impact of these new solar and wind developments, something Gosar, who called himself a ""passionate fisherman,"" said was very important to him.\Johnson said the legislation ""strikes a careful balance"" between encouraging renewable-energy development and offsetting its environmental and monetary costs.\There is no hope of action on the bill before Congress leaves for its two-month recess Friday, and only a few months left in this Congress after that. But Gosar said he is very hopeful the bill will succeed due to its bipartisan support."
25,"On a remote, craggy cliff 18 miles off the coast of Maine, a parent waits. Weepy-eyed and web-footed, the pudgy, painted puffin braces against a capricious wind -- and fickle foothold.\At last count, hardscrabble Eastern Egg Rock was home to 150 breeding pairs of Atlantic puffins, each vying to incubate a one-per-season puffball in burrows carved beneath boulders. Having clawed back from the brink -- in 1901, only one puffin pair remained in Maine -- climate change is now poised to do its own number on these charismatic birds. As last month's scientific audit, ""The State of North America's Birds"" warns, 49% of the continent's seabirds are caught up in the crisis.\Thursday night, Gene Karpinski, head of the League of Conservation Voters, will speak to climate change at the Democratic National Convention. The issue has put politicians at odds, galvanized voters and saddled scientists with a burden of proof.\Birds are used to being in human's sights. Not too long ago, our American bald eagle was in danger of vanishing in a puff. Patriotic symbolism couldn't shield it from human activity: hunting, habitat squandering, pesticide use. It took the Endangered Species Act of 1973 to restore that bird to its perch of power.\Also in 1973, a young ornithologist -- a diminutive Don Quixote named Stephen Kress -- got into the recovery act.\""It was love at first sight,"" Kress, 70, says of first viewing puffins as a teen near the U.S.-Canadian border. He learned they once flourished in Maine, the southernmost limit of their range, but by 1885 the effects of agri-fishers raiding the henhouse, daily plucking eggs from rocky crevices and laying nets on ledges to snare meaty adults, had taken a grievous toll.\Not abiding by fate, Kress negotiated with the Canadians for six puffin chicks to try re-colonizing 7-acre Eastern Egg Rock. Backed by the National Audubon Society and Barbara's, maker of Puffins cereal, he worked through the decades-long ""jigsaw puzzle"" of Project Puffin. Their team hand-reared ""pufflings"" with vitamin-fortified fish in man-made burrows and stationed interns from May to August to keep predators, like eagles, at bay. Fledged puffins set out on two- to three-year sea cruises while scientists set up sound recordings, decoys and mirrors to lure them home.\And waited.\Eight years later, the first prodigal puffin pair returned to roost. Things were looking pretty peachy until waters in the Gulf of Maine began rising faster than 99% of the Earth's oceans, Kress says, throwing delicate fish populations out of whack.\Audubon's annual Christmas bird count reveals nearly 350 North American birds are ""climate-affected,"" moving farther north. ""For those species that are already farther north, they've got nowhere to go,"" Kress says. ""Their fate, their future, really is in our hands.""\Last weekend, I saw it firsthand, setting foot on the puffins' hallowed breeding grounds, a towering babble of gulls, guillemots and terns situated 17 precarious feet above sea level.\An all-female summer squad yanked us ashore. Among their duties: Daily at 0600, one climbs atop the shack, ironically dubbed ""The Hilton,"" for a bird census. They label active burrows, tag birds and monitor avian diets and growth. By luck, we spy an adult puffin whiz by at high speed, a bowtie of sushi dangling from its slack-jawed rainbow beak, only to disappear underground. Interns fish out the baby for inspection. Puffin chicks' weights are steadily declining, they sadly report.\The changes for these colorful birds come in dribs and drabs.\""Ocean conservation is a hard thing for people to understand because it's happening underwater, and you can't see most of it,"" Kress explains. ""But seabirds are above ground, so we can see through their eyes.""\Dimpled, tears-of-a-clown eyes. In ill-fitting waistcoats, they wait. For a meal. A mate.

We know that our children are our future. And that future is rapidly being shaped by climate change.\Our precious children are at the highest risk from many effects of climate change. Particularly dangerous in Arizona are heat waves: Young children are more likely to die in extreme heat than older kids or healthy adults.\Ozone increased by higher temperatures and smoke from more severe and frequent wildfires exacerbate asthma, the most common pediatric disease. Changes in temperature and air quality are increasing airborne allergens, damaging lung function and development. More asthma attacks means more time out of school, and more parents leaving work to care for their children.\Arizona is in the midst of a 20-year drought. Nowadays, the rain we so desperately need often comes quickly and violently, producing floods and overwhelming stormwater systems. Contaminated water leads to disease outbreaks, shown by a direct correlation between flooding and emergency-room visits for intestinal infections, most commonly in children.\Infections spread by insects, such as Lyme disease, plague, West Nile and others, are already increasing as the ticks, fleas and mosquitoes that carry them expand their range under warmer conditions. Northern Arizona has nearly three more weeks above freezing per year than it did a century ago, allowing insects to overwinter in places they once couldn't tolerate.\The mosquitoes that carry Zika live in states they didn't used to, opening the door for further spread of a virus linked to devastating birth defects and abnormal brain development. Children's mental well-being is also threatened by worsening extreme events, such as hurricanes, flooding and wildfires.\During these ""natural"" disasters, kids are more likely to suffer injury or death, and lose track of their caregivers and homes. They miss school and can take months or years to catch up. They suffer post-traumatic stress disorder, which impacts their emotional and intellectual development. These documented impacts of climate change on our children's health and well-being are expected to worsen if we don't take action. The American Academy of Pediatrics, the World Health Organization and dozens of national and international medical societies recognize climate change as an urgent threat to our children.\An understanding of these effects, as well as the ethical implications of bestowing an increasingly unpredictable world on the next generation, is crucial to any conversation about climate change and potential solutions.\On Sunday in Phoenix, there's an opportunity to learn more about the impact of climate change on children, and what you can do about it. Sonja Klinsky, an assistant professor with Arizona State University's School of Sustainability, and I will lead a symposium on this issue.

Trump called global warming a Chinese ""hoax"" on Twitter years ago, and he's assigned a science dunce to lead the transition at the Environmental Protection Agency.\The comforting news is that America can move past the black hole of ignorance in Trump's Washington -- or New York or wherever he is. Enlightened state and city governments, as well as the private sector, can provide the leadership. As it happens, they're already on the case.\Huge example: During the Paris climate-change conference last December, Bill Gates organized a handful of billionaires and came up with $15 billion for his Breakthrough Energy Coalition. The group's mission is to fund research on radical new clean-energy technologies.\""Ten guys in a room produced more money than the entire world community of nations in commitment of resources,"" Daniel Esty, professor of environmental law and policy at Yale Law School, told me.\""I'm not as sad or crushed as some people (that Trump was elected),"" he added.

29,"With blizzards rocking the Midwest, we are seeing the usual influx of folks looking for homes in our more hospitable climate. But what will climate change mean for prospective home-buyers?\Last year was the hottest on record and the warming trend is likely to be a reality for the foreseeable future, so it makes sense to shop for homes with an eye toward future climate considerations.\In the Valley, warmer temperatures are sure to mean higher energy consumption as we try to cool down and an increased demand for water at the same time supplies shrink from increased evaporation.\Will the Valley will be uninhabitable or unsustainable? No, not at all. But we'll need to adapt our lifestyles and the micro-environments within which we live to maintain our quality of life.\So what factors should home-buyers consider?\No oceanfront property in Arizona\If you're looking for a home in a warm-weather climate, the Valley is probably your best choice.\This may seem paradoxical, but not if you consider the alternatives such as coastal areas. These areas, whether on the East or the West Coast, are not preferred locations in an era of climate change as all indications are that they will almost certainly be subject to extensive and frequent flooding due to rising sea levels. Securing often costly flood insurance will be a consistent issue.\For a warm weather location in an era of climate change, you are actually better off selecting the hot, dry Valley of the Sun.\Keep the cool inside\Once you have narrowed your search to a home in the Valley, there are many features to consider. From a climate change perspective, the objective is to find a home that is as tight and as impervious to the climate as possible. Some homes just seem to be tighter or better sealed then others, thereby minimizing the loss of cool air in the summer and the loss of heat in the winter.\Where's the sun?\Exposure to the sun is also of significant importance.\For me, the southern exposure of my house and outdoor patio area is ideal as the sun is directly overhead during the summer and slanting into the interior of the house during the winter. If your favored house does not have southern exposure, look for well-established trees and other vegetation to block the sun's rays from the east and especially from the west.\Other heat-mitigating options\Beyond these basics, Linda Allison at Russ Lyon/Sotheby's realty suggests the following features to mitigate the effects of climate change:\Updated, efficient heating and cooling systems.\Additional attic insulation.\Energy-efficient windows and doors.\Roof solar panels, which generate energy and reduce the sun rays hitting the roof.\With just a little attention to some of these features, home-buyers can count on continuing to enjoy life here in the Valley for years to come.\Jeff Gibbs is a former Litchfield Park planning commissioner who now lives in Surprise.

30,"Record-setting drought reduced flows on the Colorado River by nearly 20 percent for the first 15 years of this century, but scientists say drought is not the only reason the water has slowed.\Climate change made a bad situation worse, and points to a sobering future for one of the West's most critical natural resources.\Higher temperatures on the river -- which lead to more evaporation, more use by plants, more water gone -- accounted for the loss of at least a half-million acre-feet of water a year, the scientists said in a study released this week.\That's about the amount of water needed to support 2 million people.\It's the first time researchers have quantified the effect of heat on the river's flow, said Jonathan Overpeck, one of the study's authors and the director of the University of Arizona's Institute of the Environment.\The study's conclusion, Overpeck said: ""Warming alone could cause Colorado River flow declines of 30 percent by midcentury and over 50 percent by the end of the century if greenhouse gas emissions continue unabated.""\Forty million people in seven states and Mexico rely on the Colorado River for water and electricity. It is a significant source of water in Arizona, supplying almost half the demand of metropolitan Phoenix.\For the study, researchers examined conditions on the river from 2000 to 2014, a period marked by one of the worst droughts in modern history. The river's flow during those years declined by 19 percent, about 2.9 million acre-feet per year compared with the long-term average from 1906 to 1999.\At the same time, temperatures in the river's upper basin, where the largest amounts of snow runoff originate, averaged 1.6 degrees higher.\Researchers said the higher temperatures accounted for at least one-sixth of the water losses, or about half a million acre-feet per year. (An acre-foot is enough water to support about two households for one year.)\That was a conservative estimate. The heat's effects could have been much higher, accounting for as much as one-half of the losses, the researchers said.\""The future of Colorado River is far less rosy than other recent assessments have portrayed,"" said Bradley Udall, the study's co-author and a senior water and climate scientist at Colorado State University's Colorado Water Institute. "" A clear message to water managers is that they need to plan for significantly lower river flows.""\Udall and Overpeck looked at climate models for the river basin and found agreement that temperatures are likely to continue to climb if greenhouse-gas emissions remain at current levels. The models were less certain about snow and rain in the basin, Overpeck said.\""Even if the precipitation does increase, our work indicates that there are likely to be drought periods as long as several decades when precipitation will still fall below normal,"" he said.\Udall said current water planning underestimates the potential effects of climate change on future resources.\The study was published in the American Geophysical Union journal Water Resources Research.\By the numbers\1.6 degreesAverage increase in temperature from 2000 to 2014\20 percent Reduction in Colorado River flows between 2000 and 2014\500,000 acre feetEstimated annual water loss from climate change between 2000 and 2014\50 percent Anticipated reduction in flows by 2100 if temperatures continue to rise."

32,"""His basis for decision ultimately will be what's best for the United States.""\Gary Cohn, director of Trump's\National Economic Council\taormina, italy -- Wrapping up his first foreign trip as commander in chief, President Trump left the G-7 summit Saturday amid ongoing international deadlocks on trade, climate change and the fate of a global treaty on restricting heat-trapping carbon emissions.\While the American president and G-7 allies agreed to increase efforts to fight terrorism, Trump, his aides and other world leaders acknowledged ongoing disputes about trade rules and whether the United States should remain part of the historic Paris climate change agreement.\Climate talks in particular were ""very unsatisfactory,"" German Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters.\Trump, who received conflicting advice on climate change from aides, tweeted after the G-7 meetings that ""I will make my final decision on the Paris Accord next week!""\The precise date is uncertain, and he has delayed previous plans to make that announcement.\Speaking later to U.S. military personnel before heading back to Washington, Trump said many countries have ""a large number of disagreements"" with the U.S., but he believes he hit ""a home run"" during his trip.\""We made a lot of good friends this week,"" Trump said.\His voyage began in the Middle East, continued to the Vatican for a meeting with Pope Francis, led to NATO headquarters in Brussels and wound up on the Sicilian coast for the Group of Seven industrial nations summit.\Trump took to Twitter to say that ""lots of very important matters"" were discussed at the G-7, but ""first on the list, of course, is terrorism.""\He also cited pledges by members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to ""step up payments considerably, as they should,"" on their defense budgets.\While some analysts criticized Trump for not endorsing the alliance's mutual defense pledge, the president tweeted that ""money is beginning to pour in - NATO will be much stronger.""\In addition to protesting Trump's views on climate change, Germany and other G-7 members pushed back on Trump's claims that other countries engage in unfair trade practices against the United States.\The back-and-forth ended what European Union President Donald Tusk called ""the most challenging G-7 summit in years.""\Hanging over the president's entire trip: ongoing investigations back home of any links between Trump's campaign last year and Russians who sought to influence the presidential election by hacking Democrats.\Trump and his aides have denied collusion and described the investigations as ""witch hunts.""\While other leaders held traditional post-G-7 news conferences Saturday, Trump did not.\Instead, he spoke to U.S. military personnel at the nearby Naval Air Station Sigonella, from which Air Force One departed.\He was scheduled to return to the White House late Saturday.\Trump focused on terrorism, NATO\Recounting his trip, Trump stressed the need to win the fight against terrorism.\Citing this week's attacks in the United Kingdom and Egypt, Trump said the U.S. is resolved to defeat terrorism, which he called ""a bad threat to all humanity.""\In the Middle East, a more conciliatory Trump praised prospects for new peace talks and urged Muslim leaders to help defeat terrorism; during a more combative visit to Brussels, Trump demanded changes to the U.S. financial relationship with NATO. Both visits drew some criticisms.\During the president's sojourn through Saudi Arabia, Israel and the Palestinian Authority, analyst Aaron David Miller -- a Middle East negotiator in both Republican and Democratic administrations -- said his head ""was spinning"" over Trump's hopes for a peace deal.\""Never has a US President expressed so much confidence in a conflict-ending peace agreement w/so little prospect of success,"" tweeted Miller, vice president with the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.\In Brussels, Trump surprised NATO leaders by avoiding an explicit endorsement of ""Article 5,"" the mutual defense provision of the NATO charter that requires members to regard an attack on one member as an attack on all.\""The president chose instead to alienate our European and Canadian allies by publicly berating them over their defense spending,"" said Kori Schake, a former National Security Council official and now a research fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. ""He's just made it an awful lot easier for allies to refuse anything he ever needs from them.""\Aides said Trump fully supports NATO, noting that he spoke at a memorial dedicated to the invocation of Article 5 after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001.\""It's clear that the president is committed to Article 5 and the alliance,"" National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster said. ""That's why he was there for the leaders' meeting.""\During his speech in Brussels, Trump also demanded that NATO members increase defense spending, arguing that the United States is carrying too much of the financial burden. He echoed those comments to the troops at Naval Air Station Sigonella, saying that ""other nations must pay more"" for common defense.\""We're behind NATO all the way,"" the president said, ""but we want to be treated fairly.""\Despite Trump's suggestions to the contrary, NATO countries do not owe money to the United States; alliance members have agreed to increase their own defense spending to 2% of gross domestic product and say they are making progress toward that goal.\Trip ends without final decision on Paris Accord\At the G-7, held at a hilly seaside village, the issues of terrorism, trade and climate change dominated meetings mostly closed to the press.\European officials have long sought to pressure Trump to stay in the Paris agreement. During their meeting at the Vatican, Pope Francis gave Trump a book he wrote on climate change.\In backing the pact reached in Paris in 2015, supporters say countries should be required to reduce carbon emissions as to way to mitigate the threats of global warming.\While some Trump aides want the U.S. to stay in the Paris framework, other officials say new regulations will hurt the American energy industry, thereby reducing economic growth.\The G-7 was unable to come to a consensus on the topic. The annual G-7 communique -- shorter than usual at only six pages -- said nearly all the members agree on climate change, with one exception: ""The United States of America is in the process of reviewing its policies on climate change and on the Paris Agreement and thus is not in a position to join the consensus on these topics.""\Gary Cohn, director of Trump's National Economic Council, said that Trump's views on climate change are ""evolving"" and that he came to the G-7 ""to learn and get smarter"" ahead of his decision on the Paris deal.\""His basis for decision ultimately will be what's best for the United States,"" he said.\With trade, Trump reportedly criticized the Germans as ""very bad"" on the process and made other complaints about the global trading system during G-7 meetings.\Other countries said they are following mutually agreed upon rules. Merkel pointed out that her country couldn't renegotiate rules with the United States if it wanted to, as Germany is a member of the European Union.\""We have a currency union,"" Merkel said.

33,"washington -- Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt refused to say whether President Trump still believes that climate change is a hoax, one day after the president promised to withdraw from the landmark Paris climate agreement.\Pruitt sidestepped reporters' questions about Trump's views on climate change three times during a White House news conference on Friday.\""The discussions we had, through the last several weeks, have been focused on one singular issue: Is Paris good or not for this country? That's the discussions I've had with the president. So that's been my focus.""\In a highly anticipated announcement from the Rose Garden on Thursday, Trump pledged to pull out of the international agreement to reduce greenhouse gases because it would cost the U.S. millions of jobs -- sparking an outcry from European allies and even some high-profile American business leaders.\While Trump said he would be willing to renegotiate the agreement to be more ""fair"" to the U.S., he has been a longtime critic of climate change, including in a 2012 tweet when he called it a Chinese creation to make the U.S. less competitive.\According to a review by Vox.com, Trump has tweeted climate change skepticism at least 115 times, even accusing scientists of manipulating data.\White House press secretary Sean Spicer also said he did not know the answer to whether Trump believes in climate change. ""I have not had an opportunity to have that discussion. Administrator Pruitt pointed out what the president is focused on is making sure we have clean water, clean air"" and the best deal for U.S. businesses, Spicer added.\Spicer vowed to track down the answer ""if possible.""\During his Thursday announcement on the climate pact, Trump cited statistics from a Massachusetts Institute of Technology report in concluding that the agreement would only reduce emissions by a ""tiny, tiny amount.""\The report's author subsequently said that conclusion shows Trump misunderstood their findings. ""If we don't do anything, we might shoot over 5 degrees or more, and that would be catastrophic,"" said John Reilly, co-director of the MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change.\Pruitt insisted there was additional scientific research backing up Trump's claim that the accord would have a minimal impact on reducing carbon emissions -- without providing examples. ""They didn't have a corner on the market,"" he said of the MIT study. ""There were many at the time,"" and ""we can provide those to you,"" Pruitt said.\Later, Pruitt was asked his own personal opinions about whether global warming is real, and he acknowledged ""global warming is occurring"" and ""human activity contributes to it.""\""The president made a very courageous decision yesterday for America,"" Pruitt said. ""We have nothing to be apologetic about as a country,"" he said, stating that the U.S. has reduced its ""carbon footprint"" to 1990 levels through innovation and technology."
34,"The founders intended the conduct of foreign policy, or ""the intercourse with foreign nations"" as they put it, to be a joint venture between the president and Congress.\The intended role of Congress has atrophied, as illustrated by the uproar over Donald Trump ""withdrawing"" from the Paris Climate Accord and the resolution by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake and Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine authorizing the use of force against terrorist organizations.\Under the constitutional framework vouchsafed by the founders, Trump could not ""withdraw"" from the Paris Climate Accord because the United States had never actually joined it to begin with.\The Constitution gives the president wide authority to manage foreign policy without congressional interference. But the president doesn't have unilateral authority to bind the United States. That requires a treaty ratified by two-thirds of the members of the U.S. Senate.\President Barack Obama never submitted the Paris Climate Accord to the Senate for approval. As Bill Clinton failed to do for the accord's predecessor, the Kyoto Protocol.\Neither would have obtained the two-thirds approval required by the Constitution. The Wall Street Journal editorialists mischievously suggested that Trump actually submit the Paris Accord to the Senate for ratification, to watch Democrats from energy-producing states, many of whom are up for re-election, squirm.\After the 9/11 attacks, Congress authorized the use of force against al-Qaida, affiliates and anyone else implicated in them. Today, that authorization has been used to justify military action in 14 countries, and against terrorist organizations that didn't exist in 2001 and are themselves engaged in armed conflict with al-Qaida.\The Constitution gives Congress the responsibility to declare war. Flake and Kaine believe, correctly, that Congress is shirking this responsibility. So, they have crafted a new authorization of force against terrorist organizations.\These are fundamental elements of the separation of powers in our constitutional system of government. Presidents were to have a generally free hand in the management of foreign relations and the conduct of military hostilities. But Congress was to make the final decision about binding international commitments or engaging in military action.\These fundamentals shouldn't be ignored or washed away through semantic games, such as deeming the Paris Accord not a ""treaty"" or arguing that dropping bombs and killing combatants through drone attacks doesn't constitute a ""war"" against Islamic State.\Nor through legal pettifogging, such as claiming that the Paris Accord simply flows from a previously approved treaty or that, somehow, Islamic State is a derivative of al-Qaida.\Simply put, the founders didn't intend for a president to have the authority to commit to other countries to restructure the domestic energy sector without explicit approval of two-thirds of the U.S. Senate. Or to engage in combat without the explicit authorization of Congress. A constitution establishing such a presidency never would have been ratified.\Concern for the constitutional order should supersede specific issues.\I don't think the United States should ignore climate change. I continue to believe that a small carbon tax is the most appropriate step given what is known, and what remains unknown.\And, in reality, the United States will achieve most of the Obama commitment in the Paris Accord through the continued substitution of natural gas for coal through market mechanisms. The uproar is mostly over symbolism.\While I believe that Flake and Kaine are right about the appropriateness of a new authorization of force resolution, their approach doesn't really fit the protean nature of the terrorism that threatens us.\The Flake-Kaine resolution identifies specific groups to target and specific countries in which combat can take place.\It then provides a process by which the president can add groups and countries, subject to the disapproval of Congress. That's a geographic specific approach to a transnational threat.\The important point, however, is that the role of Congress in climate change and fighting terrorism shouldn't be ignored or sidestepped.\Sadly, the views of the two major political parties about the authority that should be vested in the president depends on whether they currently occupy it.\The founders had a longer view. They regarded the separation of powers they established for ""intercourse with foreign nations"" as indispensible to ordered liberty at home.\Reach Robb at robert.robb@arizonarepublic.com."
35,"On June 1, President Trump announced his decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord, an international agreement aimed at helping countries reduce the effects of climate change.\It was a devastating blow for former vice president Al Gore, a tireless environmental activist who drew heat for his Oscar-winning global-warming documentary An Inconvenient Truth in 2006. He's back with its follow-up, An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power (in theaters Friday in New York and Los Angeles, expands nationwide Aug. 4), which premiered at Sundance Film Festival in January to respectable reviews.\Despite having several conversations with the president, Gore has been unable to sway Trump, who has called global warming an ""expensive hoax.""\""I tried as hard as I could, and even though hope springs eternal, I don't think there's any realistic prospect of Donald Trump coming to his senses on climate,"" Gore says. ""I would love to be proven wrong, but I'm not going to hold my breath. We'll just have to work around him.""\Like Truth, Sequel is loosely framed around a presentation Gore gives to environmental activists-in-training, listing findings about climate-related weather events and touting alternatives to burning fossil fuels. But the documentary also moves into the real world, as filmmaking duo Bonni Cohen and Jon Shenk follow Gore across the globe as he meets with political leaders and typhoon survivors, and attends the United Nations' climate-change summit in Paris in 2015.\""For so long, it was very difficult for people in the environmental movement to personalize the issue and make it immediate for people's everyday lives,"" Shenk says. ""As storytellers, we had an 'aha' moment of 'If we tell the stories of people who are actually suffering and dealing with the front-line issues of climate change, then it could be film drama.'""\It was jarring at first for the politician to be shadowed so closely.\""It does take a little adjusting to have them following your every move practically for two years,"" Gore says.\With the sequel, Gore wanted to show what's changed, both good and bad, in the decade since Truth. At the original film's release, he was criticized for using a simulation depicting the flooding of lower Manhattan to illustrate how cities could feel the effects of rising sea levels. That came to pass in 2012, when the World Trade Center memorial was underwater during Hurricane Sandy.\But Gore has reason to be optimistic. As shown in the film, Georgetown, Texas, is one of the first cities in America to be 100% powered by renewable energy, with others such as Atlanta and Pittsburgh pledging to follow suit.\""The will to survive is itself a renewable resource,"" Gore says. ""With Mother Nature playing an increasingly prominent role in the discussions about the climate, more and more people are realizing if the president won't lead, the American people must.""\movies"
36,"It's almost unheard of in Washington: Renewable-energy legislation with support from both parties. Yet, on July 26, legislation passed through markup in the House Natural Resources Committee that will help create clean, renewable energy and local jobs in the West.\The Public Land Renewable Development Act has been bouncing around Congress for several years, and it may finally have the momentum it needs to pass. PLREDA will provide significant renewable energy development opportunities for Arizona and other states in the West that have an abundance of public lands.\For the past few years, stakeholders in Arizona and the West have been working to encourage siting of large-scale renewable-energy generation and transmission on public lands through regional and statewide planning processes like the Western Solar Plan and Arizona's Restoration Design Energy Project. Now it is time to provide a more comprehensive suite of incentives that allow communities throughout the West to benefit from renewable energy resources.\Passage of PLREDA will have a number of benefits for communities in Arizona and the West:\Revenue for local communities. The new revenue-distribution formula will provide economic value to states and counties from leasing and royalty revenue to reward the implementation of a thoughtful and robust renewable energy industry on public lands.\New conservation and recreation opportunities. PLREDA will establish a conservation fund, fed by revenues from renewable energy projects on public lands, which will protect natural resources and create valuable outdoor recreation opportunities.\Priority areas for development. By selecting areas that are best suited to renewable energy projects, similar to the successful Western Solar Plan, PLREDA will allow permitting and planning to be expedited, and environmental impacts to be minimized.\Accountability. The requirement for periodic review of energy policy will track success and address challenges to the implementation of a renewable energy industry.\In an era that has been characterized by significant division over the value and benefit of publicly owned lands in the West, this bipartisan legislation is like an ice-cold glass of water on a 115-degree August Arizona afternoon. The House version of the bill, HR 825, enjoys 38 cosponsors, 15 of whom are Republicans, while the Senate version, S 1407, has seven co-sponsors, four of whom are Democrats. Arizonans should be proud that Reps. Andy Biggs, Trent Franks, Raúl Grijalva, David Schweikert, and Kyrsten Sinema have joined Rep. Paul Gosar in moving this legislation forward.\The bill has seen tremendous support across the West from a wide variety of stakeholders, including sportsmen and conservation groups, and could usher in a new sustainable economy of well-planned and locally supported energy development.\The future of Arizona and the West relies on a thoughtful and robust renewable-energy industry in order to take advantage of nearby resources, respond to threatening drought conditions and promote sustainable economic opportunities.\The bipartisan Public Land Renewable Energy Development Act is an essential step in moving our nation in the right direction. Please join us in urging its expeditious passage.\Ian Dowdy is a certified urban planner and director of the Sun Corridor program at Tucson-based Sonoran Institute.

37,"Millions of dollars in renewable energy projects intended to provide power to facilities in California's national parks and forests are sitting idle because of a years-long squabble with Southern California Edison.\A new $800,000 solar project at Death Valley National Park, photovoltaic panels at the state-of-the art visitors center at Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area and a solar power system at the U.S. Forest Service's new facility at Mono Lake are among dozens of taxpayer-funded projects across California on hold as the federal agencies try to hash out an agreement with SCE to tie the projects to the state's electrical grid.\The apparent stumbling block involves contract restrictions imposed by federal law, but utilities elsewhere in California have signed similar agreements with the agencies with few problems or delays.\""There's 24-plus systems in the Southern California Edison area that have been installed in the last three years that we have not been able to negotiate an interconnection agreement on,"" said Jack Williams, who retired this month as the National Park Service's Oakland-based regional facilities manager. ""We think we are close at times, but then nothing. We were successful with PG&E, but with Southern California Edison.... They have been a bit more difficult. We've raised the flag many times. It's an issue for all federal agencies.""\An Edison spokesman declined to discuss the projects, citing ongoing negotiations.\The impasse has hindered the parks' ability to meet renewable energy goals at a time when federal agencies are rushing to comply with orders to reduce carbon footprints. Equally troubling, officials say, is the financial fallout: a projected saving of tens of thousands of dollars from utility bills hasn't been realized during the two years the park and forest services have been negotiating with Edison.\Parks officials at Death Valley had hoped the newly renovated visitors center would pare an estimated $31,828 from an annual electric bill of $45,724, a 70% drop in energy cost. At the Santa Monica Mountains, a solar plant designed to power a dormitory has been offline since October 2010.\""It is disappointing to see this big investment sitting idle when we could easily flip the switch and produce benefits,"" said park superintendent Woody Smeck, who called himself ""an administrator here trying to do the right thing.""\""We are purchasing electricity from SCE, whereas we could be using renewable energy from the sun and returning power to the grid. Until we can get the interconnection agreement approved, the switch is off and we can't benefit.""\The stalemate is also affecting the Veterans Administration and the Department of the Navy, which require interconnection agreements or power purchase agreements with the regional utility. Gov. Jerry Brown's office has dispatched Michael Picker, the governor's advisor on renewable energy, to meet with all the parties in coming weeks to hammer out differences.\Federal agencies generally may not sign contracts that would leave them liable for unknown future damages because they would be committing money that Congress hasn't allocated. In some instances, government departments use contracts based on the federal torts process, the legal mechanism to bring liability claims against the government. But so far, the federal agencies have been unable to get SCE to agree to such contract provisions.\The forest service said it has been trying to draft an agreement using a standard U.S. General Services Administration utility contract, but that approach has not gained any traction.\In addition to the Mono Lake project, the forest service has been waiting for a year to connect its solar panels at the San Dimas Technology and Development Center, which houses the agency's top engineering and development center for wilderness firefighting equipment. The solar plant there would be subject to rebates for the excess power it generates, officials said.\If any national park can make solar power work, it would be Death Valley, one of the world's sunniest and hottest landscapes. But superintendent Sarah L. Craighead said the park's solar projects have been unplugged since she took the job 21/2 years ago.\""We have been trying to get these agreements in place for quite some time. Everything is just sitting in the queue. Some panels were put up as part of the stimulus package,"" she said, referring to the economic initiative begun in the early days of the Obama administration.\Craighead said attorneys in the Interior Department's solicitor's office had been called on to help resolve the issue.\""We want to turn these things on,"" she said.\Although Death Valley's solar projects have not been able to get connected, the park's concessionaire has managed to install a one-megawatt photovoltaic plant that will provide one-third of the power needed to run the park's hotels, restaurants, golf course, offices and employee housing.\Pacific Gas & Electric last summer connected Yosemite's $5.8-million photovoltaic project at El Portal. The project was completed in February 2011, and the park signed the interconnection agreement four months later.\The 2,800 solar panels should produce approximately 800,000 kilowatt-hours per year. Yosemite officials estimate the system will save $50,000 per year on electricity bills and generate an energy rebate of $700,000 from PG&E over the next five years.\--\julie.cart@latimes.com"
38,"In the 1970s it seemed like we had problems we could never fix -- and I'm not talking about white polyester disco suits and the band Air Supply. The '70s presented America with the residue of a catastrophic war, soaring inner-city crime rates, runaway inflation and subjugation to Middle East oil. To punctuate the dismal vibe, everybody smoked, or so it seemed if you were sitting on an airplane at the edge of the DMZ between the smoking and nonsmoking sections, gagging and hacking as the guy a foot away from you chain-smoked filterless Camels.\The very idea that an airplane could have a ""nonsmoking section"" any more than a tear-gas chamber could have a ""no cry"" zone encapsulates the cynicism and malaise of that time. It seemed as though we were stuck with systemic problems we could never solve. Which may explain why we wore the disco suits.\But then something funny happened. We tackled those problems.\A move toward more fuel-efficient vehicles, plus Alaskan oil and geopolitical changes, gave us a breather from the tyranny of oil. Slowly we began reviving our inner cities and battling crime. We got out of Vietnam and created military doctrines to prevent such things from happening again (at least in theory). And most emblematic, we made huge strides in kicking a habit that had been part of human culture for centuries: smoking.\How'd we do it? The answer is worth considering as we struggle with a problem even harder to solve but with many similarities: climate change. In this case, we're addicted to consuming the Earth's fossil fuels in a way that's not just deadly to individuals but to the whole planet.\There are limits to the parallels between smoking and climate change, of course. People can live quite well without smoking, while society does need to consume energy -- even if not in the amounts it now does or from such damaging sources. But there are nevertheless ways in which our experience with tobacco can help us grapple with the overwhelming problem of climate change.\First, let's examine some of the ironies here. As Naomi Oreskes and Erik Conway point out in their book ""The Merchants of Doubt,"" the fossil fuel industry and the hard right have used the same tactics as the tobacco industry to seed doubt about the danger of climate change. In fact, they've often used the same people and institutions to deliver that message. Although that's depressing (fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me), it's also hopeful, because we beat tobacco -- or at least we're winning, with smoking rates having dropped from 45% of the population in 1954 to less than 20% today.\First, we implemented policy solutions. The ""sin taxes"" levied on tobacco in most states made it increasingly difficult to afford the habit and created incentives to quit. Yes, those were regressive taxes, but some of the tax revenue has been used to support health and smoking-cessation programs.\Second, we used the courts to take on tobacco for willfully and knowingly hurting people. And we started to win those lawsuits.\Third, we changed cultural norms through advertising, in many cases funded through tobacco taxes.\And fourth, we embraced real, third-party, arbitrated science, blessed with the imprimatur of the U.S. surgeon general, as a tool for moving public policy forward.\And we won, even though nobody on an airplane in 1975 would have thought it possible. So let's consider how we might apply those same techniques to solving climate change.\For starters, a revenue-neutral carbon tax could serve as a market mechanism to not only incentivize efficiency and clean energy but also as a way to create a free market for the first time, one that puts a price on the external costs of carbon. Even Canada's oil-rich Alberta has such a tax. Such levies encourage efficiencies because reducing emissions leads to lower taxes.\As to legal action, we are already seeing a burgeoning movement to use the courts to hold polluters accountable for the harm they have done -- and continue to do -- to the air, the climate and our health. ""Atmospheric trust litigation"" calls on the judicial branches of governments to force emissions cuts based on their fiduciary responsibility to protect the public trust.\NASA climatologist James Hansen recently filed a statement to a British court in support of an effort seeking to disclose who is funding the Global Warming Policy Foundation, a London-based climate skeptic think tank. Meanwhile, there is a growing conversation about who is liable for climate change. Businesses, shareholders and insurance companies are taking notice.\We are also slowly but surely chipping away at cultural norms with advertising and other media. The movie ""An Inconvenient Truth"" was a watershed in this effort, but many other examples abound. The Prius has been marketed as not only energy-efficient but also cool. Marketing leaders, like Alex Bogusky of VW ad fame, are turning their energies toward getting people to think about climate. A good maxim is that when a social debate reaches a charged state at the dinner table, the battle is nearly won. Think about civil and gay rights.\Last, science is slowly but surely taking back the game. When the Wall Street Journal published a series of baseless lies about climate change in January, it was debunked rapidly and widely by third-party groups such as the Union of Concerned Scientists. Other science arbiters, such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the National Academy of Sciences, have also made overwhelmingly clear the need for action.\Sure, there's a long way to go. Denial is rampant, and the money behind the effort to delay action is as plentiful as civilization has ever known. But one only need recall the despair of the ""nonsmoking"" section of an airplane to remember that often sea change laps at the edges of convention. It really is darkest just before the dawn.\We've come a long way, baby. But we've got a bit further to go, and the path forward is illuminated by the soft glow of cigarettes.\Credit: Auden Schendler is the author of ""Getting Green Done and a board member of Protect Our Winters."
39,"Last week, NASA announced that 97% of Greenland's vast ice sheet had undergone at least some surface melting this summer, compared with a normal melt area of about 50%. The 2012 figure, said the headline on the space agency's press release, was ""unprecedented.""\That's a powerful word in any context, but it's especially so when you're talking about the politically charged topic of climate change. If the melting was unprecedented, it would reinforce the idea that scientists are right about the dangers of human-generated greenhouse gases, and at the same time make it harder for skeptics to take potshots at the science.\The skeptics were naturally delighted, therefore, when it turned out that such widespread melting is anything but unprecedented. It happened most recently in 1889, and it happens, on average, every 150 years or so. This summer's surface melt has very likely been influenced by global warming, but it might have happened anyway. The same goes for the heat waves that have pummeled large parts of the nation this summer and the drought that's now destroying crops in the Midwest.\The drama and the hype -- alarmist headlines, crowing skeptics, backtracking scientists (or at least, publicists) and a confused public -- made me crazy. With one poorly chosen word, climate-change skeptics were handed an opportunity to sow more doubt and confusion about global warming.\I work at Climate Central, a nonprofit, nonpartisan research and news organization, and a good part of my work is dedicated to putting an end to just that sequence of events. Our central mission is communicating to a general audience what the science is and what it is not.\For the record: The science clearly shows that climate is changing largely as a result of greenhouse gas emissions. The science is equally clear that without rapid and drastic cutbacks in greenhouse gas emissions, the changes are likely to threaten life, property and Earth's biosphere in all sorts of ways -- including melting glaciers and worsening weather crises -- by the end of century, and in many cases, much sooner. In fact, some of these changes are already happening.\But there is a lot science doesn't know as well, especially what the link might be (if any) between climate change and specific events. It doesn't know for certain what the future holds for, say, hurricanes. (The tentative conclusion: These storms could become fewer but more powerful.) It can't say precisely how high sea level will rise, or how fast.\And there are outliers, scientists with (and sometimes without) legit credentials who doubt the mainstream conclusions. Yes, scientific ""facts"" are mutable: As data accumulate, knowledge changes. But just because science adjusts itself to new information (or because outliers invariably exist), it doesn't make the mainstream wrong.\I'm not a scientist; I'm a science journalist. I translate the arcane terminology of experiments, data and theories into everyday English. In the current climate of global warming doubt -- in which any uncertainty is used to discredit mountains of confirming data, where even a typo might promote misunderstanding -- the job can be a minefield.\I just co-wrote a climate-change primer for Climate Central: 60 simple, bite-size dispassionate chapters about what scientists know on the topic, no more, no less. Accuracy is always the appropriate goal for a journalist, but for ""Global Weirdness,"" we were hypervigilant.\Each chapter was reviewed, down to the comma, by at least one of Climate Central's doctorate-level staff scientists, and revised based on their critiques. Each chapter was then re-reviewed by at least one scientist outside our organization, drawn from a list of the world's most eminent experts, and revised again.\It was something like the peer review process that scrutinizes scientific findings before they are published. No writer (and no scientist) particularly likes to have his or her work picked apart in this manner, but it's the best way we know to get things right.\This doesn't mean our work won't come under criticism. The very fact that we take mainstream climate science seriously will paint us as partisan hacks in the eyes of those who insist the whole thing is a scam, and that includes some scientists with doctorates of their own. And we'll no doubt also be criticized by those who think we aren't scaring people enough. Without fear, they believe, people might not take action.\Who knows, the fear pushers might be right. But as convinced as I am that limiting greenhouse gases is important, I'm grateful for every time a critical scientist or editor has stopped me from making an ""unprecedented"" error.\In the end our best hope is sticking with the science as it is, not as any one person or cause wishes it might be.\After all, the truth is scary enough.\Michael D.

40,"Argument has raged for decades over what doomed the ancient Maya civilization and spurred its people to abandon their awe-inspiring temples and pyramids in the rain forests of Mexico and Central America. Warfare, disease, social unrest and over-farming have all been cited as potential factors in the decline of a culture that was scientifically and culturally advanced for 750 years.\A new study bolsters the theory that large-scale climate change was responsible for the society's demise -- and argues that changes in global weather patterns were also responsible for its rapid rise.\Using data from a 13,500-year-old stalagmite taken from the floor of a recently discovered cave in Belize, scientists said they were able to assemble a precise record of rainfall for the region going back 2,000 years.\The ancient cave spire was created by rainwater as it leaked from the ceiling of Yok Balum cave and deposited dissolved minerals in a growing mass on its floor, drip by drip. By examining the ratio of atomic isotopes along the length of the stalagmite, researchers said, they were able to determine when portions of it formed and how much rainwater fell during each six-month period.\What they discovered was a period of abundant rainfall during the early days of the civilization, followed eventually by drought. The results were published in the Nov. 9 edition of the journal Science.\""Unusually high amounts of rainfall favored an increase in food production and an explosion in the population"" beginning around AD 440, said study leader Douglas J. Kennett, an anthropologist at Penn State University. ""This led to the proliferation of cities like Tikal, Copan and Caracol across the Maya lowlands.""\By AD 700, that wet weather gave way to a ""general drying trend that lasted four centuries and was punctuated by a series of major droughts,"" he said. ""That triggered a decline in agricultural productivity and contributed to societal fragmentation and political collapse.... Maya kings lost their power and influence.""\Researchers said the severe drought the Maya experienced was akin to the one that devastated Mexico in the 16th century and brought crop failure, famine and death. Kennett said such circumstances probably visited the Maya during their classic period, which lasted from AD 250 to 1000.\Though the study adds valuable detail to the ancient climate record, other Maya researchers said it was unlikely to end debate on the issue.\Boston University archaeologist William Saturno said he remained unconvinced that climate change was the primary driver of the civilization's collapse.\The worst period of drought detailed in the report was in Belize 100 to 300 years after the time Maya in that region stopped inscribing major monuments and essentially ""went dark"" as a culture, Saturno said. He called it a mistake to believe that drought in one area affected all areas of Maya civilization, which also covered parts of what is now southern Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras.\Saturno said he believed the growing popularity of climate change theory in Maya studies was based on worries about modern-day global warming.\""Oftentimes, we're look- ing at ancient societies as an analogue to our own,"" he said. ""We want to drive home the point: If we destroy the environment, we'll reach a point where we can't recover.""\The authors of the study wrote that the prolonged drying trend triggered balkanization and fueled brutal warfare. Saturno said he doubted it led to war but that it could well have undermined the Maya leadership.\""If you have a guy who controls the rain, you might agree to build pyramids in his honor,"" he said. ""But if the rains don't come, you might start to say, 'Wait a minute -- this guy doesn't really control the rain.' ""\--\monte.morin@latimes.com"
41,"Activist investors have succeeded for the first time in placing a shareholder resolution on the risks of greenhouse-gas emissions up for a vote at a major bank, a step toward making climate change an important consideration for corporations.\The resolution, which follows years of protests over banks financing certain coal operations, is to be included in proxy material being sent to shareholders of PNC Financial Services Group of Pittsburgh before the bank's April 23 annual meeting.\It asks PNC to assess and report back to shareholders on how its lending results in greenhouse gas emissions that can alter the climate, posing financial risks for its corporate borrowers and risks to its own reputation.\PNC is the only major bank based in Appalachia, a region where coal and gas extraction is a major business. It has long lent to mining companies, including those engaged in mountaintop removal, which involves blowing up peaks to reach coal seams below and has been blamed for degrading landscapes, destroying habitat and polluting streams.\In recent years, PNC has cultivated an environmentally friendly image, building energy-conserving branches, making loans for solar projects and offering incentives to small businesses to protect the environment.\The backers of the resolution said, however, that PNC had offered only vague responses to the risks posed by climate change. What's more, they said, the bank reneged on a promise made in 2011 not to extend credit to individual mountaintop removal projects or to mining companies that receive the bulk of their production from the controversial process.\""As a result, it is the focus of a consumer boycott,"" the shareholder resolution says, adding: ""PNC has ignored investors' requests to provide information detailing its [mountaintop removal] policy implementation or the lending impacts of this policy.""\PNC spokesman Frederick Solomon declined to comment on the resolution, saying the bank's board would respond in due time.\The sponsors of the resolution include Quaker and Roman Catholic groups and mutual funds focused on investments they deem to be socially responsible, including Domini Social Investments, Walden Asset Management and Boston Common Asset Management.\In the mid-2000s, the Securities and Exchange Commission excluded similar resolutions at banks and insurers, holding that they concerned ""ordinary business"" at the financial firms, said Meredith Benton, a portfolio manager at Boston Common.\But in 2010 the SEC issued guidance saying corporations should disclose to shareholders the potential effect of climate change on their business and their strategies for dealing with the risks. The agency said the issue had become a topic of intense public discussion and a target for national and international regulation.\As this year's annual meeting season approaches, numerous corporations have shareholder resolutions focusing on sustainability and climate change, along with hot-button social and environmental topics such as sexual orientation, lobbying and political contributions and genetically modified food ingredients.\But most other companies facing climate change resolutions this year are directly involved with carbon energy production: oil giants Chevron Corp. and Exxon Mobil Corp. and coal producer Alpha Natural Resources Inc.\PNC had asked the SEC to bar the climate change resolution on grounds that lending and investing were part of its day-to-day business, but the SEC declined.\""In arriving at this position, we note that the proposal focuses on the significant policy issue of climate change,"" the SEC said in a letter to George P. Long III, PNC's chief governance lawyer. ""Accordingly, we do not believe that PNC may omit the proposal from its proxy materials.""\SEC spokesman John Nester said the decision does not mean every financial company must consider the issue of climate change. The ruling was based on the particular facts of PNC's case, he said, including the nature of the bank's lending criteria and public statements, which demonstrated a ""meaningful relationship"" between climate change and its operations.\Many activist stockholders have become less confrontational over the years, holding discussions with corporations over social and economic issues instead of filing shareholder resolutions, said Laura Berry, executive director of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility in New York.\The center, a 41-year-old coalition of activist investors, said its members have filed 180 shareholder resolutions while engaging in 225 ""corporate dialogues"" this proxy season.\""Filing a proposal can appear to be confrontational and can lead to all sorts of interactions -- some more effective than others,"" Berry said. ""Withdrawing a proposal is often viewed as a sign progress is being made.""\In the case of climate change and banks, that potentially could take place -- not at PNC but at JPMorgan Chase & Co., said Benton, the Boston Common portfolio manager.\The sponsors of the PNC resolution have proposed a similar shareholder vote at JPMorgan Chase but may withdraw it after discussions with a team of employees focused on climate change at the New York bank ""who have real chops and are working on these issues,"" Benton said.\By contrast, she said, discussions with PNC turned up no evidence of a ""holistic response"" to climate change issues. And despite the bank's pledge to cut back lending for mountaintop removal projects, she said, ""they haven't changed their practices in any way.""\--\scott.reckard@latimes.com"
42,"Hurricane Sandy has come and gone, so it might seem crazy that New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg recently announced a $20-billion proposal to construct levees and shore up hospitals to protect his city from storms and rising seas. All government leaders should be so crazy. Though the need to adopt policies that sharply curb carbon emissions remains as important as ever, there also are unmistakable signs that decades of inaction on climate change are shaping the present, not just the future. A national task force convened in 2009 has outlined many of the ways in which governments must adapt to and cope with climate change, but Bloomberg is one of the very few to do something concrete about it.\Early predictions made by climate scientists -- back when much of the nation was still dubious about any kind of greenhouse effect and many denied it existed -- are coming true even more quickly than expected. Although no single weather event can be laid at the door of global warming, more extreme weather throughout the nation, such as tornadoes in the Midwest and hurricanes in the Northeast, already is upon us, as are worsening dryness and fire seasons in the West.\Not all of the effects of climate change are expected to be negative. Certain warm-weather crops will grow in states that were once considered too cold, scientists say. But even those will demand adjustments. Farmers who shift from one crop to another, for instance, will be forced to learn new techniques and make new investments in equipment.\All of this requires first admitting reality, then planning for it and investing in the infrastructure needed to protect against the worst effects and take advantage of the new possibilities.\These might be as sweeping as planning out sources of water for the West -- including desalination plants and more recycling and required efficiency in water use -- or as specific as a community identifying cooled buildings where the elderly and other fragile people can go during prolonged hot spells and providing transportation to get them there. It might also include planning for crop losses and other flood-related damage in the Northeast, where precipitation has increased 67% over the past 50 years, or building levees and drainage.\Expensive? Very. But the price of doing nothing would be far greater. And that's worth remembering when President Obama releases his expected proposal for reducing the carbon footprint, which will almost surely include new restrictions for coal-burning plants, the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases. Adjusting to climate change will require clear thinking and significant investment, but if the nation sticks its collective head in the sand, it will find that sand covered by rising seas."
43,"Scientists in the West have a particular way of walking a landscape and divining its secrets: They kick a toe into loamy soil or drag a boot heel across the desert's crust, leaning down to squint at the tiny excavation.\Try that maneuver in New Mexico these days and it yields nothing but bad news in a puff of dust.\Across the West, changes in the climate are taking a toll. Almost 87% of the region is in a drought.\Nevada is removing wild horses and stocks of cattle from federal rangelands, Wyoming is seeding clouds as part of a long-term ""weather modification program,"" officials in Colorado say the state's southeastern plains are experiencing Dust Bowl conditions, and the entire western U.S. has been beset by more frequent and ferocious wildfires across an ever-more combustible landscape.\But nowhere is it worse than in New Mexico. In this parched state, the question is no longer how much worse it can get but whether it will ever get better -- and, ominously, whether collapsing ecosystems can recover even if it does.\The statistics are sobering: All of New Mexico is officially in a drought, and three-quarters of it is categorized as severe or exceptional. Reservoir storage statewide is 17% of normal, lowest in the West. Residents of some towns subsist on trucked-in water. Others are drilling deep wells costing $100,000 or more to sink and still more to operate.\Wildlife managers are hauling water to elk herds in the mountains and blaming the drought for the unusually high number of deer and antelope killed on New Mexico's highways, surmising that the animals are taking greater risks to find water.\Thousands of Albuquerque's trees have died as homeowners under water restrictions can't afford to water them, and in the state's agricultural belt, low yields and crop failures are the norm. Livestock levels in many areas are about one-fifth of normal, and panicked ranchers face paying inflated prices for hay or moving or selling their herds.\The last three years have been the driest and warmest since record-keeping began here in 1895. Chuck Jones, a senior meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Albuquerque, said even the state's recent above-average monsoon rains ""won't make a dent"" in the drought; deficits will require several years of normal rainfall to erase, should normal rain ever arrive.\With water supplies at the breaking point and no relief in sight, a domino-effect water war has broken out, which might be a harbinger of the West's future. Texas has filed suit, arguing that groundwater pumping in New Mexico is reducing Texas' share of the Rio Grande. Oklahoma has successfully fended off a legal challenge from Texas over water from the Red River.\New Mexico's stretch of the once-mighty Rio Grande is so dewatered that, sadly but aptly, it is referred to as the ""Rio Sand.""\The question many are grappling with is whether the changes are a permanent result of climate change or part of cyclical weather cycle. Jones, a member of the governor's drought task force, is cautious about identifying three years of extreme drought as representing a new climate pattern for New Mexico. It could be a multi-year aberration.\Nonetheless, most long-term plans put together by cattle ranchers, farmers and land managers include the probability that the drought is here to stay.\John Clayshulte, a third-generation rancher and farmer near Las Cruces, removed all his cattle from his federal grazing allotment. ""There's just not any sense putting cows on there. There's not enough for them to eat,"" he said.\""It's all changed. This used to be shortgrass prairies. We've ruined it and it's never going to come back.""\Kris Havstad punched his boot into the sunbaked ground and grunted. Havstad, a range expert with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, joined a group of other biologists and land managers on a recent tour of government rangeland north of Las Cruces.\Federal scientists are grimly watching a rare ecological phenomenon unfold here, a catastrophic alteration known as ""state change"" -- the collapse of the vast Chihuahuan Desert grasslands ecosystem and its transformation into a sandy, scrub desert affording little forage for wildlife or livestock.\Carpeting the landscape in lush waves, Black Grama grass had long been the signature of the 140,000-square-mile Chihuahuan Desert. But overgrazing and persistent drought have hit hard here, reducing the grass to small, stiff tufts, sparsely spaced.\The 10,000-year-old desert is changing, scientists say. Grasses are in a cycle of collapse, overwhelmed by hardy and long-lived shrubs such as mesquite and creosote.\Havstad picks at a mesquite seed pod, noting that absent any grass, hungry livestock are consuming them. ""They are not terribly nutritious,"" he said. ""It's like being the last one at the buffet and the only thing left is snow peas.""\With only shrubs available to eat, the land is losing its ability to feed the cattle that graze here. So little grass remains that a square mile -- 640 acres -- can sustain just three to five cows in current conditions. A healthy desert can handle five times as many.\This federal land and the adjacent Jornada Experimental Range offer a trove of data for climate study. The research station has kept monthly precipitation data since 1915, and the federal Bureau of Land Management has historical photographs of plots throughout the region that provide a time-lapse map of change.\In one spot, a photograph dating to the 1960s shows a lush grassy square. As the group of scientists flips through the pictures, over time the plot becomes stripped of vegetation.\Jim McCormick is the Bureau of Land Management's assistant district manager for the area. He said his staff had spent time and prodigious sums of money in a program to help the land recover from a century of harsh climate and cattle grazing.\""Then came the drought to undo all our work,"" he said.\The bureau oversees much of the region, which includes one of the largest public grazing areas in the country. The agency has asked ranchers to remove their cattle from a number of pastures for a year or two to allow the land to rest. In many cases, officials say, ranchers are taking their livestock off voluntarily.\But not all the damage can be blamed on cattle; nor can simply removing them heal the landscape. An altered climate is now the biggest driver pushing the landscape-wide alterations taking place across the West.\""In the old days, we used to think if we built a fence around it, it will be OK,"" said Brandon Bestelmeyer, who conducts research on the Jornada for the Department of Agriculture. ""That thinking didn't take into account climate change. These kind of state changes are catastrophic changes. They can be irreversible.""\As vegetation dies off and the process of desertification accelerates, Bestelmeyer said, the Chihuahuan Desert will expand. As Western cities continue their march into wildlands, the growing desert and the sprawling suburbs are on a collision course.\Bestelmeyer, a landscape ecologist, describes what's at stake: ""If we lose the grasslands, grazing is over, and the generations of people who depend on grazing will lose their livelihoods.""\Biodiversity will decline as wildlife and bird species move away or die off. Moreover, a denuded landscape loses its ability to transport water to recharge aquifers, a crucial resource in the desert.\Finally, he said, without vegetation to hold soils in place, dust and sand will be on the move and encroach onto roads, crops, homes and businesses.\""You don't want a Sahara here,"" Bestelmeyer said.\--\julie.cart@latimes.com"
44,"Correction: Tuesday, October 01, 2013: Climate change: An article in the Sept. 28 Section A about a warning issued by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said scientists predict that a global warming threshold will be reached after 1 trillion tons of carbon dioxide are emitted into the atmosphere. It should have said 1 trillion metric tons of carbon.\The world's leading climate scientists have for the first time established a limit on the amount of greenhouse gases that can be released before the Earth reaches a tipping point and predicted that it will be surpassed within decades unless swift action is taken to curb the current pace of emissions.\The warning was issued Friday by a panel of U.N.-appointed climate change experts meeting in Stockholm.\The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimated that once a total of 1 trillion tons of carbon dioxide are emitted into atmosphere, the planet will exceed 3.6 degrees of warming, the internationally agreed-upon threshold to the worst effects of climate change.\""We've burned through half that amount"" since preindustrial times, Michael Oppenheimer, a professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton University who reviewed the report and is a co-author of the panel's upcoming report on the effect of climate change, said in an interview. ""Because the rates of emissions are growing, it looks like we could burn through the other half in the next 25 years"" under one of the more dire scenarios outlined in the report.\Other scenarios show that the threshold will be reached later this century.\The finding constitutes a warning to governments to cut emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, which is generated by the burning of fossil fuels, industrial activity and deforestation.\Calling climate change ""the greatest challenge of our time,"" panel co-chair Thomas Stocker said humankind's fate in the next 100 years ""depends crucially on how much carbon dioxide will be emitted in the future.""\In the report, the panel said it is 95% certain that human activity is the dominant cause of the global warming observed since the 1950s. That is up from 90% six years ago.\""Human influence has been detected in warming of the atmosphere and the ocean, in changes in the global water cycle, in reductions in snow and ice, in global mean sea level rise, and in changes in some climate extremes,"" the report said.\The report is the panel's fifth major assessment since 1990. It reaffirms many of the conclusions of past reports, but with greater confidence.\""The atmosphere and ocean have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, sea level has risen and the concentrations of greenhouse gases have increased,"" the panel wrote in a 36-page summary of its findings, released Friday. ""Each of the last three decades has been successively warmer at the Earth's surface than any preceding decade since 1850.""\The panel's full 2,500-page report will be published Monday.\The report also addressed the so-called hiatus, a slowdown in the rise of surface temperature that has been observed over the last 15 years. That slowing of the increase in temperatures has been seized on by skeptics to cast doubt on the science of climate change.\The report touches the subject only briefly, saying that temperatures fluctuate naturally in the short term and ""do not in general reflect long-term climate trends.""\Brenda Ekwurzel, a climate scientist for the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the slowdown is more like a speed bump, a result of heat being trapped and circulated through the ocean and atmosphere in different ways rather than a fundamental change in the climate. She said surface temperature is just one of many expressions of climate change, including sea level rise, melting ice and ocean acidification.\""The global average temperature is one kind of a thermometer, but an even bigger thermometer is the ocean, which is absorbing most of the excess heat that climate change is creating,"" she said.\The report updates predictions of how temperature and sea level are expected to rise over the century.\The panel now expects sea level to rise globally by 10 inches to 32 inches by century's end, up from the rise of 7 inches to 23 inches it projected in 2007.\Those figures now include the contribution of massive ice sheets in Antarctica and Greenland that are creeping toward the ocean as they melt. The panel failed to account for that variable in its previous report, prompting criticism from the scientific community that its previous sea level rise projections were too low.\The panel also lowered the bottom of the range of temperature increase expected over the long term if carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere double. The planet would warm by at least 2.7 degrees even if aggressive action is taken to cut emissions, but temperatures could rise as much as 8.1 degrees in other scenarios.\""If no action is taken, no way will you be in the lower band,"" Michel Jarraud, secretary-general of the U.N.'s World Meteorological Organization said at the Stockholm meeting, which was webcast.\Roger Pielke Jr., a professor of environmental studies at the University of Colorado and a leading critic of the climate science establishment, praised the core science of the report, but said many of its conclusions, including the idea of a carbon dioxide limit, are neither new or surprising. He criticized the panel for not doing more to acknowledge uncertainty over how climate change will express itself in the near term.\""By not addressing the issues associated with the 'hiatus' in warming the IPCC missed an opportunity to clarify this issue, and also has guaranteed continuing allegations from its critics that is has dodged this issue,"" Pielke said.\U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called the report ""yet another wake-up call.""\""Once again, the science grows clearer, the case grows more compelling, and the costs of inaction grow beyond anything that anyone with conscience or common sense should be willing to even contemplate,"" he said in a statement.\Environmental activists greeted the report with calls for government action.\""This IPCC climate science assessment tells us in the strongest possible terms that we ignore climate change at our great peril."" Earthjustice President Trip Van Noppen said in a statement.\The assessment was written by more than 800 scientists from around the world. The panel does not conduct its own research, but collects and summarizes thousands of peer-reviewed scientific studies.\The report will inform negotiations toward a new international climate treaty to cut greenhouse gas emissions that is supposed to be reached by 2015.\--\tony.barboza@latimes.com"
45,"He sat shirtless on his thin bamboo floor in a home built on posts rising out of the Banda Sea.\Tadi had just returned in his dugout canoe from scanning crevices in a nearby reef for octopus. He and his neighbors spend every day this way, scouring the ocean for something to eat or sell. Here, fishing is about survival.\Their stilt village has no industry, no land, no running water. They dive without oxygen tanks, wearing hand-carved wooden goggles, and carry spear guns hacked from logs with their machetes. They eat part of what they catch and sell the rest, using the money to buy everything else they need: boat fuel, root vegetables, rice, wood.\Without fishing, ""how would I feed my family?"" asked Tadi, who like many Indonesians uses only one name.\Now Tadi's community, like countless others across the globe, is on a collision course with the industrialized world's fossil-fuel emissions.\Hundreds of millions of people around the world rely on marine life susceptible to climbing temperatures and ocean acidification, the souring of seas because of carbon dioxide emitted by burning coal, oil and natural gas. That includes northwest oyster growers and crabbers in the frigid Bering Sea, who now face great uncertainty from shifts in marine chemistry.\But from Africa to Alaska, many coastal communities face a substantially greater risk. These cultures are so thoroughly dependent on marine life threatened by CO2 that a growing body of research suggests their children or grandchildren could struggle to find enough food.\The science of deciphering precisely who might see seafood shortages remains embryonic.\But with many of the most at-risk coastal communities already facing poverty, marine pollution, overfishing and rising sea levels, the potential for calamity is high.\""I can't tell you how many people will be affected,"" said Sarah Cooley, at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, who studies links between acidification and food security. ""But it's going to be a very big number.""\Andreas Andersson, an acidification and coral reef expert with the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego, said, ""These people are literally going to be fighting for their lives.""\Among the most vulnerable to changing ocean conditions are people like Tadi and his 1,600 fellow villagers, even if they don't quite view it that way yet.\From his elevated perch sheltered from the midday sun, Tadi could see huts with wispy thatch roofs connected by the rickety planks of his village boardwalk. Everything stood a dozen feet above emerald waters.\Like many in his village, he's uncertain of his age. But for as long as he can remember, Tadi has netted, trapped, hooked or speared grouper, snapper, wrasses and parrotfish. Sometimes the men in his village disappear to the open sea for days to chase small tuna.\Women swarm the tide flats gathering clams, sea cucumbers, urchins and sea grass. They then paddle to a fish market on nearby Kaledupa Island, where even meaty catches fetch just a few dollars.\Among his peers, Tadi is considered one of the best spear fishermen. And no wonder: He said he stabbed his first fish when he was barely older than a toddler.\That childhood in the ocean left an impression. Every animal seemed huge. Sea life teemed wherever he looked.\""I could choose with my spear whatever fish I want,"" Tadi said through a translator. ""I never caught any small fish.""\Tadi taught his son, Laoda, to fish this way. Laoda has since taught his son, Adi.\The Sama people, or Bajau, are known as sea gypsies or sea nomads because they once lived mostly on boats. They roamed Southeast Asia between Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia, living off the sea, until governments began encouraging them to settle. Tadi's offshore village was built in the late 1950s.\Today, up to 1 million sea nomads are sprinkled throughout the Coral Triangle. Their lives are a blend of old ways and new.\Some divers in Tadi's village ruptured their eardrums as kids to make equalizing easier. Women dab their faces with rice paste for sunscreen. Villagers stack dead coral for support around the poles that hold their homes. Even fishing weights are sometimes homemade, forged by melting lead in aluminum cans over small open fires and pouring it into wooden molds.\Diesel generators provide electricity a few hours each night, and some residents use it to power televisions. Some fishermen wear expensive dive watches. On a mound of coral rubble beneath one hut is a surprisingly well-maintained billiard table.\After centuries of traveling far and wide, the Bajau's relocation concentrated their human waste and limited the range of their fishing.\This happened just as some in their village adopted the destructive practices of Asia's worst fishing fleets. A few here fish with coral-destroying bombs or cyanide. Some from the village and nearby islands gather colorful reef fish for sale to the aquarium trade. Commercial trawlers from elsewhere cause more damage. It all takes a toll.\""There's been a pretty substantial decrease in their catches per amount of effort since the 1990s,"" said Paul Simonin, a Cornell University graduate student who has tracked Bajau fishing data.\Tadi's neighbors and nearby island communities still land plenty of fish, but their reefs have seen better days. Everyone works a bit harder to find food.\And a coming storm from CO2 will only make things worse.\Scientists are still navigating the complex ways carbon dioxide can alter the marine world. But some effects are clear.\Rising temperatures already wreak havoc on corals. Warming water can cause corals to eject the algae that give them their vibrant color, weakening or killing reefs and turning them white. This process is known as bleaching. Without reductions in global emissions, by midcentury 90% of reefs are projected to see severe bleaching episodes every year.\Ocean acidification will compound the problem.\A quarter of the CO2 spewed by cars and power plants winds up in the ocean. That lowers the pH, makes the water more corrosive and reduces carbonate ions, which then makes it harder for marine creatures to build their shells and skeletons.\Acidification can directly harm animals throughout the food web, from microscopic plankton to some fish. It endangers corals, weakening their skeletons, inhibiting growth, and increasing the likelihood of bleaching. In fact, acidification even accelerates the dissolution and breakdown of the reef.\""Temperature has zapped a lot of reefs so far, but longer-term effects are likely to come from acidification,"" said Charles Sheppard, a professor at England's University of Warwick who studies climate-change effects on coral reefs.\These ocean changes may not directly hit the octopus and fish Tadi catches, but will almost certainly rearrange the foods available for those creatures to eat. And loss of coral, by itself, usually translates to fewer fish and marine creatures, often a substantial reduction.\Researchers working on reefs naturally bathed in CO2 in Papua New Guinea reported finding half as many small invertebrates -- crabs, shrimp, sand dollars, marine worms -- as on healthy corals.\""Think about a coral reef as a city, a lot of buildings and houses,"" Andersson said. ""Without the houses, you have no inhabitants.""\Scientists are still learning how much - or how little - marine life might adapt. Some corals appear more resilient than others, and bleaching doesn't always ruin healthy reefs, said David Kline, a coral and climate change scientist at Scripps.\But reefs across Southeast Asia, in particular, already are a fraction of what they once were, according to a 2007 analysis. And reefs taxed by pollution or overfishing are more susceptible to mat-forming algae. In the worst cases, after bleaching, this weedy slime can smother corals for good.\In the grassy shallows a few hundred yards from Tadi's hut, his neighbor Mbilia sat curled in her canoe, plucking sea urchins from the water and halving them with her machete.\She could not even contemplate a reef with almost no fish. The prospect, to her, seemed amusing.\""I am an old woman,"" Mbilia said. ""I'm not thinking a lot about that.""\Tadi and Laoda usually don't think about it much either. But there are days when fishing is so slow it's a possibility they just can't ignore.\""Sometimes we eat everything in one day,"" Laoda said. ""But if we can't find anything, we don't eat.""\Some Bajau don't believe humans can alter the marine world. Even harder to grasp is the possibility that actions now could cause future decay. For some here, successful fishing is dictated by the whims of testy sea gods.\""They do not see a cause-and-effect relationship the way we do,"" said Julian Clifton, a University of Western Australia professor who has studied Tadi's village. ""The Bajau get characterized as backward because they don't get this idea. But their relationship with time is different from ours. They live in a sort of constant present.""\If fishing worsens dramatically for Tadi, options appear limited. Fishermen could keep pushing out into the ocean, or the village could fold up and move away, or turn to fish farming. The first might be possible. The second two are much harder.\The Bajau are short on money and clout. They remain among the region's poorest coastal residents, an ethnic minority often disparaged by others. And by the time they could face real trouble, others around the world may have similar problems, straining resources that otherwise might help.\At least 6 million people in 99 countries fish coral reefs, according to research published in the journal PLOS One in June. An additional 400 million or more are tied indirectly to coral. Indonesia alone includes nearly 1,000 inhabited islands, many of which are populated by people dependent on reefs.\""In the 15 or 16 countries we've surveyed, 50 to 90% of their protein comes from fish,"" said Johann Bell, a fish expert helping Pacific Island nations deal with threats to seafood. ""It's a huge problem. There are going to be many who just fall below the radar.""\Credit: Welch writes for the Seattle Times."
46,"Climate change has lengthened the Rocky Mountain wildflower season by more than a month since the 1970s and altered the flowering patterns of more species than previously thought, new research shows.\Wildflowers at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory, which sits about 9,500 feet above sea level in Colorado, bloom almost immediately after the spring snowmelt and stick around until the first hard frost in the fall. But as temperatures rise, snow is melting earlier and frosts are occurring later.\Forty years ago, flowers bloomed from mid-May to early September. Now the season lasts from April to mid-September, according to a trio of researchers who collected data at the research station near Crested Butte, Colo.\Earlier spring snowmelt and other climate shifts have changed the timing of blooms for more than two-thirds of 60 species of native wildflowers found in the mountain meadows, stands of aspen trees and conifer forest that were surveyed from 1974 to 2012, the researchers reported this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. In that period, the wildflower season was extended by 35 days.\The study is the latest to document one of the strongest signs that global warming is shaking up the natural world. Scientists studying phenology -- the timing of seasonal events in nature -- are observing rapid shifts in when flowers bloom, trees leaf out and bees, birds and butterflies appear in the spring.\Scientists have documented the trend using historical records from writers and naturalists, including Henry David Thoreau, who in the 1850s began recording in his journal the first blooms of the season around Concord, Mass.\Previous studies largely have focused on the first appearance of flowers in the spring, but that probably underestimates the true extent of the changes they are going through because of a warming climate, the study published this week said.\To go beyond that, they observed wildflower species growing in 30 plots about the size of two dining room tables pushed together. They checked in on each plot about once every other day and recorded the blooms they saw throughout the growing season. They found that compared with 1974, by 2012 half of the species flowered earlier, more than one-third reached their peak blooms sooner, and 30% flowered later into the season.\""We don't know if it's good or bad for these plant species at this point,"" said study coauthor Amy Iler, postdoctoral biology researcher at University of Maryland in College Park.\The findings nonetheless raise many questions about how disruptive the changing bloom times might be to bees, birds and other pollinators as well as to other plants that are adapted to wildflowers' appearing at very specific times, she said.\""Climate change is reshuffling flowering plants over a short time period,"" Iler said. ""So it might be changing things that were set in place by natural selection over a long time frame.""\The study is the product of decades of work by David Inouye, a biology professor at the University of Maryland, who has amassed an exhaustive record by systematically counting wildflowers at the wilderness laboratory in the mountains of Colorado.\""It is probably the most detailed, long-term data set on flowering times that exists in the United States and perhaps even the world,"" said Richard Primack, a biology professor at Boston University who has used Thoreau's records to study the effects of climate change on plants and animals.\Primack, who was not involved in the study published this week, praised the paper as an ""extremely innovative type of analysis"" that would stimulate a flurry of new research.\""As soon as I read this paper I thought, my God, why didn't we analyze our data that way?"" Primack said. ""This study shows us that if you don't just focus on the first flowering date but also on the peak flowering date and the final flowering date, there's a much greater impact of climate change than we previously suspected.""\--\tony.barboza@latimes.com\Twitter: @tonybarboza"
47,"A new federal report on climate change released by the White House does not focus, as previous reports did, on predictions about the future but instead offers stark descriptions of the here and now: shorter winters, intensified storms, deepening drought, more frequent heat waves. Growing seasons are changing and Western pine forests are falling to beetle infestations.\None of this should come as a surprise; the most recent report by the United Nations' climate change experts said pretty much the same thing on a global scale. But there has been a more discernible tone of alarm in such reports during the last several months. They press the point that the effects of climate change are evident and that more are coming -- faster than previously thought and faster than even progressive countries and states are preparing for. California is well positioned to do its part, thanks to AB 32, the Global Warming Solutions Act, which became law in 2006. Not only has it put the state on the path to significantly reducing its greenhouse gases, but the law's cap-and-trade provision will provide billions of dollars for at least a decade to be dedicated to further fighting climate change.\How to spend this windfall? You can be sure there's no shortage of ideas in Sacramento. Gov. Jerry Brown wants to spend a third of it on the state's controversial high-speed rail project, which he first proposed in the 1980s. A proposal by state Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg (D-Sacramento) would reduce that to one-fifth -- but would spend an additional 40% of the money on affordable housing to be built near mass-transit lines, long a priority of his.\Both ideas have merit, though as this page has argued, the state should not commit significant sums of cap-and-trade money to high-speed rail until it is determined that the project is viable -- legally, financially and otherwise. Both transit-oriented housing and the rail project, at least theoretically, should eventually reduce the number of vehicle miles traveled by Californians, an important step in reducing tailpipe emissions, and Steinberg's smart-planning emphasis has the added benefit of providing more housing as well as creating walking-friendly cities and less-crowded streets.\But it doesn't make sense to tie up so much of the state's cap-and-trade income in long-term projects when climate scientists insist that we need to move quickly and decisively. Already California is hard-pressed to meet its climate goals for the years beyond 2020. Not only would the benefits of high-speed rail not be felt for more than a decade, but there are legitimate questions about whether the project will ever get done and, if it does, how much it will contribute to reducing carbon emissions.\There are ways to reduce greenhouse gases more quickly and measurably. Replace more diesel trucks, which would also reduce deadly particulate pollution, especially in low-income areas girdled by freeways. Expand existing public transit systems, making them quicker and more convenient. Help more California motorists afford hybrid or electric vehicles. Increase the state's commitment to solar energy and water conservation; the single biggest consumer of power in California is the State Water Project, which is responsible for the energy-intensive job of moving water around the state.\Carbon isn't the only greenhouse gas. Methane is about 30 times more potent at trapping heat over 100 years. Methane-capture equipment at the state's dairies and cattle operations, major producers of the gas, could significantly reduce this kind of pollution.\There are many ways of combating climate change with cap-and-trade money. Long-term strategies such as Steinberg's smart-planning proposal have an important place in the state's green portfolio, but they should not dominate it, earmarking the money for specific state projects for years into the future at a time when the state must redouble its efforts to meet short-term goals."
48,"Signaling growing industry opposition to the Obama administration's forthcoming proposal to curb carbon emissions from power plants, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce warned in a report Wednesday that the climate-change rule could cost the economy tens of billions of dollars in lost investment and millions of jobs.\The Environmental Protection Agency is expected Monday to unveil regulations that would push states to make significant cuts in pollution from coal generators, which account for about 40% of all greenhouse-gas emissions in the country.\Although the size of the proposed reduction has yet to be announced, the chamber's report estimated that such a rule could result in an average annual drop of $51 billion in economic output and 224,000 fewer jobs every year through 2030, with the Southeast feeling the biggest pinch.\The chamber said the numbers were based on modeling from the economic research firm IHS, using assumptions that the regulation would set a 42% reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions by 2030 from 2005 levels -- an aggressive percentage that is close to a target previously cited by President Obama.\Some analysts noted, however, that the chamber's economic analysis doesn't take into account the gains in productivity, among other benefits, in employing pollution-cutting technologies and shifting to cleaner sources of energy.\EPA spokesman Tom Reynolds took issue with the chamber's cost numbers. In a blog statement, he said the report assumes that under the proposal, states would need to require so-called carbon capture and sequestration technology for natural gas plants.\""That's not true,"" he wrote, noting that three-fourths of the chamber's cost estimates come from power plant construction.\Even if the chamber's projections are true, some economists said, a $51-billion drop in output amounts to peanuts for an American economy with an annual gross domestic product of about $15 trillion.\""It sounds ominous, but it's tiny,"" said Stephen Levy, director of the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy in Palo Alto.

They just morph into new incarnations.\Take, for example, the eight-year battle among industry, environmentalists and the administrations of Govs. Arnold Schwarzenegger and successor Jerry Brown over how to deal with threats of global warming.\Now, the conflict again is heating up. Just before their July recess, a group of business-friendly Democratic lawmakers introduced legislation to slow California's campaign to curb climate change.\Nine Assembly and Senate members, led by Assemblyman Henry T. Perea (D-Fresno), want to delay putting motor vehicle fuels under the state's system for buying and selling the right to release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.\Perea and colleagues worry that requiring refineries to buy credits could add at least 15 cents to the price of an average gallon of unleaded gasoline, which tops $4 in many parts of the state.\To the frustration of environmentalists, the bill, AB 69, would postpone bringing vehicle fuel under ""cap and trade"" until Jan. 1, 2018.\""The cap-and-trade system should not be used to raise billions of dollars in new state funds at the expense of consumers, who are struggling to get back on their feet after the recession,"" Perea said. ""In some areas of the state, like the Central Valley, constituents need to drive long distances and they will be disproportionately impacted by rising gas prices.""\The Brown administration, while guarded in its comments, shows little interest in revising state plans to implement the state's landmark 2006 law to combat climate change, still known by its old bill number, AB 32.\""Having transportation fuels under the cap is essential for California to achieve its AB 32 greenhouse gas emission reduction goals,"" said David Clegern, a spokesman for the California Air Resources Board. The agency is charged with cutting carbon releases to 1990 levels over the next six years.\The governor's office hasn't said whether Brown would veto Perea's bill should it get to his desk.\Environmentalists and pro-AB 32 lawmakers have been quick to respond negatively to Perea's proposed legislation.\Oil companies should not be given an exemption from the law,"" 34 legislators wrote to Brown in a June 27 letter. ""Business as usual is unsustainable when it comes to reliance on fossil fuels.""\Good but not great\California's economy grew 2% last year, ahead of the national economy's more sluggish 1.8%, said Stephen Levy, director of the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy in Palo Alto.

50,"As wildfires burned in California, a study by several major environmental groups estimated that climate change could mean that future blazes will be much larger and add billions of dollars to already costly losses.\The 46-page study released Tuesday, titled ""Flammable Planet: Wildfires and the Social Cost of Carbon,"" is part of an ongoing project by three groups to examine what it calls the missing risks, such as wildfires, that climate change can make more expensive. The groups are the Environmental Defense Fund, the Institute for Policy Integrity at NYU School of Law, and the Natural Resources Defense Council.\U.S. wildfires cost as much as $125 billion annually, but climate change could add as much as $60 billion to the bill by 2050, the study said. The projected cost increase is attributed to an expanding area in which wildfires burn -- estimated to be 50% to 100% larger by 2050. California ""could experience a 36% to 74% increase in area burned by 2085 under a high emissions path,"" the study said.\""Climate change is here now, and its toll on our health and economy is rising every day,"" said Laurie Johnson, chief economist at NRDC.\""The current scientific consensus is that wildfire risk will increase in many regions of the world as climate change leads to warmer temperatures, more frequent droughts, and changing precipitation patterns,"" the study said. ""Fires are expected to become more frequent and intense, and fire seasons are projected to last longer.""\However, fire officials in several Western states said climate change wasn't solely to blame for the size and cost of fires. Other factors must be considered, they said, such as hundreds of years of overly aggressive fire suppression, leading to overcrowded forests that will continue to spark more intense wildfires.\""That problem only grew as we went from periods of abundant rainfall to average rainfall and then to drought,"" said Dan Ware, fire prevention and outreach program manager for New Mexico State Forestry.\Jim Paxon, who retired from the U.S. Forest Service in New Mexico in 2003 and served as a spokesman on major wild-land fires for 13 years, blamed lack of forest management -- not just climate change -- for an explosion of unwieldy and costly wildfires in the West.\Lack of prescribed burns and less timber cutting are major factors, said Paxon, who now serves as special assistant to the Arizona Game and Fish Department.\""I could spend hours showing some daylight on what it has cost us taxpayers since the demise of the timber industry at the hands of enviro-litigants,"" he said. ""Now we have mega-fires as a partial consequence.""\According to federal statistics released Tuesday, firefighters were battling 15 uncontained large fires, eight of which were in California. Between 7 million to 9 million acres are burned each year in the United States, while globally the damage is 865 million acres.\How to measure the full cost of a wildfire is complicated and becomes difficult depending on what is included in calculations. The cost includes direct market damages such as lost timber and property, nonmarket damages such as health effects, and added expenditures such as fire prevention, the study said.\""Research suggests that the total costs of a wildfire are typically 10 to 50 times its suppression costs,"" the study said. ""Given that the United States spends roughly $2.0 [billion] to $2.5 billion on wildfire suppression per year, we estimate that the total cost of U.S. wildfires is presently between $20 billion and $125 billion annually.""\Although most fire officials agree that the cost of fighting fires will probably keep increasing, there isn't consensus on the costs anticipated by 2050.\""The projection given in the report is concerning, but with millions of dollars dedicated to hazardous fuels mitigation, forest and watershed thinning treatments and prevention outreach, our hope is that will also mitigate costs spent on fire suppression,"" Ware said.\Paxon said the cost of fighting wildfires had increased dramatically since he started his career in 1969. It cost hundreds of dollars an acre to suppress wildfires when he first joined the agency. By 2000, it was in the tens of thousands, he said, because inappropriate forest management had led to enormous fires.\He called the new report ""pretty extreme,"" saying that although fires change the vegetation and -- in the hottest blazes -- soil and watersheds may take decades to recover, millions of acres of forests are not ""destroyed,"" as the study says.\Kent Hamilton, Rocky Mountain aviation safety manager for the U.S. Forest Service, said the complexities of fighting fires in modern times contributed to escalating costs. For instance, modern aircraft fleets for fire suppression are more expensive but more effective than in years past, increasing the margin of safety for the firefighters on the ground, he said.\--\cindy.carcamo@latimes.com\michael.muskal@latimes.com"
51,"Fewer than half of American states are working to protect themselves from climate change despite more detailed warnings from scientists that communities are already being damaged, according to a new online clearinghouse of states' efforts compiled by the Georgetown Climate Center.\Fourteen states have plans to prepare for the effects of climate change. California, New York and Maryland are among those that have made the greatest progress toward the dozens of goals their plans set forth, such as cutting statewide greenhouse gas emissions, improving infrastructure, securing water supplies, battling wildfires or coping with rising sea levels. Even those states have much work ahead of them, though.\An additional eight states and the District of Columbia are devising similar plans, and some counties and towns have plans in place. But more than half of states have not taken any steps to address the threats posed by climate change, leaving them vulnerable to predicted flooding, drought and wildfire, and leaving taxpayers on the hook for the cleanup.\The online clearinghouse georgetownclimate.org is meant to give communities a way to track what their state is doing to adapt to climate change. Lawmakers and regulators could also use the tool to glean ideas from states that are further along.\Vicki Arroyo, director of the Georgetown Climate Center in Washington, said she welcomed the progress that a ""significant minority"" of states had made on planning, but acknowledged that in much of the country, the work to deal with the effects of global warming had yet to begin.\""A number of states have started implementing changes that will actually make their communities more resilient. That's good news,"" Arroyo said. ""Unfortunately, the research also shows that many states are still not treating this issue with the urgency that is called for.""\In May, the third congressionally mandated National Climate Assessment sketched out sobering scenarios of global warming's effect on different regions of the United States. The Northeast and Midwest, for instance, would see a huge increase in heavy downpours that could lead to flooding and erosion. The Southwest, including California, would be more prone to extreme heat, drought and wildfire.\Other agencies, such as the U.S. Geological Survey, have shown that coastal communities in Oregon, California, the mid-Atlantic, eastern Florida and the Gulf Coast are highly vulnerable to damage from rising sea levels.\The states furthest along in their plans are those on the West Coast, including Alaska and Hawaii, in the Northeast, mid-Atlantic and Florida. Away from the coasts, only Colorado has a plan finalized. Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan are in various stages of planning. Illinois has no plan, although Chicago does.\The inaction throughout much of the country was the ""unfortunate side effect"" of the political polarization over climate change in the last decade, said Greg Dotson, vice president for energy policy at the Center for American Progress, a progressive think tank.\""People don't want to acknowledge that there's a problem with unavoidable consequences that you have to plan for,"" he said.\Laggard states might soon be prodded to act, thanks to an update in July to federal policies. States are now required to factor climate change into their disaster planning or risk losing an increased share of federal money the next time a natural disaster occurs.\Even in states that lack plans, individual communities are pushing ahead, the Georgetown website shows. Waveland, Miss., terribly damaged by Hurricane Katrina, is planning for future damage that higher sea levels, storm surges and flooding could bring. Tucson is planning for the effects of long-term drought on its water resources. Salt Lake City is also working to preserve its water resources and factoring in climate change as it selects additions to its tree canopy.\Still, those states that rolled out plans years ago are not far along in their work, according to the website.\California offers incentives to municipalities to integrate climate change in planning their water usage, for example. But the state has not mandated such planning, in part because mid-size and small communities lack the expertise and data to determine just how hard climate change will hit them, said Jessica Grannis, adaptation program manager for the Georgetown Climate Center.\Such challenges have slowed preparation for climate change in other states too, Arroyo said. This year, the Obama administration pledged to roll out data tools and apps that would help communities gather the information they needed to plan for future disasters.\--\neela.banerjee@latimes.com\Twitter: @neelaeast"
52,"Think that people in upstate New York will more strongly believe climate change is upon us after an early November blizzard dumped 7 feet of snow, which then was turned to slush by spring-like temperatures?\Think again.\Freaky seasons and drastic weather anomalies do little to convince most people that climate change is real -- political ideology does much more, according to a study in the journal Nature Climate Change.\The study, published online this month, found that people who saw the winter of 2012 as warmer than usual were right. It was, on any time scale. But that conclusion did not affect their views on the science behind climate change.\The results further undermine a fundamental assumption that has driven science communication since a U.N. panel first announced, in 1990, that evidence pointed toward an increasingly warming Earth because of the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\People may be hesitant to accept the consensus view now, scientists and policymakers have since assured, but that will change when their local climates starts changing.\""There's really little to no evidence of that"" in the U.S., said sociologist Aaron McCright of Michigan State University, lead author of the study.\McCright found that Americans' perceptions of aberrant weather patterns matched the data. But he found that those individual perceptions did little to drive how strongly people believed climate change was underway, caused by man, and an immediate threat. Nor did that personal experience with abnormal climate influence whether Americans thought the scientific community agreed on those counts.\The scientific consensus on climate, outlined in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's fourth report in 2007, is that ""the warming of the climate system is unequivocal, as is now evident from observations of increases in global average air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice and rising global average sea level.""\It's no surprise to anyone -- least of all social scientists -- that America is deeply divided along party and ideological lines about climate (and healthcare, among other topics). But a growing body of evidence now suggests that ideology interferes with the assessment of science.\For example, in a study published this month, a Duke University social psychologist showed he could strongly shift conservatives' skepticism about climate change by associating the science with policies that either were antagonistic to their core beliefs (such as small government and unfettered markets), or aligned with them. Skepticism was higher when facts were presented in a context of government regulation, and lower in the context of free-market solutions.\Study coauthor Troy Campbell, a doctoral student at Duke's Fuqua School of Business, showed a similar shift in credulity among liberals with respect to crime statistics and gun ownership policies.\In other words, it appears that Americans are not coldly weighing the facts, then arguing over policy. Our ideologies and political affiliations are altering how we process facts. This example of ""motivated"" cognition appears to be driving denial of climate science, according to Campbell.\""People often say that we disagree about the facts, so that leads us to disagree about the solutions,"" Campbell said. ""But what's actually happening is that people are disagreeing about the solutions, so we can never really have a good discussion of the facts. That's a tragic story.""\Tragic, but all too familiar, McCright said. ""It's something that we see a lot,"" he said of Campbell's study. ""Whether you call it confirmation bias or motivated cognition, it is a pretty robust finding across many different studies.""\McCright co-wrote another study, published this week, that matched more than a decade's worth of polling by Gallup with a database of region-specific climate anomalies compiled by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\The researchers ran about 800 computer models to complete the most comprehensive and specific analysis to date of how personal experience and perceptions of local climate anomalies affect beliefs about climate change.\""We searched high and low to find different ways that the climate extremes could impact people's views of climate change and we found almost nothing,"" McCright said. ""We found that, sure enough, political ideology and political party affiliation are the two dominant predictors in our models, which is sort of depressing. But this is the reality in the U.S.""\On the upside, McCright said, people's perceptions about freakish spells of weather do match the data -- making it perhaps easier to talk about adapting to change, rather than about halting the warming trend.\Campbell, who is earning a marketing degree, suggests that divorcing descriptions of the problem from its potential remedies could filter out the interference of ideology, but he and McCright acknowledged that it is may be too late to do so on the topic of climate change. The association between climate problems and remedies is far too strong and pervasive, and is reinforced by political leaders and the media, both said.\On that front, the news is not so good either.\A Pew Research Center study last month showed that there is little to no overlap between where conservatives and liberals seek news -- at a time when ideologues of either stripe disproportionately drive public policy. The middle ground is eroding, the Pew studies show. And these new studies suggest this change is washing away our ability to agree on facts.\""It's like we have no common facts anymore,"" McCright said. ""And climate change is symbolic of that.""\--\geoffrey.mohan@latimes.com"
53,"In the 2014 midterm elections, no one spent political cash like Tom Steyer, the Democratic hedge fund billionaire from San Francisco who has tried to make climate change a paramount issue in American politics.\He dropped more than $74 million into congressional and gubernatorial campaigns, almost three times the $27.7 million spent by the second-biggest individual donor, former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg.\Casino mogul Sheldon Adelson and business executive David Koch, two Republican mega-donors, gave $13.2 million and $6.2 million, respectively.\The numbers, compiled from documents filed with the federal government, were detailed by Politico this week. The analysis does not include money donated to nonprofits that aren't required to reveal their contributors.\Much of Steyer's money was spent through Nextgen Climate Action Committee, his political organization. Despite his deep pockets, however, his ability to push Democrats to victory in the midterms was limited.\The U.S. Senate changed to Republican control, and candidates backed by Steyer in battlegrounds such as Colorado and Iowa lost.\Some of his candidates won in places including Pennsylvania, Michigan and New Hampshire, but analysts have said they doubt climate change was an issue that drove voters to the polls.\Steyer and his allies have said this year's campaigns were just the starting point in a multiyear effort to raise the profile of environmental issues.\Steyer put a positive spin on the outcome of his efforts after hosting a conference this month in Oakland. And he expressed a desire to play an even larger role.\""If you look at the statistics about where we were, how people voted and whether they voted, you'll find out we were very successful,"" Steyer said.

54,"The release of climate change proposals by Senate Democrats on Tuesday quickly spawned a heated debate over the direction of California's economy and the potential effect of new environmental regulations.\Some unions and companies welcome the legislation, saying it will lead to new jobs and foster a growing market in clean energy technologies. But oil companies, utilities and other business groups viewed the proposals with skepticism, if not outright hostility.\""This is not going to be easy,"" said Kathryn Phillips, director of Sierra Club California. ""There will be a lot of negotiation.""\The proposals largely reflect goals set by Gov. Jerry Brown during his inaugural address last month. One bill would require stricter limits on greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and another would require greater energy efficiency in older buildings, expanded generation of renewable energy and reduced gasoline use on state roads by 2030.\Other bills would create an advisory committee on job growth and order state pension systems, the two largest public pension funds in the country, to divest from coal companies.\During Tuesday's news conference outside the Capitol, Senate leader Kevin de Leon (D-Los Angeles) said environmental regulations could spur innovation and help California's economy transition away from fossil fuels.\""My Senate colleagues and I have seen clean energy jobs growing across California, and we want to make sure they reach every single district,"" De Leon said.\Sen. Ben Hueso (D-San Diego) described it as ""the California gold rush of the modern era.""\""It will be a tough lift,"" said Assemblyman Anthony Rendon (D-Lakewood), who joined De Leon on Tuesday to show his support. ""People have concerns about dependability. People have concerns about costs. We take all of those concerns very seriously.""\A coalition of oil companies reiterated their opposition to the ""radical"" goal of reducing gasoline use 50% by 2030, describing the Senate proposals as ""attacks on an important industry.""\In addition, utility companies have circulated an alternative energy proposal, and some business groups questioned the potential effect of higher electricity prices.\""The jobs you lose in manufacturing could outweigh the jobs you gain in the clean, emerging economy,"" said Dorothy Rothrock, president of the California Manufacturers & Technology Assn.\If the Senate proposals are enacted, meeting the targets will be left up to state agencies responsible for drafting and enforcing new policies. Assemblyman James Gallagher (R-Nicolaus) said that reduces accountability, and he's pushing legislation to give lawmakers the final word on regulations.\""Shouldn't we have some say in it?"" Gallagher said.\De Leon disagreed, saying that would ""politicize"" the regulatory process.\--\chris.megerian@latimes.com\Twitter: @chrismegerian"
55,"About 1 in 6 species now alive on the planet could become extinct as a result of climate change, according to a new study published last week in the journal Science.\If present trends continue, Earth's temperature will wind up 4.3 degrees Celsius higher than it was before the onset of the industrial era. Should that scenario come to pass, as many as 16% of species around the world would be at risk of dying out, the study says.\Author Mark Urban, an ecologist and evolutionary biologist at the University of Connecticut, based his calculation on a meta-analysis of 131 previous studies that made predictions about how multiple species would fare in a warmer world.\Although the studies focused on different species in different parts of the world and used different modeling techniques to make their forecasts, Urban's statistical methods found that none of those variables mattered as much as ""the level of future climate change.""\For instance, 2.8% of species currently are at risk of global extinction, Urban wrote. But the hotter Earth gets, the more that risk rises.\If the world is able to stick to its target of making sure temperatures rise only 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, the global extinction risk would rise to 5.2%.\In the more realistic scenario that Earth warms by 3 degrees Celsius, an estimated 8.5% of species would be projected to become extinct.\And if things continue the way they are, the global extinction risk would nearly double, to 16%, Urban wrote. That's 1 out of every 6 species gone.\The average of all the scenarios is that 7.9% of species will become extinct as a direct result of climate change, according to the study.\The extinction risk isn't the same in all areas of the globe, Urban found. It appears to be lowest in North America, where about 5% of species are likely to disappear. (That figure could be higher or lower depending on how much temperatures rise.) Europe is a close second, with 6% of species at risk.\At the other end of the spectrum, South America could lose 23% of its species. That continent is particularly vulnerable because it has a lot of creatures that live in small ranges. If changing climate conditions make their homes uninhabitable, there's nowhere for them to go where they could find equivalent conditions.\In Australia and New Zealand, as many as 14% of species could disappear, Urban wrote. As in South America, the animals that live Down Under have the misfortune of inhabiting niche environments with no ready alternatives. The fact that they live on islands further limits their ability to seek comfort by moving into new ranges.\The analysis also revealed that the faster Earth's temperature rises, the more species will die out as a result. If temperatures rise more gradually, animals will have more time to adapt -- and better odds for success.\""Extinction risks from climate change are expected not only to increase but to accelerate for every degree rise in global temperatures,"" Urban wrote. ""The signal of climate change-induced extinctions will become increasingly apparent if we do not act now to limit future climate change.""\Urban noted that the species that go extinct aren't the only ones that will be forced to reckon with climate change.\""Even species not threatened directly by extinction could experience substantial changes in abundances, distributions, and species interactions,"" he wrote. That ""could affect ecosystems and their services to humans.""\The 131 studies that were used to make these estimates did not take into account such complex factors as the way climate change may prompt species to change they way they interact with each other. Nor did they attempt to predict how species might evolve to adapt to their new realities.\Still, the results offer a ""sobering estimate of climate change-induced biodiversity loss,"" University of Washington biologist Janneke Hille Ris Lambers wrote in a commentary that accompanies Urban's report.\The study is only one of many that makes the case that ""climate change will have enormous impacts on the organisms with which we share our planet,"" she wrote. Despite the uncertainties inherent in making these kinds of predictions, she added, ""we should not wait ... before taking action, preferentially by curbing emissions.""\--\karen.kaplan@latimes.com\Twitter: @LATkarenkaplan"

Among his duties: organizing lectures and national tours, vetting speakers and finding partners that, he says, ""do a great job for humanity.""\When not assisting the Dalai Lama, the 50-year-old Dhonden lectures in San Diego twice a week on consciousness and near-death experiences.\Dhonden hatched the idea for a jubilee-style 80th birthday, and the task of finding the right space fell on his shoulders.\""[In] New York, life is very busy. People walk fast. Not enough time to think,"" Dhonden said recently as he sipped tea in an El Segundo coffee shop. ""In California, people like to take time and have more time. People like to find out what really happens in the world, what is the truth about.""\Such seekers have helped elevate the profile of the 14th Dalai Lama, who fled Tibet in 1959 and settled among the Himalayan foothills.\But rather than stay in his refuge, he has traveled -- meeting with heads of state, lecturing at universities -- and written dozens of books. During eight decades of public life, he's dispensed simple teachings tailored to glide across national and ideological boundaries.\He preaches what he calls a ""religion of kindness,"" amassing acolytes and friends eager to pay tribute to the Nobel Peace Prize winner, even as he minimizes his work.\""My small contribution, insignificantly small contribution, [is] promotion of human value,"" he said during an interview via satellite from his compound in Dharamsala, India. ""I cannot say some ... great thing achieved.""\Dhonden, who takes that humility in stride, said his goal was to craft a three-day celebration worthy of the man he so admires.\It was the Million Acts of Kindness campaign in Anaheim's public school system that caught Dhonden's eye when he began searching for the right location, he said. The program tabulates caring deeds, like saying ""please"" or planting a garden on school grounds.\""If you really want to change the city, it has to do with the culture, healing the city from within,"" Mayor Tom Tait said.\Dalai Lama's emissary arranged for the mayor and his wife, Julie, to travel to Dharamsala this spring for a three-day visit. There, Tait gave the Dalai Lama a token that bears the city's motto: ""Anaheim -- City of Kindness."" The Dalai Lama frequently removed it from his pocket to show it off, Tait said.\The Southern California summit will open with the Dalai Lama's address on ""the transformative power of creativity and art"" at the Honda Center. On Monday, his actual birthday, he will lead two discussions at UC Irvine about climate change and wisdom, which Tibetan Buddhists believe accumulate with time.\The university, which has hosted the Dalai Lama twice before, has an endowed scholarship program in his name that centers on ethics and public affairs.\Half of the 10-person organizing committee for the Global Compassion Summit are UC Irvine administrators.\Thomas A. Parham, UC Irvine's vice chancellor for student affairs, said the topic of sustainability suits the campus. UC Irvine has been recognized by the Environmental Protection Agency for its food waste recycling and recently added a zero-emission bus to its fleet.\""The world is in desperate need of more love, compassion and empathy,"" Parham said. ""If you look at the Dalai Lama's values and virtues, there's a high degree of congruence with our campus.""\The summit is scheduled to close Tuesday morning, with the Dalai Lama leading a 90-minute dialogue on values-based education, a session that likely will include Anaheim's kindness campaign.\""If you really want to change this world,"" Tait said recently as he and Dhonden met students in the library at Gauer Elementary School, ""start with education, start with the kids.""\The focus of the Dalai Lama's visit is his message, Dhonden said, because Tibetan tradition places scant value on birthday celebrations. Rather, elders are accorded respect and aging is honored. Death is inevitable and contemplated daily.\Just don't think it's coming soon for the Dalai Lama, Dhonden said: ""He will live 114 years.""\--\matt.hamilton@latimes.com\Twitter: @MattHjourno"

""Americans, their children and generations to come deserve -- and demand -- better.""\Brown, a Democrat, said California's drought and wildfires were evidence that the effects of climate change are being felt now, calling it ""the new normal.""\""Lest you think this movement is limited to Democrats and only embraced within our borders,"" the governor added, ""the conservatives in England, the moderates in Germany and even the communists in China are on board.""\Many of the Republican candidates, who are set to hold their first debate Thursday, have either denied the science surrounding climate change or opposed stiffer steps to address the problem.\It's a key issue for Brown, who has pushed stronger regulations in California and taken shots at Republicans on the issue before. In March, he said Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, a candidate, had shown ""such a level of ignorance"" that he ""has rendered himself absolutely unfit to be running for office."" More recently, Brown labeled politicians who deny the existence of climate change ""troglodytes.""\Brown, 77, ran for president three times: in 1976, 1980 and 1992.

58,"The ""wanted"" poster with pictures of five state lawmakers appeared in the pages of a Spanish-language newspaper in Southern California last week.\""Would these politicians be willing to confront the petroleum industry and fight for Latino families?"" the ad said in support of tougher environmental rules. ""Help us make sure these elected politicians stay responsible to the community.""\The five are among the Latino or African American Democrats representing low-income districts who have not taken a side in the fierce tug of war over climate change measures that has been dominating the Capitol.\They represent places with perhaps the most at stake in California's environmental policies -- communities choked by pollution but wary of the higher costs that can come with new regulations.\One measure would set new targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions; another would reduce the use of gasoline on state roads and require more electricity to come from renewable energy.\Lawmakers have only a few days left to weigh the issues. With Republicans opposed, the fate of the legislation rests in the hands of undecided Democrats.\Assemblyman Ian Calderon (D-Whittier), one of the lawmakers named in the ad, said he knows that people in his mostly Latino district rank the environment as a top concern. ""But does it continue to stay a No. 1 issue for them when their gas prices go up and their utility bills go up?"" he said.\The question of what best serves these districts has become a key issue in the climate debate.\Supporters of the legislation say that cutting greenhouse gas emissions from transportation and power plants would reduce asthma and respiratory diseases associated with polluted air. They also say investments in green power could foster new jobs in areas with high unemployment.\""What we would ask these legislators is to do the right thing,"" said Arturo Carmona of Presente.org, the Latino advocacy group that ran the newspaper ad. ""They have an unprecedented and historic opportunity to stand with working families, with communities of color.""\Opponents argue that such neighborhoods could be harmed by higher prices of fuel and electricity. Zero-emission vehicles are often too costly for low-income residents, who are more likely to drive older cars with worse gas mileage and would be hit hard if the cost per gallon rose.\Fueling the debate are questions of whether the environmental movement is serving low-income, minority families.\Solar panels and electric vehicles ""are great, but they don't come to our neighborhoods,"" said Assemblyman Jim Cooper (D-Elk Grove).\Assemblyman Reggie Jones-Sawyer (D-Los Angeles), who heads the Legislative Black Caucus, said environmentalists should work more closely with minorities.\""What are you doing to make sure that we have a clean environment and that our water is clean and the oil drilling in our neighborhoods is clean and efficient?"" he has asked them. ""Many times we would get no response.""\Jones-Sawyer has suggested that designated seats for representatives of low-income communities be added to the California Air Resources Board, a top regulatory agency for handling pollution. But he said Gov. Jerry Brown's office opposed the idea.\An administration official said ""no door has been closed"" in the climate change talks.\Senate leader Kevin de Leon (D-Los Angeles), who is the author of the most contentious climate change bill, on gasoline use and renewable energy, supports the addition of new board members.\A Latino who grew up poor, De Leon has been working to show the benefits of environmental regulations and programs to minority communities.\He touts the prospect of new jobs in a green economy. He hosted a Capitol event at which a Latino family from Stockton was presented with a Toyota Prius, paid for with the help of a state program, to replace an aging truck.\Last month, De Leon spoke in English and Spanish to an environmental group and reminded the audience that he represents ""one of the poorest and most polluted districts in the state.""\If the Legislature approves his bill, ""we will be healthier and much more prosperous,"" he said.

59,"Tom Steyer's crusade to force politicians to confront climate change is well known, manifesting itself in millions of dollars of campaign funding, including the windfall he raised for Hillary Rodham Clinton recently in his San Francisco home.\Less well known is the billionaire's crusade to force farmers to confront it.\At an 1,800-acre cattle ranch that Steyer and his wife, Kat Taylor, own near Half Moon Bay, they are plotting to upend agribusiness with the same precision -- and even some of the same tools -- that served Steyer well in the hedge fund business.\They are also surprising some allies in the climate movement by cattle ranching at all. Many see the presence of massive numbers of cows on the planet as incompatible with efforts to contain global warming.\The couple have a different take.\""We would continue raising cattle even if no one ever ate another steak,"" said Taylor. That's how beneficial she and Steyer think these large farm animals can be. They want the cows to mimic the ancient migratory patterns of wild ungulates and naturally fertilize and aerate soil to reverse the mass erosion believed to be accelerating climate change.\Steyer and Taylor are among the ultra-rich climate activists whose impatience with the impact of food production on the environment has them moving beyond writing checks for research projects and scientific institutes to personally picking up cattle prods and pitchforks.\Former Oracle Chief Executive Larry Ellison, the world's fifth-richest man, purchased nearly the entire Hawaiian island of Lanai with futuristic plans to revive a long-defunct pineapple-growing industry there by desalinating seawater with solar and wind power.\On a farm in Arizona, Howard G. Buffett, son of the world's third-richest man, Warren E. Buffett, is fine-tuning climate-friendly growing techniques with the help of a couple of oxen, which he brought on board to demonstrate how the practices could work on subsistence farms in Africa that have no tractors.\Back at TomKat Ranch, cattle are encouraged to roam the way large mammals had in the wild for thousands of years, in the hope of re-creating ecosystems in which the patches of land they temporarily visit are enriched by all the accompanying organisms, rather than degraded.\During a recent visit, the cattle had roamed so far into the hills that ranch hands were unable to get a reporter out to see them. Steyer playfully suggested hopping on the ATVs parked nearby, but a handler reminded him that, well, he was a billionaire with a busy agenda and time was short.\The goal, Steyer explained, is to ""sequester a lot of the carbon in the soil and, from a greenhouse gas standpoint and carbon standpoint ... be a net plus.""\Steyer, Taylor and a staff of scientists and farmers are riding herd not just over cattle, but also accountants from PricewaterhouseCoopers. The number crunchers are meticulously analyzing whether there is merit to the couple's theory about how cattle ranching and climate interact.\""We are picking apart the whole operation, looking at all the supply-chain effects, adding data collection, recruiting a data consortia,"" said Taylor, the inspiration behind the ranch. Since the cows were AWOL, Taylor was talking over by the farm's makeshift chicken pen, where scores of fluffy chicks chirped like mad on the parched field.\Steyer waved to a worker named Annie. ""Her daughter got married here a year ago,"" he said. ""As her wedding gift, she raised and killed 100 chickens for the wedding dinner.""\The chickens feast on the insects attracted by the cattle herd's manure. Self-sustainability is religion here. The billionaires who own the place won't even buy food for the fish that swim around its aquaponic vegetable growing tanks. Instead, they have a partnership with a firm called Inka Biospheric Systems, which recycles waste on the farm into homemade fish food.\By trade, Taylor is the leader of a community bank oriented toward low-income borrowers, but she talks about potential for green innovation in farming with the granular detail of a doctoral student in agricultural science. Conversation with her jumps from nematodes to rhizomes to how ""the animals stamping with their hooves and manuring stimulates the microbial community to get ever busier.""\As they strolled through the postcard-pretty property, Steyer would chime in every so often to bring the conversation back to 60,000 feet.\""There are huge questions here,"" he said from across the large table in one of the outbuildings that didn't look like much from the outside, but inside could have been the photo shoot set for a Restoration Hardware catalog. ""This could be a very good thing, or it could be a very bad thing. Determining what it actually means in the real world, not what people hope it means or fear it means, is pretty important.""\The couple initially purchased the ranch in 2002 to help preserve the landscape, provide educational opportunities for local students and boost the farm-to-fork movement.\Its previous owners were an Austrian count and countess who held parties and family reunions on the property until the count died of a heart attack and the countess was too heartbroken to return. It fell into terrible disrepair, Taylor said, used as a dumping ground for cars and other objects, its topsoil stripped and sold.\The vision for the land evolved as Taylor and Steyer grew increasingly interested in conservation theory that holds that herds of large, heavy animals like bison running across the earth had once helped churn rich plant material into the soil, creating a hospitable environment for what Taylor calls a ""massively symbiotic symphony of nature.""\Regardless of whether the grazing technique helps the environment, the couple know it is not going to be widely embraced unless it makes business sense. The audit will examine whether the practice can be scaled beyond boutique operations like Leftcoast Grassfed, the ranch's organic beef business that serves mostly farm-to-fork enthusiasts.\""You can think of this ranch as a big scientific experiment,"" Steyer said. ""We have the hypothesis and we are trying to rigorously test and measure it.""\Agriculture will be refashioned in the coming decades, predicts Ellison, who has been more circumspect about his plans for Lanai. His desalination project, he told an Oracle conference last year, ""is supposed to be a model for the next generation.""\Out in Arizona, Buffett's approach is decidedly less radical.\He's a firm believer that the chemicals and other products made by giant companies like Archer Daniels Midland -- where he once worked -- are essential to growing enough food, particularly on increasingly parched land.\Buffett is the son of a billionaire investor, but his passion is not high finance -- it's farming. He's been a farmer for decades. The foundation he created, funded with some $2 billion from his father, is focused on global food security and sustainability.\Key to his work on the Arizona exhibition farm are Ike and Earl, the oxen. They were not easy to find, Buffett said, as the only practical purpose for oxen in America tends to be for history buffs who want to demonstrate how life was lived in times past. ""I thought for a while we were the only ones in Arizona who had them,"" he said. ""But there is a guy a couple of hours from here, and he has all the old yokes and equipment and shows up at agriculture fairs.""\Like Steyer and Taylor, he says farmers need to adopt new thinking on what they do to their soil. He's an evangelist for no-till farming, in which fields are left unplowed and covered with plant residue to keep it nutrient-rich and lessen the need for synthetic fertilizers. Such soil, he says, is a sponge for carbon dioxide that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere and accelerate global warming.\""I can prove all day long that this works,"" he said. ""When someone argues with me, I just reverse the question. I ask what solutions they have. How are they going to help farmers survive climate change?""\--\evan.halper@latimes.com\@evanhalper"
60,"One of the key technologies that could help wean the globe off fossil fuel is probably at your fingertips or in your pocket right now: the battery.\If batteries can get better, cheaper and store more power safely, then electric cars and solar- or wind-powered homes become more viable -- even on cloudy days or when the wind isn't blowing. These types of technological solutions will be one of the more hopeful aspects of United Nations climate talks that begin next week in Paris.\""If you are serious about eliminating combustion of fossil fuels to power anything -- a house, a city, a state -- you can't do it without [energy] storage,"" which usually means batteries, said Jay Whitacre, a Carnegie Mellon University battery expert and inventor.\Former Vice President Al Gore, former U.S. Geological Survey chief (and current editor-in-chief of the journal Science) Marcia McNutt and others point to better batteries as one of the bright spots in the fight against climate change.\Although batteries have been around more than 200 years, this year the technology has amped up.\In October, an international team of scientists announced a breakthrough in overcoming major obstacles in next-generation energy storage and creating a battery that has five to 10 times the energy density of the best batteries on the market now. In September, Whitacre won a $500,000 invention prize for his eco-friendly water-oriented battery. And in April, Elon Musk announced plans for his Tesla Motors to sell high-tech batteries for homes with solar panels to store electricity for nighttime and cloudy day use, weaning the homes off dirtier power from the burning of coal, oil and gas.\""The pace of innovation does seem to be accelerating,"" said J.B. Straubel, chief technical officer and co-founder of Tesla with Musk. ""We're kind of right at the tipping point where the current performance and lifetime of batteries roughly equal that of fossil fuels. If you are able to double that, the prospects are huge.""\At its massive Nevada ""gigafactory,"" Tesla has started producing Powerwalls to store energy in homes. They can't make them fast enough for customers worldwide.\In November, a Texas utility announced it was giving wind-generated electricity free to customers at night because it couldn't be stored. That's where Tesla hopes to come in -- not just in cars, but in homes. Within 10 years, Straubel figures it will be considerably cheaper (and cleaner) to get energy through wind and solar power and store it with batteries than to use coal, oil or gas.\""What has changed is the Gigafactory,"" said Venkat Srinivasan, deputy director of the Joint Center for Energy Storage Research at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. ""Two years ago I didn't think anyone would have thought you'd invest $5 billion in a big [battery] factory.""'\Tesla is using existing technology, just mass producing and marketing it. That's one of two key changes in the field. The other is work to make the battery itself much more efficient.\Start with that lithium ion battery in your pocket. It was invented by John Goodenough, a professor at the University of Texas. His next task is a safer battery that uses sodium, a more plentiful element that can produce a faster charge.\""Now I hope to help free yourself from your dependence on fossil fuels,"" he said on the same October day he was awarded part of a $1-million innovation-in-alternative-fuels prize from Israel.\""I believe in the next year there will be a breakthrough,"" he said. ""I'm hopeful, but we're not there yet.""\Glenn Amatucci, director of the energy storage research group at Rutgers University, called it ""a race against time. Every day and every hour is critical in terms of getting an advance.""\But Goodenough is in a special hurry, working more than eight hours a day on his battery: He's 93.\There are many teams around the world working on breakthrough batteries of various types. One of the most promising materials is lithium oxygen, which theoretically could store five to 10 times the energy of a lithium ion battery, but various factors hurt its efficiency. Then, last month, a team led by Clare Grey at the University of Cambridge announced in the journal Science that they had, on a small scale, overcome one obstacle so that its efficiency could compete with lithium ion batteries.\The potential gains in this technology are high, but it is still at least seven years from commercial availability, Grey said.\At Carnegie Mellon and Aquion Energy, Whitacre is honing a water-oriented battery with sodium and carbon. Others are looking at magnesium.\Tesla's Straubel sees all sorts of battery possibilities.\""It's an ongoing revolution,"" Straubel said. ""It's a critical piece in the whole puzzle in how we stop burning fossil fuels completely.""\Credit: Associated Press"
61,"It was like the debut of a environmentally themed buddy cop drama, with a political odd couple joining together against a common foe.\In one chair was California's current governor, Jerry Brown, the cerebral Democrat known for dropping Latin phrases into Capitol news conferences.\In the other was his predecessor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Republican movie star who is fond of finding ways to compare political issues to his championship bodybuilding career.\It's hard to imagine two more different people serving back-to-back in the same political office, but on Sunday they sat for a joint interview to put a bipartisan spin on fighting climate change, a key issue for both of them.\""It's important for people to know that Republicans can work with Democrats and vice versa,"" Brown said.\Schwarzenegger added, ""That is a very important message for the international community, that they should not look at [climate change] in a political way.""\Both Brown and Schwarzenegger are in Paris for the United Nations summit, which is aimed at producing a new international accord for stemming global warming. It was a packed day for the current governor.\Before meeting with his predecessor, Brown led an event at the U.S. ambassador's residence in Paris. Fifteen leaders of cities, states and provinces from around the globe signed on to an agreement pledging to set tougher standards that national leaders are expected to agree to.\""Start signing,"" he told the local representatives, who let out a chuckle, picked up their pens and complied.\Called the Under 2 Memorandum of Understanding, the agreement seeks to keep global temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius. Brown helped devise the sub-national effort, which is expected to have 100 signatories by the end of the week.\Brown delayed his trip by a day to travel to San Bernardino in the wake of Wednesday's mass slayings. He arrived Saturday in Paris, where he plans to participate in nearly two dozen events related to the climate summit. On Monday he has half a dozen items on his schedule, among them a roundtable convened by California billionaire and philanthropist Tom Steyer that includes California business leaders.\Although the two California governors first bumped into each other Saturday night -- Brown was leaving a documentary screening; Schwarzenegger was signing autographs -- they met again Sunday at the Four Seasons.\In an upstairs meeting room, they sat next to each other with ornate coffee cups and a tray of pastries on the table in front of them. A documentary crew filmed as they spoke to reporters.\Brown was wearing a suit with no tie; Schwarzenegger wore a plaid sport coat and boots with the seal of California.\Although they said bipartisan consensus was possible, it's Schwarzenegger's Republican Party that has been the most opposed to taking any action on climate change, sometimes even denying it is happening.\Schwarzenegger said the lack of national action on the environment was a symptom of broader dysfunction.\""Is anything getting done in Washington?"" he said. Schwarzenegger signed into law the landmark 2006 legislation that created California's cap-and-trade program and provided the foundation for much of the state's efforts against climate change.\Brown has occasionally criticized Republican climate deniers as ""troglodytes,"" a word he used again during the interview. (Shortly before leaving for the trip, Brown wrote to officials in Texas and West Virginia and accused them of seeking to score political points in their recent attempt to cast doubt on the legality of one of President Obama's key climate change initiatives.)\""This is a creature that lives in caves,"" he said. ""As people hear that word, they're going to say, what does all that mean? And when they think about it, they may want to walk outside their caves and see the sunshine.""\After the interview, they headed to a restaurant for a reception for the summit's large California delegation.\As they exited the hotel, one bystander jumped ahead of Brown to get into position to take a picture of Schwarzenegger.\""Go ahead,"" Brown said.\Once at the reception, Schwarzenegger gave a speech that touted his solidarity with Brown on climate change.\Gesturing to the current governor, the former Mr. Olympia said, ""It is like one mind in two bodies.""\--\chris.megerian@latimes.com"
62,"California Atty. Gen. Kamala D. Harris is investigating whether Exxon Mobil Corp. repeatedly lied to the public and its shareholders about the risk to its business from climate change -- and whether such actions could amount to securities fraud and violations of environmental laws.\Harris' office is reviewing what Exxon Mobil knew about global warming and what the company told investors, a person close to the investigation said.\The move follows published reports, based on internal company documents, suggesting that during the 1980s and 1990s the company, then known as Exxon, used climate research as part of its planning and other business practices but simultaneously argued publicly that climate-change science was not clear cut.\Those documents were cited in stories by reporters for Columbia University Energy and Environmental Reporting Fellowship, published in partnership with the Los Angeles Times. The nonprofit InsideClimate News also published several stories based on the documents.\Shortly after the news reports, Harris' office launched the investigation in response to the findings, the person said. New York's attorney general also is investigating the oil company as a result of the published reports.\Exxon Mobil did not respond to several requests for comment made by telephone and email.\A spokesman for Harris declined to confirm the investigation.\U.S. Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Torrance), who has called on federal authorities to investigate Exxon Mobil, praised Harris' decision.\Lieu said the investigation means that any damages won from Exxon Mobil could benefit Californians.\""I commend ... Harris for taking this action,"" he said.\Lieu said he has sent letters to U.S. Atty. Gen. Loretta Lynch and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission calling for federal investigations of securities fraud and violations of racketeering, consumer protection, truth in advertising, public health, shareholder protection or other laws.\Lieu said he hopes the decision by Harris, representing a state with the eighth-largest economy in the world, will prompt other states and the Justice Department to investigate.\""I think this action will be taken very seriously by Exxon Mobil,"" Lieu said.\Richard Keil, an Exxon Mobil spokesman, previously said that the company denies any wrongdoing in regard to the climate-change reports.\""We unequivocally reject allegations that Exxon Mobil suppressed climate change research contained in media reports,"" Keil said in a statement issued in response to the letters sent in October by Lieu and Mark DeSaulnier (D-Concord). Keil issued a statement with the same quote in early November when the New York investigation became public.\Exxon Mobil continues to face calls from several current and former U.S. lawmakers for criminal investigations based on the media reports. They include Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Al Gore.\It is unclear what approach Harris intends to take in California's investigation.\Harris' office is casting a wide net and looking at a variety of issues, according to the person familiar with the matter.\Legal experts say the SEC requires that companies disclose the risks of climate change to their business operations but that the agency has taken almost no action to enforce it.\The moves by California and New York are seen as a step to fill that void.\Exxon Mobil already has received a subpoena for documents dating from 1977 from the office of Eric Schneiderman, New York's attorney general.\Schneiderman has at his disposal New York's Martin Act, a law that gives the state's attorney general broad power to prosecute companies for financial fraud.\Unlike federal securities law, the New York statute does not require the state to prove that a company intended to defraud -- only that it misrepresented relevant information or withheld it from investors.\The law applies to any company doing business in the state.\--\ivan.penn@latimes.com\Twitter: @ivanlpenn"

The film, directed by Alejandro G. Inarritu, follows the early 19th century trapper Hugh Glass as he seeks revenge for his son's murder and his own abandonment on the frontier.\His long-sought-after win was greeted by a heartfelt standing ovation by the appreciative crowd. DiCaprio seized the moment with a speech that was both personal and political.\DiCaprio thanked his brother in this endeavor, Tom Hardy, and the cinematic genius of Inarritu. But he also used his acceptance speech to talk about climate change, explaining that the production had to go to the tip of South America to find enough snow to complete ""The Revenant.""\""Climate change is real,"" he said. ""Let us not take this planet for granted. I do not take this evening for granted.""\DiCaprio had been nominated four other times before, thrice for lead actor, but it took his grueling role in ""The Revenant"" to push him over the top.\""Any time you're recognized it feels good, but especially for a film like this, which has been a different experience,"" DiCaprio, 41, told The Times in an interview before his win for the same role at the Golden Globes. ""I've made no qualms about saying that making this movie is the hardest thing I've ever had to endure.""\By any calibration, DiCaprio is one of the Hollywood's leading movie stars. Most of his films, including ""The Revenant,"" have been box-office hits and he's worked with some of the world's greatest directors, including Martin Scorsese, James Cameron and Inarritu.\DiCaprio, a Los Angeles native, was first nominated as a supporting actor for 1993's ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape?"" His role as the troubled young Arnie Grape earned widespread praise, and helped launch his remarkable career.\DiCaprio's prior Oscar snubs include one of the academy's most famous. He didn't get an acting nomination for ""Titanic,"" which won for best picture and director in 1998 and is still one of the highest-grossing films of all time.\His other acting nominations include nods for roles in 2004's ""The Aviator,"" 2006's ""Blood Diamond"" and 2013's ""The Wolf of Wall Street,"" for which he was also nominated as a producer for best picture.\However, other 2016 awards shows strongly hinted that this would be DiCaprio's year to finally land atop the Oscars for lead actor. He won the comparable prizes at this year's Golden Globes and Screen Actors Guild awards.\In the lead actor category this year he beat out Bryan Cranston in ""Trumbo,"" Matt Damon in ""The Martian,"" Michael Fassbender in ""Steve Jobs"" and Eddie Redmayne in ""The Danish Girl.""\The cast and crew of ""The Revenant"" endured a notably difficult shoot, using only natural light in frigid settings in Canada and South America.\DiCaprio also had the populist wind at his back.

""We'll have to see what the FBI says about it.""\In response, Clinton called Trump an ""unqualified loose cannon.""\""He's talking about breaking up our alliances, letting more countries get nuclear weapons, banning all Muslims from coming to America,"" she said.

66,"In advance of a political showdown in the state Legislature, Gov. Jerry Brown's administration has made its first formal effort to extend the life of the program central to California's bid to combat climate change.\The California Air Resources Board, which is controlled by the governor, released a plan that would continue the state's cap-and-trade program to cut carbon emissions beyond 2020, the date when the program currently expires.\Cap-and-trade functions by forcing companies to buy permits in order to pollute, providing a financial incentive for power plants, oil refineries, manufacturers and other businesses to reduce their emissions. Money from the program finances high-profile projects, such as the state's bullet train and electric car subsidies, alongside other efforts to cut pollution, particularly in disadvantaged communities.\The new plan would provide stronger links to similar programs in Canada, better align with federal clean-power standards and give the state a mechanism to meet Brown's aggressive greenhouse gas reduction targets through at least 2030, according to a report from the board.\""Despite California's marked progress, greater innovation and effort is needed to avoid the worst consequences of climate change,"" the report said.\The plan released Tuesday represents somewhat of an insurance policy in case the governor and lawmakers fail to reach a deal next month that would cut through the many political and legal challenges facing the cap-and-trade program.\Brown wants new legislation to extend cap-and-trade beyond 2020 and is negotiating with oil companies, part of an expected major debate over the issue when the Legislature returns from recess in August.\An extension of the cap-and-trade program might also require approval from two-thirds of lawmakers, the threshold required to approve new taxes. Doing so would insulate cap-and-trade from pending legal arguments that contend it's currently an unconstitutional tax because the original 2006 law to authorize the program passed with only a majority vote.\Clearing any legislative hurdle is a tall order, with previous efforts to expand the state's climate change programs opposed not only by Republicans, but also business-aligned Democrats in the Assembly. Should a new law not pass, the plan released Tuesday formalizes Brown's intention to continue cap-and-trade, albeit with less legal certainty.\Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de Leon (D-Los Angeles) praised Brown and the Air Resources Board for moving to continue cap-and-trade, but said the Legislature also needs to act.\""The governor is doing his job,"" De Leon said after a Tuesday news conference in Sacramento to tout the clean energy industry. ""Now it's time that the Legislature do its job by making sure that we bring predictability, that we stabilize the markets, that we continue to invest in vulnerable communities throughout the state of California.""\Beyond the political and legal wrangling over cap-and-trade, the program has faced financial problems. The cap-and-trade auction in May produced only $2.5 million in revenue instead of the $150 million that state officials had expected. Tuesday's plan aims to create greater certainty for investors about the climate program's future.\The 14-person Air Resources Board -- all but two members are appointed by Brown -- must still sign off on the cap-and-trade extension before it takes effect. A final vote is expected in spring 2017.\--\liam.dillon@latimes.com\Twitter: @dillonliam\Times staff writer Patrick McGreevy contributed to this report."
67,"A controversial measure to extend California's target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions was approved by the Assembly on Tuesday, clearing a major hurdle in a battle at the Capitol over the future of the state's environmental programs.\White House officials and Gov. Jerry Brown cranked up the pressure on Assembly members to support the legislation, while oil industry lobbyists huddled with sympathetic lawmakers in an attempt to stall an effort that once seemed unlikely to gain traction this year.\The legislation would require slashing greenhouse gas emissions to 40% below 1990 levels by 2030, an easier target than the current goal of hitting 1990 levels by 2020.\""When it's all said and done, this is a simple bill, but an extremely significant one,"" said Assemblyman Eduardo Garcia (D-Coachella), who introduced the measure on the floor. ""It represents a new chapter of the state's climate policy.""\The measure, Senate Bill 32, must receive a final vote in the Senate before it can go to Gov. Jerry Brown for his signature. It is the sequel to Assembly Bill 32, a landmark 2006 law that laid the groundwork for California's extensive array of environmental initiatives, including the cap-and-trade program, which provides a financial incentive to reduce emissions by forcing companies to buy permits to pollute.\""Today's action sends an unmistakable signal to investors of California's commitment to clean energy and clean air,"" said a statement from state Sen. Fran Pavley (D-Agoura Hills), who wrote both measures.\The issue has been the subject of intense lobbying in Sacramento, especially after signals this month from Brown and some lawmakers that there may not be enough political support to pass the measure before the end of the legislative session Aug. 31.\After the vote, Brown issued a statement referencing Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who has called climate change a hoax, and thanking lawmakers for ""rejecting the brazen deception of the oil lobby and their Trump-inspired allies who deny science and fight every reasonable effort to curb global warming.""\Assemblyman Ken Cooley (D-Rancho Cordova), one of more than a dozen Assembly members who supported the legislation Tuesday after abstaining or voting against it last year, said he's confident lawmakers will have greater say over state regulations than they have in the past. White House officials reached out to Cooley and a few of his colleagues recently to talk to them about supporting the measure, he said.\""It just signals that clearly the White House views the leadership of California as an important part of a global conversation,"" he said. ""It rose to the level where they were looking to reach out to members.""\Democratic donor and environmentalist Tom Steyer was also in the Capitol during Tuesday's debate talking to lawmakers.\""You're dancing to the flute of a rich hedge-fund billionaire who is running for governor,"" Assemblyman James Gallagher (R-Plumas Lake) told his colleagues who were supporting the legislation, a nod toward Steyer's rumored political ambition.\Steyer said it was only a coincidence that he was present Tuesday. Asked about Gallagher's comment, he said, ""Normally when I hear something like that, I think, 'Wow, those guys have run out of actual arguments and now they're trying to sling dirt.' ""\Oil companies and manufacturers that opposed the legislation are now turning their attention to a related measure, Assembly Bill 197, which would increase legislative oversight of regulators and crack down on pollution from refineries and other sources.\If it's blocked, the new emissions reduction target from Senate Bill 32 won't take effect.\Despite some concerns from fellow Democrats, Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon (D-Paramount) said his caucus would support Assembly Bill 197, which is scheduled for a hearing Wednesday morning.\""It's really about oversight, it's really about accountability,"" he said.\Tuesday's vote came shortly after the latest report of revenues collected under cap and trade.\In the program, permits are traded on a market or sold in an auction. Although overall demand for permits increased, revenue is expected to be less than $10 million, even lower than the dismal results from the May auction.\Supporters have noted that revenue is not the best way to measure the success of a program intended to lower emissions, but the money has become an important part of the political conversation. Brown is counting on some of the money to help pay for the bullet train from L.A. to San Francisco, and lawmakers are working on plans to divvy up the rest among projects in their districts.\Rendon said he hopes approving new legislation this year will restore some confidence to the cap-and-trade market.\""We're trying to let people know that we're dedicated to battling climate change in California and that what this program has done for the economy, it's going to continue to do so for quite some time,"" he said.\However, the legislation would not address legal uncertainty stemming from a lawsuit over whether the cap-and-trade program has amounted to an unconstitutional tax. Eliminating that concern would require a two-thirds vote in each house of the Legislature, the threshold needed to approve taxes and fees.\Catherine Reheis-Boyd, president of the Western States Petroleum Assn., said in a statement that problems will only worsen because the measure advanced Tuesday ""fails to address fixes to cap-and-trade, which sends the wrong signals to the market.""\The Brown administration has said more work will be necessary -- possibly with a ballot measure in 2018 -- to address the issue.\""Shoring up the cap-and-trade program -- either through the Legislature or by the voters -- will provide that certainty and will continue billions in funding for vital programs, especially in disadvantaged communities with the dirtiest air,"" said a statement from Nancy McFadden, a top aide to Brown.\--\chris.megerian@latimes.com\melanie.mason@latimes.com\liam.dillon@latimes.com"

69,"Plant hundreds of millions of trees. Drastically reduce the burning of fossil fuels for electricity and transportation. Perfect and employ new technology to capture and store carbon.\These are among the aggressive steps that U.S. officials outlined Wednesday as probably necessary to limit the worst effects of climate change. Presented at the United Nations climate conference in Marrakech, Morocco, the proposal has a futuristic name that evokes its ambition: The Mid-Century Strategy for Deep Decarbonization.\The outline is not a formal policy but a road map showing ways the U.S. can reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change by at least 80% below 2005 levels by the year 2050. That would significantly escalate the Obama administration's current plan to reduce emissions between 26% and 28% by 2025.\The strategy would depend on a blend of technological advances, market forces and government policies -- and that blend can be flexible depending on how all three evolve and which ones work best. Here are some highlights from the 111-page report:\Slashing fossil fuels and rapidly expanding renewable energy\The largest gains, by far, in reducing greenhouse-gas emissions would come from rapidly scaling down the use of fossil fuels to provide electricity for homes, buildings and industry, and fuel for transportation. (Read: electric vehicles are the future.) This would be done by expanding wind, solar and nuclear power, modernizing the electric grid to make it more flexible to transmit new forms of energy and expanding regional plans that put a price on carbon, such as California's cap-and-trade program. The plan proposes doubling current levels of investment in clean energy technology by 2050.\Sequestering carbon\This would require a blend of changes in land use to increase the so-called land sink that captures carbon naturally and through new technologies that could capture carbon emissions.\The report projects that the U.S. would need to add about 50 million acres of forests, vastly expanding the volume of trees that can store carbon that is emitted into the air. For perspective, the Tongass National Forest in Alaska, the country's largest national forest, is about 26 million acres. The plan says this could be done on federal land and through policies that encourage private landowners to plant forests. It also says that farming can be improved to increase carbon sequestration in fields and that urban growth must be controlled to limit land loss.\The report proposes new investment in experimental technologies that would remove carbon from the air, but it emphasizes that these mechanisms must not have damaging side effects. If they are not successful, the goals of the plan potentially could be met through reductions from other efforts.\Reduce non-carbon emissions that contribute to climate change\This includes methane, which is often released in the production of natural gas and oil. (Just this week, the Obama administration finalized new rules intended to reduce methane leaks in energy production.) It also includes reducing nitrogen-based fertilizers and finding ways to reduce methane from livestock farming. It also presumes reductions in hydrofluorocarbons, which are emitted from air conditioners and refrigerants.\The Trump factor\The report has been developed over many months, long before Donald Trump became president-elect. He has called climate change a hoax and said he would ""cancel"" the Paris climate accord. It notes that the Obama administration has taken substantial action to reduce emissions, but it also emphasizes that future administrations will have to do their part.\--\william.yardley@latimes.com"
70,"Climate change could supercharge the powerful storms often hailed for bringing drought-busting rains to California.\The storms, called atmospheric rivers, are long stretches of water vapor that ""flow"" from the tropics up to the West Coast. In California, they can deliver up to half of the state's annual precipitation in just 10 to 15 days, as well as destructive floods and landslides. Sometimes, the deluges from atmospheric rivers can deal ecological damage too.\A new study describes how a series of atmospheric rivers in the winter of 2010-11 contributed to a massive die-off in the San Francisco Bay's struggling oyster population. The findings, published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, are the first to demonstrate the ecological impacts of the storms -- an example of the extreme climatic events expected to increase in size and frequency with climate change.\In California, climate models project that both intense droughts and floods, linked to strengthening El Nino and La Nina events, will increase by 50% by the end of the century. The reasoning is warmer air has an increased capacity to store moisture and energy, which could be unleashed in the form of bigger and badder storms.\While some ecological effects of climate change have been well-documented -- such as warmer temperatures driving range shifts in plants and animal species -- the impacts of extreme weather have proved difficult to study because of their unpredictable nature. However, scientists may have seen a preview of what's to come over five years ago.\On March 16, 2011, torrents of freshwater discharged into the San Francisco Bay from the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. At its peak, 220,000 cubic feet of water rushed into the bay per second. The influx coincided with a drop in the bay's salinity, which proved catastrophic for the little Olympia oyster.\A previous study tested the range of environmental conditions -- such as air and water temperature, acidity, dissolved oxygen and salinity -- in which oysters can survive. Oysters match their internal body salinity with their external environment -- when the surrounding water gets less salty, they seal themselves up. They can stay this way for about eight days, until they asphyxiate or build up too much waste in their bodies.\Before the deluge, China Camp State Park was home to one of the most abundant populations of the mollusks in the northern San Francisco Bay, with about 180 oysters per square foot stuck to the shoreline and below the tide. (That's 30 times more oysters than in the second-most populated site.)\The numerous China Camp oysters likely provided other populations around the bay with ""recruits"" -- larval oysters that float through the water until they find a hard surface to latch onto and grow.\In the 1850s, the booming population along the West Coast -- especially in San Francisco -- could not get enough of the little oysters, which have a coppery taste compared with those often served in restaurants today.\Around the late 1800s or early 1900s, the fishery collapsed, and people began farming Pacific oysters introduced from Asia. The West Coast's only native oyster species, the once-abundant bivalve has struggled to recover since.\For many years, the San Francisco Bay has been the site of ambitious oyster restoration projects. Government agencies and environmental groups hope the filter-feeding, reef-building bivalves could protect the shoreline from erosion and sea level rise, as well as reinvigorate the underwater ecosystem.\But the findings this week suggest more trouble could be in store for the diminutive Olympia oyster as climate change threatens to bring supercharged precipitation events to Northern California.\The March 2011 event wasn't the biggest freshwater discharge into the bay -- storms in January 1997 and January 2006 dumped 16,000 and 10,000 cubic meters per second into the bay, respectively. Although oyster data from that time is sparse, surveys found a relatively abundant population at China Camp in 2003. A November 2006 count found no living oysters, but many shells belonging to the dead mollusks.\--\sean.greene@latimes.com"
71,"Although California's leaders may protest President Trump's announcement Tuesday that he's scrapping the Clean Power Plan, his decision is expected to have little effect on a state already marching toward renewable energy.\In fact, greenhouse gas emissions from electricity generation in the Golden State are already below what the federal government would have required by 2030, and they're expected to drop even further.\""Rollback of the Clean Power Plan is pretty much irrelevant to California,"" said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist who has advised state leaders on climate regulations.\\The federal rules, enacted by former President Obama as part of his campaign against climate change, were intended to push states away from coal and toward cleaner energy sources. But that was already underway in California. Los Angeles, one of the last places in the state to rely on coal, was already planning to stop importing electricity from out-of-state coal plants by 2025.\In addition, state law requires California to generate half of its electricity from renewable sources such as solar and wind by 2030, and state Senate leader Kevin de Leon (D-Los Angeles) has suggested pushing even further.\When it comes to fighting pollution and climate change, there are some areas where California relies on the federal government. For example, they share authority on regulating vehicle emissions, and Trump's preparation to roll back federal rules has caused alarm here. However, there's less of a concern when it comes to generating electricity.\Trump's moves have caused some anxiety among California companies that are developing clean-energy technologies and looking for new markets to sell them.\Bob Keefe, executive director of Environmental Entrepreneurs, said the Clean Power Plan would have been ""a huge economic catalyst.""\""President Trump is basically telling California's more than 40,000 clean-energy businesses and the 500,000 workers they employ that they don't matter to him,"" he said.\It's an open question how Trump could affect various efforts for California to integrate its electricity grid with neighboring states, an idea that has failed to gain traction so far. Advocates of the concept say regional cooperation could expand the market for renewable energy, but the lack of federal pressure to cut emissions could dampen enthusiasm in places such as Utah and Wyoming, which rely on coal.\""They don't have the Clean Power Plan bearing down on them,"" said Don Furman, who directs the Fix the Grid campaign that's seeking closer relationships among West Coast states.\Ralph Cavanagh, an attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said he didn't expect changes to the Clean Power Plan to harm efforts to create a regional electricity grid, because of the falling cost of renewable energy.\""The rationale is stronger today than it was yesterday,"" he said.\--\chris.megerian@latimes.com\Twitter: @chrismegerian\"

""I think I've done 75 seven-minute interviews -- Japan, Russia, Brazil, everywhere.\""The day before yesterday I was live on [the French cable channel] Canal Plus when the interpreter talking in my earpiece was evacuated from his building because of a bomb scare. The questioner was going a mile a minute in French, but because of those 75 seven-minute interviews, I picked up enough key words to fight my way through it.""\Gore has been concerned with climate change since he took a class with pioneering global warming theorist Roger Revelle as a college student in the 1960s. Not only did Gore ""never imagine when I was a young man that this would become an all-consuming body of work for me,"" he also never anticipated that the work would involve the movies.\More than that, he was frankly dubious about both of his films.\""I was quite reluctant to do the first film for a foolish reason. Honestly, this will sound silly to you,"" he says. ""When I was a student, trying to take a shortcut in a Shakespeare class, I would pop in videotapes of plays that had been filmed and found it didn't work. I was afraid translating my climate change slide show to a movie might produce a similar result.""\Gore was skeptical about doing ""An Inconvenient Sequel"" for a different reason.\""I had doubts you could tell essentially the same story again with any hope of success,"" he explains. ""Once again I was dead wrong.""\A pair of factors, Gore explains, made the difference with the new film, co-directed by Bonni Cohen and Jon Shenk. First was the fly-on-the wall / cinema verite philosophy of the filmmakers, who for two years shadowed their protagonist everywhere, even watching as he changed soaking-wet socks.\""You forget they're there,"" he says, ""to the point where when I saw the movie there were a lot of scenes where I had no idea or no memory of them having filmed it, which was a little uncomfortable.""\The other factor was Gore's belief that ""though the crisis is worse, we now have the solutions we need"" in wind and solar power, whose costs are dropping dramatically as use increases.\One of the film's high points, in fact, is Gore's visit to Georgetown, Texas, ""the reddest city in the reddest county"" in that notoriously red state, a place that for strictly economic reasons now gets all its energy from wind and solar.\""I love that scene,"" he says. ""So many people who would never ever want to use the phrase 'global warming' are now looking at the economic practicalities, at the hard-nosed economic rationale for the change. It's being fought, but the buggy whip makers made a similar effort a century ago.""\Though Gore doesn't like to dwell on it, he admits he is not tireless, that there's an exhaustion factor to all the work and travel he does.\As you might suspect, friends and family do tell him not to work so hard, to take some time off.\His response: ""I will do that soon. We're almost there.""\Do they roll their eyes?\""Yes, and maybe mutter, 'I've heard that before.' ""\Gore perseveres because of ""the sense of mission, if you'll forgive an overly lofty word,"" he says. ""It's a privilege to have a task that justifies pouring every ounce of energy into it, that creates a sense of joy, that gives energy back.

73,"The pioneers who built Seattle polluted and plumbed the lower Duwamish River for a century, straightening its wild curves and saturating its sediment with toxic chemicals from an asphalt plant, Boeing manufacturing facilities and other industries.\The damage was so severe that the last five miles of the river before it empties into Elliott Bay were designated a federal Superfund cleanup site in 2001 -- an official stamp of devastation that came all too late in the view of Native American tribes that once fished for salmon here.\Now, even as progress has been made in the $342-million cleanup, the river and the effort to clean it face a new threat: climate change. Scientists say that rising seas could flood riverbanks by midcentury and that potential increases in storm-water runoff and downstream flows could bore into sediment and release toxins sealed below.\\The challenges are not isolated to the Duwamish. Experts say that Superfund sites across the country -- including Portland Harbor in Oregon, naval bases in Virginia and landfills in the Midwest -- are at risk from the increasingly extreme weather and rising sea levels associated with climate change, and that methods for cleaning them may need to be rethought.\Under President Obama, the Environmental Protection Agency began doing just that, proposing technical guidelines in 2015 to make Superfund cleanups more resilient to climate change.\Yet how the Trump administration will address the dual threat of past and future is unclear.\Scott Pruitt, the new EPA chief, has said cleaning up Superfund sites is at the top of his ""back to basics"" approach for the agency. He has promised to streamline the process, including by getting directly involved with large projects.\Like President Trump, Pruitt questions the scientific consensus that human activity is driving climate change. He has had information about climate science removed from the EPA's website and played a prominent role in Trump's recent decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\Environmental groups worry Pruitt will favor inexpensive methods that fail to withstand the test of time.\""Climate change impacts everything,"" said Gregg Small, executive director of the nonprofit Climate Solutions, based in Seattle. ""You cannot solve any problem if you are not dealing with climate change, because it exacerbates every other problem in the environment.""\The Superfund program was once among the nation's highest-profile environmental efforts. For four decades, it has identified and sought to remediate sites contaminated by industrial waste, runoff, mining, chemical use and other types of pollution.\Rivers and ports have frequently been designated Superfund sites, as have older manufacturing locations. Cleanups may involve removing acres of contaminated soil and replacing it with healthy soil, ""capping"" a site with a layer of new soil, or letting nature slowly break down pollutants.\But an increasing understanding of climate change presented new questions. Would capped toxins at a Superfund site stay sealed in more extreme weather? What if storm water surged into an area more powerfully than in the past? What if floods forecast to occur once in a century happened once every couple decades?\""A system that was designed for remedial action under one set of circumstances may fail completely under other circumstances,"" said Peter deFur, a Virginia-based consultant on Superfund cleanups.\""Nobody knows what Pruitt means by 'back to basics,'"" he said. ""If it means requiring air permits, water permits, cleaning up Superfund sites -- that's great, we want to do that. But if 'back to basics' means forgetting about climate change, we're going to fail.""\Those concerns have also been raised within the EPA. On March 28, Michael Cox, a longtime climate change expert for the agency, helped lead a workshop on how the climate might affect the cleanup of the Duwamish. Three days later, Cox retired -- and made his feelings known in a blistering open letter to Pruitt that was circulated widely within the agency and eventually made it to the news media.\""You will continue to undermine your credibility and integrity with EPA staff, and the majority of the public, if you continue to question this basic science of climate change,"" Cox wrote.\In an interview this month, Cox said prioritizing Superfund cleanups could not be separated from accepting climate science.\""If we're spending hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars on cleanups, I sure hope we're looking out 50, 60, 70 years to make sure they are resilient to the changing climate,"" he said. ""Why in the heck would we spend close to half a billion dollars on something that's not going to stand up over time? It doesn't make any sense.""\Dave Schuchardt, the Superfund program manager for Seattle Public Utilities, was among dozens of federal, state and local officials who attended the March workshop. Schuchardt said in an interview that stronger storm and river flows projected under climate change can ""scour"" away at layers of soil intended to seal in toxins.\""As we work through that set of decision points, we'll want to consider how this particular river might be affected by climate change and how it might or might not affect the scouring situation,"" Schuchardt said.\EPA officials in Washington did not respond to repeated requests for comment for this story.\Dagmar Cronn, who lives in a house overlooking the Duwamish, spent two years watching Boeing spend millions removing waste from the river. She said she was pleased with the work, even as she has seen the river wash away trees on her bank and erode her property.\But Cronn, 70, also imagined unprecedented sea levels and storm flows churning the riverbed and the toxins it contains. ""They could all be picked up and carried God knows where,"" she said.\Caption: PHOTO: A STRETCH of the Duwamish River in Seattle is listed as a Superfund site.

74,"It has been a decade since Al Gore released ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" the Oscar-winning documentary that catapulted the onetime presidential candidate to the front lines of climate change activism. Now he's back with ""An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power,"" which follows the former vice president as he travels the world to talk about global warming.\He spoke Monday at an event organized by the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco.\Gore didn't neglect the big news in California: Last week, lawmakers voted to extend the state's cap-and-trade program, the centerpiece of its fight against global warming. The vote was noteworthy not only because it solidified the only program of its kind in the country, but also because it received bipartisan support.\\Gov. Jerry Brown, who has been seeking the mantle of global climate leadership, was a driving force behind the measure. ""He just got this amazing legislative victory last week,"" Gore said.\For some people, Gore's public image is inseparable from his dire predictions on climate change from ""An Inconvenient Truth."" But he's also looking on the bright side by highlighting approaches that can stem the potential devastation of global warming. Some of that optimism was on display Monday.\""We're going to win this,"" Gore said when talking about avoiding catastrophic effects of climate change. At another point, he said: ""The U.S. is likely to meet the commitments made by former President Obama regardless of Donald Trump.""\That's an optimistic reading of the landscape. Under the Paris accord, the U.S. needs to reduce emissions at least 26% below 2005 levels by 2020. But now it's on course for a reduction of 19% or less, according to an analysis from the Rhodium Group, a research organization that tracks climate policies.\The San Francisco crowd broke out in laughter when the moderator, Greg Dalton of the Climate One discussion forum, asked Gore, ""Are more Republicans in Congress in the gay closet or the climate closet?""\Gore said many Republicans know climate change is a threat but ""they're scared to death"" of primary challenges ""if they depart from the orthodoxy.""\""I think the dam may break soon,"" he said.\Gore drew a connection between climate activism and other social movements that faced resistance. ""The climate denial is no more ferocious than the resistance to civil rights in the South,"" he said. ""And yet, it gave way.""\--\chris.megerian@latimes.com\Caption: PHOTO: A DECADE after releasing his Oscar-winning documentary ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" Al Gore is back with ""An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power.""\PHOTOGRAPHER:Michael Nigro Sipa USA"
75,"As rains fell and floodwaters rose in Houston, President Trump took to Twitter with an ""oh, gosh"" tweet: ""Wow - Now experts are calling #Harvey a once in 500 year flood! We have an all out effort going, and going well!""\How refreshing it is when the president directs our attention to the words of experts -- people who ascertain facts, study the issues, dissect the causes of problems, and put their biases and suppositions aside to figure out solutions.\If Trump himself were to consult the experts -- such as, you know, climate scientists -- he would learn that global warming is real. He'd also learn that although warming did not cause Hurricane Harvey, it certainly makes such storms stronger, more unpredictable and quicker to intensify. Experts -- there's that word again -- say that warmer air temperatures mean more evaporation of moisture from the seas to the skies, and thus more rainfall from storms. Warmer seas -- including the Gulf of Mexico -- intensify storms, from their size to their wind speeds, and amplify storm surges. (In southeast Texas, the flat geography allows a surging Gulf to intrude farther inland.)\\Another wrinkle, according to atmospheric scientist Michael E. Mann: Climate change modeling suggests that human-propelled global warming could lead to weaker prevailing winds and a jet stream tracking father north. And that appears to have been what led Harvey to park over southeast Texas and dump more than 40 inches of water in places rather than spreading the rain (and pain) around or drifting back out over the Gulf.\Trump flew to Corpus Christi early Tuesday for a personal look at the damage, caused primarily by winds and the surging Gulf. To his credit, the president opted not to visit Houston. Much of that area is still underwater, and a presidential drop-in would only tie up crucial assets necessary for rescuing people sheltering in sodden homes. But we hope that what he sees on his visit (or on TV) spurs some second thoughts about whether human activity -- namely, the burning of fossil fuels -- is creating a less habitable world. This week, with tens of thousands of people missing, stranded or in need of food, water or shelter, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott called Harvey ""one of the largest disasters America has ever faced.""\Ironically, the president two weeks ago rescinded Obama administration standards requiring the federal government to account for the impact of climate change when designing and building new infrastructure projects. Of course, that makes no difference to the current status of Houston, but Harvey's terrible impact certainly spotlights the foolishness of ignoring climate change. Experts (ahem) in Trump's own Pentagon know that climate change is real, and they recognize that more extreme heat, droughts, floods and famines threaten international stability while rising seas imperil military bases -- especially, of course, naval installations.\But rising seas also threaten civilian shipping ports, coastal neighborhoods and sensitive freshwater estuaries. Saline ocean water is already seeping into the Everglades, threatening the freshwater supply of millions of people in southern Florida. Infrastructure must be adapted to account for such changes. And not just in the U.S. Globally, populations in coastal zones are increasing faster than in inland areas, and many of the world's megacities are built on coasts or in low-lying deltas.\This is the hot, hard reality the world faces, and as we've noted before, Trump, along with his Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt, Energy Secretary Rick Perry and other proponents of increasing fossil fuel production, are leading the nation in a dangerous direction. This can't be written off as merely an issue of honest policy differences; their beliefs and agenda imperil the health and safety of the people they have sworn to protect. As difficult as it might be for someone so incapable of introspection and reevaluation, the president needs to understand that he has subscribed to fake science, and that he must alter his course.\We remain optimistic that other actors -- the nations of the world, states such as California and local governments, corporations and consumers -- will continue to change their behaviors to help confront the problem. But this would be a far more winnable battle if the world wasn't also forced to fight ignorance in the White House, and a president content to whistle past the flooded graveyard.\\"
76,"Big deadly fires are nothing new to California, particularly during fire season when the Santa Ana or Diablo winds blow hot and dry, making tinder out of trees and bushes that have been baking all summer long.\But the firestorm now raging through Northern California isn't the typical wildfire. For one thing, it's not just one fire but close to two dozen. For another, these fires are not only threatening hard-to-reach rural or mountains area, but they also have torn through suburban neighborhoods. More than 3,500 homes, commercial buildings and other structures have been reduced to ash. The Tubbs fire jumped across the 101 Freeway in Santa Rosa, for heaven's sake.\The flames moved so fast that they caught people unaware and unprepared to flee. As of Wednesday, when the wind picked up and shifted the flames toward more populated communities, the death toll stood at 21 people, with more than 500 still missing. By Thursday morning, fire officials believe, some of the individual fires may meet and merge into one mega-fire.\\At this point the fires rank collectively as the deadliest blaze in California since the Oakland Hills fire in 1991, which claimed 25 lives. The fires also have burned more structures than the Oakland Hills fire, the Cedar fire that raged through rural communities in San Diego County in 2003, or the Station fire that burned through the Angeles National Forest in 2009. When this is over, it may well be the state's worst fire catastrophe in recorded history by any measure.\This is not just bad luck. Coming on the heels of other large-scale natural disasters -- Houston inundated by a slow-moving tropical storm, swaths of Florida and the Caribbean ripped to shreds by a monster hurricane, much of Puerto Rico leveled by an equally powerful hurricane, a handful of Western states swept by massive fires that burned up millions of acres -- one can't help but see a disturbing pattern emerge. Those superstorms that scientists warned would result from climate change? They are here. The day of reckoning isn't in the future. It is now.\We don't yet know what started the fires in Northern California, but we have a good idea of what made them so destructive. Authorities blame a combination of factors: winds so strong they knocked down power lines, extremely dry conditions, and an abundant supply of combustible material from a years-long drought that killed millions of the state's trees or left them vulnerable to insect infestations. Ironically, this year's unusually rainy winter probably contributed to the problem by producing burnable new growth.\All of those factors are exacerbated by the warming world. Hotter summers yield more fuel for fires and stronger winds to fan the flames. And this summer was California's hottest on record, a milestone dramatically illustrated when San Francisco hit 106 degrees on Sept. 1 during a statewide heat wave.\Similarly, scientists say climate change doesn't cause hurricanes, but it can make them bigger and more destructive. Higher air temperatures mean more evaporation and heavier rains outside of drought zones, and warmer seas intensify the size and fury of the storms themselves. It's a double whammy that has contributed to an unusually severe hurricane season this year.\Burning fossil fuels is not the only human activity that aids and abets the destruction wrought by wildfires and hurricanes. So does the relentless march of humans to develop land in danger spots -- a 500-year flood plain, an unstable hillside or a historical fire corridor. And in California, aggressive fire suppression has impeded the natural burn cycle in the state's wooded areas so that there's more fuel when the massive fires do take hold.\""These kinds of catastrophes have happened and they'll continue to happen."" Gov. Jerry Brown observed at a news briefing Wednesday. ""That's the way it is with a warming climate, dry weather and reducing moisture.""\California is fortunate to have a governor who understands the perils of ignoring climate change and is aggressively pushing policies to mitigate its future harm. Unfortunately, that puts him at odds with a head-in-the-sand president who blithely disregards the obvious connection between the warming climate and the multiple federal disaster areas he's been forced to declare in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico and, now, California.\\"
77,"It has been a year of flood and fire for the American city. In late summer, Houston virtually disappeared under water as Hurricane Harvey dumped 33 trillion gallons on U.S. soil. Not long after, with the deadly wine-country fires barely out, Los Angeles, Ventura, Santa Barbara and San Diego counties caught fire, burned and kept burning. The Thomas fire, which started near Santa Paula, is now the fifth largest by acreage in California history -- and within shouting distance of the biggest ever.\In a certain sense these disasters seem familiar, or at least regionally appropriate. Houston, a city whose bayous thread through its neighborhoods like veins, is fundamentally a wet place. Los Angeles, accustomed to bracing for fire as soon as the Santa Anas begin to blow, is fundamentally an arid one -- if not quite ""a desert that faces an ocean,"" as Carey McWilliams put it with slight exaggeration, then certainly a landscape that spends each year getting drier and more flammable as the months pass.\What's changed is the numbing regularity of these events, the way they crowd together on the calendar in much the same way wildfires have been crowding together on the map of Southern California in recent weeks. (And the way they spread out on the calendar too: It used to be the case that by December the Santa Anas were done for the year. This year they revved up just as Angelenos were pulling boxes of Christmas lights from the attic.) Thanks to the combination of climate change and several decades of American overconfidence about planning and land use, we're on the doorstep of an era when dramatic disasters, floods and wildfires chief among them, threaten to become routine.\\What do I mean by ""overconfidence""? I mean that in nearly every corner of the country we have expanded our metropolitan regions into the path of, instead of away from, risk. Houston has for many decades seen nearly every flood plain as developable. Los Angeles has had the same attitude about many hillsides and canyons -- even some that have burned again and again for centuries on end.\That attitude is the flip side of American pragmatism. A can-do spirit can be a death sentence when the thing you're getting done is environmental folly. And the risks are simply higher now. One recent study found that hurricanes as strong as Harvey are three times as likely in the age of climate change as before; another estimated that climate change had increased that storm's rainfall by 38%. California's five biggest wildfires have all taken place in the last 14 years.\In an odd way we've already begun to adjust. One remarkable aspect of the recent wildfires has been the expectation among people in other parts of the country that with so much territory on fire and so much smoke in the air, life in Los Angeles must have come to a standstill. In fact, especially in the parts of the city east of big smoke plumes, life went on under blue skies and in pleasantly though not exceptionally warm temperatures. The fires barely put a dent in our routines.\On Labor Day weekend of 2005, less than a year after I started working as architecture critic for The Times, I flew to New Orleans to cover the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. I spent my nights there sleeping on the floor of a neon-lit sports bar inside the Hyatt Regency, the only big hotel in town with power.\For all of New Orleans' history of flooding, there was something that seemed exceptional about that disaster: about its scale, about the way the eye of the hurricane, instead of skirting the city as had happened so many times before, this time seemed to steer itself right toward the Superdome. It seemed a water-driven equivalent, in a certain way, of 9/11: a once-in-a-generation, or even once-in-a-lifetime, jolt to the regularity of city life.\I was wrong to see it that way, of course. Even within a couple of days of exploring New Orleans, my tattered and dog-eared copy of Peirce Lewis' seminal ""New Orleans: The Making of an Urban Landscape"" under my arm, it became clear that much of the destruction in and around the city was an example of urban-planning chickens coming home to roost. Beginning with the invention of a new pump in 1913 that made it possible to drain the swampy neighborhoods between the heart of New Orleans and Lake Pontchartrain, the city built aggressively in long-empty terrain. It made its housing stock absurdly vulnerable to the very flooding for which the city, much of which lies below sea level, has been famous since its founding.\To compound the effect of disasters and how we understand them, volatility is increasing in nearly every part of contemporary life. The chaos of flooding and fire is now redoubled by the chaos of the media and political landscapes. How do you make sense of the culture when the exceptional morphs into the predictable?\Last week, for example, all of the following things happened within a single 24-hour news cycle. A would-be suicide bomber, reportedly inspired by ISIS, tried to blow himself up in Manhattan. Mario Batali, a chef, and Ryan Lizza, a journalist, were the latest prominent men to be accused of sexual misconduct. Ed Lee, the mayor of San Francisco, died suddenly of a heart attack at age 65. And Alabama voters got ready to head to the polls in a wild special election for U.S. Senate -- a race featuring a Republican candidate whose Svengali, Stephen K. Bannon, promotes a political philosophy that has been aptly described as ""maximum chaos.""\As all of this was going on the seemingly inexhaustible Thomas Fire was creeping over some very dry hills and bearing down on the town of Carpinteria.\A few days earlier that fire, which began about 10 miles inland, reached the ocean near Ventura's Solimar Beach. That seemed a perfectly chilling way to mark the end of 2017. Fire, chewing up earth and fueled by fast-moving air, meeting water. The four classical elements all working together in service of Disaster, new patron saint of our increasingly vulnerable metropolitan regions.\--\christopher.hawthorne@latimes.com\Twitter: @HawthorneLAT\Caption: PHOTO: FIRE bears down on oceanfront homes north of Ventura on Dec. 6.

78,"
Numerous species already have enough to contend with as climate changes drive them out of their natural habitats; a new study shows that they also have to compete with each other in outrunning those changes.
\
The University of Connecticut study, to be published Wednesday in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, suggests that the effects of climate change on wildlife are a good deal more complicated than previously thought.
\
Mark Urban, an assistant professor of ecology and environmental biology who led the new research, said many studies conducted on climate change and its potential impact on wildlife feature complex meteorological models to predict changes in climate.
\
What they don't feature, he said, are equally complex models of how wildlife will react to those climate changes. Real-world factors -- the different rates at which animals migrate, how they prey on each other and how they get in each other's way -- need to be included for a more accurate picture.
\
""Those models are really simplistic, and they're not including certain things that are really important,"" Urban said. ""If we start looking at these complexities in predictive models, we will see striking differences in predictions.""
\
And, he said, some of those differences won't be for the better.
\
""When we add those changes, we're going to see some surprises, and some of those surprises won't be good ones,"" he said.
\
The study offers a new mathematical model that factors in migration rates and the intensity of competition from other species during migration.
\
As climates change, species disperse to friendlier habitats. But they disperse at different rates. Urban compares this to several species moving along a single-lane highway.
\
""What you don't want is a car that's really fast coming up from behind you,"" he said. Getting to a new environment is only half the battle. If another species has settled there first and is taking up limited space and consuming limited resources, the friendlier climate won't help much.
\
In other words, it's not enough to outrun changes in the climate; species have to do so faster than their competitors.
\
Differing dispersal rates will lead to entirely new relations among species, which also confounds predictions, he said. With climate changes, ecosystems are much more fluid and lead to what's known as ""no-analogue communities"" -- groups of species that never before interacted now contending with each other.
\
""You'll see these communities that never occurred before suddenly occur; climate change creates these no-analogue communities,"" he said. ""You don't know how they might interact.""
\
The mathematical model in Urban's study has not been applied to existing environments, so it's too early to say which species are most at risk. But the study suggests that climate change may have a drastic effect on species in the tropical regions. Unlike, for instance, species native to New England, which are exposed to several kinds of climate, those in the tropics live in a more uniform climate. As a result, they will have far fewer options for migrating to more livable habitats and will face much fiercer competition for the space.
\
Further research, he said, might identify species that are particularly vulnerable, and that could lead to preservation efforts. One possibility, he said, is to facilitate migration -- moving a slow species into a more conducive habitat or even creating ""competitor-free areas"" for the more vulnerable species.
\
He adds that this would have to be done with great caution because of unintended consequences that can come from that kind of intervention.
\
Frank La Sorte, a postdoctoral researcher in the ornithology lab at Cornell University, said the study adds ""biological realism"" to the body of research on climate change.
\
""To really understand the overall complexity, we need to look at these more refined biological factors,"" he said. ""I think it adds to our current understanding and brings these important issues to the forefront.""
\
Gary Langham, vice president and chief scientist for the National Audubon Society, said the study is a reminder that ""we need to appreciate all the complexities as we seek to protect the most important places for birds and other wildlife.
\
""This paper underscores the 'web of life' problem -- species interact with each other and habitats in many complex ways,"" Langham said in an email. ""Dispersal and competition are important considerations along with range changes and habitat resilience in making conservation decisions.""

The Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority has approved the zero-emissions and low-emissions renewable energy credit program authorized last year as part of the state's landmark energy reform bill.
\
The program, intended to increase the number of clean energy projects throughout the state, will be administered by Connecticut Light & Power and United Illuminating. The utilities are required to procure renewable energy credits under 15-year contracts with owners or developers of renewable energy projects. The program allows qualifying projects, such as a customer's rooftop solar panels, to sell their renewable energy credits to companies at a fixed price for a period of 15 years.
\
Each year, CL&P And UI will sign power purchase agreements worth $8 million for zero-emission projects and $4 million for low-emissions projects, ""an approach that will roll out over the next several years,"" said Dennis Schain, spokesman for the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection.
\
""The program will deploy hundreds of projects across the state at the lowest possible cost to ratepayers"" and ""will help jump start Connecticut's clean energy industry,"" DEEP Commissioner Daniel C. Esty said in a prepared statement.
\
CL&P and UI are set to begin accepting bids from renewable energy project developers.
\
The projects that require the smallest subsidies from the program will be selected for funding. Winning bidders will receive 15-year contracts for the payment of a set price per megawatt hour of energy output in the form of renewable energy credits.

After approving four sites in town for the installation of solar arrays, East Hartford is looking into seven additional sites for the purpose of producing more electricity savings.
\
According to documents presented to the town council, which is scheduled to review the issue next Tuesday, the town has identified more roofs of public buildings that could be suitable for solar panels.
\
Earlier this summer, the council approved the contracts between SunEdison, a solar company, and East Hartford. SunEdison will receive Zero Emission Renewable Energy credits -- energy subsidies by Connecticut Light & Power -- to help install and maintain solar panels at four schools and sell energy to the town.
\
It has been predicted that through these initial installations by SunEdison, the town will save about $800,000 over the course of a 20-year contract.
\
These projects will soon begin the local approval process, according to town memos.
\
The state, through its Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, has released more credits for smaller projects this time and will begin receiving applications in late September, town Finance Director Michael Walsh wrote.
\
If a power purchasing agreement is approved by the council, it ""will commit the town to paying for electricity generated by a solar roof array canopy at each location to the owner of the equipment,"" he wrote.
\
""The owner, in turn, will use the committed revenue stream from the town coupled with the ZEREC credits to make the infrastructure investment on behalf of the town,"" Walsh added, referring to the physical structures of the solar arrays.
\
If the seven new sites are approved, Walsh estimated that between $700,000 and $1.6 million would be saved over another 20-year contract.

81,"Let Hurricane Sandy be our tipping point toward a better America.\First, we're all in this together. As the wind strengthened and the hurricane neared, the political negativity and hostility waned. There's nothing like a common adversary to unite us, even a benign atmospheric one. It wasn't just that Sandy wreaked havoc on campaign plans. It's that both presidential candidates began to act more like governors than ideological opponents beholden to a spectrum of groups. Watching them gave me more faith in America's potential than all the bickering I've been forced to hear. Apparently, when push comes to shove we can work together because we must. \Second, a picture is worth a thousand words. The satellite images showed a white, counterclockwise pinwheel of clouds just like every other hurricane I've seen -- except for its size. With what the pundits are calling a wingspan a thousand miles across, Sandy was two to three times larger than typical. Keep in mind that one of the most robust predictions of climate change theory is that extreme events will be more powerful, whether this unprecedented storm or last summer's unprecedented drought. \Let this pinwheel become a pinup to move us toward a saner, safer, smarter future. A cultural shift similar to what I remember happening after earthlings got a chance to see our spherical, cloud-gauzed, green-swathed living planet from space. I refer to the famous earthrise photo taken from the moon during the Apollo 11 landing in July 1969. It helped launch the most potent phase of the American environmental movement, which centered on pollution and wilderness. Let the new pinup energize a third phase already underway, one focused on a sane energy policy and policy adaptations to the good and bad things of climate change. \Third, some recommended reading. During the hurricane I kept thinking of a pair of books that ought to be hinged together as Part I and Part II of a larger work. The word diptych comes to mind. It's a pair of images hinged to fold inward for protection. In this case, the problem and the solution we're now facing. \My diptych consists of two books: ""The Control of Nature,"" by John McPhee and ""America the Possible,"" by James Gustave Speth. Read the first till you weep with relief, having realized that control of nature remains an illusion. Read the second until you smile, knowing that the planetary wisdom it promulgates can be a more important part of the future. \I've recommended ""The Control of Nature"" to every student I've taught since it was published in 1989. Its two main conclusions are pretty simple. First, we can't control nature. Second, we persist in believing that we can. That we can live or build directly in harm's way. That our engineers can protect us. That our emergency response systems will work and that endless quantities of government money will be there to pay for the cleanups. We delude ourselves, even when everyone is doing his or her best. \Speth's latest book is just out. He's a wounded veteran of the environmental wars. Trained as a lawyer, he spent a lifetime working within the law with a special expertise in climate change policy. His antagonist was the corporatocracy currently running the United States through high-pressure lobbying and campaign contributions to elected beholders. Having realized that working within the law got him hardly anywhere on this issue, he decided to follow Henry David Thoreau's example and break the law in an act of civil disobedience. \His book is a readable prescription for the future that's actually possible. His message is clear. A new political economy is coming, and will eventually win the day. One that is more democratic, sustainable and, in a word, better for us all. \Let me be specific. (1) Politics need not be so petty. (2) Pin Sandy up. (3) Mandate and provide incentives for a retreat from the shore. (4) Support global carbon reductions. (5) Nature rules. (6) Democracy and dollars should not be the same. \Robert M. Thorson is a professor of geology at the University of Connecticut's College of Liberal Arts and Sciences.

More than a month after Hurricane Sandy wreaked havoc on the East Coast, a number of scientists are looking at how such a storm came to be and whether it can help us better predict future storms, or shed some light on larger weather patterns.
\
At Avery Point, UConn scientists have spent the last few weeks entering data into the computer simulation of Sandy. That will be followed by a few months of analyzing the data. Current weather models are very helpful in simulating weather events and predicting major storms, said James O'Donnell, professor of marine sciences at University of Connecticut. But it could always be better.
\
""All I'm saying is that things are changing ? the sea level is rising, the ocean is getting warmer,"" he said. ""We could do a slightly better job at the prediction.""
\
The effects of a storm can vary greatly within a relatively small area within Long Island Sound, he said. Knowing where a storm is going to cause flooding and where that flooding is going to hit hardest is crucial to knowing how to minimize the damage, he said.
\
The data that scientists have now does a good job in general prediction, but O'Donnell said what it means for specific geographical points is still a work in progress.
\
""How it translates to Stonington and Groton and sedimentation in New Haven harbor ? all those things can be improved,"" he said.
\
To that end, O'Donnell's team analyzes data collected by computers at four points in Long Island Sound. Meters on 600-pound buoys, weighed down by even larger anchors, measure current velocity, wind speed, wave height and water temperatures. The computers record and automatically email the data every 50 minutes.
\
""What we've done so far is compare observations with what would have been expected for a typical hurricane,"" he said. ""The flooding was a lot worse for a hurricane of those characteristics."" For instance, it moved more slowly and to the west instead of the north.
\
We can expect more major storms in the next several years, he said. ""We're not sure what they'll look like ? they may be like Sandy, Irene or Bob, so we need to arrange a number of likely flooding scenarios,"" he said.
\
O'Donnell's program began recording data in the Long Island Sound about 10 years ago, and works in collaboration with the state Department of Environmental and Energy Protection and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
\
Regular maintenance of the equipment happens once a year. ""We scrape it and paint and anything that's rusted, we fix.""
\
It costs about $500,000 a year to collect the data, and that doesn't include the maintenance and other operations of the program.
\
So while O'Donnell and his team work to glean some information about Sandy to save Connecticut's coast, what does Sandy say about larger weather patterns?
\
NOAA officials noted that Sandy's arrival happened during the 332nd consecutive month with an above-average temperature. Or as Philip Bump wrote in Grist, ""if you were born in or after April 1985, if you are right now 27 years old or younger, you have never lived through a month that was colder than average.""
\
Kerry Emanuel, a scientist with NOAA, said that it was only in the last 10 years that meteorologists have developed a set of objective data to definitively identify hybrid storms such as Sandy. While much work has been done on looking at the frequency of conventional hurricanes, little has been done in considering whether hybrid storms are increasing either in frequency or intensity.
\
""What Sandy did was to remind my colleagues and I that we haven't done our homework,"" he said. ""We don't really know if they've increased. We don't know. But we should be able to know.""
\
Climatologists are currently studying Sandy to glean whatever insight they can about the storm and what it says about climate change, Emanuel said. But ""the wheels of academia turn slowly,"" he said, and it will probably be about two-and-a-half years before you see papers published in journals. But he wouldn't be surprised if he hears several Sandy-related lectures at meteorological conferences in the spring.
\
""There's some projects that we've been mulling over,"" he said. ""One is to ask a hypothetical question of what would Sandy have been like hypothetically, had it occurred before this global warming?""
\
Of course, Sandy was hardly the only hurricane this year. It wasn't even the strongest ? that would be Michael, which formed in September and reached Category 3, but fortunately never made landfall. According to the National Weather Service, 2010, 2011 and 2012 are all tied (along with 1887 and 1995) as the third most active hurricane seasons in recorded history with 19 named storms. Hurricanes and tropical storm names made it all the way to the Ts this year.
\
Scientists have been singling out and anatomizing storms for research long before Sandy. Kevin E. Trenberth of the Climate Analysis Section at the USA National Center for Atmospheric Research, was part of a team that created a similar model for Hurricane Katrina, tweaking certain circumstances to see how outcomes might have changed.
\
""We fiddled with the sea temperatures to see what it did to the storm,"" he said. ""We were able to quantify at the time that maybe the global warming component added maybe one inch of rain. You can still say that it's only 10 percent, but if it's one inch on top of 11, it contributes to the risk that it will break the levees.""
\
But there's only so much one storm ? however big and unique it might be ? can show about the climate at large, said Thomas Knutson, also at NOAA.
\
The confluence of events that created Sandy mean that it's a ""once in 700 years storm,"" Knutson said. Whether that means that we're ""wretchedly unlucky"" to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, or whether the climate has changed in such a way that these storms will start happening a lot more frequently than once every 700 years is a question that requires more data.
\
""We're more interested in things that are systematic and systematically changing over time. If you can establish such a pattern of more record highs than record lows, that tells you something,"" he said. ""For instance, global mean temperatures are a good example, and how they've changed systematically over the century. It's the systematic part that counts.""

State environmental officials are trying to decrease reliance on energy from wood-burning biomass and tap into hydropower from dams in Canada to help meet its escalating renewable-energy targets, something it expects this year to miss for the first time.
\
""The incentives in this marketplace haven't produced enough on-the-ground renewable projects,"" Commissioner Daniel Esty of the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection said in an interview.
\
The department on Tuesday will release details of a study addressing proposed changes in its renewable-energy strategy. A summary of the study was available for review Monday.
\
The plan supports proposed changes to state laws governing how much of which type of energy the state should promote.
\
Ratepayers suffer when the state falls short of its renewable energy targets, as is expected this year, Esty said. The main reason: State incentives have gone to the wrong technologies, he said.
\
The new study of renewable energy sources sets up the state to buy power from large hydropower projects such as Hydro-Quebec or those in the Canadian Maritimes. It would also wean the state off of old, out-of-state biomass plants and create more renewable projects in Connecticut.
\
But some critics say that the state's approach might run against the goal of lower rates.
\
""They have a couple different priorities, and they tend to work at cross-purposes,"" said Nick Culver, an analyst with Bloomberg New Energy Markets. ""It will be very difficult to reduce reliance on out-of-state renewables and at the same time reduce electricity bills at home.""
\
The state wants more renewables, too, from sources such as solar, wind, fuel cells, tidal power and hydropower. The study plans to extend the state's push for renewables from 20 percent of its total energy use by 2020 to 25 percent by 2025.
\
Pending legislation would include hydropower from large out-of-state dams in the state's portfolio of renewable energy. The power would be acquired by contract, rather than the existing system of renewable energy credits. If the legislation goes through, the state hopes to join with Massachusetts and Vermont to procure renewable energy as a group, with the hope of buying the power at lower prices.
\
To get more energy from Connecticut sources, state environmental officials hope, through legislation, to change regulations on the largest source of out-of-state renewable energy: biomass.
\
The proposal would tighten emission limits for biomass plants -- which burn mainly wood to create energy -- and require the plants to buy carbon offsets for the energy it takes to transport wood. The state expects the new rules to drive some biomass plants out of the Connecticut market.
\
The changes could reform the market into ""a game of 'Survivor' from here on for New England biomass,"" Culver said. ""Some plants won't be able to stay afloat if Connecticut steadily tightens emission criteria. This could ultimately increase costs for ratepayers, forcing regulators to double down on imported hydropower.""
\
It's also unclear how many biomass plants the regulatory tightening might push out of the Connecticut market. William Dornbos, Connecticut director of Environment Northeast, said, ""Existing and proposed biomass facilities in Massachusetts demonstrate that it is feasible to meet or exceed this limit.""
\
Further, some are warning that jumping into large hydropower could run counter to the state's call for more in-state renewables.
\
""This bill will stifle the growth potential of the state's renewable energy industry by providing economic incentives for well-established, utility-owned Canadian hydropower,"" said Paul R. Michaud, executive director of the Renewable Energy and Efficiency Business Association.

The Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority is putting in a six-acre array of solar panels on a section of its Hartford landfill. The solar project coincides with the authority's plan to cap the remaining 35-acre section of the landfill.
\
The cap and one-megawatt solar array will cost the trash-to-energy authority about $11.6 million and will make the landfill the first in the state to develop its limited-use real estate into a renewable energy project.
\
Across the country, there are more than 70 similar projects on contaminated sites, former landfills or mined areas that create 216 megawatts of clean energy, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Most are solar projects such as Hartford's, but others include wind power, wood-burning biomass, hydropower and geothermal.
\
""When we began working with the city of Hartford on the future of the landfill, we wanted to find innovative ways to use the land,"" CRRA President Thomas D. Kirk said in a written statement.
\
""Solar energy was an idea we all agreed on right away.""
\
Output from the solar panels will receive an 11-cent per kilowatt hour subsidy from the Zero Emissions Renewable Energy Credit program, Connecticut Light & Power's clean energy effort mandated by the state.
\
The cost of building the project will be covered by a Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority fund dedicated to closing the landfill.
\
E. T. & L. Corp., hired to close the final 35-acre part of the landfill and put in the solar array, first will install a synthetic grass surface that will ensure that water doesn't seep through the landfill waste and contaminate the groundwater.
\
In 2007, the resources recovery authority began closing the landfill, and the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection approved the plans for a solar array in 2011.

A shot at a long-term contract is reviving a renewable energy project here that has spent the past few years idling.
\
The project -- 42 megawatts of power from biomass, 2.3 megawatts from solar, and 5.6 megawatts from fuel cells -- is one of many proposals submitted Monday in response to a call from the state energy department for contracted renewable energy.
\
Other projects include: at least five wind turbine projects in Maine and New Hampshire, a 28-megawatt fuel cell park in Killingly and a Connecticut-based solar project.
\
The developer of the Montville renewable energy park, NRG Energy Inc., expanded its initial plans to just convert an old coal boiler. The new plans include a solar farm and some fuel cells, a diversity the company says will aid it in its bid for a long-term renewable energy contract with the state that it filed Monday.
\
""This is the legacy of Connecticut's electricity generation behind us,"" John Baylor, NRG Energy's senior director of development and head of the Montville project, said while standing in front of the old, riverside power plant.
\
""This,"" he said, pointing at the new project plans, ""is our future.""
\
The state's step into contracting renewable energy projects signals a continuation of its proactive approach to developing renewable power through programs such as its low- and zero-emissions subsidy programs.
\
Until now, the state's electric companies mostly ran the clean energy purchasing though a market, where supply and demand on any given day dictated the amount of subsidy a solar farm or fuel cell park could get. For some, such as NRG, the uncertainty made getting financing difficult, if not impossible.
\
Baylor said that without a long-term power contract, financing for the more than $100 million project wasn't possible. The end of the state's Project 150 clean energy contract program closed that door. And last year, an attempt to lock in a power purchase contract as a stipulation to Northeast Utilities' merger with NSTAR failed.
\
""This is the first opportunity we have to bid into a contract,"" Baylor said.
\
Adding some certainty for developers through a long-term contract, the approach mirrors one Massachusetts launched in late 2010, when the state directed its electric distribution companies to enter into long-term power agreements for clean energy rather than buying the energy off the oftentimes volatile markets.
\
Criteria for acceptance of the bids, such as NRG's, focus on dollars and cents -- in the end, a determination of how much of a subsidy the projects will need. Viability and reliability of the project also play a significant part in the application. The latter item on the bid could favor Connecticut projects that rely on fewer miles of transmission lines.
\
Developers plan to convert an old coal steam unit that burns oil and gas into a biomass unit, which would run on locally harvested wood from tree trimmings, foresters and sawmills. The finished biomass boiler, though set to create 42 megawatts of electricity, still will be able to burn oil or gas when higher outputs are needed. In those cases, the unit could generate 82 megawatts.
\
According to NRG estimates, the 80 miles surrounding the Montville park could supply about 2.3 million tons of wood annually. The station would need about 400,000 tons to operate at full bore. The biomass conversion and operation, the company said, would add up to 200 jobs to the local and regional economy.
\
The fuel cells also would be locally grown, so to speak, by FuelCell Energy Inc., which manufactures its products in Torrington and is headquartered in Danbury.
\
The company is bidding to develop the Killingly fuel cell park, which, if accepted, would be the second largest in the world. The world's largest, also a FuelCell Energy project, is under construction in South Korea.
\
Decisions on the bids are expected to be made by Aug. 20, with contract negotiations and regulator approval expected to stretch into mid-October.

86,"Discussions about climate change often include references to extreme weather events, but they rarely go as far back as the flood that sent Noah off on an ark.\But such was the nature of the Climate Stewardship Summit at the Asylum Hill Congregational Church, an interfaith forum on the role of religion in dealing with climate change. \""People think of it as a political issue -- it's been so politicized,"" said Terri Eickel, executive director of the Interreligious Eco-Justice Network and one of the event's organizers. ""Our goal is to say that it's not just a political issue, it's a personal issue and a spiritual issue."" \While the environment has increasingly become an issue of concern among interfaith groups, she said, Thursday's summit was ""pretty unique, in its scope and its depth."" \Attendance was greater than organizers anticipated, with about 200 people. \During a round-table discussion, Rabbi Joshua Ratner of the Jewish Community Relations Council in New Haven referred to the Book of Genesis, when God gave Adam and Eve the job of tending to the Garden of Eden. And the covenant that God made after the flood, he said, wasn't specifically with humanity but with all the Earth. \""The main notion being that we are entrusted with a sense of stewardship over the Earth,"" Ratner said. ""The Earth is the Lord's, it's not ours. We are here as guests, as stewards. I think that's something that's not particular to the Jewish faith, but something we share across religious sensibilities."" \Looking at the Earth and the climate from a theological perspective, he said, allows people to approach the issue away from the ""secular, Western modern, tradition of human centrism"" that views the Earth's resources as belonging specifically to humanity. \""If you look at it from a Jewish perspective, the Earth itself has rights,"" Ratner said. ""The Earth itself is entitled to rest and revivification, and is not just there for us to use and exploit as we see fit."" \The Rev. Virginia W.G. Army of St. John's Episcopal Church in Vernon said the religious community played a role in the civil rights movement but has been less aggressive on environmental issues. \""I think for people who are faithful and want to provide leadership and direction on this ethical question, it means engaging in conflict, and I think that's hard for us as people of peace and people with a lot on our plates,"" she said.

Connecticut's headaches over two long-term deals for renewable  power, including a large contract with a Maine Wind Farm, now include a lawsuit by a New York firm that owns competing solar generation facilities.
\
Allco Renewable Energy Ltd., based on Wall Street in New York City, submitted bids from five solar facilities when the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection sought bids in July for 15-year contracts to sell power to Connecticut Light & Power. In September, the department awarded contracts to a Maine wind project and a solar project in Connecticut -- but not to Allco.
\
Allco filed a lawsuit against Dan Esty, the DEEP commissioner, in U.S. District Court in Connecticut, claiming the contracts amount to the state setting wholesale power rates. That's against the Federal Power Act that gives U.S. regulators the exclusive right to oversee wholesale markets, Allco said in the lawsuit, which was filed Nov. 27 and seeks to have the deals revoked, along with other relief.
\
Allco's lawsuit also said pricing of contracts was not done properly under federal law, and its offer was for a lower amount than one of the winning bids.
\
The most controversial of the contracts is for 250 megawatts, with the so-called Number Nine Wind Project in Maine, which has not yet been built. Critics say that agreement raises concerns about transmitting the power, and could lead the state to ignore renewable energy sources that are based locally.
\
Allco ""will suffer irreparable harm"" because its solar facilities ""are competing for a limited supply of long-term renewable energy contracts in Connecticut, and the defendant's interference with the wholesale energy market in violation of the FPA will cause the Plaintiff to suffer substantial economic losses,"" the lawsuit said.
\
The department said it conducted the bidding and awarded the contracts properly after working closely with the state Attorney General's office, the Office of Consumer Counsel and outside lawyers.
\
""We are confident we followed all legal requirements during this process and are eager to advance Governor Malloy's agenda of bringing cheaper, cleaner, and more reliable energy to the residents and businesses of Connecticut,"" department spokesman Dwayne Gardner said in a written statement.

Think for a minute of the Dust Bowl of the 1930s. Human activity -- plowing of deep-rooted native grasses across a 150,000-square-mile swath of the Great Plains -- caused a human and environmental disaster.
\
It can happen, and there is every indication it is happening again, on a broader scale.
\
The National Climate Assessment, released this month, says that climate change is not something to be worried about in the future, something that can be palmed off on our children. It is already affecting every part of the country, causing extreme weather with dire consequences.
\
In the Northeast, communities ""are affected by heat waves, more extreme precipitation events and coastal flooding due to sea level rise and storm surge,"" which means ""infrastructure, agriculture, fisheries and ecosystems will be increasingly compromised.""
\
The essence of the report is that the U.S. average temperature has increased by 1.3 degrees to 1.9 Fahrenheit since 1895, that most of this increase has occurred since 1970 -- and that nothing but humans burning fossil fuels explains most of this change. This point has been made by numerous studies, including two United Nations studies and one by American Association for the Advancement of Science. It represents an overwhelming consensus among scientists.
\
LOW CARBON
\
We need to become a low-carbon society. The challenge is getting the public behind that notion. Pew Research and Gallup polls in the past year found that only about a third of Americans think climate change is a serious and immediate problem. Many right-leaning Republicans deny there's a problem at all.
\
There's some hope, if the world changes its ways. The report says that if the U.S. and other big emitters enact polices that cut emissions considerably, U.S. temperatures will rise about 3 degrees to 5 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century. Continue what we're doing, and U.S. temperatures will rise by 5 degrees to 10 degrees, which means that summers in Connecticut will be as hot as those in Georgia are now.
\
To prevent that unfortunate outcome, we must mitigate the damage through lower emissions of heat-trapping gases, and must adapt to the changing climate. As a state and country, we are in the early stages of both. Yes, other countries have to join the effort, but the U.S. will have no authority if we are still a big part of the problem.
\
STATE EFFORTS
\
Connecticut has begun to address the issue. The state was a founder of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a nine-state compact that has reduced power plant emissions by 40 percent since 2005.
\
The state adopted a Connecticut Climate Preparedness Plan pursuant to 2008 legislation, and in January the state launched the CT Institute for Resiliency and Climate Adaptation at the University of Connecticut Avery Point Campus in Groton, a research center designed to gather data and develop policy tools to help communities prepare for severe weather and rising sea levels.
\
Some shoreline communities, aided by environmental organizations such as The Nature Conservancy and Connecticut Fund for the Environment, have created stricter rules for rebuilding homes in flood zones or begun to protect open space near marshes so that the marshes can expand.
\
Still, as UConn geologist Robert Thorson noted in a recent Courant column, misguided policies continue to encourage building in vulnerable shoreline locations.
\
On the mitigation front, the state has made progress at reducing energy use in buildings, and two transit systems come online in the next two years -- but there is much more to be done.

A hydropower proposal on the Farmington River in Collinsville was cited as an example for Connecticut and the nation July 1 as federal, state and local officials announced an important step forward for the project.
\
U.S. Sen. Christopher Murphy, U.S. Rep. Elizabeth Esty and Gov. Dannel P. Malloy gathered at the dam on the Farmington River in Collinsville to announce the passage of the Collinsville Renewable Energy Promotion Act.
\
The legislation had been years in the making and its passage was a key boost for a hydropower project the town has been working on since 2007. The bill reinstates two licenses from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to use the dam, as well as for another downstream. The legislation also gives the dams to the town.
\
Murphy said the legislation, which President Barack Obama signed into law recently, helps ensure that the project will be completed. He and Esty said that as small as the project is, it's a model for what can be accomplished with renewable energy projects. Officials say the project could generate nearly 2 megawatts of power, enough to power 1,500 homes.
\
""This can be a model for Connecticut and the region,"" Murphy said. ""We know we have to commit to renewable energy.""
\
Murphy promoted the project when he was congressman and continued it in the Senate. The bill was the first that Esty introduced after she was elected in 2012.
\
""This is a template for producing local power,"" Esty said.
\
Malloy said the state is ready to move forward with the project. ""This is about clean, cheap, more reliable energy and producing as much of it in Connecticut as possible,"" Malloy said, adding that the Canton project is part of a larger effort the state is pushing to establish clean, renewable energy.
\
One dam is in Collinsville and the other is further downstream in Avon and Burlington. They were built by the former Collins Company and generated electricity for the factory it ran in Canton that made axes and machetes. The company closed in 1966 and the dams have not been used for hydropower since then.
\
First Selectman Richard Barlow has championed the project and said part of his father's job at the Collins Company was to maintain the dam.
\
""We have a lot of work to do but we have cleared a major, significant hurdle,"" Barlow said.
\
Murphy said that under the terms of the bill, the town has two years to get the project going. He said after the press conference that financial assistance from the federal government is unlikely. For that, the town has turned to the private sector.
\
In June, the board of selectmen authorized negotiations with New England Hydropower LLC to partner with it on the project. A contract with the company is not expected to be finalized until the fall.

Connecticut isn't at all like the sunny, dry-summer places where most of the world's great wine grapes are grown. Winters are more bitter than in France. Growing seasons are shorter and wetter than in Italy, Spain or California.
\
So you'd think that global warming would be greeted with hallelujahs at Connecticut's 32 vineyards and hosannas from scientists trying to help grape growers deal with New England's climate. Warmer average temperatures and extended growing time would seem to be a perfect recipe for better Connecticut wine.
\
Except it's not that simple. Experts warn that climate change will bring both new opportunities for Connecticut winemakers and increasing risks.
\
""Global warming sounds good,"" said Jamie Jones, an owner of Jones Winery in Shelton and president of the Connecticut Vineyard and Winery Association. ""But it's not a slam dunk.""
\
Connecticut's 32 state-licensed wineries recently wrapped up their harvest season.
\
""This has been probably our largest harvest ever,"" said Jones, whose family is continuing to expand its vineyard. Jones said that the additional acre of vines picked this year added about 5 tons to the winery's harvest.
\
""The complexities here are immense,"" said Frank Ferrandino, a scientist at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station. Global warming in the next few decades might mean that Connecticut vineyards could grow more and tastier crops of classic grapes like chardonnay, merlot and cabernet sauvignon, Ferrandino said.
\
""Grape production in Connecticut will greatly benefit from warmer, drier summers"" was one of the conclusions of a 2010 report by the Governor's Steering Committee on Climate Change. ""Grapes will have a longer time to mature, making more varieties a viable option in Connecticut (especially red varieties), and the sugar content will increase, making Connecticut grapes more desirable for wine production.""
\
The trouble is that climate change is also expected to trigger more severe and frequent storms, with uncertain temperature shifts. Winter cold snaps might go deeper and longer, early warm spells could be followed by late frosts, even though overall annual temperatures continue to rise. The possibility of increased rainfall raises the threat of increased grapevine diseases like mildew and mold.
\
""Erratic weather is not good,"" Jones said. ""Wine grapes don't like extremes.""
\
That's especially true for the classic viniferous grapes that evolved and developed around the Mediterranean Sea and in warmer regions of Europe over thousands of years, like cabernet sauvignon from Bordeaux, pinot noir from Burgundy, and warmth-loving vines from elsewhere in France, Italy and Spain. Those sorts of grapes also thrive in the drier, gentler climates of California, Oregon, Australia, Chile and other world wine regions.
\
Deep cold, like the frigid periods that Connecticut residents suffered through this past winter, can damage the roots of those European grapevines. ""We're expecting a 40 percent crop loss,"" Cornell University viticulture expert Tim Martinson said, referring to grapevines in the Northeast damaged by extremely cold weather..
\
""For our grape growers, the most important thing is not how warm the summers are, but how cold the winters get,"" Ferrandino said.
\
Various Connecticut vineyards do plant and harvest European-style wine grapes despite the risks. Ferrandino said that the best places to grow them at the moment are near the shoreline, where the waters of Long Island Sound help moderate winter extremes.
\
The native grapes that evolved in North America are a lot tougher, more resistant to dramatic shifts in winter and summer temperatures, Ferrandino said. Unfortunately, he said, those native cold-resistant grapes have a different flavor, often described as ""foxy"" or sweet, and don't make good wine.
\
For decades, scientists at Cornell University and other U.S. research centers have been breeding hybrid grape varieties, crossing traditional European grapes with American grapes. Their goal is to create grapes able to survive American weather and also make excellent wine. With names like Saint-Croix, Cayuga and Seyval Blanc, the hybrids ""tend to be acidic ... and make a little harsher wine,"" Ferrandino said.
\
Most Connecticut vineyards, even those that plant traditional European varieties, raise hybrids as a backup against cold weather. ""If it gets too cold, you have to plant hybrids,"" Ferrandino said.
\
""As a farmer in New England, that's all you do is hedge your bets,"" said Jones, whose Shelton vineyard plants seven or eight varieties of grapes and has been gradually expanding the amount of acreage devoted to wine fruit.
\
Another worry for state grape growers is the possibility that climate change bringing warmer average temperatures could also result in wetter weather at critical times.
\
The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station is working with a $24,000-a-year federal grant to raise and test hybrid wine grapes at its Lockwood Farm facility in Hamden. Ferrandino, who is in charge of the project, said 32 varieties are being grown there.
\
The hybrid grapes grown in Hamden are tested for things like weight, sugar content, acidity and disease resistance, he said. Once harvested, they are sent back to the research facility for taste tests. Wine made from the grapes grown in Hamden is then compared to wine made from the same hybrids grown in other regions. Ferrandino said the idea is to find out which varieties grow best in which areas and weather conditions.
\
""The trouble is, this stuff takes eight years. ... We have to accumulate enough data to make a statement"" about a particular hybrid variety, Ferrandino said.
\
Such research projects, especially those involving disease-resistant grape varieties, could become even more important as Connecticut's climate changes.
\
As Connecticut winemakers wonder how global warming might actually help them, their counterparts in more established wine regions are increasingly concerned that rising temperatures will force drastic, even catastrophic, changes.
\
A study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences predicts that there are likely to be dramatic declines in production in many of the world's premier wine regions by 2050.
\
Computer models forecast as much as an 85 percent drop in production for areas such as Bordeaux, Rhone and Tuscany, while California's wine grape crops could be cut by 70 percent.
\
New York's Finger Lakes wine country, which made its reputation growing high-quality wines from cool-weather Riesling grapes, might also undergo significant changes, according to Cornell's Martinson. ""It might become too hot for some varieties that are now adapted to this region,"" he said.
\
The same study also predicted that new areas in places like northern Europe and even the Yellowstone region of North America could become suitable for growing wine grapes. Martinson said that sections of the northeastern United States could eventually end up with a climate similar to what North Carolina has now.
\
""Within the industry, there's a lot of head-scratching going on,"" Jones said.
\
""There remains significant opportunities to grow more grapes in Connecticut,"" said Connecticut's agriculture commissioner, Steven Reviczky. ""But it's going to require us to be a little more nimble. ... It's not going to be easy.""

Leidos Inc. is selling its Plainfield wood-fired power plant to Greenleaf Power, a Sacramento company that is buying biomass plants across North America.
\
Greenleaf Power announced Wednesday it has agreed to buy the 37.5-megawatt power plant in a deal it expects to close later this year.
\
The company bought four California biomass plants in 2010 and 2011 and a Canadian plant in 2013. In a statement, Greenleaf President Hugh Smith said, ""Plainfield solidifies Greenleaf Power's presence throughout North America as the leading owner-operator of biomass power facilities.""
\
He added, ""This facility holds tremendous promise and we look forward to working closely with the Plainfield community.""
\
The Plainfield Renewable Energy plant incinerates wood from construction waste and other sources that would otherwise be openly burned or dumped in a landfill, said Greenleaf, which is majority-owned and managed by Denham Capital, a Boston private equity firm.
\
The young biomass plant, a project initially valued at $225 million, has already shifted ownership once.
\
In October 2013, as the secured lender on the project, Leidos Holdings took the title to the plant from the initial owner, Enova Energy Group, which failed to complete construction on the facility. Months later, the biomass plant began producing power and selling it to Connecticut Light & Power under Connecticut's clean power program known as Project 150.
\
But operation of the plant proved difficult for Leidos. The plant failed to be profitable for the company and suffered numerous shutdowns over the last year, according to Leidos. The plant reported $6 million in operating losses in the fourth quarter of 2014.
\
""Clearly, the Plainfield project has had adverse impacts to our financials,"" Mark W. Sopp, Leidos' chief financial officer, said Wednesday in a conference call with investors.
\
Sopp said Greenleaf Power will pay Leidos $30 million in cash and provide a secured note of about $80 million at closing. Leidos sold the power plant for $40 million less than what was listed on the company's balance sheet. But the company was glad to be done with it.
\
""While we are disappointed with the further impairment to the value embedded in the sales price, we do believe for many reasons that accepting this offer was the best course of action for the company and our shareholders,"" Sopp said.

The Malloy administration picked Wednesday, Earth Day, to reboot a coordinated campaign against climate change that had been dormant since the state completed a report on the subject four years ago.
\
While the state is on pace to reach its next emissions target, Connecticut is without a road map to accomplish the ambitious, and statutorily mandated, goal of reducing greenhouse gases to 80 percent of 2001 levels by 2050.
\
""It is going to be a big task."" Gov. Dannel P. Malloy said Wednesday, steps from the swelling Connecticut River, after signing an executive order ""recommitting"" the state to the global challenge of climate change by seating a Governor's Council on Climate Change.
\
The council will set interim goals and recommend carbon-cutting policies. Its goal is for Connecticut to average 2 percent reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in each of the next 35 years.
\
Robert Klee, commissioner of the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, who will be chairman of the council, said there is a ""moral imperative"" to meet the goals Connecticut enacted with the 2008 adoption of the Global Warming Solutions Act.
\
Most of Connecticut's greenhouse gas emissions come from the transportation sector, power plants and residential heating. And while power plants and residents have cut their emissions from 1990 levels, emissions from the transportation sector are higher than they were 25 years ago.
\
Following a 1990 assessment from the United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Connecticut was the first in the United States to pass legislation requiring actions to control carbon emissions. A decade later, the state issued its first Climate Change Action Plan, whose goal was to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to levels that eliminate any threat to the climate.
\
In 2008, the Global Warming Solutions Act committed the state to cut its greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2010; to 10 percent below 1990 levels by 2020; and finally to 80 percent of 2001 levels by the middle of the century.
\
Although Connecticut's 2005 Climate Change Action plan outlined steps for Connecticut to reach its first two goals, it was silent on the final one, which will be the goal of this rebooted climate change council.
\
It is unclear what sort of policy changes the council will recommend in its report to the governor's office, due by the end of 2015, but there is agreement that the proposals need gravitas.
\
One independent report said the state needs ""very different policies"" to meet the goal, while the state itself has characterized what's required as ""significant additional measures and breakthrough technologies.""
\
Malloy, who is confident the 2050 goal can be met, nevertheless said the state has some ""ground to make up.""
\
His 15-member council will include state agency officials from energy and environment, economic and community development, transportation, housing, administrative services, insurance, public utilities authority and policy and management.

""Except that someone has to lead,"" Malloy quickly added, arguing that Connecticut can show the rest of the world ""what can be done"" to dramatically reduce the manmade pollution he said is clearly having an impact on climate.
\
""We can demonstrate here in Connecticut ... that small entities and large entities can have an impact on the environment,"" Malloy said. ""Ultimately, we have to find a cleaner way to do things.""
\
Robert Klee, commissioner of the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, used the council's first meeting to warn that the panel is facing ""a very big challenge"" in planning how to meet the state's major anti-pollution goals and preparing Connecticut for the unstoppable impacts of climate change.
\
Malloy created the new council by executive order on Earth Day 2015, in an effort to push forward with efforts to reduce greenhouse gases and deal with rising sea levels, violent weather and other consequences of global warming. It includes top-level state officials and representatives from environmental groups.
\
Malloy, Klee and other council members offered lots of examples of how well Connecticut has done on climate change issues in the past decade, including cutting greenhouse gas emissions by more than 10 percent since 2004.
\
In 2012, according to the most recent statewide emissions inventory, Connecticut pumped 39.5 million metric tons of greenhouse gases into the air.
\
""We've just begun the hard work,"" said Klee, pointing to the state's official target of slashing those gas emissions to 9 million metric tons over the next 35 years.
\
One of the toughest parts of the new council's job will be to set interim targets that will determine how quickly Connecticut should move in an anti-pollution effort that is bound to have a major impact on the state's economy.
\
Another critical area for the council is preparing the state, cities, towns and residents for the inevitable changes that global warming is expected to bring. Those include a continued increase in sea levels along Long Island Sound and more frequent and stronger weather events, like hurricanes.
\
Katie Wade, state insurance commissioner, noted that there are $57 billion worth of insured properties along Connecticut's shoreline. She said that in 2011, between Tropical Storm Irene and a late October snowstorm, Connecticut insurance claims for storm-related damage approached $1 billion.
\
Connecticut's new two-year state budget includes $20 million in bonding to help cover the costs of preparing state and local infrastructure to withstand changes in climate.
\
Some shoreline communities are already seeing increases in local flooding that experts say is due to the rising water levels in the Sound, and utilities with coastal plants are already working to safeguard their facilities from sea level increases.
\
""Where are our assets, and how can we protect them?"" was the way Scott Jackson, a former mayor of Hamden and now a top official in Malloy's Office of Policy and Management, described the task ahead.

Greenskies Renewable Energy, a Middletown company that designs, finances, builds and maintains solar panel systems on big box stores and for towns, schools and universities, said it has lined up $165 million to finance coming projects.
\
The company said it has an agreement from First Niagara bank and a tax equity investor. The money will finance 127 projects in 12 states.
\
Some of the commercial projects in Greenskies' pipeline include 180 solar installations for Target stores in Arizona, Maine, Michigan, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas and Wisconsin and two warehouses in New York. The average array will contain 1,700 solar panels.
\
This is the sixth round of financing with First Niagara in the past three years, the company said, but executives declined to say how much the bank had backed in total. The company was founded by Mike Silvestrini seven years ago, out of conversations he had with Art Linares Jr., who at the time had just finished high school.
\
Linares, now 26, is a state senator from Westbrook.
\
Linares' father, Art Linares Sr., and Centerplan Construction, also of Middletown, were instrumental in guiding and funding the company in its early years. Robert Landino, CEO of Centerplan's parent company, is chairman of the Greenskies board.
\
Greenskies contracts with installers, and has 50 workers in Middletown for sales, engineering and administrative duties.

Chris Schweitzer sees art as a way to reach people who haven't thought much about climate change.
\
As program director for the New Haven/Leon Sister City Project, his first work was a ""tiny house"" -- a typical dwelling of a peasant from Nicaragua, where Leon is located.
\
""The house underlined the fragility of the lives of the farmers in places like Nicaragua, Bangladesh and Peru who are affected by climate change,"" Schweitzer says. He took it to 10 schools and the New Haven Green.
\
""The goal was to connect with people on a different level,"" he continues. ""There's information about climate change out there, but people aren't necessarily getting the full picture. I hope this will grab them and get them thinking about it in a different way.""
\
An ongoing project has been the creation of butterflies -- 800 to date -- cut from plastic jugs and painted in realistic or fantastic designs.
\
""The butterflies and other art we've done is to get people involved in making the art,"" Schweitzer says, ""and also when it's done, to put it in schools or on street corners and get them to think about climate change.""
\
Kids and adults in both New Haven and Nicaragua made the butterflies and in the process may have picked up information about climate change. Education is part of the mission of the sister city project, which works in New Haven and Leon ""to promote social justice and support education and sustainable development,"" according to www.newhavenleon.org.
\
""I think people, right now, culturally, are not energized,"" he says, ""and the thing about art is it can be really powerful. It can evoke emotion, be playful, be disarming. One of the reasons we do butterflies is they are really pretty, and everyone loves butterflies, but then they can think about the metamorphosis to a new society and can also think about how fragile they are, and how threatened they are from climate change.""
\
Leading up to last autumn's People's Climate March in New York City, Schweitzer and volunteers made a papier-mache Statue of Liberty, festooned with greenery and painted butterflies, which he set out on the street and took to various places, like the Wooster Street Farmers' Market (pictured). He often pulled it on a platform behind his bike, his main transportation. (He doesn't own a car.)
\
All these efforts are part of the Walk/Bike/Transit effort of the Sister City Project.
\
Schweitzer is working with students at several high schools on his next theme, ""Cows, Cars, Coal and Planes.""

The nation's top environmental official, Gina McCarthy, returned to Connecticut on Friday to hail the recent landmark agreement by 195 countries on climate change.
\
McCarthy, who attended the high-level talks in Paris, said the world is taking major steps forward to limit the increase in the global average temperature by 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit). The United States and most other nations in the world favored the accord. Countries such as Syria and North Korea were not part of the agreement.
\
""It is not just our moral obligation, but it is one of the biggest environmental, economic and national security challenges of our time,"" McCarthy told a crowd gathered in the cold outside the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection in Hartford.
\
Before becoming the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency administrator, McCarthy was Connecticut's environmental commissioner, having been nominated in 2004 by Republican M. Jodi Rell. Previously, she had served under Republican Gov. Mitt Romney and others in high-profile positions in the Massachusetts state government for 15 years.
\
McCarthy told reporters there was much agreement among the 195 nations in Paris.
\
""If you went to the conference, there were no climate-deniers,"" McCarthy said. ""We have joined with a tremendous amount of overwhelming international support for this. We didn't just join. We provided leadership, which is where we should be.""
\
McCarthy, 61, conceded that the climate change deal would not have enough political support to be approved by the U.S. Congress, but she says the authority of the executive branch is sufficient for the international deal.
\
""Right now, we don't feel we need Congress to take action moving forward,"" McCarthy said.
\
Air pollution has gotten so bad in places like Beijing that citizens ""unfortunately have to use a mask on many days"" in order to breathe properly, she said.
\
""There is a path forward that can actually continue the great environmental movement in this country, which is to produce clean air, clean water, and healthy land,"" McCarthy said. ""Now, we're going to have to have a stable climate to go with it.""
\
McCarthy appeared with Gov. Dannel P. Malloy and other top officials at an outdoor news conference, where the main participants were not wearing overcoats.
\
""I never get cold because I am in hot water constantly,"" McCarthy said.
\
Malloy and McCarthy walked over to an electric car parked outside DEEP headquarters, and McCarthy placed the charger into the car.
\
""Climate change is happening,"" Malloy told the crowd. ""Make no mistake about that.""
\
Connecticut has been seen as a leader on battling climate change, and is working on the issue under the nine-state Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, known as RGGI. Along with New York, Vermont, Maine, and others, Connecticut is seeking to reduce carbon emissions. While in Connecticut, McCarthy had worked on the RGGI initiative.

Inadequate public funding to preserve Connecticut's open space and the growing negative impacts of climate change are two of the biggest concerns raised in the latest report from the state's environmental watchdog agency.
\
At the same time, the report released Friday by the Council on Environmental Quality includes some good news: Bald eagle and osprey populations in the state are rising; carbon emissions are down; and oxygen levels in Long Island Sound are improving.
\
The CEQ's analysis of environmental trends from 2015 data includes a repeat warning that Connecticut is falling behind on its goals for saving the state's remaining forests and other open space. The state's official target is for state protected parks, forests and other open space areas is 320,600 acres by 2023, an amount equal to 10 percent of Connecticut's total land area.
\
As of 2015, the total amount of state protected lands amounted to 257,6254, according to the CEQ.
\
The state protected or helped to protect 1,807 acres of open space last year, most of that coming through the cooperative purchase of a big section coastal forest lands in southeastern Connecticut called ""The Preserve.""
\
""Even with this outstanding acquisition, progress is not nearly on track to reach the state preservation goal by 2023,"" according to the report.
\
The CEQ's grim conclusion is that ""Connecticut's prospects for meeting its land conservation goals are bleak,"" and that ""the same is probably true for the goals Connecticut has set for itself regarding waste recycling and wildlife conservation.""
\
According to available figures cited by the CEQ, solid waste recycling in this state has declined since 2008, down from about 25 percent that year to about 22 percent.
\
Wildlife concerns include dramatic declines in species as diverse as lobsters, bats and turtles, while the fragmentation of Connecticut's forests is contributing to clear population reductions in forest-nesting birds.
\
The CEQ reports that state efforts resulted in the preservation of 1,289 acres of farmland in 2015, the greatest amount since 2009. The bad news is that, according to the council, the state needs to save at least 2,000 acres of land a year to meet its current farmland preservation goals.
\
Another major environmental negative for Connecticut cited by the report involves the varied impacts of global warming. Those may include rising sea levels in Long Island Sound that are ""squeezing wildlife that inhabit Connecticut's coastal marshes,"" a decline in air quality last year that the CEQ attributed to high summer temperatures, and increasing numbers of invasive plants and insects.
\
""After record-breaking low levels of [air] pollution in 2014, Connecticut saw slightly more pollution in 2015,"" the report stated. CEQ experts attribute that decline in air quality to a surge in ozone at ground levels resulting from higher-than-normal summer temperatures.
\
""The changing climate is affecting our environment, and most of the time in negative ways,"" Karl Wagener, CEQ's executive director, said Friday.
\
Lobsters aren't the only aquatic species suffering from the warmer water temperatures in Long Island Sound resulting from climate change, the CEQ reported. Other cold-water fish are becoming more rare, while warm-water species appear to be moving into the Sound.
\
Rising sea levels are also flooding coastal marshes along Connecticut's shoreline. The CEQ report cites a multi-year study involving University of Connecticut scientists that found several marsh-nesting bird species populations ""in sharp decline.""
\
One potentially sour environmental note that wasn't included in the report is that Gov. Dannel P. Malloy is once again proposing to eliminate state funding for the council, which has been in existence for more than four decades. Cutting the CEQ's funding is part of the governor's plan to solve a nearly $1 billion budget deficit forecast for next year.
\
""We'll see how the budget shakes out,"" said Wagener, ""and hope this is not our last report.""

HARTFORD - July was the hottest month for global temperatures since scientists began keeping records in the 1880s, and climate experts say it's another danger signal that has worldwide implications.
\
July wasn't the hottest in Connecticut - that occurred in 2013 - but scientists and environmentalists say it has become increasingly clear that climate change has already affected the state.
\
Summer and winter air temperatures are significantly higher than they were 200 years ago. Sea levels in Long Island Sound are continuing to rise, and lobsters have largely disappeared from Connecticut's shores. The flow of water in the Connecticut River has increased. Growing seasons are about 30 days longer than a century ago. Invasive insects, including disease-spreading mosquitoes, are expanding their ranges into the state.
\
Jim O'Donnell, professor of marine sciences with the University of Connecticut and executive director of the Connecticut Institute for Resilience & Climate Adaptation, said the evidence of how global warming is changing Connecticut is irrefutable.
\
O'Donnell recently compared 80 years' worth of air temperature records taken at Yale University in the late 17th and early 18th centuries to temperatures taken in New Haven over the most recent 80-year period.
\
""It's pretty clear there has been at least a 2 degree Celsius [3.6 degrees Fahrenheit] average warming in summer air temperatures, and at least a 3 degree Celsius [4.5 degree Fahrenheit] warming in winter air temperatures in New Haven,"" O'Donnell said.
\
A comparison of Yale records from a century ago with Connecticut's last few decades shows that the growing season is starting about 15 days earlier in the spring and lasting about 15 days longer in the fall, according to O'Donnell.
\
Most climate scientists, like O'Donnell, are reluctant to attribute short-term weather events, such as this summer's drought in the Northeast, to climate change. Most point to the periodic Pacific Ocean-warming phenomenon known as El Nino as the likely explanation for our current dry conditions and this summer's heat waves.
\
The continuing rise in average global temperatures is increasing heat in the oceans and atmosphere and is almost certainly ramping up normal weather events, according to climate experts. Their prediction is that higher global temperatures are causing the ice caps to melt, which triggers rising sea levels, and injecting more energy into weather systems.
\
""More energy, more moisture in the atmosphere ... leads to more extreme and violent storms,"" said Mel Cote, chief of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's surface water branch for the Northeast. The prospect that devastating hurricanes and storms like Irene and Sandy could occur far more frequently is enough to send shudders down the spines of emergency management officials.
\
July was the ninth month in a row that set global heat records, according to federal agencies, including NASA. Many experts agree that 2016 is certain to go down as the hottest year scientifically recorded.
\
Alan Dunham, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service office in Taunton, Mass., said statistics for the Hartford region indicate that July 2016 was the 10th-hottest July on record, with an average temperature of 76.4 degrees Fahrenheit. Connecticut's hottest July was in 2013, with an average of 77.9 degrees.
\
But last month's 10-day heat wave (consecutive days with temperatures above 90) did tie the record set in 1995.
\
The overwhelming consensus of climate scientists is that air pollution is a major trigger for global warming.
\
""It does affect nearly every other one of our environmental problems,"" Karl Wagener, executive director of the state's Council on Environmental Quality, said of climate change. The council is Connecticut's watchdog agency for environmental matters. ""It drives a lot of other environmental problems in our state, from air quality to invasive species.""
\
Higher sea levels in the Sound ""are squeezing the habitats of many of our coastal species,"" Wagener said. Shoreline marshlands and dune areas are threatened by both higher water levels and bigger storm surges, putting endangered species like the piping plover at greater risk.
\
Warmer winter temperatures mean invasive insects like the Asian tiger mosquito, or Aedes albopictus, which is capable of transmitting the Zika virus, can survive in Connecticut more easily. Wagener said the Southern pine beetle, once confined to states much farther south, is now in Connecticut's evergreen woodlands.
\
Wagener also said there is evidence ""that heavy rains are becoming heavier and more frequent for Connecticut."" O'Donnell is more cautious, warning that more research needs to be done on rainfall.
\
More intense rainstorms carry the threat of more flooding in Connecticut, warns Jerry Silbert, executive director of the nonprofit environmental group Watershed Partnership. ""These changes take place slowly, but they increase the likelihood of extreme weather events,"" Silbert said.
\
Flooding not only threatens homes and businesses, but can overwhelm sewage systems and pour untreated waste into rivers and Long Island Sound. Many of the waste treatment plants along the coast are at sea level and vulnerable to rising tides and storm surges, Silbert said.
\
Although Silbert doubts that most Connecticut residents understand the seriousness of the climate situation, O'Donnell said the risks are becoming increasingly clear, especially those who live along the shoreline.
\
""I know for sure that most coastal town planners and politicians are very aware,"" said O'Donnell, whose organization is helping those officials prepare for global warming's changes.
\
O'Donnell adds that, for Connecticut's shoreline homeowners and businesses, there's one more key financial alert being sounded about the risks involved with global warming. ""Increasing [flood and storm] insurance costs are making people aware,"" O'Donnell said.

WASHINGTON - A last-minute deal between conservatives and GOP leaders in the House averted votes expected Thursday on a measure to impeach the commissioner of the IRS.
\
Instead, IRS Commissioner John Koskinen will testify before Congress next week.
\
The conservative House Freedom Caucus celebrated the development as a victory, as conservatives had long pushed GOP leaders for impeachment hearings against Koskinen. They accuse him of obstructing a congressional investigation into the treatment of tea party groups seeking tax exemptions.
\
But the agreement canceling the votes came only after conservatives themselves predicted that their impeachment resolution was going to get sidelined by Democratic and Republican opposition Thursday. So instead they settled for a hearing next Wednesday, which would result in an impeachment vote only after the November presidential election, if ever.
\
House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin welcomed the resolution, saying that it ""was a good way to work things out."" Neither Ryan nor other House GOP leaders had embraced the impeachment push, but Ryan, who needs to maintain conservative support, had also avoided publicly criticizing the move.
\
However, it would take only one aggrieved conservative to revive the impeachment on the House floor, so the deal does not definitively rule out a vote before the election.
\
Koskinen has disputed the allegations against him in private meetings with House Republicans in recent days.
\
The original conduct the House was investigating, related to how tea party groups were dealt with by the IRS, happened before Koskinen's tenure.

Obama: Atlantic marine reserve helps in fighting climate change
\
WASHINGTON - Creating the Atlantic Ocean's first marine national monument is a needed response to dangerous climate change, oceanic dead zones and unsustainable fishing practices, President Barack Obama said Thursday.
\
The new Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument consists of nearly 5,000 square miles of underwater canyons and mountains off the New England coast.
\
Monument designations come with restrictions on certain activities. The White House said the designation will lead to a ban on commercial fishing, mining and drilling, though a seven-year exception will occur for the lobster and red crab industries. Others, such as whiting and squid harvesters, have 60 days to transition out. Recreational fishing will be allowed within the monument.

Deal with opponents of Arizona immigration law ends lawsuit
\
PHOENIX - A coalition of civil rights groups agreed to end its challenge of Arizona's landmark 2010 immigration law in a deal in which the state issued guidelines on how police officers must enforce the law's most contentious section.
\
The agreement unveiled Thursday ends the last of seven challenges to the law that was criticized for requiring officers, while enforcing other laws, to question the immigration status of people suspected of being in the country illegally.
\
Courts barred enforcement of other sections of the law, but the questioning requirement was ultimately upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court.
\
The enforcement guidelines include a requirement that officers document the reasons for their suspicion that a particular person is in the country illegally.

Found wing flap confirmed as part of MH370
\
SYDNEY - A wing flap that washed ashore on an island off Tanzania has been identified as belonging to missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, Australian officials said Thursday.
\
The flap was found in June by residents on Pemba Island, and officials had previously said it was highly likely to have come from the missing Boeing 777. An analysis by experts at the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, which is heading up the search for the plane, subsequently confirmed the part was indeed from the aircraft, the agency said in a statement.
\
Several pieces of wreckage suspected to have come from the plane have washed ashore around the Indian Ocean since the aircraft vanished with 239 people on board during a flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing on March 8, 2014.

Colin Bennett is no stranger to running as a Green Party candidate in the 33rd Senate District. He ran and lost in 2004, 2006, 2008 and 2014. The only race he missed in the past decade was in 2012, when he ran for Congress.
\
Bennett believes that the issue of climate change is too important not to keep trying to find a way to awaken people to the dangers involved, and if that involves running for office, then so be it, he says.
\
""Literally, I feel the world is on the precipice of disaster,"" said Bennett. ""I'm doing everything in my power to turn that around.""
\
Bennett, 37, lives in Westbrook, runs a small used bookstore in Deep River called Bennett's Books, and has other jobs to make ends meet. In the summer, Bennett works for Sail Connecticut Access, a nonprofit operation that gives people with special needs the opportunity to go sailing.
\
The campaign across the 33rd Senate District, which stretches down the Connecticut River Valley from Portland to Old Saybrook, has been dominated by disputes between Republicans and Democrats over Donald Trump and Gov. Dannel P. Malloy.
\
The Democratic candidate in the district, Essex First Selectman Norm Needleman, has been hammering away at the ties between the controversial GOP presidential candidate and the incumbent Republican, Art Linares.
\
Linares, who supports Trump's candidacy, has sought to capitalize on Needleman's past backing of Malloy and link Needleman to the unpopular governor's policies and tax increases.
\
""I do think it has been a distraction,"" Bennett said this week. Although Bennett is ""absolutely not a Trump supporter"" and is highly critical of Malloy, the Green Party candidate believes the race has been empty of discussion of major issues like ""the climate crisis.""

HARTFORD - Holding brightly colored signs, about 300 people rallied at the state Capitol Saturday afternoon to promote clean and renewable energy.
\
""We need to green our grid,"" said Martha Klien, a lead volunteer with the Connecticut Sierra Club. ""No more converting of residents to fossil fuels that merely accelerate climate change.""
\
The rally - sponsored by the Connecticut Sierra Club, 350 Connecticut, and other environmental, labor, faith and social justice groups - aimed to halt global warming, promote clean, renewable sources like solar and wind, and celebrate the state's recent decision to cancel plans for major natural gas pipelines.
\
Standing in the shadow of the Capitol, Chris Garaffa of New Haven struggled with the wind to keep his homemade sign upright. The sign read, ""Climate change is the symptom, capitalism is the disease.""
\
Garaffa said jobs and climate change are interrelated. If the country shuts down coal and nuclear power plants, people will lose jobs, he said. But it can replace these jobs by converting to solar or wind energy, which in turn will help with climate change, he said.
\
Garaffa said he opposes the major natural gas power-generating projects that have been proposed for the region.
\
""There is no such thing as clean natural gas or safe natural gas,"" he said. ""They are done for profit. They are not done with safety in mind.""
\
Susan Miller of Windsor said she came to the rally to make sure the legislature was paying attention to global warming.
\
""Because of the election, it's really inspired me to become more active to fight for things I believe in,"" she said. ""This met all of the needs.""

102,"
In a powerful testament to the warming of the planet, two leading U.S. science agencies Wednesday jointly declared 2016 the hottest year on record, surpassing the previous record set last year - which itself had topped a mark set in 2014.
\
The pronouncement comes two days before President-elect Donald Trump, who has tweeted that global warming is a hoax, takes office after a campaign in which he threatened to pull the nation out of an international agreement to fight climate change.
\
Trump has since said he has an open mind about the Paris climate accord, even as he has nominated to Cabinet posts men who have raised questions about the extent to which human activity is responsible for rising temperatures around the world.
\
Scientists have been far less guarded, noting the striking reality that global temperatures have set a record three years in a row.
\
""We don't expect record years every year, but the ongoing long-term warming trend is clear,"" Gavin Schmidt, who directs NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, said in a statement accompanying the government temperature report.
\
NASA announced the record jointly with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
\
Last year's warmth was manifested across the planet, from the warm tropical ocean waters off the coast of northeastern Australia that contribute to the widespread death of coral in the Great Barrier Reef, to the Arctic, where melting sea ice hit regular monthly record lows and overall temperatures were the highest on record, at least from January through September of 2016.
\
In a catalog of some of the extremes the planet witnessed during the year, the NOAA noted the megafire that engulfed Fort McMurray in Alberta, Canada, at the beginning of May, a conflagration that came relatively early in the year for wildfires. That event was consistent with a warming climate, as well as with the role of El Nino, although scientists are reluctant to formally say that climate change has played a role in an individual event without conducting extensive analysis.
\
Extreme high temperatures were seen from India - where the city of Phalodi recorded temperatures of 123.8 Fahrenheit in May, a new national record - to Iran, where a temperature of 127.4 Fahrenheit was recorded in Delhoran on July 22.
\
For the contiguous United States, 2016 was merely the second-warmest year on record, but for Alaska, it was the warmest yet recorded, underscoring once again the sharpness of Arctic warmth.
\
Last year's warmth was partly enhanced by a strong weather pattern known as El Nino, triggered by unusually warm waters in the Pacific. But the scientists underscore that the event is hardly the only cause. For example, 1998 was also, at the time, the warmest year on record, thanks in part to a strong El Nino - but the 2016 planetary temperature now far surpasses that year, meaning other factors probably contributed to the temperature's rise.
\
""This El Nino might have contributed about a quarter or a third"" of the record in 2016, Deke Arndt, chief of the global monitoring branch at NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information, said Wednesday.
\
Scientists said the three-year rise in temperatures only increases the urgency to battle climate change.
\
""2016 is a wake-up call in many ways,"" said Jonathan Overpeck, a climate scientist at the University of Arizona. ""Climate change is real, it is caused by humans and it is serious.""
\
Officially, average surface temperatures in 2016 were 0.07 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than 2015, and featured eight successive months - January through August - that were individually the warmest since the agency's record began in 1880, according to NOAA.
\
The average temperature across the world's land and ocean surfaces was 58.69 Fahrenheit, or 1.69 degrees above the 20th-century average of 57 degrees, NOAA said. The agency also noted that the record for the global temperature has now successively been broken five times since the year 2000. The years 2005 and 2010 were also record warm years, according to the agency's data.
\
NASA concurred with NOAA, also declaring 2016 the warmest year on record based on its own data tracking temperatures at the surface of the planet's land and oceans, and expressing ""greater than 95 percent certainty"" in that conclusion. In contrast, NOAA gave a 62 percent confidence in the broken record.

103,"Immigration Misconceptions\Win Heimer's Jan. 11 letter, ""Limiting Legal Immigrants Ill-Considered,"" demonstrates the public's misconceptions of immigration policy and history. Mr. Heimer wrote, ""My parents thankfully were allowed to leave Nazi-occupied Vienna and make their way to Connecticut."" Over the last eight years, the U.S. admitted nearly 1.1 million immigrants per year. But during the eight-year Nazi occupation of Vienna, the U.S. admitted fewer than 50,000 immigrants per year.\Under current law, only one-third of new immigrants are chosen because of their skills or for humanitarian reasons. The remaining two-thirds are chosen because of a family connection and are predominately lower-skilled workers, according to Pew research. A September 2016 study from the acclaimed National Academy of Sciences concluded that massive low-skilled immigration adversely affects the wages of lesser-educated Americans and prior immigrants.\NumbersUSA and Sen. Jeff Sessions support an immigration policy that serves the national interest as recommended by the last bipartisan U.S. Commission on Immigration chaired by the late-Civil Rights icon Barbara Jordan. The commission recommended reducing legal immigration to half of their current levels.\Chris Chmielenski, Bristow, Va.\The writer is director of content and activism for NumbersUSA.

While most of my friends asked, ""Why Hartford?"" and most people assumed I meant the West End, I have really loved living here. I'm minutes from arts, entertainment and history and can walk to Goodwin Park, one of the city's treasures for sure! My diverse neighbors are kind, helpful and are part of the reason I moved back to the city. This is where people come to live as immigrants, as my Swedish relatives did 100 years ago. And I am proud to be here and contribute to my community.\Sandra Johnson, Hartford\Trump's Bad Swamp\I have always cherished swamps as a sustaining source of biological diversity, teeming with life and regeneration. During the presidential campaign, Donald Trump chose to turn this natural source of sustenance and vitality into a metaphoric septic pit of degenerate human corruption and cronyism. From good swamp to bad swamp in one campaign rally slogan and pledge.\Chants of ""drain the swamp"" still play loudly in my head. All I can think of are President Trump's proposed new Cabinet secretaries who, almost to the one, represent the epitome of super wealth, profiteering and special interest - the very qualities that ""draining the swamp"" was supposed to eliminate in Washington. Instead, the American populace is about to become the victim of the ravenous alligators who will occupy senior positions in the new administration.\President Trump has cast his lot with multimillionaires and billionaires. His actions speak louder than words and promises. All of us who symbolically mirror the life-giving and interdependent qualities of a real swamp must seize the day and carry forward President Abraham Lincoln's quest for a just and free society, of the people, by the people and for the people. No time to waste.\Anne Foss, Farmington\Climate Change Created Refugees\Syria has long been troubled with population growth, social unrest, and government authoritarianism and corruption. After a prolonged period of drought, an event made more likely by global climate change, rural populations migrated into cities and organized with urban citizens in opposition to Assad's regime. All of these elements combined created the current Syrian conflict. Climate change on its own did not create this, nor is it directly attributed to its citizens' refugee status. But it exacerbated existing problems and hastened their inevitable conclusion. It is for this reason that the Pentagon has referred to climate change as a ""threat multiplier.""\Not all countries have the resources to easily adapt to and endure climate change. If climate change continues unabated, it is likely that Syria will not be the last country to experience refugee/migrant crises and violent societal upheaval. Comprehensive policies toward the refugee crisis should recognize and ameliorate underlying problems like climate change while providing support toward those unfairly dispossessed.\Such obligations are never easy, but we must remember that in a different set of circumstances, any one of us could be a refugee.\Arthur Nowell, South Windsor\White House Website Changes\As the transfer of power was taking place last month, a look at the White House website showed the elimination of the pages on LGBT issues, on climate change, the Affordable Care Act, and the Council on Women and Girls page. Now perhaps these issues are not being totally thrown away, but you can bet if they reappear, they will be much different than the ones that President Obama and the Democrats put in place.\Hold on, folks, the greatness is about to begin.\Trump voters own every single policy and issue to come.\Pam Bergren, East Hartford"
104,"Unusual weather in the Southwest could cause a nationwide salad shortage later this month. But that's just the tip of the iceberg (lettuce): Scientists say the weird weather is probably caused by climate change - which means these sorts of problems are likely to happen again.\The shortage, first reported by NPR, is the result of two separate phenomena in Arizona's Yuma County and California's Salinas Valley, where the United States grows most of its leafy greens. In Yuma, the lettuce harvest, which usually runs from November to April, wound up early because of unusually warm weather. And in central California, which typically picks up the harvest once Yuma is done, heavy precipitation delayed some plantings.\That could cause a gap at some point between lettuce supplies, said George Frisvold, an agricultural economist at the University of Arizona. Frisvold's colleague, Jonathan Overpeck, the director of the university's Institute of the Environment, says we can blame ourselves, in part, for the great salad shortage.\""There's this old adage in climate science that you can't attribute any one event to human causes,"" Overpeck said. ""That's not really true anymore, because now it's really been established that humans alter the whole global climate system. Anything related to increased warmth in the atmosphere likely has some element of human causation.""\Both the temperature in Yuma and the rain in Salinas have a link to atmospheric warmth. The case of Yuma is pretty obvious: Temperatures in the Southwest have been increasing for 100 years, and this winter was no different. According to the National Weather Service, February's average temperature was two degrees warmer than the recorded average in recent decades.\In Salinas, the situation is a bit more complex, Overpeck said. The region has seen an unusual number of storms called ""atmospheric rivers"" - you might know them by the name Pineapple Express - which push heavy precipitation to the Pacific coast from around the Hawaiian islands. It's unclear whether climate change has a role in the increased incidence of atmospheric rivers, Overpeck said. While some early research suggests that is the case, more data is needed to confirm it.\That said, it's ""a basic concept of physics"" that when the atmosphere is warmer, it holds more moisture, Overpeck explained. That means that, when storm clouds form, you see more snow and rain.\Incidentally, these sorts of cascading disruptions aren't just limited to lettuce - or even to the United States. Britain recently suffered a widely publicized shortage of iceberg lettuce, zucchini, broccoli and cabbage, brought on by extreme weather in Spain, Europe's ""salad bowl.""\Closer to home, fruit growers across the Northeast and Midwest have expressed concern that unusually high and fluctuating temperatures could cause crops like apples, cherries, plums and grapes to develop too early and expose them to spring freezes. The Progressive Farmer recently warned that ""almost off the charts"" temperatures in Kansas and Oklahoma could put early-growing winter wheat at similar risk, plus expose it to warm-weather pests and diseases.\In 2012, high winter temperatures cost Michigan $220 million in cherry harvests. That same year, unusually hot nighttime temperatures also cut into Corn Belt yields.\""Climate change impacts on agriculture,"" the report concludes, ""will have consequences for food security both in the U.S. and globally.""\Credit: Washington Post - - - ; By CAITLIN DEWEY"

It's ""good for the business, our shareholders and customers; if ultimately we are able to positively impact the environment in the process, that's a win too.""\Wal-Mart was one of 81 companies that promised to reduce emissions in the run up to the 2015 Paris global climate negotiations. The company upped its targets last November, saying it would get half its power from renewable sources by 2025.\Trump signed an order Tuesday that tells the Environmental Protection Agency to reconsider former President Barack Obama's climate rules, and rescinds a series of orders Obama issued to embed consideration of climate change in government actions from where to lease buildings to whether to allow oil pipelines to be built.\""Most big companies in the U.S. recognize that climate change is real,"" Geoffrey M. Heal, a professor at Columbia Business School, said in a telephone interview. ""They need to move ahead on the climate change front no matter what Trump's government does.""\Business's biggest lobbying force supports Trump on this issue. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce welcomed Trump's order, calling that shift ""vital to stimulating economic growth."" The group argues that Obama's regulations held back economic growth, preventing business owners from constructing needed pipelines, roads and other infrastructure.\But many of the group's members and other corporate titans supported Obama's Clean Power Plan, or have set their own goals. Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world's largest beer-maker, also announced Tuesday that it would get 100 percent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2025. Nearly 90 companies made similar pledges, according to the Sierra Club.\""We believe climate change is real and the science is well accepted,"" General Electric's Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Immelt, wrote in an internal blog post shared by the company. ""We hope that the United States continues to play a constructive role in furthering solutions to these challenges, and at GE, we will continue to lead with our technology and actions.""\Mars, the maker of M&M's, committed to eliminating its emissions entirely by 2040. Andy Pharoah, vice president of corporate affairs, said that Mars is ""disappointed the administration has decided to roll back climate regulations.""\Technology companies including Apple, Amazon.com, Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Microsoft also expressed their support for Obama's policies.\""We believe that strong clean energy and climate policies, like the Clean Power Plan, can make renewable energy supplies more robust and address the serious threat of climate change while also supporting American competitiveness, innovation, and job growth,"" the companies said in a joint statement after Trump's order was signed.\Other companies, while stopping short of criticizing the Trump administration, said they would keep pursuing lower emissions in their own operations. Procter & Gamble, Nestle Inc., Ikea, Levi Strauss & Co. and Best Buy Co., which all signed the 2015 pledge organized by the Obama administration, said they still intended to honor their commitments.\""We will continue to integrate sustainability into our business practices, operations, innovation, brand building and culture,"" Damon Jones, a spokesman for Procter & Gamble said.\Many energy businesses welcomed Trump's rollback. The Independent Petroleum Association of America, which represents oil and natural gas producers, joined the Chamber of Commerce in praising his move. So did the National Federation of Independent Business, which challenged the Clean Power Plan in court.\""People are going to freeze in the dark because of the destruction of the reliable electric power grid under Obama and the Democrats,"" Robert Murray, the president and CEO of coal-mining company Murray Energy Corp. said in an interview. ""Mr. Trump is doing the right things.""\Some environmental groups cautioned that action from the private sector wasn't enough to make up for the pullback in federal policy.\""Policy is going to be required to get us where we need to be,"" said Karen Palmer, research director at Resources for the Future.\Credit: Bloomberg - - - ; By CHRISTOPHER FLAVELLE"

The industry has suffered from political instability and a fragile security situation since the 2011 Arab Spring uprising. \The attacker in Hurghada, one of Egypt's most popular beach resorts and diving centers, stabbed the tourists in the face, neck and feet, according to the security official. \In the attack on the policemen, gunmen on a motorcycle opened fire on a security vehicle patrolling a Giza village, the Interior Ministry and officials said.\Cleared in killing of unarmed black man, Tulsa cop resigns\OKLAHOMA CITY - A white Oklahoma police officer recently acquitted of fatally shooting an unarmed black man submitted her resignation from the Tulsa Police Department on Friday, saying the desk job where she had been assigned made her feel isolated from fellow officers. \Officer Betty Shelby's resignation is effective Aug. 3, according to a news release from the Tulsa branch of a national police union.

110,"I am not a member of the deep state. I am not big government.\I am a scientist, a policy expert, a civil servant and a worried citizen. Reluctantly, I am also a whistleblower on an administration that chooses silence over science.\Nearly seven years ago, I came to work for the Interior Department, where, among other things, I've helped endangered communities in Alaska prepare for and adapt to a changing climate. But on June 15, I was one of about 50 senior department employees who received letters informing us of involuntary reassignments. Citing a need to ""improve talent development, mission delivery and collaboration,"" the letter informed me that I was reassigned to an unrelated job in the accounting office that collects royalty checks from fossil fuel companies. \I am not an accountant - but you don't have to be one to see that the administration's excuse for a reassignment such as mine doesn't add up. A few days after my reassignment, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke testified before Congress that the department would use reassignments as part of its effort to eliminate employees; the only reasonable inference from that testimony is that he expects people to quit in response to undesirable transfers. Some of my colleagues are being relocated across the country, at taxpayer expense, to serve in equally ill-fitting jobs. \I believe I was retaliated against for speaking out publicly about the dangers that climate change poses to Alaska Native communities. During the months preceding my reassignment, I raised the issue with White House officials, senior Interior officials and the international community, most recently at a U.N. conference in June. It is clear to me that the administration was so uncomfortable with this work, and my disclosures, that I was reassigned with the intent to coerce me into leaving the federal government. \On Wednesday, I filed two forms - a complaint and a disclosure of information - with the U.S. Office of Special Counsel. I filed the disclosure because eliminating my role coordinating federal engagement and leaving my former position empty exacerbate the already significant threat to the health and the safety of certain Alaska Native communities. I filed the complaint because the Trump administration clearly retaliated against me for raising awareness of this danger. Our country values the safety of our citizens, and federal employees who disclose threats to health and safety are protected from reprisal by the Whistleblower Protection Act and Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act. \Removing a civil servant from his area of expertise and putting him in a job where he's not needed and his experience is not relevant is a colossal waste of taxpayer dollars. Much more distressing, though, is what this charade means for American livelihoods. The Alaska Native villages of Kivalina, Shishmaref and Shaktoolik are perilously close to melting into the Arctic Ocean. In a region that is warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet, the land upon which citizens' homes and schools stand is newly vulnerable to storms, floods and waves. As permafrost melts and protective sea ice recedes, these Alaska Native villages are one superstorm from being washed away, displacing hundreds of Americans and potentially costing lives. The members of these communities could soon become refugees in their own country.\Alaska's elected officials know climate change presents a real risk to these communities. Gov. Bill Walker, an independent, and Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski have been sounding the alarm and scrambling for resources to help these villages. But to stave off a life-threatening situation, Alaska needs the help of a fully engaged federal government. Washington cannot turn its back. \While I have given small amounts to Democratic candidates in the past, I have no problem whatsoever working for a Republican administration. I believe that every president, regardless of party, has the right and responsibility to implement his policies. But that is not what is happening here. Putting citizens in harm's way isn't the president's right. Silencing civil servants, stifling science, squandering taxpayer money and spurning communities in the face of imminent danger have never made America great. \Now that I have filed with the Office of Special Counsel, it is my hope that it will do a thorough investigation into the Interior Department's actions. Our country protects those who seek to inform others about dangers to American lives. The threat to these Alaska Native communities is not theoretical. This is not a policy debate. Retaliation against me for those disclosures is unlawful. \Let's be honest: The Trump administration didn't think my years of science and policy experience were better suited to accounts receivable. It sidelined me in the hope that I would be quiet or quit. Born and raised in Maine, I was taught to work hard and speak truth to power. Trump and Zinke might kick me out of my office, but they can't keep me from speaking out.

111,"NEW DELHI - Every year, thousands of Indian farmers commit suicide. Now one researcher thinks it may have something to do with climate change.\Tamma Carleton, a researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, compared almost five decades worth of suicide and climate data and concluded that temperature variations in India may have ""a strong influence"" on suicide rates during the growing season.\In her study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA, Carleton estimates that more than 59,000 farmer suicides over the past 30 years can be linked to global warming.\Carleton's findings are particularly worrying and come just two months after the Trump administration pulled out of the Paris climate accord, which was adopted by 196 countries, including the United States under the Obama administration in December 2015. As part of the agreement, world leaders committed to holding the average global temperature rise to ""well below"" two degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit. After Trump pulled out of the accord, many countries, including India and China, said they would continue to honor their commitments under the accord.\Senior members of the administration, including Trump, have expressed skepticism that climate change is caused by man-made carbon dioxide emissions. In a tweet in 2012, he wrote, ""The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.""\According to one estimate cited in Carleton's article, India could experience an average temperature rise of 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit. The study suggests that the implications for India's mostly rural population could be devastating. ""My findings suggest that this warming will be accompanied by a rising number of lives lost to self-harm,"" she writes.\High temperatures in the growing season reduce crop yields, putting economic pressure on India's farmers, she writes. ""These crop losses may also permeate throughout the economy, causing both farming and nonfarming populations to face distress as food prices rise and agricultural labor demand falls.""\Rainfall in the growing season, too, is important, Carleton suggests. More rain means higher yields, she writes, noting: ""Suicide rates fall as growing season rainfall increases.""\According to the World Health Organization, India accounts for the highest number of suicides in the world. A staggering 133,623 people took their own lives in 2015, according to data from the National Crime Records Bureau. More than 12,000 of those were farmers and farm laborers.\According to Indian authorities, bankruptcy and indebtedness or farming-related issues are cited as the major causes of suicide among farmers in India.\Credit: By Vidhi Doshi - The Washington Post"
112,"Millstone Mum \On Finances\In the articles written about the Millstone Power Station, few have clarified the state of affairs better than Stephen Singer's Courant piece on Aug. 22 [Business, Dominion Digs In On Finances]. \According to that story, Dominion Energy Inc. (Millstone's owner) is ""doubling down as it resists demands that it hand over financial information"" to state legislators, and reiterating ""the possibility of closing Millstone if it's denied access"" to renewable energy state contracts.\Millstone, which says it's worried about financial security, wants a special deal to bid alongside renewable producers. The plant insists it needs this arrangement to remain competitive. But when the state seeks essential financial information, Millstone resists.\This should, at the very least, raise questions for lawmakers and consumers. If Millstone is in financial need, wouldn't it welcome the investigation? If Millstone was in a perilous situation, wouldn't it have every incentive to be forthright and prove it? Millstone's reluctance to share financial information is telling. \Millstone had until Aug. 29 to share information with the state. It requested more time and was given three more weeks. The details the company has shared thus far are sparse at best. Until it follows through with the state's request, we're obligated to keep asking for evidence.\Matt Fossen, Greenwich\The writer is spokesperson for the Stop the Millstone Payout, a coalition of the independent power generators Calpine Corp., Dynegy, and NRG Energy.\Learning From History\Thank you for the article about the Civil War re-enactments [Sept. 5, Living, ""What Of Civil War Re-Enactments""]. Members of my family fought in the Civil War. In this case they were part of the northern forces, but either way, it's part of history. \The Phoenix Stage Company in the Oakville section of Watertown is performing a play called ""Rebel Yells,"" which happens to re-enact a hospital room in the South during the Civil War. But it's not about slavery or even about the war. It's about six people coming together to discuss what the war has taken from them - limbs, faith, love. It could be any war in any time period. \History is not racist or bigotry. It's a learning experience so that we don't repeat it. Isn't that what someone once said? \Laurie Phillips, Naugatuck\The writer's husband is in the cast of ""Rebel Yells.""\Houston, Could It Be Climate Change?\Until 1998 no major league hitter had hit more than 61 home runs in a year, but after that there were several. Two of them, Sammy Sosa and Mark McGuire had four years of 50 or more homers, a feat matched only by Babe Ruth. There had to be a reason, and there was. Their ability was boosted by drugs, and uncovering it helped baseball by increasing trust in the game.\Then, a financial firm claimed to have only one losing month in over a decade, and further claimed extraordinary annual returns. Again there was a reason. It was a Ponzi scheme led by Bernard Madoff. Ferreting out that crime helped increase trust in the financial profession, and to some degree aid the victims.\Now came an unprecedented storm over Houston in which more than 50 inches of rain fell. Reservoirs were facing a perilous situation. More than a trillion gallons of rain fell. Once again, it would seem there has to be a reason - and dare we say that might just be climate change. Admitting it might just help a lot of people and help mitigate many such future weather catastrophes, not just for our beloved country but our precious planet. Truth hurts, truth helps.\Norman L. Bender, Woodbridge\Pay It Forward Tax Plan\Connecticut needs to encourage successful people and businesses to move to here and stay here for the long run. I propose an individually targeted rolling phase-out of the personal and business income tax.\Starting in 2019, any individual or business that pays income tax in Connecticut for eight consecutive years will never again have to pay state income tax as long as they retain continuous residency in the state.\Alternately, a business or individual could permanently buy out of their Connecticut state tax liability by paying an amount equal to 3 times the average of their current tax liability (as figured by the average payment for the previous three years).\This would create an immediate windfall for the state as high income individuals and successful businesses take advantage of this program. It could also be used to lure businesses and high income individuals to the state from our high tax neighbors in New York, Rhode Island and Massachusetts, as well as from other high-tax states throughout the country.\These high income individuals and businesses could deduct these state taxes from their federal taxes to reduce the financial impact of the upfront costs and sidestep any future elimination of the deduction of state taxes.\Ian Kaswan, Glastonbury"
113,"SIMSBURY - Some Simsbury residents say a 26-megawatt solar farm proposed for Simsbury farmland will create irreversible negative impacts to the town, including diminishing the town's character, a reduction in property values and adverse environmental impacts on animal migration patterns and water quality.\Others insist that it will improve property values, reduce the tax burden on residents and is the lowest impact use for the land, which is currently being farmed but is zoned for residential and light industrial use.\More than 50 people turned out for a public hearing at Eno Memorial Hall on Tuesday to learn more about the proposal put forth by Rhode Island-based company Deepwater Wind that is currently being evaluated by the Connecticut Siting Council - the state authority that regulates such projects.\Deepwater Wind wants to build the Tobacco Valley Solar Farm on 156 acres in north Simsbury, whose parcels total 289 acres. It is expected to produce enough energy to power 5,000 homes. Deepwater would be selling the energy to utility companies, not to residents.\If approved, Deepwater Wind would install 110,000, 10-foot solar panels on the property. Deepwater Wind officials on Tuesday estimated that about 30 acres of trees would be cleared for the project, while 133 acres would be preserved as open space or forested area. \Deepwater Wind officials noted Tuesday that two of the five historic tobacco barns located on the property - two structures along Hoskins Road - would remain. However, officials stated that the structures are in severe disrepair and that there are no current plans to use them as part of the project.\Deepwater Wind was selected from a pool of respondents to the state's Three-State Clean Energy Request for Proposals. The company is also working on solar projects in Foster and Glocester, R.I., and belongs to a group that has completed projects totaling 800 megawatts of solar energy. It recently completed an offshore wind farm for Block Island.\About 20 people addressed the siting council Tuesday. The 15 people who spoke in opposition to the plan said they were not opposed to the idea of green energy or solar farms, but called various aspects of the project into question.\""We all know, as much as we'd like to go to the light switch for power, we've also got to go to the refrigerator for food,"" said Joe Pozzato, who lives near the proposed site. ""We've got to keep the farms going. They're disappearing.""\Jason Polayes, who lives nearby, told council members he was concerned about the effect the project would have on water quality, particularly for those with wells in the area. \""I believe if this project is done, it should be done right and I believe as it stands now, the proposal is not to the benefit yet of the residents around it,"" Polayes said. ""I don't understand the complexity of a wind farm off Block Island. This is a solar farm in a residential area and I imagine it poses other challenges and I don't know if I've seen those taken into consideration yet for the proposal.""\Six people spoke in favor of the proposal, saying solar panels are a better option for the land than the prospective housing development or light industrial warehouses the current local zoning allows for.\Mark Scully said he was ""willing to accept the sacrifice of putting a solar farm on this site.""\""I think looking back, this will not materially influence the residential character of the town,"" Scully said.\""I think there are very serious, legitimate concerns that our citizens have raised and I would encourage you to make the modifications that will allow this solar farm to be built that is in keeping with the character of this community,"" Scully said. ""My reasoning is simple: We all need to do our part to address climate change. ... Future generations will thank us for this project.""\In addition to the public hearing, Tuesday's events included a site review and an evidentiary hearing, in which the council further questioned Deepwater Wind.\Because the project site was too expansive to walk and still privately used as farmland, council members and others in attendance, including town leaders, viewed the land via public vantage points during a driving tour. The tour route extended primarily through the residential areas that abut the property.\In several areas, but most notably in the neighborhoods along Munnisunk Drive, Gordon Street and Knollwood Circle, the proposed solar site was visible through the treeline of many backyards. \In August, First Selectwoman Lisa Heavner formally announced the town's opposition to the project, saying the application to the siting council lacked sufficient information for the council to render a decision. \Heavner said town leaders called upon the siting council to reduce the project's scope ""to lessen the impact on abutters and the public including the removal of the parcel located on the southern side of Hoskins [Road]."" \She added that the project should be amended to include visual buffers and landscaping ""based on visual elements characteristic of and already existing in Simsbury,"" and that historical landmarks should be preserved.\Heavner said Tuesday that town leaders would remain willing to work with Deepwater Wind to ensure the proposal considers the concerns of town officials and residents.\The evidentiary hearing was continued until Oct. 10 at 11 a.m. at the siting council headquarters in New Britain. The deadline for a decision on the matter is Dec. 26, according to a tentative schedule released by the siting council.\Credit: By JORDAN OTERO SISSON - jsisson@courant.com"

115,"The Southwest endured its worst heat wave in decades. Triple-digit temperatures forced the cancellation of dozens of flights at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. It was too hot to fly. And then there were hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, which disrupted even more travel plans and led to the cancellations of countless others.\""Weather events are becoming more frequent, more severe and, in many cases, the seasons in which we worry about them are becoming longer,"" says Meghan McPherson, who teaches at Adelphi University's emergency management program. ""Much of our infrastructure was designed to function in the climate in which it was created. Because of this, roads that never flooded even 10 years ago are now flooding in everyday rainstorms. Our planes are unable to take off in heat they were not designed to withstand.""\So how do you travel during a time of extreme weather? There's nothing you can do to change the climate, at least in the short term, but there are a few steps you can take to ensure that disruptions are kept to a minimum.\If you're concerned about an early thaw this winter, for example, you can plan your ski trip for a time when snow is more of a sure thing - say, move your vacation from early March to mid-February. You can apply this climate-conscious travel planning to other trips, too. Take that Caribbean cruise in December or January to steer clear of hurricane season.\The threat of global warming also should influence where you go. Greg Geronemus, the co-chief executive of SmarTours, a tour operator, says more of his clients are asking him about ""last chance"" destinations that are threatened by climate change.\Many travel companies have ""Act of God"" clauses that let them off the hook for weather-related delays or cancellations. That fine print is in the airline's contract of carriage or in your cruise line's ticket contract, and it means the company can cancel a trip without having to cover your expenses or get you to your destination. A good travel insurance policy can make things smoother - whatever the weather.\Credit: By CHRISTOPHER ELLIOTT - Washington Post"
116,"HARARE, Zimbabwe - Zimbabwe's president said Wednesday he fired his deputy and longtime ally for scheming to take power, including by consulting witch doctors, while Emmerson Mnangagwa said he has left the country after ""incessant threats"" to him and his family. \The demonization of the deposed vice president is the clearest sign yet that President Robert Mugabe, who at 93 is the world's oldest head of state, is preparing his wife, Grace, to succeed him. \Mnangagwa said he was safe but did not mention his location. ""I will be communicating with you soon and shall return to Zimbabwe to lead you,"" he said in a statement. \Mugabe spoke publicly for the first time since dismissing Mnangagwa, who had been seen as Mugabe's potential successor. Now Mugabe's wife appears poised for the role. \Mugabe told thousands of cheering supporters that Mnangagwa had plotted to take over since becoming a vice president in 2014. Mnangagwa replaced Joice Mujuru, who had been ousted and accused by Mugabe of using witchcraft to take power. \""We have kicked him out for the same reasons that saw us chasing away Mujuru,"" Mugabe said of Mnangagwa.\The president added: ""People were told that I will retire in March but I did not.

His comments reflected the recent hardening of Egypt's public rhetoric on Shiite and non-Arab Iran.\New Venezuelan law clamps down on dissent, hate \CARACAS, Venezuela - Venezuela's all-powerful constitutional assembly passed a wide-reaching law on Wednesday that clamps down on social media and broadcasters alike by ordering prison sentences of up to 20 years for anyone who instigates hate. \The pro-government assembly passed the law, accompanied by applause and flag-waving on the chamber floor. It prohibits Venezuelans from spreading any message through television, radio or social media that instigates violence or hate. \It drew swift criticism from international human rights advocates, who say the new law cracks down on dissent by criminalizing peaceful protests, the hallmark of a democratic society. \Backers of socialist Nicolas Maduro have often accused opponents of being fascists spreading hateful messages.\Puerto Rico reports a rise in daily deaths after Maria \SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico - The pace of deaths quickened on Puerto Rico immediately after Hurricane Maria - well beyond the numbers officially attributed to the storm. \The U.S. territory reported an average of 82 deaths a day in the two weeks before Maria hit. That average increased to 117 from Sept. 20 to 30, though the rate has declined since then. \The territory said 55 people died in the Sept. 20 hurricane or later as result of it. The overall daily death figures hint that storm could have caused other fatalities as well, though officials of the government's forensic institute said Wednesday that they don't have evidence to attribute them to the storm. \Jose Lopez Rodriguez of the Puerto Rico Demographic Register says the post-storm increase was a ""significant difference."" \Angelika Graswald, 37, who admitted removing a plug from her fiance's kayak before it capsized in the Hudson River but maintained she was falsely accused of intentionally causing his death, was sentenced Wednesday to up to four years in a New York prison.

117,"When I began teaching at UConn in 1984, I started a file of state newspaper clippings for my geoscience courses. One of the first things I learned was that more than 6,000 acres of wetland on the Connecticut shore was converted to dry land prior to the 1970s by ditching, draining and dumping within tidal wetlands. This allowed land-hungry communities to spread out over what was then being called artificial fill. \At the time, I wondered naively why any government would permit such land use practices during a geological epoch of melting ice sheets and rising sea level. Today, any governing entity for coastal property knows that the pace of sea level rise has accelerated, and that an epoch of stronger subtropical storms is upon us. \Within the last decade, the owners of Connecticut coastal properties have been kicked in the shins by rising insurance premiums. Now, the state and municipal governments with jurisdiction over those lands are being kicked by Moody's Investors Service. This credit rating agency, arguably our nation's most respected, has put coastal states and municipalities on notice that Moody's credit ratings for state and municipal bonds will hereafter be tied to coastal preparedness. \The fiscally conservative and hazards aware part of me is loving this news because it proclaims an obvious truth that we geologists have taught for a half-century. Easy come, easy go. Lowlands created easily by shallow fill will be the first to go under. We're talking about our national mall in Washington, D.C., much of the Bay Area in San Francisco, the Florida coastal strip, New York, Boston and countless other cities with large areas of low-lying fill within city limits. \To understand this sea change in Moody's tone, simply pause and reflect on what the past hurricane season did to poorly prepared coastal communities. The media frenzy has abated, but the financial shocks keeps growing. The estimated recovery costs are: $180 billion for Harvey in Texas; $95 billion for Maria in Puerto Rico; $50 billion for Maria in Florida. The total is triple that of historic Hurricane Katrina, once considered the ""costliest hurricane in U.S. history."" \Though the U.S. is $20 trillion in debt, each disaster is met by battalions of federal employees who coordinate recovery and help pay the bills. In Houston alone, more than 10,000 people were physically rescued, and nearly 1 million citizens have asked for financial assistance. Any money our federal government pays them will be borrowed from somewhere else. Though the size of our debt staggers belief and is beggaring the next generation, it's only enough to pay for 61 hurricane seasons like the last one. \Continuing with the example of Houston, the Dec. 1 New York Times published an investigation about building on the city's reclaimed marshes and swamps. In Houston, 6,000 properties were built in zones designated as safe following minor engineering alterations such as building levees and raising the land surface a few inches with imported soil. In one of these so-called safe zones, a sprawling, upscale residential community called the Woodlands was submerged by the floods of hurricane Harvey. This inundation, the paper said, ""underscored the profound vulnerability of a metropolis with an ethos of untrammeled development built, essentially, on a swamp."" This quote could also apply to the development-crazed ethos of the Connecticut shoreline prior to the 1970s, after which the state stopped encouraging the filling of floodplains and coastal marshes. Everything built on those lands is now at risk. Easy come, easy go. \This brings us to the concept of the so-called 500-year flood. To statisticians, it's the flood with a 1-in-500 (0.2 percent) chance of occurring in any given year. To geologists, it's pure fiction because it requires that an unknown future behaves in a way similar to the recent past, and that a century's worth of data can be used to extrapolate the next 400 years. \This fiction explains why Houston has experienced three 500-year floods within the last three years. Each is a fairy tale on which federal flood policy has been based. I'm glad the private sector reads non-fiction. \Robert M.

118,"
Ted Kaufman's Sunday essay on climate change finally drew together incontrovertible information on the hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of members of professional scientific societies in the U.S. alone who understand and support the concept of present and future climate change brought on by our overuse of carbon-based energy sources.
\
The ""deniers"" of such concepts can only summon up a mere ""35,000 scientists disagree"" and present zero evidence to support that utterly untenable position.
\
Ironically, the same day's paper included two related news items:
\
""Mild weather redefines winter landscape"" and ""Weather officials predicting warmer-than-usual winter.""
\
How many times must we read such headlines before action is taken to, at least, reduce this threat to our children, grandchildren and generations (if any) beyond?

No one would argue that electricity generated from renewable resources is not a desirable thing, but the well-intentioned blind pursuit of it is pushing electricity prices higher in The First State.
\
Delaware's businesses and homeowners are already paying dearly to keep the lights on. According to federal statistics, Delaware has the 13th highest residential electricity rate in the nation, the 13th highest commercial rate and seventh highest residential average monthly bill.
\
One cost driving up prices is Delaware's membership in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), a nine-state ""cap and trade"" compact designed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from large power plants. While a case could have been made for Delaware's joining the coalition in 2008, today our participation lacks credibility.
\
Unanticipated changes in the energy market, and upgrades at several Delaware power plants, will result in our state's power industry producing about 40 percent less CO2 by 2014 -- far surpassing the RGGI target of a 10 percent reduction by 2019.
\
Despite having more than exceeded its goal, Delaware remains in the program because the hidden tax it levies on ratepayers is used to fund renewable energy initiatives supported by Gov. Jack Markell's administration. According to a RGGI report, through the end of 2010, Delaware had reaped nearly $18.9 million though the program.

Another reason for Delaware's escalating electricity prices is the state's Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) -- a mandate that an increasing percentage of the electricity supplied to Delaware consumers come from renewable sources.
\
When the RPS was established in 2005, 10 percent of the electricity sold in the state had to come from renewables by the year 2020. That percentage has since been raised twice. Currently, the RPS now stands at 25 percent by the year 2025.
\
The RPS is well-meaning, but short-sighted. Delaware is not well-positioned for the placement of wind turbines. The only wind power resources we have are along the coast or off-shore, neither of which has proven locally viable on a large scale.
\
Some Delaware utilities are investing in solar arrays, like the 10-megawatt Dover SUN Park, to help comply with the RPS. In addition to being subsidized through the sale of renewable energy credits and federal tax credits -- which are financed by ratepayers and taxpayers -- the direct costs of solar energy are quite high.
\
According to David T. Stevenson, director of the Caesar Rodney Institute's Center for Energy Competitiveness, ""electricity from solar farms costs four to five times more than conventional sources."" In the case of the Dover SUN Park, Stevenson says ""the total added cost ... compared to using conventional power over the 20-year contract will be $65 million or $3.25 million a year.""
\
Aside from cost is the worrisome reality that wind and solar energy are not reliable. The amount of electricity they produce is impacted by the time of day, as well as weather and seasonal conditions. Neither can be counted on to produce power when demand is at its peak.
\
Contrast this with electricity generated from natural gas turbines, which are environmentally friendly, far less expensive for ratepayers, and dependable. Turbines can also be quickly be started and stopped to efficiently meet fluctuating demand.
\
The good news is that new technology for capturing natural gas trapped in shale formations has dramatically increased supplies and dropped prices in the last several years. Using this plentiful and relatively clean domestic energy source would be far less expensive for Delaware's homeowners and businesses than that being supplied via the ever-increasing Renewable Portfolio Standard.
\
It was with these issues in mind that I sponsored House Bill 247. It sought to freeze the state's renewable electricity mandate at current levels, which stand at 7 percent for this compliance year. I reasoned the freeze would give state officials a chance to reassess the direction of Delaware's energy policy.
\
The bill failed to clear the House Energy Committee, which is chaired by one of Gov. Markell's most ardent energy policy supporters.
\
Our state's energy policy seems single-minded in its determination to force the use of renewable energy on ratepayers with an utter disregard for the burden those higher costs are placing on homeowners and businesses.
\
Our citizens deserve better. Our energy plan should be dynamic and informed, recognizing and adjusting to changing conditions in a way that acknowledges the importance of holding costs in check as well as our responsibility to be good environmental stewards.

NASA's James Hansen has produced a ""statistical analysis"" showing that summer heat waves are more common now than in the period 1950 - 1980. He claims that this proves that the earth is warming and that CO2 from burning fossil fuel is the cause.
\
In the related Aug. 7 article Hansen does not mention that (1) satellite measurements show that there has been no net global warming since 1998, even though atmospheric CO2 levels have been climbing every year; and (2) Hansen's own NASA GISS surface temperature records show that in the U.S. at least, 1934 was as warm as 1998.
\
Hansen chose to ignore the hot, dry ""Dust Bowl"" years of the 1930s and to base his study in the cooler years from 1950 through 1980, making warming in the late 20th century look more unusual. Hansen's claim that today's weather ""is so rare that it can't be anything but man-made global warming"" is political propaganda based on a misleading presentation of the scientific record. Happily it will soon be forgotten.

The lead article ""Study: Climate shift dramatic"" (Aug. 7) featured the viewpoint of Dr. James E. Hansen, a climate change activist highly acclaimed by his fellow peers that continue to forecast ""gloom and doom"" for our civilization.
\
Dr. Hansen has been a frequent advisor to our current President on climate change legislative needs. One should understand that the majority of Hansen's opinions and conclusions are based on his data from the 1950s through 2011. May I remind our readers that during the 1965-1975 period he and his ""so called experts"" were predicting a global ""cooling.""
\
Did the authors of your article know that Hansen was arrested three times for his political activates?
\
Yes, I'm a skeptic, I look to an acclaimed M.I.T. scientist, Dr. Richard S. Lindzen, for his long-term view of climate change from the dark age , which were hotter than today, when London did not flood, to our present day.

Inch by inch along parts of the Atlantic Coast, global climate change is running in what scientists warn is geology's version of fast-forward - swamping and eroding beaches, wetlands and farm fields.
\
ROBERT CRAIG/THE NEWS JOURNAL
\
Shorelines from North Carolina to Boston are in a 'hotspot' for sea-level rise and will see water levels rise at double the rate of most places on the planet, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The doubling is largely because of a geologic double whammy. Delaware also has the lowest average elevation, at 60 feet, of any state in the country ... and it's sinking.

\
The treasured lifestyle of residents along the coasts of the Mid-Atlantic could significantly change by the time this year's high school graduates retire, scientists say.
\
The larger issue for taxpayers is where to spend money and energy attempting to hold back the ocean - and where to retreat and allow nature to take its course.
\
Humans have already changed Earth's atmosphere by releasing vast amounts of carbon dioxide and similar heat-trapping gases from power plants, vehicles and other sources, scientists say.
\
The resulting rise in air and sea-surface temperatures, along with melting glaciers and land ice, will push up sea levels globally by more than 1 1/2 feet by 2100.
\
Along the Delaware, Maryland, Virginia and New Jersey coasts, sea levels could rise faster and higher - nearly 1 1/2 feet by 2050 and 3 1/2 to nearly 5 feet by the end of the century, according to DNREC and other federal and science agency reports.
\
That could swamp tens of thousands of homes and businesses along the coasts and jeopardize big chunks of land along Maryland's fragile Chesapeake Bay. In Delaware alone, DNREC predicts a 1 1/2-foot rise in sea level would inundate more than 110,000 acres. At 3 feet, more than 133,000 acres would be impacted.
\
With a higher ocean, saltier water would push farther upstream, especially in summertime and drought years, making it harder to dilute for public consumption. Water supplies for communities along the Delaware River to Philadelphia could be threatened. And Wilmington's port, its riverfront and its Southbridge neighborhood could be inundated with water.
\
Delaware is ""extremely vulnerable,"" said Collin P. O'Mara, secretary of Delaware's Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control.
\
It may be worse along the Eastern Shore of Maryland.
\
""Dorchester County as we know it will simply disappear beneath the tide,"" says a Maryland assessment for the low-lying county on the Chesapeake Bay .
\
Tom Bradshaw, a lifelong Dorchester resident, said, ""Unfortunately, that statement is true. I grew up in the lower part of the county, and there are places under water now that were dry marshland when I was a kid.""
\
Different challenge
\
Like Maryland, Delaware has barrier beaches along the Atlantic that take a pounding. But the First State also faces a different challenge along Delaware Bay, where farm fields and homes are already being lost to encroaching brine water, and inland residents find themselves inside newly widened floodplains.
\
DNREC computer models show parts of the narrow Del. 1 corridor between Dewey Beach and Fenwick Island will be threatened or flooded daily at high tides by 2050, even in calm weather. With a 3-foot rise, all that's left in spots is a thin, fragile dune ridge between the Atlantic Ocean and the Inland bays, leaving little to protect thousands of homes and resort developments from the force of Atlantic Ocean waves and tidal surges already capable of swamping waterside communities.
\
Delaware officials are assessing what it would cost to hold back the tide, or to let the water rise. Statewide, nearly 152,000 acres could be submerged in the worst case, about 11 percent of the total land area, with New Castle and Kent County both losing about 12 percent and larger Sussex 9 percent.
\
One scenario estimates an up-to $200 million expense during the next 30 years just to help seven bayside communities withstand, or gracefully retreat from, rising tides.
\
And that figure does not include ongoing state and federal costs for replenishing sand lost in coastal communities along the Atlantic Ocean in Lewes, Rehoboth Beach, Bethany Beach and Fenwick Island, or raising evacuation routes. Taxpayers spent $35 million just for sand replenishment during the past 18 months.
\
Investing resources
\
Eleven of the state's largest environmental groups already have drafted a joint statement supporting DNREC's soon-to-be-released sea-level vulnerability findings, citing dramatic potential losses to the state's economy and ecosystems.
\
O'Mara said communities along Delaware's coast and bays are ""very special places. But at the same time, if we're going to invest resources from all taxpayers, we need to make sure there is a public benefit.""
\
In Kent County's South Bowers community along Delaware Bay, homeowner Alfred Izzarone argues the state needs to raise the sole access road so residents can flee, or access, their homes, when water rises. The narrow lane was raised 18 inches in 1996, and it got another 3 1/2-inch boost during a recent repaving.
\
But the water sometimes still gets dangerously high around Izzarone's home, built in 1938 and placed on pilings in 1984.
\
He can't erase the night a few years ago when he was nearly swept away by water while attempting an emergency gas line repair.
\
A monster storm whipped up without warning on Mother's Day of 2008, and water rose 5 feet around the house. His neighborhood lost 16 cars during that storm and several homes were damaged.
\
""I luckily grabbed hold of the piling and worked my way back,"" recalled Izzarone, who believes the state needs to replenish the sand in front of his community. ""It's increasing. I live here, walk the beach every day and see the high water line on super high tides and full moons and new moons.""
\
'Get used to it'
\
Get used to it, scientists say. Our weather has changed. Society must adapt to higher tides and storm surges, deeper heat waves and droughts, more intense storms and changes in long-term weather patterns.
\
An international army of scientists also warns the world is just a few years away from a ""tipping point"" in carbon dioxide releases. Carbon dioxide pollution from power plants needs to peak at 32 billion tons annually worldwide by 2017 to avoid a more-than 3.6-degree increase in average world temperature - the threshold where weather, climate, ocean and sea-level changes are expected to have drastic human costs. An Energy Department report last week showed a promising drop in U.S. carbon dioxide emissions, but it won't come close to heading off that tipping point.
\
""It would appear that we may have to adapt to at least 1 meter [slightly more than 3 feet] of sea-level rise by 2100 no matter what, and that means that state and local governments will need to work with the federal government to build sea walls and coastal defenses, engage in some degree of 'managed retreat,'"" said Michael E. Mann, a Penn State University geophysicist who has been at the center of climate change research and controversy since the 1990s.
\
Adds Susan Love, a coastal program planner for Delaware's Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control: ""It's a big deal for the state of Delaware, for the way we live our lives, for the places we recreate, where we work.""
\
Delaware and Maryland officials recognize the danger inherent in sea-level rise and have evolving plans for dealing with it. In North Carolina, however, lawmakers approved a plan banning consideration of sea-level rise based on climate change for development decisions.
\
""That's the most absurd thing I've ever heard,"" O'Mara said. ""We're already seeing impacts. Every study that comes out shows that we can't wait"" to take action.
\
Delaware is cautiously beginning to add up the toll, based on estimates of an up-to-4 1/2-foot sea-level rise. Among the likely losses within this century, as calculated by DNREC in its upcoming vulnerability report:
\
* All of Delaware's 73,400 acres of tidal wetlands, and 98 percent of its tidal marsh
\
* Up to 15,000 Sussex County homes or businesses; 18,000 statewide, including 5 percent of identifiable commercial properties.
\
* 44 percent of the state's parks, refuges, conservation areas and otherwise protected land.
\
* 5 percent of roads and bridges, including 6 percent of evacuation routes.
\
* 6 percent of railroad lines, including areas around Wilmington's Amtrak station.
\
Government help
\
There are many examples of communities, institutions and individuals struggling to hold back rising tides, or wondering what to do when high water reaches them. Government assistance is often required.
\
In Chincoteague, Va., home of the famous wild pony roundup, townspeople have asked four of the past 10 years that federal dollars be used to repair the public parking lot on the beach savaged by storms. Annual costs range from $200,000 to $700,000, contingent upon the extent of the damage.
\
Without the 961-space parking lot there is no tourism economy, they argue. Tourists won't schlep their beach umbrellas, coolers and kids from an inland park lot to a shuttle and make a 2-mile ride to the beach, as environmentalists have proposed. While debate over a long-term solution continued this spring, giant earthmovers repaired the lot at federal taxpayers' expense.
\
East of Dover, landowner David Shevock blames the state and other private landowners for failing to fix storm-damaged wetland dikes that once kept briny Delaware Bay tides and surges away from fields where he grows corn and soybeans - and from the once-freshwater wetland habitats where he hunts.
\
""If we have a big storm or a northeast storm, the water from the bay lays in there for four days. The whole farm's under water at times,"" Shevock said. ""Some of the land there is in cultivation, but it can't be used now"" because of salt buildup in the soil.
\
In the city of Wilmington, Delaware Nature Society officials are facing the long-term prospect of losing the marshy Russell W. Peterson Wildlife Area landmark, where the group operates a new educational center visible from I-95. State computer assessments show open water will push inland from the Delaware River and flood most of the marsh by 2050, turning the rest of the center's interpretative marsh into open water within a few decades.
\
""You hear about Bowers Beach and Dewey Beach preparing for sea-level rise, but no one is thinking about Wilmington, because we don't have waves,"" said Brenna Goggin, a DNS environmental advocate. ""But we have the river, and if the water is rising, it's going to rise everywhere. If you look at maps for places like Southbridge, you're not seeing a pretty picture.""
\
At Kitts Hummock, a bayside village south of Delaware's sprawling Dover Air Force Base, homeowner Tom Idnurm is taking his chances - but believes he'll eventually need government help. Late last month on a blazing hot day, Idnurm watched contractors lower a new modular home onto his lot - the same spot where his previous cottage was trashed by an unexpected and record-setting coastal storm in mid-2008.
\
""Quite honestly, they [state government] should probably look at a long-term plan of buying out the property owners here, and letting it return to nature,"" said Idnurm, whose views differ with some bayside landowners eager for permanent beach restorations. ""I would hate to lose my place, but the reality is, it's going to flood again.""
\
About 100 miles south, at NASA's Wallops Island space facility on Virginia's Eastern Shore, federal officials extended a sea wall and pumped 3.2 million cubic yards of sand along the beach last year to protect the $1 billion space agency infrastructure from being washed away.
\
To the northwest, along the Chesapeake Bay's Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge near Cambridge, Md., woods and marsh purchased by the federal government are disappearing under rising water, taking away critical habitat for wildlife.
\
Federal researchers expect entire islands to disappear in Chesapeake Bay, noting that in recent months a new channel was cut through Tangier Island off the coast of Virginia.
\
Skeptics remain
\
All this seems a bit over wrought to Rich Collins, a Delaware insurance agent and leader of the Positive Growth Alliance, a business-oriented lobbying group. Sea-level rise forecasts are ""way overstated,"" Collins insists.
\
""I have real concerns, because there are many environmental programs that I believe are designed to drive people away from the water,"" said Collins, a member of the state's Sea-Level Rise Advisory Committee and a critic of past state attempts to factor future climate change into current land-use decisions. ""Their intention, in my opinion, is to shut down human use of the coastline.""
\
Others say the evidence is unequivocal - and alarming.
\
In New Jersey, where the state's Coastal Zone Management Program has been working for years to help local governments develop plans for ""resilience,"" environmental scientist Donna Frizzera said current state forecasts are far from worst-case estimates.
\
Maps and forecasts of future sea-level rise, offered as guides for long-term planning, only show viewers the calm-weather level of future high tides. Not shown is the height of storm surges pushed up from higher starting points by the more-vicious storms climate researchers say will become more common.
\
""For some communities we showed them the current inundation and sea-level rise projections,"" Frizzera said. ""Then we showed them the storm surge on top of the sea-level rise projects.""
\
""If you really want to be scared, those are very frightening.""

The ""apparent"" Rehoboth sea level rise is a function of the lowering of the Earth's crust and an increase in amount of the global oceans' water.
\
The measurement of the ""apparent"" sea level is not in dispute. But on average an increase in the sea level (ocean's size) at Rehoboth cannot vary from the global sea level. Since 1992, satellites have measured sea level. The calculated rise averages about 3 mm per year. At that rate, sea level 90 years from now would be about 0.3 meters (11 inches) higher, not the exaggerated numbers that the alarmists project.
\
Global warming is not in dispute, either. The globe has been warming since the end of the last ice age, more than 10 thousand years ago. But can you trust those scientists and their computer models when anyone who takes the time to look back can see how far off their alarming global warming forecasts have been.
\
These scientist's batting averages are so bad it is puzzling how any organization can take them seriously. Yet, every year the same group of scientists make more forecasts (most of which will also turn out to be wrong). They are the ones that need to be doubted.

A recent News Journal editorial touted a ""new"" report by NASA scientist James Hansen regarding climate change. In reality, there is nothing new about Hansen's report, except that this time he is using the nationwide drought to scare people (again) into believing we can abate or prevent climate change and extreme weather events by drastically reducing hydrocarbon use.
\
Whenever an extreme weather event occurs, Hansen and others say we must act immediately to prevent such events. However, there is no clear scientific evidence that humans are responsible, future climate changes will be calamitous, or slashing energy use will avert anything.
\
Hansen's analysis is biased by his decision to focus only on the period from 1955-99, conveniently ignoring the warm period during the 1930s and the lack of an increase in temperature since 2000. Indeed, climate history tells us that America's droughts of the 1930s were longer and more severe than the current drought - and that human greenhouse gas emissions clearly were not the culprits 80 years ago.
\
Our climate is changing because it always has changed. It is foolish to believe that the climate should remain constant or claim that energy policies will somehow achieve ""climate stabilization.""
\
Delaware's climate has changed over the years, but not in ways The News Journal asserts. Data from the New Castle County Airport in Wilmington - the longest, most consistent record available - show that summer maximum temperatures are not significantly warmer, recent winters are not drier or less snowy, and storms are no more frequent on average.
\
Floods are more common in Delaware, not because of climate change, but because of increased storm runoff due to more impervious surfaces like asphalt and concrete. Water shortages primarily reflect our growing populations' increased demand for water, not climate change. The Palmer Drought Index used by climatologists to quantify climate-induced changes in drought cycles, frequency and severity shows no long-term trend for Delaware.
\
Sea levels continue to rise globally. However, as an article in the journal Science observes, satellite records during the past 18 years show no net increase in mean sea level for the mid-Atlantic region. A recent study for the Chesapeake Bay confirms this and notes that any apparent sea level rise can be attributed to coastal subsidence, not to climate change.
\
Hansen's latest alarm is intended to promote his view that fossil fuels should be more expensive and less available. The News Journal joins him by advocating a ""carbon tax"" to force people to curtail their use of fossil fuels. However, such a tax would primarily hurt the poor in Delaware by making it more expensive to commute to work, to heat and cool homes, to use televisions and computers, and to buy food, goods and services that are made more costly by soaring transportation and production costs.
\
The poor do not have the luxury of purchasing high-priced solar panels, even with government subsidies. Thus, they are to become more dependent on welfare and food stamps and have less of a chance of becoming middle-class.
\
Activists like Hansen say we must act now to ""prevent climate change,"" even before full scientific certainty can be established. This gives carte blanche to policymakers to take extreme steps to ""save the planet"" even if scientific, economic and overall human welfare facts argue otherwise.
\
This is the wrong approach. Actions to abate climate change should not be implemented until it can be demonstrated that they will actually achieve their intended results without creating new problems or exacerbating existing troubles. Imposing immediate, draconian programs like a carbon tax will have little, if any, beneficial impacts but will create numerous unintended adverse consequences.
\
Paraphrasing S.J. Perelman, The News Journal says, ""I may not know anything about climate science, but I know what I like."" Similarly, Rep. John Kowalko has said, ""We don't need a state climatologist, we need a state climate advocate!"" In other words, they want to replace science-based policy with advocacy-driven solutions and be told whatever to justify their editorial stances and legislative agendas.
\
We must return to true science-based assessments of potential risk and use them to develop appropriate solutions to problems over which we have some control. Delaware cannot afford anything less.

The four-part News Journal series on sea level rise around Delaware highlights the need to adapt to the possibility that global warming may continue for a few hundred more years. However, the Delaware state government study on the subject suffers from the faulty assumption that increased carbon dioxide concentration is a major cause of the current warming period. Many letters to the editor have thoroughly debunked that assumption. Taking a long view of the Earth's climate, we have been between major ice ages for about 10,000 years, with over 20 cycles of cooling and warming. The present warm period was preceded by the ""Little Ice Age"", which preceeded the Medieval Warm Period - warmer than we are now!
\
The cooling and warming cycles are likely caused by changes in the output of the sun. The current warming trend could reverse at any time and bring a new ""Little Ice Age"", or even the next major ice age over the long term.
\
The Delaware state government has already done more than enough work on adapting to the warming period. We need a leaner less expensive government.

The DuPont Environmental Education Center and the Russell W. Peterson Urban Wildlife Refuge, on the Wilmington Riverfront, marks the place where the city, river and marsh meet. The 212-acre Refuge is home to a diverse range of frogs, birds, fish and native plants that help tell the story of an urban wildlife landscape. The area is also poised to showcase how sea-level rise will impact the future of the Delaware Bay Estuary and surrounding areas.
\
The sea level along Delaware's 281 miles of coastal shoreline is expected to rise as a result of climate change, putting lucrative coastal real estate at risk.
\
Local forecasts by the Delaware Estuary Program predict that sea level will rise between 0.5 meters and 1.5 meters in Delaware Bay over the next 100 years.
\
This will present huge challenges for Delaware residents and businesses, as well as for the state's natural areas, such as the Peterson Urban Wildlife Refuge. Fortunately, the State of Delaware is preparing for and adapting to the impacts of climate change.
\
They have convened representatives from numerous state departments ranging from the Delaware Economic Development Office to the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control, as well as from local governments, and business and citizen advocacy organizations, to form the Sea Level Advisory Committee.
\
The Advisory Committee has conducted an exhaustive analysis of the vulnerabilities that Delaware residents and natural resources face from sea-level rise. The report released this week assesses the societal, economic, natural resource and public safety/infrastructure impacts of three sea-level rise scenarios: 0.5 meters, 1 meter and 1.5 meters by 2100.
\
The report shows that tidal wetlands, like those at the Peterson Wildlife Refuge, as well as freshwater tidal wetlands, coastal impoundments and conservation lands are at high risk.
\
In fact, 97 percent to 99 percent of Delaware's tidal coastal wetlands could potentially disappear entirely under each scenario. The results of the vulnerability assessment will help the State develop strategies to reduce the risk of sea level rise for our residents and natural resources.
\
But Delaware cannot address these impacts on its own. That's why the newly created National Ocean Policy is such welcome news.
\
It puts together a National Ocean Council of federal agencies that will work together with states and tribes to address a wide range of ocean issues, including picking up trash on our beaches, improving marine wildlife management, and preparing for sea-level rise.
\
It will encourage all levels of government to share information regarding these issues and work together to plan a coordinated adaptation strategy.
\
This means Delaware will get assistance to address this issue across state boundaries from its neighbors grappling with similar issues, and from federal agencies that are looking at them nationwide.
\
Climate change is likely to cause the border between the city, river and coastal tidal marsh to change.
\
Fortunately, the state's sea level planning effort and the new National Ocean Policy will help Delaware protect the Russell W. Peterson Urban Wildlife Refuge, our coastal communities, and other critical coastal habitats and development, in the face of rising seas.

Wilmington broke ground Thursday on a $36 million renewable energy biosolids facility that will significantly reduce the amount of sludge produced by the city's Hay Road Wastewater Treatment Plant.
\
City officials have described the project as a large part of Mayor James M. Baker's greening plan for Wilmington. The facility will burn landfill and sewage sludge gas to produce electricity to power the plant, while excess heat from electricity generation will dry leftover sewage sludge.
\
In June, the Wilmington City Council agreed to issue up to $39 million in bonds to finance the project undertaken by Honeywell International. The decision came with some controversy, as the project materialized as a no-bid extension of a 2008 energy savings agreement between Wilmington and Honeywell.
\
Council members pointed to the jobs the project will bring, as well as Honeywell's guarantee for $16.7 million in savings over two decades.

The News Journal
\
A new national report flatly declared Friday that global climate change ""is already affecting the American people"" - making seasons hotter and drier, whipping up more furious storms and floods and threatening global ecosystems and every aspect of human activity.
\
""Evidence for climate change abounds, from the top of the atmosphere to the depths of the oceans,"" said the draft National Climate Assessment, which is issued every four years.
\
In an opening to the 1,146-page document, described as ""A letter to the American People,"" the report's lead officials said: ""Climate change, once considered an issue for a distant future, has moved firmly into the present,"" with evidence to be found in hotter seasons, increased wildfires, and retreating sea ice.
\
""Americans are noticing changes all around them,"" the report said. ""Summers are longer and hotter, and periods of extreme heat last longer than any living American has ever experienced. Winters are generally shorter and warmer. Rain comes in heavier downpours, though in many regions there are longer dry spells in between.""
\
Some areas initially could benefit from warmer temperatures or climate alterations, they conceded.
\
""But many more have already proven to be detrimental, largely because society and its infrastructure were designed for the climate of the past, not for the rapidly changing climate of the present or the future.""
\
Without large reductions in global emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gas - mainly pollutants from burning fossil fuel - effects will steadily worsen, with sea levels rising for centuries, heat waves and extreme weather worsening, the report said.
\
Burdens could fall most heavily on those least able to manage, including ""the elderly, children, the poor and the sick,"" the report said.
\
Those living along coastal areas will be subject to rising tides and storm surges. People living in already hot and dry regions will see their homes become hotter and drier.
\
Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control Secretary Collin P. O'Mara said that the study found severe consequences for the Northeast in particular, if worldwide greenhouse gas emissions remain at high levels.
\
""In the Northeast, it's more flooding waterways, more droughts, extreme storms,"" O'Mara said. ""We talk a lot about storms and sea-level rise. But it's not just the big events once a year, it's storms like we had a couple of weeks ago that didn't have a name but caused a lot of problems at Bayview Beach and in South Wilmington. Delaware is a microcosm of what this collection of scientists is seeing nationally.""
\
'An alarm bell'
\
Some 240 scientists and other experts from across the country developed the draft document, which was released for public comment Friday and is expected to become final in 2014. Comments will be taken through April 12.
\
The report said changes seen during the past 50 years are ""due primarily to human activities"" and warned that changes will continue and ""accelerate significantly if greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase.
\
""There is strong evidence to indicate that human influence on the climate has already roughly doubled the probability of extreme heat events,"" as seen in 2011 and 2012, the report said.
\
In the Northeast, higher temperatures ""will add stresses to the region's already burdened environmental, social, and economic systems,"" with storms, flooding and sea-level rise ""compromising"" infrastructure, such as roads and bridges.
\
The report included a map of the Northeast indicating that Delaware could see 15 additional days a year with 95 degree and higher temperatures. Currently, the state averages 21.2 days 90-degree-plus days per year.
\
Jeff Tittel, who directs the Sierra Club New Jersey Chapter, said the Garden State received a vivid reminder of the risks in late October, when Superstorm Sandy trashed the Jersey Shore.
\
""This assessment should be an alarm bell, not only for the people of the United States, but more importantly for political leaders who have dragged their feet and held back from working on climate and lowering greenhouse gas emissions,"" Tittel said. ""We're all in this together, and this report shows the alarming impact. Politicians need to get it - and lead.""
\
Concerns extend to the reliability of water supplies and farming production, although agricultural systems and practices could adapt to help protect food production.
\
In another worrisome development, scientists pointed out that natural ecosystems and habitats could be affected too quickly to allow movement or adaptation for some species.
\
Warming and rising acidity in the oceans will affect habitats and the distribution of species, potentially making global waters less productive and less able to absorb carbon dioxide. That, in turn, would potentially add to atmospheric buildups of greenhouse gas.
\
""Certain coastal ecosystems are already rapidly changing as a result of interactions between climatic and non-climatic factors, and others have already crossed tipping points,"" the report said. ""Eelgrass in the Chesapeake Bay died out almost completely during the record-hot summer of 2005, when temperatures exceeded the species' tolerance threshold of 86 degreesF, and subsequent recovery has been poor.""
\
If seas rise just 2 feet, the report said, more than 5,790 square miles and $1 trillion of property and structures could be flooded along coastlines. That level could be reached in just 37 years, by 2050, if a worst-case rise of 6.6 feet occurs by the end of the century.
\
If seas rise here 5 feet by 2100, Delaware officials predict a loss of 11 percent of the state's land base, along with all tidal wetlands, 20,000 residences and significant percentages of highway, rail lines, industrial properties and other assets.
\
Miami, greater New York, New Orleans, Tampa-St. Petersburg and Virginia Beach were ranked as the most vulnerable port areas. But Delaware officials concluded that nearly all of the Port of Wilmington would be flooded with a 5-foot rise, with a loss of nearby areas, including the community of Southbridge.

\
In a world of dire scientific warnings about climate change, Delaware on Friday announced that it has hired a nationally recognized expert to help it develop detailed projections for changing conditions along the state's coasts, farms, cities and suburban neighborhoods.
\
Katharine Hayhoe, director of the Climate Science Center at Texas Tech University, will fill the knowledge gaps Delaware officials face in planning for rising temperatures, changes in rainfall patterns, extreme weather events and other weather trends during this century.
\
She was hired by the state Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment Steering Committee to identify issues that could affect daily life here.
\
""Climate change is a global problem, but the reason why we care about climate change is how it's going to affect us in the places where we live,"" Hayhoe said in an interview with The News Journal on Friday.
\
""What's relevant in Delaware is how is climate change going to affect sea levels and the risk of coastal flooding. How is it going to affect the severity of storms and the risk of extreme heat in the summer? What about water resources?""
\
Hayhoe's writings as an Evangelical Christian and scientist concerned about climate change late last year earned her the wrath of both Rush Limbaugh and climate skeptics in the Christian Right. Soon afterward, Republican Newt Gingrich abruptly jettisoned a chapter that Hayhoe wrote for a book that he planned as a sequel to his 2007 A Contract with the Earth.
\
Friday's announcement of Hayhoe's selection by Delaware came hours before the federal government released a draft of the latest National Climate Assessment, an every-four-year assessment of global warming and its climate consequences for the United States.
\
The national report concluded that climate change has become ""apparent across the United States in a wide range of observations,"" and ""threatens human health and well-being in many ways.""
\
Hayhoe's program in Texas is part of the Department of Interior's South-Central Climate Science Center. She said on Friday that her research in Delaware will take into account findings from the new national assessment, as well as models based on a United Nations report due later this year, making state forecasts the most up-to-date possible.
\
""We already know it's happening,"" Hayhoe said. ""Our Spring is arriving one to two weeks early over the whole northern hemisphere, compared with 50 years ago. We're breaking heat records right, left and center. We're seeing all of the indicators that tell us this is really here. This is not a future problem.""
\
She has done similar work in California, Chicago and the Northeast region, adding that Delaware was a ""natural"" place to continue her work. In October, Hayhoe was one of the scientists named to a four-year, $750,000 National Science Foundation-funded effort to determine how climate change will affect roads and bridges and future infrastructure design requirements.
\
Delaware will pay $46,000 for its state-specific work, expected to be complete in draft form by March. The Delaware data will be incorporated into a scientific white paper on Climate Change Vulnerability for the state that is expected to be complete by the end of March.
\
Delaware's Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment Steering Committee was formed in August and includes both state officials and scientists from the University of Delaware and Delaware State University.
\
""The world's changed since then,"" said David Small, deputy secretary of the state Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control, referring to the regional impacts from Superstorm Sandy. ""That probably suggests even more urgency"" in completing Delaware's vulnerability assessment, he said.
\
A state Sea Level Advisory Committee has also been meeting to discuss options for the state's low lying and vulnerable coastal areas.
\
Morgan Ellis, a climate planner in the state division of energy and climate, said one of the department's difficulties has been coming up with Delaware specific projections. Maryland and Pennsylvania have done projections, as have states in the Northeast and Southeast, but there is little site-specific that covers the unique coastal environment of Delaware, she said.
\
While Delawareans are beginning to make connections between climate change and what is occurring on the ground, Small said, the additional data will help answer the questions of citizens and government officials.
\
Hayhoe outlined her proposal to committee members Friday morning via a teleconferencing call.
\
There is great variability in climate forecasts, Hayhoe said. But if data is examined over 20-year time slots, much of the natural climate variability of cyclical events such as El Nino and La Nina tend to balance out, providing a true picture of a region, she said.
\
She recommended that state officials use only worst and best case scenarios in developing its final report to the citizenry, because those would cover the entire spectrum of possibilities. That perspective will help Delawareans decide to do something about climate change - or to ignore the warnings.
\
""Only by looking at the impact of climate change do we have any motivation to do something about it,"" she said. ""It's being aware of the consequences before anything happens.""
\
In Bayville Shores, northwest of Fenwick Island, resident John F. Bacon said Superstorm Sandy heightened concerns on climate change. Hayhoe and other scientists across the country noted that climate change-driven warming of ocean waters likely added to Sandy's power.
\
""My sense is, this community was shocked,"" Bacon said. ""Had that storm not turned and gone up and into New Jersey, it would have been tragic here. If it hit us, it would have been over. Water was coming over our piers, our ramps - my house was an island, almost.""
\
On Thursday, Bacon attended a separate state committee meeting examining sea level rise in Delaware. It wants the public to determine whether property owners selling inside boundaries where scientific models say seas will rise should be forced to disclose that vulnerability to potential buyers.
\
That would be a significant step beyond the existing rule of requiring sellers to disclose to buyers that properties reside in designated flood zones, based largely on historic flood and storm surge records.
\
Bacon agreed that owners should disclose sea level predictions, explaining that he considered it ""a matter of integrity and honor.""
\
""In the near term, there are probably people here who will sell after Sandy,"" Bacon said. ""I think two or three people told me they're alarmed about it.""
\
Hayhoe and other researchers have pointed out that climate models, including past estimates by the United Nations, have systematically underestimated rates of change. She cited work by Michael Oppenheimer, who said in an interview with The News Journal last year that the U.N.'s current forecast - calling for about a foot of global sea-level rise by 2100 - will likely be significantly increased as new knowledge about warming and polar ice melt takes hold.
\
A draft of the U.N.'s latest forecast, leaked by a climate change skeptic last month, did significantly increase global average sea-level rise predictions. The United States draft report issued Friday indicated that the global increase could be as high as 6.6 feet, with even higher levels along the Mid-Atlantic.
\
Hayhoe said that attacks on climate scientists whose findings support climate change warnings are misdirected.
\
""It's an unfortunate truth. Any climate scientist who stands up and says climate change is real, it's happening because of human activity, anyone who does that has to be prepared to be attacked,"" said Hayhoe, who has endured blasts of email attacks on both her science and faith.
\
""The reality is that this is an issue about temperature and sea-level rise, intense rainfall events, birds, bugs and trees moving northward,"" Hayhoe said. ""Thermometers are not Democratic or Republican. What should be political is what we want to do with the facts - because there's no perfect solution.""

State economies can benefit as climate change pressures encourage shifts to cleaner and more efficient energy sources, Gov. Jack Markell said in a speech on Friday to a climate conference at Georgetown Law School in Washington, D.C.
\
But governments also need to act now to prepare communities for more extreme storms and other emerging consequences of global warming-driven climate change, Markell added.
\
""I think people are paying more and more attention to climate impacts than ever before because of many of the things that have happened to many of us,"" Markell said during a keynote speech that opened the second day of the Georgetown Climate Center workshop.
\
The event focused on ways states and federal government can cooperate in developing a future with drastically lower emissions of heat-trapping carbon dioxide and communities better prepared for threats like sea-level rise, longer droughts and changes in agricultural patterns.
\
""From hurricanes and tornadoes to wildfires and droughts, we're experiencing exactly what so many of the models predict and suggest that we ought to be experiencing. We ought to just say that the science is settled and the data is overwhelming, and that ought to be the starting point for all of these conversations,"" Markell told an early morning crowd.
\
The center, based at Georgetown Law School, operates as a clearinghouse and analysis center for state and federal issues involving energy, climate and transportation. Some of its work has focused on the evolution of climate change policies since 2009, when the Environmental Protection Agency issued a formal declaration that carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping greenhouse gases have endangered public health and should be controlled.
\
Markell has said releases that could raise global average temperatures by 3.5 degrees Fahrenheit or more in the next century work as scientific evidence of climate change and links to carbon dioxide. But he also has emphasized that shifts to new and cleaner energy sources will create opportunities for economic growth and development.
\
""I think a lot of governors have seen that we can actually accelerate economic growth in our states by supporting the construction and manufacturing jobs in energy efficiency, clean energy and advanced transportation,"" Markell said.
\
""And I think the fact that the debate is evolving in that direction, where people see that these investments are good for the environment and good for the economy, is a whole different way of looking at things. It's a much better way of looking at things.""
\
In Delaware, that view has led to state-level support for a range of initiatives, including power plant shifts from coal to natural gas, a fuel cell manufacturer venture and Fisker Automotive's troubled electric car enterprise.
\
Earlier in the workshop, Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control Secretary Collin O'Mara said that the nine-state Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative has succeeded in dramatically lowering power plant carbon dioxide emissions without harming ratepayers, utilities or local economies.
\
O'Mara chairs the initiative, which recently reduced emissions goals to account for findings from the first years of the program. The group relies on a ""cap and trade"" process that limited annual power plant carbon dioxide emissions and created a market for plants to buy needed pollution credits and sell excess amounts.
\
The group cut its multistate budget for carbon dioxide emissions by 45 percent, to 91 million tons, earlier this month, with levels required to fall by 10 percent by 2019.
\
""We have confidence that the numbers are realistic,"" O'Mara said.
\
Markell said Superstorm Sandy and other recent weather calamities have shown that global warming has become an immediate threat that requires a ""frank conversation,"" choices and action.
\
""I know that there has been some hesitation on the part of some in the environmental advocacy movement,"" Markell said. ""They've been hesitant over the years to have a robust conversation about adapting, because some saw that as really a surrender. They didn't want to give a false sense that we can adapt our way out of it.""

Some people say the costs of addressing climate change are too high, but what about the costs if we fail to act? I am a person of faith, and I have faith in our ability to innovate. I know it can be done because we are doing it. I've worked with congregations to help them become more energy efficient.
\
We changed out light bulbs, sealed up cracks in doors and windows and turned off unused lights and appliances. It was not difficult, but it is saving significant money on energy bills each month that can now go to other programs. There is a cost to all of this carbon pollution. We are paying with damaged health and an uncertain future we're leaving for our children. It is time for action. I support promoting energy efficiency, renewable energy and putting standards on polluting power plants.

It is an indisputable fact that the Earth's climate has changed continuously over billions of years caused by the immense powers and energies of nature and the universe and will also in the future. All who believe that humanity can influence the climate should look at causes and not only at the effects. It took hundreds of generations to reach a global population of 2 billion.
\
During the present generation the global population increased from 2 billion to 7 billion, adding 5 billion who need food, shelter, energy and who pollute. Providing meaningful employment might be the most difficult problem especially in nations where the population doubles every 30 years.
\
The National Geographic Society recently claimed that the babies being born now will probably become 120 years old which will exaggerate the problem. Since population increase is exponential, the next generation will see even greater increases. Everything reasonable should be done to keep the air and water clean, but if the exponential increase in population is not slowed down, all efforts will be in vain.
\
It is regrettable that religious, civic and political leaders ignore the reality of the problem. Facts can be ignored, but could cause catastrophes of unimaginable proportions and unsolvable problems for future generations.

The News Journal reports that two state business groups, including one described as ""conservative,"" object to the recommendations by the state's Sea Level Rise Advisory Committee because those recommendations could cost money in the near future. Having spent 30 years in business, I'm happy to explain: The idea is to invest something now in order to avoid or reduce eventual catastrophe.
\
There is nothing ""conservative"" in the idea that we should stick our heads in the sand and hope for the best on climate change. The truly ""conservative"" thing to do is to take action now regarding climate change and sea-level rise so as to conserve as much as possible of our land, homes, environment and economy.

In a recent letter to his constitutents, Chris Coons said Congress should pass the bipartisan Master Limited Partnerships Parity Act, which would drive down the cost of renewable energy, making it cheaper to move to a clean energy economy. And he said Congress can also pass the voluntary, consensus-based policies in the Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act and the bipartisan Weatherization Enhancement and Local Energy Efficiency Investment and Accountability Act.
\
More government subsidies to drive down costs? Ask how that worked in Germany (you probably don't know - they are getting out of the solar panel business; ask Spain - they are awash in debt due to failed green energy programs). Private enterprise (CF natural gas abundance) can much more readily resolve the energy supply needs.
\
I would have thought someone with a business background like Sen. Chris Coons had in the Gore company, would be more knowledgeable about private enterprise and efficiency.

In the topsy-turvey world of Delaware weather - snow two weeks ago and balmy, record-breaking temperatures on the first days of winter - it's no wonder people have trouble connecting long-term weather trends to proof of climate change.
\
Turns out, Delawareans aren't alone.
\
A new study by the Yale Project on Climate Change posed this question: ""Who remembers a hot summer or a cold winter?"" to see how experience influences perception of climate change.
\
What researchers Peter D. Howe and Anthony Leiserowitz looked at was how people see their local climate and how that matches climate conditions that have been recorded over time: snowfall, heat and cold data, for instance.
\
The past two weeks may have cloudied that outlook more. After 13 days of cold temperatures and snow (at least in the northern part of the state), unseasonable record-high temperatures descended on Delaware this weekend.
\
It hit 72 in Georgetown Saturday, breaking the record of 65 from 1956, and 76 Sunday, breaking the previous high of 68 set in 1949. The 68 degrees registered in Wilmington Saturday beat the old mark of 65 set in 1895. On Sunday, it reached, 67 there, besting the record of 64 set in 1980 and 1998.
\
Records were set across the region as Philadelphia, Allentown, Pa., Mount Pocono, Pa., Atlantic City, Trenton and Reading, Pa., among many other cities, saw new high-temperature marks set.
\
This comes as Delaware officials are in the midst of a detailed climate change study that so far points to increased temperatures - about .2 degrees per decade between 1895 and 2012. And new data from the U.S. Geological Survey suggests that each of the three counties in Delaware will see continued increases of more than three degrees by the end of this century.
\
But when it comes to the data versus what folks believe, things get very complicated.
\
""People come preloaded with a whole set of different attitudes and cultural values,"" Leiserowitz said.
\
And when it comes to evidence that the climate is changing, people are often ""influenced by prior beliefs about global warming,"" he said.
\
Howe, with the Department of Environment and Society, Quinney College of Natural Resources at Utah State University, and Leiserowitz, with the School of Forestry and Environmental Studies at Yale University, used national survey data collected in 2011 for their project.
\
What they found was that perceptions about weather in the short term coincided with collected weather data. But among people who believe that global warming is not happening, there was less of a tendency to recall above-normal summer temperatures even if the weather had been hotter than normal.
\
""These results suggest that the subjective experience of local climate change is dependent not only on external climate conditions, but also on individual beliefs, with perceptions apparently biased by prior beliefs about global warming,"" Howe and Leiserowitz wrote in their paper.
\
""The relationship between personal experience and beliefs about global warming is of considerable interest as changes in local weather and climate conditions continue to be consistent with scientific projections of global warming,"" they wrote.
\
Delaware's climate assessment concluded that nationwide, maximum temperature events were rising in the summer and minimum temperature events were declining in the winter.
\
And events like Superstorm Sandy or droughts and heat waves all have an impact on the way people view the interactions between climate and weather.
\
In groups that have strong beliefs that global warming is occurring or that it is not, people tend to ""cherry pick what backs up what they already believe,"" Leiserowitz said.
\
In a place like Delaware, the weather often doesn't make sense and that can make for a fuzzy big picture when it comes to local impacts of climate change.
\
""It's really because of our placement and geography,"" said state climatologist Daniel Leathers.
\
Delaware is in the middle Atlantic and that means, at least in the winter, the meanderings of the jet stream play a huge role. So in early December, the jet stream brought cold, Canadian Arctic air into Delaware and the precipitation, at least in the northern part of the state, fell as snow, he said.
\
But weatherwise, it's sometimes like we live in two different states. While northern Delaware was shoveling out and experiencing school shutdowns and delays, in the south - less than 100 miles away - the snow quickly turned to rain.
\
That, said Leathers, was caused by the other huge weather driver in Delaware: the Atlantic Ocean.
\
The ocean holds heat and as the warmer ocean air blew into Sussex County, the air temperature warmed and snow changed to rain, he said.
\
Varying views
\
Many longtime Delawareans believe the C&D Canal is the big weather transition line in the state - that it can snow on one side of the canal and rain on the other.
\
But, said Leathers, that just isn't true. The canal just isn't a big enough body of water to influence weather, he said.
\
Instead, it's the ocean. Lower Kent and Sussex counties get that warming air flow off the ocean and Delaware Bay.
\
But for the warmer ocean air to reach New Castle County, it has to flow over New Jersey first, Leathers said.
\
As for snow, it tends to come in waves, dictated by where the jet stream sets up, he said.
\
If you look at big storms from the past - be they December snow, late-season snow or Superstorm Sandy, the jet stream played a role in all of them. Normally, a late-season storm like Sandy would get caught in the jet stream and head out to sea, he said.
\
Or take a late-season storm in March 1958. Middletown got some 27 inches of snow over 24 hours. To the north, in Middletown, Conn., residents saw 50 inches over 24 hours.
\
Or consider a winter flood event in 1996. The ground, at least in northern Delaware, had been frozen and snow-covered for weeks and all of a sudden, the snow melted and it started to rain. Flooding was bad in Delaware but worse to the north in Pennsylvania.
\
""Everybody has a different storm they remember,"" he said.
\
The take-home message about Delaware weather is ""it's so variable,"" Leathers said.
\
As for winter weather memories, many Delawareans remember more snow and more days below freezing - when it was cold enough to ice skate.
\
Cindy Small, in a Facebook post to Delawareonline, noted: ""[I] Grew up at Red Mill Pond. Seems like the pond froze every winter. Lots of kids skated behind Brent and Mark Moore's house in Red Mill Acres. [I] remember doing crack the whip.""
\
Anne Maull recalled the bitterly cold winters of the late 1970s.
\
""[I] remember walking my daughter out on the frozen Delaware Bay off the point of Cape Henlopen in winter of '78 & '79. My dad took pictures.""
\
Jane Nickle remembers ""ice skating on the canal on the other side of the old Reedy Point Bridge. That's how cold the winters were back then.""
\
And Sarah Dougherty sent along two pictures of two big snow storms up near Pike Creek Valley and these winter memories:
\
""I have many fond childhood memories of snowy winter days in the 1970s & 1980s. When I think back, I remember there being a lot more snow in those days, with long stretches of freezing temperatures that seemed to keep snow on the ground from December right into February.
\
""I grew up in a suburb of Wilmington. I remember 'the older boys' [my brothers and neighborhood boys] building igloos out of the huge mounds of snow that snow plows created. They used them as forts during snowball fights, and there was always a stack of snowballs inside ready for use. 'The girls' [neighborhood friends and myself] would occupy these snow forts when the boys were done, making them into homes for our dolls and stuffed toys.
\
""I can remember getting ready to go out in the snow, and the layers of clothing that I would have to wear including double socks. The outer layer was always snow pants and a down jacket accessorized with wool scarves, knit mittens & a knit hat.
\
""I remember long, long treks through the woods pulling wooden sleds and plastic snow discs. Our destination was the back side of Delcastle golf course where the greatest sledding hill ever [or as far as I knew] was. Such fun times we had sledding down that hill, then trudging back up with our sleds.""
\
Why are our weather memories important? Well, Leiserowitz said, climate change ""has become a deeply political issue, a litmus test issue"" in the world of politics. So rather than making decisions based on science, ideology comes into play, he said.
\
On either end of the debate there are climate deniers and climate alarmists - the folks who are deeply committed to their view of global warming, he said.
\
For the alarmists, any extreme weather event can be a call to action - even some that have no known scientific connection to climate change, such as tornadoes in the Midwest, Leiserowitz said.
\
Among the deniers, there is the deeply held believe that any action on climate change will signal a huge expansion of government, higher taxes and because it is a global issue, more U.S. interaction with the United Nations. Some in this group believe that climate change is just a conspiracy theory, he said.
\
""It triggers some of their biggest fears,"" he said. ""That's the underlying issue.""
\
Then, there are the people in the middle, the people who may shift back and forth on the issue or are waiting for more details to make up their mind.
\
But in this latest research, Howe and Leiserowitz saw something else. Across the country, many people had been impacted by an extreme weather event.
\
In fact, 8 out of 10 Americans have personal experience with a weather disaster, he said. And one-third of these people were harmed in some way by the extreme weather events.
\
""They are having huge impacts,"" Leiserowitz said. These days, 65 percent of people in the United States say climate change is affecting them, the study found.
\
""They are beginning to connect the dots,"" he said. ""People are experiencing it and we're beginning to actually talk about it.""

The News Journal recently published an essay by Dr. Robert Laskowski, president of the Christiana Care Health System, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the U.S. Surgeon General's 1964 report on the health risks associated with smoking. It was very important in bringing public attention to the risks involved to smokers themselves, to those breathing second-hand smoke, and even to babies in the womb. There are a number of similarities between smoking tobacco and burning fossil fuels - coal, oil and natural gas.
\
Both produce toxic gases and particulates, along with carbon dioxide. Both are harmful to human health and welfare; the number of people who die yearly from each worldwide is estimated to be 5 million or more. Both are addictive and hard to give up; President Bush said, ""Americans are addicted to oil,"" in his 2006 State of the Union address. Both have been promoted and defended by powerful interests that have a great deal to lose once people know the truth about the risks they are taking - not only for themselves but for generations as yet unborn.
\
In the case of climate change caused by the burning of fossil fuels, widespread public attention to its dangers came in 1988, more than 25 years ago, with the testimony of NASA's Dr. James Hansen in U.S. Senate hearings conducted by Tennessee Sen. Al Gore. Hansen told reporters, ""It's time to stop waffling so much and say that the evidence is pretty strong that the greenhouse effect is here."" Since then we have had a number of reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a statement from the U.S. National Academies of Science along with those of the other major industrial countries, and statements by many leading scientific societies, including the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Chemical Society, the American Geophysical Union, the American Institute of Physics, the Geological Society of America, and the American Meteorological Society - all supporting the scientific consensus that earth's climate is changing, that human activities - especially the burning of fossil fuels - are largely responsible, and that if action is not taken soon to change business-as-usual emissions, the consequences will become very serious for both humans and other forms of life.
\
Smoking in this country has been greatly reduced by public information and warnings, by prohibiting smoking in many public places, and by a heavy tax on tobacco products. Many economists and policymakers agree fossil fuel burning will need to be reduced rapidly (in a matter of decades) - if we are to avoid the most serious consequences - by putting an increasing price on carbon - either through a cap-and-trade system such as that used by the northeastern Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative states, including Delaware, or through a direct tax on carbon at its source.
\
So after more than 25 years, why have we made so little progress in addressing the dangers of climate change? One reason is that wealthy individuals and corporations (like the Koch Brothers and Exxon-Mobil), with a lot invested in fossil fuels, have been waging a very effective public relations campaign attacking the integrity of climate scientists and denying that burning fossil fuels causes climate change. Recently environmental sociologist Dr. Robert Brulle of Drexel University published a study on the organizations and funding behind the powerful climate change the denial effort.
\
Here in Delaware we have the Caesar Rodney Institute, which does everything it can to oppose efforts to reduce the burning of fossil fuels - most recently in the form of a legal challenge to DNREC's authority under RGGI to reduce Delaware's carbon emissions from power plants. Who funds it? I would like to know. Wouldn't you?

In the months after 9/11, Vice President Dick Cheney repeatedly invoked the principle that if there's even a 1 percent chance of a terrorist attack, we must prepare as if it were a certainty.
\
Standing in line at a coffee shop during the recent wave of brutally cold weather I heard someone say, ""This weather sure puts a nail in the whole global warming hoax."" And I immediately thought of what became known as ""the 1 percent doctrine.""
\
Let me connect the dots. It is tough trying to convince people like the guy I was in line with that climate change is real and the odds are very good that it is caused by human activity. Somehow, for many people on both sides, climate change has become an ideological issue. In past columns, I have cited the fact that every major national and international scientific organization has passed resolutions saying its membership believes that global warming is a reality. Over and over again, polls of recognized climate scientists show that 95 percent or more of them say the same thing.
\
Yet over and over again other polls of all Americans show there has been little or no change in the percentages of those who accept or deny climate change. It seems people have made up their minds, one way or the other.
\
So I don't intend in this column to try to change anyone's mind. I'll even grant that there are reputable scientists who are skeptical of or even deny aspects of climate change. Instead I'd like to argue that we should apply the Cheney doctrine to climate change.
\
Can a rational human being who doesn't believe in climate change at least agree there is a remote possibility that 95 percent of climate scientists are right? Maybe a 1 percent chance?
\
If so, shouldn't we prudently prepare ""as if it were a certainty?""
\
Now let me invoke another principle, this one from the world of probability analysis and statistics. In those fields, they use something called ""expected value"" to make decisions about allocating or not allocating limited funds based on two factors - probability and the potential payoff.
\
You may think the probability of climate change being real is very low, but you would have to admit that if it is a reality, the potential payoff -the expected value - of taking action and spending money to ameliorate its effects is enormous. Said differently, even if there is only a 1 percent chance that the more alarming predictions about climate change are correct, the payoff of doing nothing could be catastrophic.
\
Back to that guy in the coffee shop line. I have to admit I had to hold back telling him, buddy, I don't care how cold it is. No climate scientist has ever claimed that global warming means the end of cold weather.
\
Along with a lot of media pundits and talk show hosts, he was confusing anecdotes about weather with long-term climate science. He had probably listened to one of them saying there was no Polar Vortex, that it was a hoax invented by global warming alarmists to make the cold weather conform to their theories.
\
Huh? Even a cursory review of the scientific literature shows that the polar vortex concept has been around for a long time. Check the August 1950 issue of the Tellus Journal of Geophysics.
\
Climate change in no way suggests there won't be extremely cold weather spells in Delaware for years to come. What scientists do say is that the long-term trends, measured in decades not in days, is for an alarming increase in average temperatures over the next 50 years.
\
How about this for anecdotal weather news? At the same time we were experiencing a couple of days of polar vortex weather, Australia was in the throes of an unprecedented heat wave -setting records for the hottest Australian day on record, the hottest four-day period and the hottest 14-day period.
\
I don't claim that proves global warming, although it probably persuaded a lot of Australians. I do want to point out that drawing conclusions from local weather misses the big picture. Our cold spell did nothing to alleviate the inexorable rise in sea levels that are scheduled to wipe out a few Pacific islands in the next ten years.
\
Not believing in global warming isn't going to stop it. And even those who persist in denying it ought to think hard about applying Dick Cheney's 1 percent doctrine. We are running out of time.

""The things the president has focused on with climate change are also the things that have the potential to strengthen the economy and create new jobs.""
\
Collin P. O'Mara, secretary of Delaware's Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control
\
Delawareans say President Barack Obama should do more to create jobs and confront the threat of climate change, issues that are on the minds of many in a state that has seen slow economic growth and an increasing threat from rising seas.
\
""Do I think government as a whole has done a great job in economic recovery and jobs on main street? Absolutely not,"" Paul Calistro, executive director of the Wilmington community center West End Neighborhood House, said Tuesday.""We can do better. I see so many people falling out of the middle class. We see so many people struggling to make ends meet.""
\
Thomas M. Powers, the University of Delaware's Center for Science, Ethics and Public Policy's director, had seemingly modest hopes for progress on Obama's promised climate change initiatives.
\
He wants a more specific plan to move the nation away from reliance on carbon-heavy energy sources, particularly coal. And he wants a public education campaign on the consequences of ""business as usual"" national energy policies and reliance on fossil fuels.
\
""When we have a colder than normal winter, like we're experiencing now, people assume climate change models must be wrong. That's just a matter of our own scientific ignorance,"" said Powers, who added that a public education push could prove ""controversial.""
\
Obama touched on job creation and climate change in his State of the Union speech Tuesday, two issues Delaware is struggling to address.
\
On the economy, Delawareans at either end of the political spectrum agree not enough is being done to promote economic growth.
\
The state needs a boost to its manufacturing sector, to put those without a college degree to work, and improve its housing market to help the economy, Calistro said.
\
Federal tax credits and low-cost financing that promotes manufacturing and new home purchases could go a long way toward stimulating economic progress.
\
""That's where our focus should be,"" said Calistro, adding it's not totally up to government to invest in communities.
\
""The private sector also has a responsibility,"" he said. ""They have benefited hugely from cheap capital in the financial markets and the stock market. They need to reinvest that into the common people and create jobs.""
\
Ezra Temko, the Delaware organizer for Americans for Democratic Action, praised news that Obama would sign an executive order to raise the minimum hourly wage to $10.10 for new federal contract workers. That came on the same day that a committee of the Delaware House of Representatives gave support to a proposal to raise the state's minimum wage $1 to $8.25 by June 2015.
\
""It's great that he's taking a step forward that's within his power to make our economy better and make lives better for low-wage workers,"" Temko said.
\
Temko said the president should use his executive power more broadly to get around an obstructive Congress, suggesting he take action to slow deportation while Congress continues to avoid legislation to comprehensively remake immigration policy.
\
Sher Valenzuela, an owner of the Milford manufacturer First State Manufacturing, a federal contractor, panned Obama's minimum wage plan, saying it's another example of government meddling in a way that is detrimental to economic growth.
\
""We pay above average wages because we want to retain good people,"" said Valenzuela, a former Republican candidate for lieutenant governor. ""But only 17 years ago we were in a garage starting out our business and the first people we employed we paid minimum wage. These kinds of artificial adjustments to free enterprise do not help customers, do not help stimulate the economy.""
\
Obama should focus instead on improving an education system that does too little to prepare students to work, and on reducing government regulations that prevent business investment, she said.
\
""We've got regulatory and permitting issues that are coming down from the national level on the local level that are overly burdensome,"" Valenzuela said.
\
Anything Obama is likely to propose on climate change will be controversial, and expectations from Delawareans closely watching for initiatives were not high.
\
Obama broadly declared his intent to require cuts in emissions of heat-trapping pollutants in last year's State of the Union address, with or without Congressional support. The proposed ""climate action plan"" has focused heavily on power plant emissions standards, with draft regulations for existing plants unlikely before June and questions rising over the administration's move to regulate existing plants ahead of new.
\
""One of the things that I think, unfortunately, we have to hear is a highlighting of the authority that he has to act without Congress,"" said Brenna Goggin, environmental advocate for the Delaware Nature Society. It's not clear what his plans are to go forward using executive authority in the absence of Congressional approvals, Goggin said.
\
Keeping the issue at the top of Obama's agenda are increasingly sober warnings of global disruptions, and potential catastrophe, if fossil-fuel burning and emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases continue at current levels.
\
The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is finalizing its 5th assessment of the threat, with draft versions warning that global temperatures are likely to rise by 3.8 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100 even with prompt global action. Temperatures have an even chance of jumping by more than 7 degrees, the IPCC concluded, if emissions growth continues unchecked.
\
The toll for exceeding even the lower temperature rise could become increasingly apparent after 2050. Predicted consequences include increases in severe droughts, heat waves, storms, and extreme weather, as well as rising seas, acidification of oceans, disruptions in food production and a widening range for some diseases.
\
Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control Secretary Collin P. O'Mara said the administration's power plant initiatives are important, as are market-based control efforts similar to the cap-and-trade type Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative for power plants that already includes Delaware.
\
""The things the president has focused on with climate change are also the things that have the potential to strengthen the economy and create new jobs,"" O'Mara said. ""We're hopeful that there will be a big focus on efficiency and continuing to invest in reducing energy consumption. Because we know that's one of the best ways to put the construction trades to work.""

""The heat is on for climate action,"" said a Jan. 25 headline. It's only because President Barack Obama and the liberal politicians want to tax and regulate U.S citizens. European nations' and Australia's politicians have backed off carbon reduction programs because their citizens have had it with the self-inflicted damage that results. China, the world's biggest producer of CO2 from fossil fuels, isn't restricting carbon use. Nor is India,which should soon overtake the U.S. for second place. They want to create jobs for their citizens.
\
Wanting to impose higher fuel prices and reduce our global competitiveness is just plain insane. Global temperatures have not risen for more than 16 years, despite a steady increase in atmospheric CO2. How can that be? ""Warmer"" scientists say the heat is now being transported to the deep ocean. If you buy that one, next they'll offer to sell you beachfront property in Arizona. They want us to believe that Mother Nature woke up one day saying, ""I think I will quit warming the globe for a while and send the heat to the deep ocean.""
\
The United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has admitted its catastrophic temperature forecasts have been greatly overstated. Knowing that the predictions of doom are not real, why would Obama and the liberals want ""climate action?""

A recent letter writer cited the United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to support his assertion that climate change doom predictions are not real. It's encouraging to see the writer knows of the IPCC and respects its authority. I hope he carefully reads the entire 2013 ""Summary for Policy Makers."" This most recent report clearly sets out the scientific consensus regarding climate change. It states ""warming of the climate system is unequivocal and, since the 1950s, many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia."" It further explains ""it is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.""
\
Former President George W. Bush understood this problem in 2001 when he stated, ""By increasing conservation and energy efficiency and aggressively using these clean energy technologies, we can reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by significant amounts in the coming years. We can make great progress in reducing emissions, and we will."" U.S. Sen. John McCain agreed in 2007 when he said, ""The world is already feeling the powerful effects of global warming, and far more dire consequences are predicted if we let the growing deluge of greenhouse gas emissions continue, and wreak havoc with God's creation.""
\
The DuPont company states on its website: ""We believe the global scientific understanding of climate change is sufficient to compel prompt, effective actions to limit emissions of greenhouse gases."" What to do to avoid adverse climate change is a fair subject for debate. The reality of climate change is not.

""We simply don't have time to let a few loud interest groups hijack the climate conversation.""
\
John Kerry, U.S. Secretary of State
\
JAKARTA, Indonesia -- U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Sunday called climate change perhaps the world's ""most fearsome"" destructive weapon and mocked those who deny its existence or question its causes, comparing them to people who insist the Earth is flat.
\
In a speech to Indonesian students, civic leaders and government officials, Kerry tore into climate change skeptics. He accused them of using shoddy science and scientists to delay steps needed to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases at the risk of imperiling the planet.
\
A day earlier, the U.S. and China announced an agreement to cooperate more closely on combating climate change.
\
American officials hope that will help encourage others, including developing countries like Indonesia and India, to follow suit.
\
China and the United States are the biggest sources of emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases that cause the atmosphere to trap solar heat and alter the climate. Scientists say such changes are leading to drought, wildfires, rising sea levels, melting polar ice, plant and animal extinctions and other extreme conditions.
\
Also in the Jakarta speech, Kerry said everyone and every country must take responsibility for the problem and act immediately.
\
""We simply don't have time to let a few loud interest groups hijack the climate conversation,"" he said, referring to what he called ""big companies"" that ""don't want to change and spend a lot of money"" to act to reduce the risks.
\
Kerry later singled out major oil and coal concerns as the primary offenders.
\
""We should not allow a tiny minority of shoddy scientists and science and extreme ideologues to compete with scientific facts,"" Kerry told the audience at a U.S. Embassy-run American Center in a shopping mall.
\
""Nor should we allow any room for those who think that the costs associated with doing the right thing outweigh the benefits.""
\
""The science is unequivocal, and those who refuse to believe it are simply burying their heads in the sand,"" Kerry said. ""We don't have time for a meeting anywhere of the Flat Earth Society,""
\
Kerry said the cost of inaction will far outweigh the significant expense of reducing greenhouse gas emissions that trap solar heat in the atmosphere and contribute to the Earth's rising temperatures.
\
He outlined a litany of recent weather disasters, particularly flooding and typhoons in Asia, and their impact on commerce, agriculture, fishing and daily living conditions for billions of people.
\
""This city, this country, this region, is really on the front lines of climate change,"" Kerry said. ""It's not an exaggeration to say that your entire way of life here is at risk.""
\
He added: ""In a sense, climate change can now be considered the world's largest weapon of mass destruction, perhaps even, the world's most fearsome weapon of mass destruction.""
\
The solution, Kerry said, is a new global energy policy that shifts reliance from fossil fuels to cleaner technologies. He noted the President Barack Obama is championing such a shift and encouraged others to appeal to their leaders to join.
\
The U.S.-China statement issued just after Kerry left Beijing on Saturday said the two countries agreed on steps to carry out commitments to curb greenhouse gases, including reducing vehicle emissions, improving energy efficiency of buildings and other measures.
\
Beijing and Washington launched a climate change discussion last year, promising progress in five areas: reducing vehicle emissions; advanced electric power grids; capturing and storing carbon emissions; gathering greenhouse gas data; and building efficiency.
\
Kerry was in Indonesia on the last leg of a three-nation tour of Asia that started in South Korea. After leaving Indonesia on Monday, he planned to visit Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates.
\
Before the climate change speech, Kerry toured Jakarta's Istiqlal Mosque, one of the largest in the world, to pay his respects to Indonesia's Muslim majority population.

The world's predicament on climate change reminds me of an old saying: ""The hurrier I go, the behinder I get.""
\
Despite mounting evidence that global warming is an urgent crisis, emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases grew faster between 2000 and 2010 than over the previous three decades, according to an authoritative new report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
\
Some governments have instituted policies to try to hold down emissions of carbon dioxide - by far the biggest contributor to climate change - but these measures do not go nearly far enough. We're doing a Michael Jackson moonwalk, appearing to move ahead while actually sliding backward - toward what scientists fear is an abyss.
\
Between 1970 and 2000, according to the new report, worldwide greenhouse gas emissions rose at an average rate of 1.3 percent a year. But between 2000 and 2010 - a period when no one could claim ignorance of the problem - emissions rose at 2.2 percent annually.
\
Given the fossil fuels we have already burned - the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has been increased by an incredible 40 percent since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution - some further warming is inevitable. Most climate scientists believe humankind can avoid calamity if we limit the temperature rise to about 4 degrees by 2100. But at present, according to the new report, we are on track for an increase of up to 8 degrees.
\
Wave bye-bye to low-lying island nations and coastal cities. Say so long to what we think of as ""normal"" weather patterns and growing seasons. Get ready to welcome tropical pathogens as they migrate into formerly temperate zones.
\
""There is a clear message from science,"" said Ottmar Edenhofer, a German climatologist who is co-chair of the working group that produced the new report. ""To avoid dangerous interference with the climate system, we need to move away from business as usual.""
\
And there you have the problem.
\
As Edenhofer noted in a statement released with the report, climate change is a problem affecting the ""global commons."" But for leaders around the world, ""business as usual"" means acting in national self-interest.
\
Someday, perhaps, the effects of climate change will be so overwhelming that governments see the need for shared sacrifice. It's time to acknowledge, however, that we're not there yet.
\
In Germany, for example, Chancellor Angela Merkel has an ambitious plan to fill more than 40 percent of the nation's energy needs from renewable sources, such as solar and wind, by 2025. But Merkel has had to temper her policies because of the fear that industries would migrate to countries where energy produced from fossil fuels is less expensive. Indeed, BMW recently announced a new $1 billion investment that will make its South Carolina plant the carmaker's biggest factory in the world.
\
The United States has reduced its carbon emissions by roughly 10 percent since 2005. President Obama's push for tougher automobile fuel economy standards is helping, but the decrease is largely due to two factors beyond government's control: the Great Recession, followed by an unusually slow recovery; and a shift by power plants and other industries from coal to natural gas, which emits less carbon when burned - and which is cheap and abundant because of the drilling technique known as fracking.
\
Other countries where fracking can reach previously inaccessible deposits of gas and oil will surely follow suit. To the extent that global industry shifts from coal to gas, the planet will benefit. But burning natural gas, too, sends heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere - just not as much as other sources.
\
And in any event, progress here and in Europe to limit greenhouse gases is overwhelmed by the increase in emissions by rapidly industrializing countries. China is the world's biggest carbon emitter by far, and if officials continue to fuel the Chinese economy by burning coal, incremental progress by the rest of the world hardly matters.
\
Ironically, the choking smog that darkens the skies over Beijing, Shanghai and China's other big cities may be the world's best hope.
\
In a generation, hundreds of millions of people have left rural poverty in China for jobs in the big cities. These migrants quickly develop middle-class expectations of a healthy environment in which to raise their children. Popular anger over pollution is so widespread, and so deep, that I believe the government will have to respond.
\
If China's autocratic leaders come to see renewable energy as being in their national - and personal - self-interest, the world has a chance.

Warning of ""irreversible and dangerous impacts,"" some of the world's top scientists on Sunday released the most comprehensive assessment yet of climate change.
\
The newest finding in the stark United Nations report is the level of certainty -- 95% -- that humans and greenhouse gas emissions are largely to blame.
\
""The atmosphere and ocean have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, and sea level has risen,"" says the report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
\
The panel includes hundreds of scientists from 80 countries meeting in Copenhagen for its final report. The assessment comes as the Earth is headed toward its hottest year ever recorded, along with its highest level of atmospheric carbon dioxide in at least 800,000 years.
\
The report will be a key document used at the Paris climate summit next year, when world leaders try to broker their first major deal on emissions in decades.
\
The panel's findings are ""yet another wake-up call to the global community that we must act together swiftly and aggressively in order to stem climate change and avoid its worst impacts,"" said John Holdren, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.
\
Secretary of State John Kerry agreed and put it more bluntly: ""Those who choose to ignore or dispute the science so clearly laid out in this report do so at great risk for all of us and for our kids and grandkids.""
\
A NASA website, Global Climate Change, says 97% of climate scientists agree that warming trends over the past century are very likely due to human activities.
\
The public is a bit more skeptical. A year-old survey by Pew Research showed 67% of Americans believed global warming is occurring, and 44% said the Earth is warming mostly because of human activity.

ExxonMobil is under investigation by New York's top law enforcement officer about whether it lied to investors and the public about the risks and financial impact of climate change.
\
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman subpoenaed the firm Wednesday, seeking financial records, statements and other climate-change-related material dating to 1977, according to a government official with direct knowledge of the matter. The official discussed the issue on condition of anonymity because the subpoena and other details of the investigation remain secret.
\
""Exxon Mobil has included information about the business risk of climate change for many years in our 10-K, Corporate Citizenship Report and in other reports to shareholders,"" ExxonMobil said in response to questions about the subpoena.
\
The company's 10-K annual report for the 2014 fiscal year stated many countries are considering regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions ""due to concern over the risk of climate change.""
\
""These requirements could make our products more expensive, lengthen project implementation times and reduce demand for hydrocarbons, as well as shift hydrocarbon demand toward relatively lower-carbon sources such as natural gas"" it warned, adding that new rules ""may also increase our compliance costs.""
\
The broad investigation by Schneiderman's office focuses on whether ExxonMobil made timely and accurate disclosures about how its climate-change research, the impact of long-term environmental shifts and any movement away from usage of fossil fuels could have on the company's financial fortunes.
\
New York's Martin Act gives the state's attorney general broad authority to investigate suspected financial wrongdoing and how it could affect investors.
\
Material sought by the subpoena includes research reports showing potential causes of climate change and documents detailing how the company made business decisions and financial projections based on environmental projections, according to the official. Additionally, the subpoena seeks information about ExxonMobil's funding of organizations involved in climate-change research, including those that challenged climate science findings. Schneiderman's office also sought the firm's disclosures in Securities and Exchange Commission filings and other statements to investors.
\
Investigators plan to examine whether ExxonMobil's internal research and findings square with what the company told investors and the public.
\
The energy giant is the second major company under investigation by Schneiderman over climate-change statements. Peabody Energy the world's largest private-sector coal producer, turned over documents in response to a 2013 request, and disclosed the issue the following year, the official said.
\
""Peabody continues to work with the New York Attorney General's office regarding our disclosures, which have evolved over the years,"" spokesman Vic Svecsaid in a statement the firm issued Thursday.

During a recent coastal storm, some folks in Oak Orchard near Millsboro were stuck in their homes for four straight days. The streets were impassable because of high water.
\
Del 1. along the coast was flooded, too, forcing people to travel 40 miles inland and then backtrack 10 miles between Bethany and Dewey beaches.
\
Delaware, it turns out, has done a good job planning and predicting when these low-lying places will flood, according ""States at Risk: America's Preparedness Report Card"" issued by Wednesday by the groups Climate Central and ICF International.
\
State officials still have work to do in implementation of two of their key planning documents that address sea level rise and a state framework to address climate change impacts by state agencies, the report found. In addition, they have more work to address impacts from extreme heat days.
\
The report praised state efforts to plan for climate risks, especially coastal flooding. The state received a B-plus on the report card, which considered flood, heat and other threats and looked at how well communities are prepared.
\
Susan E. Love, climate and sustainability section lead in the state division of Energy and Climate, said that it was good to be recognized for the planning efforts.
\
But, she said, ""We haven't put together a specific implementation plan"" for the 55 recommendation in the state's Sea Level Rise Adaptation Plan or the 166 action items in a climate framework that outlines key issues facing state agencies.
\
Still, Love said, ""It is nice to have verification that we are moving in the right direction.""
\
Meanwhile, she said, state agencies are working to incorporate the framework recommendations into projects and plans.
\
""We have made a lot of progress,"" she said.
\
The findings were released as the National Climatic Data Center issued global temperature data for October and reported that combined average temperature over both land and sea surfaces was the highest recorded for an October in 136 years of record-keeping. October was the sixth consecutive month when global land and sea surface temperatures broke global temperature records.
\
A strong El Nino in the equatorial Pacific is expected to continue impacting climate and weather globally. The national long-range forecast for winter suggests slightly warmer temperatures and slightly higher precipitation in the Mid-Atlantic. New England is expected to be warmer than normal.
\
In the United States, October was also a warmer than normal month nationally but in Delaware and neighboring states, both temperature and rainfall were about average for the month.
\
One of the big weather events in October in Delaware was a coastal storm that brought heavy rain, beach erosion and flooding to coastal areas.
\
The States at Risk report found that Delaware faces three key threats from climate change: more extreme heat days -- which are expected to more that quadruple and rise from 15 to more that 50 by 2050; more inland flooding and increased coastal flooding.
\
The report found ""a greater proportion of Delaware's area is at risk of coastal flooding than any state except Florida and Louisiana. Approximately 5.4 percent, or 100 square miles, of Delaware's land is currently within the 100-year coastal floodplain; by 2050, this is projected to increase to 7.1 percent or 130 square miles"" as sea level rises.
\
The report found that Alaska, California, Massachusetts, Maryland, New York and Pennsylvania where the only states that has assessed future climate vulnerabilities and designed and implemented plans to deal with them.

I guess Lara Setrakian was serious.
\
Setrakian is the poet laureate of the deeply immersive, single-topic website perhaps best illustrated by her acclaimed Syria Deeply, which she launched three years ago. In March 2014, she told me that her second site would be Arctic Deeply, focusing on the melting polar ice caps and set to debut that summer.
\
Then the Ebola crisis erupted, followed by the California drought, and they became the topics for Deeplies No. 2 and No. 3.
\
Now, at last, Arctic Deeply will debut Dec. 8, and Setrakian says she is ""extremely excited."" The venture is a partnership with the Centre for International Governance Innovation, a Canadian think-tank.
\
""The Arctic has been a huge priority for us for quite a while,"" says Setrakian, a former correspondent for ABC News and Bloomberg TV.
\
The timing seems right: The United States chairs the Arctic Council, and the temperature in the Arctic is rising at twice the rate as in the rest of the world.
\
The Deeplies are designed to address an all-too-familiar phenomenon in the news business. When a story explodes, there is saturation coverage. Then something else explodes, and the parade moves on, and the aftermath of Explosion No. 1 is too often ignored. That's what inspired Setrakian, a former Middle East correspondent, to create Syria Deeply, which was widely applauded from the start.
\
On its first day, Fast Company proclaimed, ""SYRIA DEEPLY OUTSMARTS THE NEWS, REDEFINES CONFLICT COVERAGE.""
\
Setrakian says there are many other subjects that have a ""Syria problem.""
\
Setrakian looks for topics that are ""generally underreported and extremely consequential for our time.""
\
Setrakian says the episodic approach ""is how our industry is built. You can't cover everything at the same time."" That said, ""there are people who want to know what happens on Day Four. We're here to fill in the gaps.""
\
Arctic Deeply will follow the model of its three predecessors. It will offer a mix of original content, links to top-flight coverage from other news outlets, news summaries, maps, op-eds, backgrounders, timelines, data visualization, you name it. All on the Arctic.
\
Providing that original content will be Managing Editor Hannah Hoag, who has written about climate change for a variety of publications for more than a decade. Setrakian describes Hoag's role as ""hyperactive beat reporter.""
\
For Hoag, the mission is personal.
\
She has visited the Arctic, and she has witnessed the impact of climate change on the population, the rising sea levels and ""villages falling into the ocean.""
\
""I've seen the changes firsthand,"" Hoag says.
\
Though she will be based in Toronto, Hoag plans to make frequent trips to the Arctic.
\
Hoag says she was attracted to Arctic Deeply because ""it checked a lot of boxes for me.""
\
She sees the new gig as an opportunity to take her climate change reporting to a, yes, deeper level.
\
""I want to talk to the people affected by climate change,"" Hoag says. ""It's a chance to focus on a niche issue that's really important now and in the future.""
\
Setrakian says that, three years in, she's more convinced than ever that her approach works. ""We have fantastic engagement metrics,"" she says. ""There has been a lot of validation of the single-topic model.""
\
Though News Deeply has gotten some grants, it supports itself in part by building platforms for other companies.
\
It has eight full-time employees devoted to all of the sites, including copy editors and digital staffers, and eight for specific projects.
\
Though traffic spikes at times of crisis, Setrakian says, the sites maintain a devoted cadre of regular visitors. ""For the diehards, there is a home,"" she says.
\
Should we look for more Deeplies in the future?
\
Setrakian says, ""Refugees Deeply is definitely on the agenda.""

High-level negotiations on an international agreement to fight global warming open outside Paris in Le Bourget on Monday and are scheduled to conclude Dec. 11.
\
The event is formally known as the 21st Conference
\
of the Parties (COP21) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC).
\
CLIMATE CHANGE SUMMIT
\
Here's what you need to know:
\
1WHAT'S AT STAKE?
\
Nothing less than the future of our planet. The participants hope to produce a legally binding plan to keep global temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) from pre-industrial levels. Without this minimum step, the planet will face worsening droughts, storms and floods, according to a consensus among climate scientists.
\
2WHO'S GOING TO BE THERE?
\
Representatives from 196 nations, including dozens of world leaders such as President Obama and China's President Xi Jinping (whose two countries are the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases blamed for the warming trend). Thousands of delegates, politicians, business leaders, scientists, environmental activists and journalists will be at the summit. Public climate change demonstrations in Paris and in cities around France have been called off in the wake of the terrorist attacks in the French capital two weeks ago.
\
3WHAT IS SPECIFICALLY BEING DISCUSSED?
\
The conference will review the reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases (carbon, methane) that each country has pledged to achieve by 2020. The United States and China, which emit these gases from burning coal, oil and gas, have promised to shift their industries to green, low-carbon fuels. In 2009, climate talks in Copenhagen stalled over disagreements between developed and developing countries over how the burden of cuts should be distributed.
\
4HOW DOES ALL THIS AFFECT ME?
\
The human cost of climate change is considerable. Over the past 20 years, weather-related disasters led to 606,000 deaths (30,000 per year) and 4.1. billion injuries, the U.N.'s officer for disaster risk reduction calculates. Moreover, some 90% of major disasters have been caused by 6,457 floods, storms, heatwaves, droughts and other extreme weather events at an annual cost of $250 billion to $300 billion, the U.N. estimates.
\
5WILL THERE BE A DEAL?
\
It's looking like a definite maybe. Experts have expressed optimism that enough preparation has been done in advance of the talks to make a binding action plan possible. Of the 196 countries participating, 178 have submitted so-called Intended Nationally Determined Contributions, or INDCs -- essentially public pledges that illustrate how much they will reduce emissions and what form that would take.

""The only people who are still disputing (climate change) are either some Republicans in Congress or folks on the campaign trail.""
\
President Obama
\
President Obama is sticking with his view climate change is a global threat on the order of terrorism, in part because groups such as the Islamic State will be defeated in traditional ways.
\
""But if you start seeing the oceans rise by 5, 6, 7 feet"" and if weather patterns change to where ""bread baskets to the world suddenly can no longer grow food, then you're seeing the kind of crisis that we can't deal with through the deployment of the Marines,"" Obama said in an interview on CBS This Morning.
\
""We can't deal with it through pouring money at it,"" Obama added.
\
As for terrorism, Obama -- who is seeking a global climate change agreement -- said ""we're gonna get"" the Islamic State.
\
""They will be defeated,"" Obama said. ""There will be ongoing efforts to disrupt the world order from terrorists, from rogue states, from cyber attacks. There's always some bad people out there trying to do bad things. And we have to be vigilant in going after them.""
\
Obama's critics have mocked his efforts to equate climate change and terrorism. Donald Trump, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, called one of the president's comments ""one of the dumbest statements I've ever heard in politics.""
\
Asked about Trump's criticism, Obama said: ""Mr. Trump should run back a tape or quote on some of the stuff he's said.""
\
Said Obama: Nearly all of the world's scientists and most of its political parties see climate change as ""a really urgent problem.""
\
""The only people who are still disputing (climate change) are either some Republicans in Congress or folks on the campaign trail.""

As world leaders wrap up historic climate negotiations in Paris this week, many of us eagerly await its results to determine whether the international community is prepared to meet the challenge of climate change head on. Still, regardless of the outcome of the negotiations, the conference serves as a valuable opportunity to reexamine our own efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and develop new clean energy sources, recognizing that we are all impacted by the challenges of climate change and all have a responsibility to focus on solutions.
\
As the lowest-lying state in the U.S., Delaware is particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Rising temperatures and more extreme weather caused by a warming climate harm our tourism and agriculture industries, as well as delicate ecosystems. Furthermore, with more than 380 miles of exposed shoreline statewide, rising sea levels threaten the health and safety of Delawareans.
\
The good news is our state has shown a strong commitment to addressing the causes and responding to the consequences of climate change. Transforming our power plants to operate more cleanly helped us reduce greenhouse gas emissions more than any other state. We've also implemented more than $100 million in energy efficiency projects to reduce energy consumption in state buildings.
\
In addition to making our existing energy consumption cleaner and more efficient, Delaware is also focused on developing new clean energy solutions. We've increased our solar-generating capacity by over 6,000 percent, including 1,600 solar energy systems installed on government buildings, businesses, schools, and homes.
\
As leaders around the world seek climate solutions on a global scale, it's imperative to recognize achieving these public goals is possible only in partnership with the private sector.
\
Consider Allen Harim Foods, which recently broke ground on a 1.57-megawatt solar array near a poultry processing plant in Harbeson. The new facility is expected to supply about 11 percent of the energy used by the plant and save the company 16 percent in energy costs during its first year of operation.
\
Other examples include Newark's Bloom Energy, which makes solid oxide fuel cells, or Baltimore Aircoil in Milford, which builds high-efficiency cooling systems. New Castle's White Optics manufactures more efficient lighting materials, and energy storage manufacturer Johnson Controls employs hundreds in Middletown. These businesses prove it is possible to create jobs and spur economic growth while reducing dirty emissions.
\
Still, Delaware has much more to do, whether it's finding more ways to increase our use of alternative fuels and cleaner energy sources, developing new energy efficient technologies, or supporting public transportation to cut vehicle emissions.
\
The ""Climate Framework for Delaware"" focuses on three goals: mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, adapting to a changing climate, and avoiding current and future flood risk by building on our investments from dikes in New Castle to beach preservation projects throughout eastern Sussex.
\
Congress must also do its part to help states transition to a clean energy economy. That means increasing incentives for companies to develop new technologies and doubling down on federal investments in R&D to encourage the creation and commercialization of new materials and processes that are less harmful to the environment.
\
In addition, federal lawmakers must reinforce the Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Power Plan, which aims to reduce dirty emissions from power plants by 30 percent nationwide by providing states flexibility to design local programs, much as we have done with Delaware power plants.
\
The plan also encourages partnerships like the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, through which Delaware and our neighbors have invested nearly a billion dollars in energy efficiency and market-based clean energy efforts that reduced emissions regionally by more than 40 percent since 2005.
\
The Paris conference marks the first international climate gathering that includes greenhouse gas emission reduction commitments from developing nations, including high emitters like China, India, and Brazil. Delaware, U.S., and world leaders have the opportunity to recognize the full extent of climate change as not only an environmental necessity, but also as an economic and moral imperative.

It was great to see Rep. Carney discussing the impact of climate change on Delaware, in the local Delaware papers. Climate change is a real and dangerous threat, not just to Delaware, but to the entire planet. Not only will the sea levels rise, but changes to the climate will have a devastating and widespread impact.
\
The delicate reefs and shellfish of the ocean are already being destroyed from the changes. Even just a small change in ocean temperature can have a devastating impact on the coral reefs. A prime example of this is the Great Barrier Reef, which has seen drastic coral destruction over time from the '60s until now. Due to milder winters and extensive droughts, trees are weaker and more prone to tree-killing insect infestation. These insects typically would not be around in normally cold winter months.
\
These are just a few of the devastating effects of climate change, and it's great to see Rep. Carney working in Congress to pass legislation to encourage alternatives to fossil fuels and other energy resources, however, there is something everyone can do right now on their own to help curb climate change; reduce or eliminate our consumption of meat. After he attended the Paris climate change summit, Arnold Schwarzenegger very publicly said last week that if people want to save the planet they should ""eat less meat.""
\
Animal agriculture is the leading cause of all greenhouse gas emissions. Various studies and research have shown that animal agriculture contributes more to greenhouse gases than all transportation methods combined. The methane produced by livestock has over an 80 percent more warming potential than CO2.
\
Cutting out or eliminating meat is crucial to the survival of the planet. Today it's easier than ever to do so. There are companies out there that are consistently releasing delicious, amazing plant-based foods. There are alternatives and replacements for just about everything nowadays, or you can just keep it simple with fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts, legumes and seeds. A national movement called ""meatless Monday"" has spread to schools, colleges and some businesses. All three counties in Delaware have plant-based organizations (VegRehoboth, VegDover and VegWilmington) that are available to people who may wish to look into a plant-based diet. Protecting the planet, the oceans, Delaware coastal tourist towns and Delaware's economy can all start at the grocery store, and everyone can help by choosing less animal products when they shop.

Financial collapse
\
What happened in Italy? Apparently an Italian citizen committed suicide after an insolvent bank expropriated all his savings. A couple of years ago I wrote to the editors of this paper that this could happen in the United States. This is the ""Cyprus-style"" confiscation of the bank accounts of ordinary people authorized by Dodd-Frank. It can happen here. We are currently experiencing a collapse of the junk bond segment of the market. Many experts have been warning for a long time that a collapse of the financial system worse than 2008 is a probability. This newspaper has a moral obligation to report this news to the public. And this can explain the undeclared war against Russia that we are waging in the Middle East and northern Africa as we plot and encourage so-called revolutions and regime change, and send planes to Syria where we face the possibility of a mistake with a Russian plane that could trigger World War III.

Dow/DuPont merger concerns
\
I am retired from the DuPont Co. Like all of my friends, I am deeply concerned about the impact of the Dow/Dupont merger on employees, retirees and the communities where DuPont facilities are located. DuPont has already announced its intention to layoff several thousand employees.
\
For well over a hundred years we have had laws requiring that mergers must not result in restraint of trade or stifle competition. Mergers such as Dow/DuPont will be subject to FTC and Justice Department review to ensure compliance with those laws.
\
I believe we are at a time when mergers should also be subject to a social responsibility review, which would include impact on communities, employees and retirees and what steps would be taken to minimize adverse impact.
\
I've never heard of any such legislation being proposed. I know it's too late to impact the Dow/DuPont merger, but I really do think this makes a lot of sense and is something long overdue in a civilized society.

Raise fines for cellphone use
\
This sums up what is wrong with Delawares. There should be no texting and cellphone use while driving. Any accident, especially like this one in Bear, should be treated same as a DUI. The fines for texting and driving should be a very high price. Everywhere I go every other car is using their phones. This has become a nightmare. I almost got hit head-on by someone texting. Treat it as you would a drunken driver. This is every bit as serious. Bottom line, up the ante on fines and sentencing if an accident occurs.

can tho, vietnam -- Huynh Van Loi, 50, a farmer who spent most his life in the same small Mekong Delta district, has experienced good weather and bad, droughts and floods. But this year brought something he'd never seen.
\
""The water is salty,"" he said. ""I've been living here since my childhood but this is the first time we've had salty water. All my crops were destroyed.""
\
The worst drought in 90 years, rising sea levels and rampant development are causing a crisis in the Mekong Delta, known as Vietnam's rice bowl. The delta is home to 20 million people and accounts for more than half of Vietnam's rice and fruit production, 90% of its rice exports and 60% of fishery exports.
\
But this year, paddy rice fields resemble parched desertscapes as farmers wait for a rainy season that is late to arrive. Small farmers such as Loi, who grows watermelons and orange trees about 40 miles from the South China Sea, have seen crop-ruining salinity intrude farther inland than ever before.
\
The drought, caused by El Nino weather patterns, is hitting the entire region from Thailand to Cambodia to Vietnam's central highlands. The impact is most acute here in the Mekong Delta, where the Mekong River ends its 2,700-mile journey from the Tibetan plateau through six Asian countries.
\
A United Nations report released in March about the drought estimated that 393,000 acres of rice in Vietnam was already lost, with an additional 1.2 million acres likely to be damaged. Almost 1 million people lack water for daily consumption.
\
The figures are alarming but could grow worse if weather extremes become more common in years to come.
\
""This year is not a special case,"" said Duong Van Ni, an environmental management professor at Can Tho University. ""It will happen more in the future.""
\
Ni said the rapid agricultural development that turned postwar Vietnam from a famine-stricken country into one of the world's leading rice exporters has exacerbated the effects of climate change.
\
""A long time ago, there were also typhoons, also saltwater intrusion, also drought,"" Ni said. ""But the impact was not as severe as now, because at that time the ecosystem wasn't changed by humans. Now the system is already damaged: by canals, by dikes, by water management, by land use.""
\
Then there are the dams. China has built seven hydropower dams on the upper Mekong, known locally as the Lancang, and plans to add 21 more. Laos and Cambodia intend to build 11 hydropower dams on the lower Mekong, with two in Laos already under construction.
\
China's existing dams already hurt the Mekong, affecting water levels, water temperature and fish migration patterns. They also trap as much as 80% of the sediment that reaches them. The sediment is needed to fertilize downstream floodplains and protect against coastal erosion.
\
""The biggest impact is the trapping of silt,"" said Richard Cronin, director of the Southeast Asia program at the Stimson Center, a think tank in Washington, D.C. He said the silt is needed to replenish nutrients that wash away during monsoon season in the delta and southern Cambodia, as well as to sustain the delta against rising sea levels.
\
Without the sediment, the low-lying delta is eroding and actually sinking. Vietnam's Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment estimated that a 1-meter rise in the sea level would submerge nearly 40% of the Mekong Delta and more than 20% of Ho Chi Minh City, a metropolis of 10 million people.
\
Vietnam is introducing salt-resistant rice and increasing autumn and winter rice crop quotas to make up for this year's shortfall. The Ministry of Agriculture and Development is seeking $4.5billion from the government to build an irrigation system, and work is underway on a decades-long plan to construct sea walls and dikes along the coast.
\
""I find it difficult to be optimistic,"" said Dan Spencer, associate professor of environmental studies at the University of Montana. ""Like many poor nations, Vietnam generates very little of the climate change problem but suffers from the brunt of many of the effects.""
\
Ni called the problem alarming. ""I wonder if the situation of the Mekong basin, especially the Mekong River, should be upgraded as a global issue, as soon as possible,"" he said. ""It's not isolated to six countries in Asia.""
\
On a recent day, farmer Nguyen Tran Ngoc was digging a canal to try to irrigate some new crops: watermelon, flowers, squash, pumpkin and cabbage. He stopped growing rice because of the lack of water. He doesn't know how much longer he can make a living from farming.
\
""Worry or don't worry, it's all the same,"" he said. ""Change is coming and we can't control it.""

July and August were the hottest months for the planet since record keeping began. Scientists are confident that 2016 will be the hottest year. Rising sea levels have made flooding commonplace in several major U.S. cities. And meanwhile, one of our leading presidential candidates says climate change is some kind of Chinese hoax.
\
Elections have consequences, and this is one of the most fateful: Anyone who takes climate change seriously had better do everything possible to keep Donald Trump out of the White House.
\
Believe it or not, there are issues more important than Trump's latest offensive outburst or Hillary Clinton's score on the likability scale. Clinton accepts the scientific consensus on climate change, which is increasingly supported by what we see and feel every day. She would build upon President Barack Obama's efforts to address the issue, which include the historic Paris agreement, seen by many experts as our last best hope to prevent catastrophe.
\
Trump, by contrast, is a bald-faced denier. ""Obama's talking about all of this with the global warming and ... a lot of it's a hoax,"" he said at a December rally in South Carolina. ""It's a hoax. I mean, it's a moneymaking industry, OK? It's a hoax, a lot of it.""
\
He tweeted in 2012 that ""the concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing noncompetitive."" He later said this was a joke, but during the campaign he has again said he does not believe in climate change and claimed that action to limit carbon emissions ""is done for the benefit of China.""
\
The Paris pact represents the first time the world's two biggest emitters, China and the United States, have formally agreed to hold down the amount of heat-trapping carbon they spew into the atmosphere. Trump would renounce the agreement -- and also scrap Obama administration rules limiting emissions from coal-fired power plants. He has promised greater fossil-fuel production and scoffed at alternative energy sources such as wind power.
\
Clinton recognizes the potential economic benefits of developing the technology to lead the world toward a clean-energy economy. Trump would rather let China, Germany and other nations compete for that prize.
\
According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 15 of the warmest 16 years on record have come since the turn of the century. By examining air bubbles preserved for centuries in polar ice, scientists know the concentration of heat-trapping carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased by 40 percent since the Industrial Revolution, when large-scale burning of fossil fuels began.
\
Global warming is affecting weather patterns worldwide. Deniers point out that it is not possible to conclusively blame any given storm or localized heat wave on climate change - and that, yes, it still gets cold in the winter. But the phenomenon is clearly visible in melting glaciers and ice caps, the opening of ice-free sea lanes through the Arctic and, most urgently, sea-level rise. The oceans are rising because warmer water occupies a greater volume than cooler water and because so much land ice is melting. According to NOAA, average sea level is rising by about 1.2 inches per decade. That may not sound like much, but it has already been enough to at least triple the amount of ""nuisance"" flooding that coastal cities have to cope with when onshore winds coincide with high tide.
\
Last November, in Time magazine, Clinton wrote that ""I won't let anyone take us backward, deny our economy the benefits of harnessing a clean energy future, or force our children to endure the catastrophe that would result from unchecked climate change.""
\
Neither her policies nor Trump's will reverse the climate effects we're already seeing. But it is possible, and necessary, to keep the impacts from becoming completely unmanageable. Obama leaves behind a framework for coordinated international action, more than two decades in the making, that still could fail - but that might, just might, succeed. Trump boasts that he can't wait to tear it all down.
\
The choice is ours.

The climate is changing in dangerous ways, and we are responsible for most of these changes. This is not a matter of conjecture or political opinion - it is the conclusion of the overwhelming majority of climate scientists, based on solid evidence that mounts each year. Rising sea levels, extreme heat, increased incidence of floods and drought, ocean acidification and expansion of tropical diseases pose an unacceptable level of risk to our descendants. So do many other climate-related threats.
\
Business, scientific and technical leaders are responding to these threats by finding ways to adapt to climate change, increase our energy efficiency, and develop carbon-free energy sources. Political leaders here and abroad are creating policies that promote these advances. At the Paris climate conference in December, 195 countries adopted an historic climate agreement, whose main goal is to prevent the world's mean temperature from rising more than 2 degrees centigrade above its pre-industrial level. This agreement was the culmination of many years of efforts by governments and citizens. The negotiators of the agreement came together despite differences in forms of government, in responsibility for past emissions of greenhouse gases and in susceptibility to future climate change.
\
But these efforts to reduce the risk to future generations are now being imperiled by a small yet vocal group that denies the validity of the evidence and of scientific expertise in general. Of special and immediate concern is the stated intent of the current Republican Party platform and presidential nominee Donald Trump to promote the extraction and use of the most carbon-intensive fossil fuels, to withdraw the United States from the Paris agreement and to rescind President Barack Obama's executive actions designed to reduce climate risk. We are deeply concerned about the serious long-term damage to our world that would result if the climate and energy policy goals of Trump and the Republican Party were to become our national policies, reversing decades of progress on energy, climate, clean air and clean water. These consequences would be borne by billions of current and future citizens of this planet.
\
To address this concern, we - together with 373 other members of the National Academy of Sciences - have published an open letter Sept. 21 drawing attention to the serious risks of climate change. We state that ""the problem of human-caused climate change is real, serious, and immediate, and that this problem poses significant risks: to our ability to thrive and build a better future, to national security, to human health and food production, and to the interconnected web of living systems."" The letter also highlights the urgent need to reduce heat-trapping emissions as part of the Paris agreement.
\
For the United States to withdraw now from the Paris agreement would undermine the world's ability to deal with climate change, diminish U.S. credibility internationally, and hobble U.S. economic competitiveness in developing and marketing clean energy sources. But where there is risk, there is also opportunity for creative problem solving. As the letter notes, ""Nations that find innovative ways of decarbonizing energy systems and sequestering CO2 will be the economic leaders of the 21st century.""
\
We should not turn the clock back by regarding scientific ignorance as a virtue, or by embracing business-as-usual energy policies. It's time to unleash the renewable and limitless power of the mind, and to accelerate efforts to develop and implement clean energy sources. This is the leadership we need, and this is the only kind of leadership that will reduce the worst climate change risks to our children while presenting them with new and exciting economic opportunities.

Delaware's Inland Bays have gotten better, especially in open waters, over the last five years but a growing population, impacts from climate change and continued stress from runoff pollution continue to impact water quality, according to the 2016 State of the Inland Bays Report released this week.
\
One of the unexpected surprises in the report is the improvements in Little Assawoman Bay. Nitrogen and phosphorous levels at almost all sampling stations meet water quality standards there, and levels of oxygen in the water met or exceeded the standards everywhere except Dirickson Creek during summer sampling.
\
The big question for the staff of the Center for the Inland Bays, the nonprofit that produces the report every five years, is what is working in the Little Assawoman that could be applied to Rehoboth and Indian River bays.
\
""We have definitely seen encouraging progress in some of our environmental indicators such as inputs of nutrients from point sources and water quality improvements in Little Assawoman Bay,"" said Marianne Walch, the center's science coordinator. ""But lack of progress in some areas, such as nonpoint nitrogen inputs and negative trends in others, such as climate change indicators, suggest the bays will have many water quality and habitat challenges ahead.""
\
The report used 35 environmental indicators to assess the ecological conditions in the bays. This work compared 2011 findings to changes over the last five years.
\
What researchers found is that Rehoboth and Indian River bays are in better shape in the center of each waterway. The likely reason: better water exchange because of the influence of Indian River Inlet. But the tributaries continue to be nutrient-rich and have poor water quality and low oxygen levels.
\
Local, state and federal officials have intensely studied the Inland Bays for more than 40 years. Over that time, thousands of septic systems have been removed from the drainage basin, state-of-the-art sewer systems have replaced them and farmers have adopted plans to control runoff from their land.
\
Yet, nutrient pollution from nitrogen and phosphorous continue to be a significant problem in the watershed, and much of it likely comes from runoff from the land and from parking lots, roof tops and other impervious surfaces, according to the report.
\
These nutrients cause algae growth, cloudy water and large shifts in oxygen levels. These rapid shifts can cause fish kills.
\
Walsh pointed to significant population growth - the year-round population doubled in the region between 1990 and 2000 - as well as the increase in paved surfaces and significant changes in land use as significant changes in the estuary.
\
Scientists believe that once impervious surface reaches 10 percent, water quality degrades. In the Inland Bays, the percentage of impervious surface is at 10.4 percent and is much higher in some urbanized areas, she said.
\
Another major concern is the impact of climate change from more frequent and stronger storms to shoreline erosion and inundation, she said.
\
In Dewey Beach, municipal officials are already coping with increase flooding along the streets that front Rehoboth Bay.
\
""We cannot pump and pave our way out of this situation,"" said Mike Dunmyer, a Dewey Beach commissioner.
\
""We know that we need to be more resilient (to the impacts of sea level rise),"" said David Small, secretary of the state Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control.
\
Finding new and innovative ways to stabilize shorelines will be a key component as the region copes with climate change, he said.
\
""We know this area is going to continue to grow,"" he said.
\
Small said Sussex County's efforts to replace septic systems with central sewer have played a major role in reducing nitrogen and phosphorous pollution and new stormwater regulations should help reduce both nutrients and sediment entering the bays and the tributaries.
\
As center officials look toward possible solutions, Executive Director Chris Bason said reaching out to landowners and seeking more grant money could encourage the planting of cover crops to reduce pollution runoff from farms.
\
About 8,000 acres of farmland in the watershed are planted with winter cover crops, he said. In the Maryland Coastal Bays watershed, thousands more acres are planted with cover crops that uptake excess nitrogen and phosphorous from the land.
\
""We can do a lot better,"" he said. ""The real area that we need to focus on is agriculture.""
\
Among the issues center scientists would like to explore next are why other estuaries like the Maryland Coastal Bays and the shallow coastal bays in New Jersey can support underwater grasses, but Delaware's do not. There are almost no eelgrass beds in Delaware's Inland Bays, but they used to be common here.
\
They are also curious why water clarity, even in shallow waters near shore, is so poor during the summer.
\
And they would like to know what has worked in Little Assawoman Bay to make conditions there significantly better than they were five years ago.
\
""The State of the Bays reporting provides a time to ask ourselves ... how we are doing in meeting our goals to restore and protect Delaware's Inland Bays,"" Walch said.
\
""Here we are five years later,"" Bason said. ""How are the Inland Bays doing? It's not simple. Science never is.""

In her recent piece, ""It's time to chill about global warming,"" national columnistSusan Stamper Brown accuses global warming activists of being obsessed with polar bears; making vicious predators into our ""poster child."" She selectively reports contradictory observations to support her suggestion that, whether the planet is warming or cooling, it's really not our fault. We just need to trust in God, ""who causes occasional warming to help his animals survive.""
\
In fact, she reveals a shallow interpretation of the motivations of those concerned about climate change, a distorted understanding of the science and a dismissive attitude about the magnitude of the problem and our central role in creating it.
\
Do we care about polar bears? Sure we do, as one magnificent species that is representative of every creature, every ecosystem, every human being whose welfare is threatened by a warming planet.
\
On the day Ms. Brown's piece was published, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration released their Arctic Report Card. Jeremy Mathis, director of NOAA's Arctic Research Program stated, ""Rarely have we seen the Arctic show a clearer, stronger or more pronounced signal of persistent warming and its cascading effects on the environment than this year.""
\
We've heard the message repeated: There is agreement among more than 97 percent of (peer-reviewed) climate scientists that climate warming is occurring, due largely to human activity, with emissions of greenhouse gases at their highest levels in recorded history. Indeed, most of the leading scientific organizations worldwide have issued public statements endorsing this position.
\
We witness the impacts, as every day the media brings new images of melting ice caps, retreating shorelines, devastating weather events, bleaching of coral reefs, species extinction, uncontrolled spread of disease. We can see it right here in Delaware. According to a recent EPA report, higher water levels are already eroding beaches, submerging lowlands, damaging farmland, worsening coastal flooding and increasing salt levels in critical estuaries and aquifers. Our growing season is being affected, as are migratory patterns of the birds and waterfowl that we take so much delight in, which attract tourists from around the world.
\
Climate change activists are not just talking about the future of polar bears. We're talking about the kind of world we want to live in, the world we want to leave our children and the all too real suffering that the all too real impacts are causing now.
\
The board of directors, faith leaders and members of Delaware Interfaith Power and Light believe climate change is a defining moral challenge of our times.
\
One of 40 state affiliates, with 18,000 member congregations throughout the country, our shared mission is to serve as a religious response to climate change. We believe we have a moral responsibility to care for Creation, to protect those most vulnerable, to scientifically inform and spiritually deepen our understanding of our relationship with each other and the natural world.
\
We do not believe that God will intervene to save us from our ill-informed and reckless mistakes. We have a long and dismal history of spoiling our nests, of desecrating this beautiful, wondrous, miraculous Creation that sustains us. And we have paid a high price in human suffering.
\
The immensity of this challenge calls on all of us to be part of the solution. Our collective congregations - each in their own way, inspired by their own faith - are finding practical ways to be the change we want to see in the world. We participate in preach-ins, form Earth care teams, become learning centers, secure energy audits, upgrade energy systems, install solar panels, plant, community gardens, explore eco-systems and advocate for a safer, healthier, more equitable future for the generations to come.
\
We cannot afford to live in a state of denial. Nor can our policy makers. We need a reality check for ourselves and we need to hold our leaders accountable. Then, together, we need to believe that we can pull back from the brink of our own destructiveness. It will require inquiring minds, open hearts, helping hands and a certain leap of faith to deliver this precious and all too fragile cargo, including the polar bears, to our children's children. They are counting on us.

The first task of a newly elected president, with the advice and consent of the Senate, is to select a Cabinet. Presidents deserve latitude in choosing the team they believe will best help them carry out their vision for the country. As the old saying goes, ""Elections have consequences.""
\
On perhaps no nomination, however, is the advice and consent of the Senate more important than that of the secretary of state. The president's authority over foreign policy is not unilateral. The Constitution vests the Senate with significant authority, requiring, for example, that the president secure the support of two-thirds of the Senate before entering into treaties with foreign powers. The founders were suspicious of partisan agendas, and the tradition in the United States is that partisanship ought to end at the water's edge. The secretary of state is the representative, not of any party, but of one nation, indivisible.
\
In Rex Tillerson, Donald Trump has nominated a man who shares his transactional nature. Throughout his confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Tillerson made it clear that no higher consideration guided him as chief executive officer of ExxonMobil and no higher consideration would guide him as the nation's chief diplomat than the art of the deal. Asked if there was any country he would not have done legal business with as an oil man, based on that country's record of human rights abuses, Tillerson answered there was none. Asked about climate change, Tillerson advocated taking ""a seat at the table"" in negotiations, not to exercise leadership, but to ensure that whatever happens American competitiveness is not compromised. Invited repeatedly to speak out against human rights abuses on the part of dictatorial regimes around the world, Tillerson consistently refused to do so. Not only did he seem to view taking up the cause of human rights as counterproductive from the standpoint of getting the best possible deals from dictators, at times he seemed genuinely and unnervingly unmoved by the plight of victims of oppression. Responding to a question about the murder of political dissidents in Russia, Tillerson responded, ""Well, people who speak up for freedom in regimes that are oppressive are often at threat, and these things happen to them.""
\
America at its best has been more than merely a transactional world power. President John F. Kennedy, at the height of the Cold War, committed the United States to ""do our part to build a world of peace where the weak are safe and the strong are just."" He expressed the optimism that throughout our history has characterized our country at its best. ""Our problems,"" he observed, ""are man-made; therefore they can be solved by man. And man can be as big as he wants. No problem of human destiny is beyond human beings."" Kennedy stressed that the key to human progress was a recognition of our common humanity: ""For in the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet. We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our children's future. And we are all mortal.""
\
It is hard to imagine a nomination for secretary of state less in keeping in the 21st century with Kennedy's vision of American leadership for the global common good than Rex Tillerson. In Kennedy's time, the manmade problem that threatened humanity with self-inflicted destruction was nuclear war. In our time, it is the destruction of the climate of our shared ""small planet"" through the uncontrolled burning of fossil fuels. In Kennedy's time, the solution was negotiated disarmament. In our time, it is a negotiated agreement to move to a common reliance on sustainable sources of energy. Tillerson's commitment at his confirmation hearing to participate in climate negotiations only for the purpose of safeguarding American competitiveness was in keeping with a career in the senior leadership and as CEO of a company that has actively worked for decades to forestall global action to address climate change. The fossil fuel industry, of which Tillerson was a chieftain, has spent vast sums of money lobbying against climate change legislation and financing a decades-long misinformation campaign to create public confusion as to the reality of climate change and the threat it poses to humanity. No company has been more aggressive, or irresponsible, in this regard than ExxonMobil.
\
America stands for better and America can do better. The Senate should refuse to give its consent to Tillerson's nomination. It should advise Donald Trump to go back, draw from the deep well of American diplomatic talent and select a nominee who will inspire confidence in American leadership at home and abroad, amongst the persecuted as well as the powerful; a nominee who will affirm Kennedy's belief in the potential of American leadership to achieve a future better for the United States and for all humanity.

158,"Climate change is not only harmful to our physical health, it can be debilitating for our mental health as well, according to a report published Wednesday.\Severe weather events and natural disasters linked to climate change have the most dramatic impact on mental health, according to the report by the American Psychological Association and ecoAmerica. Natural disasters cause intense negative emotions in people who are exposed to them, primarily fear and grief. Anxiety, depression and unhealthy behavior are also common responses. Some people, particularly those who experience tragic events, such as the loss of a loved one or repeated exposure to extreme weather, develop post-traumatic stress disorder.\As one example of how disasters made more likely by climate change can impact mental health, the report cites statistics from people who survived Hurricane Katrina. Their rates of suicide and incidence of suicidal thoughts more than doubled; one in six people met the diagnostic criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder; and nearly half of the people living in an affected area developed an anxiety or mood disorder such as depression.\""I found this topic really interesting because this wasn't something I was hearing people talk about and this wasn't well acknowledged as an effect of climate change,"" said Susan Clayton, the lead author of the report and a professor of psychology at The College of Wooster in Ohio.\Some things protect people from the worst psychological effects of climate change-induced natural disasters, such as having social support. In contrast, those who live in communities where livelihood is directly tied to the environment, such as agriculture, tourism or fishing, are more vulnerable to negative mental health impacts. People in indigenous communities are particularly vulnerable because climate change can threaten environmental aspects of their cultural heritage.\Climate change can be a cause of stress, which is often caused by a sense of a loss of control or an inability to adapt to a new situation. Increased stress levels can increase the likelihood of problems such as substance abuse, anxiety disorders or depression, according to the report.\Problems exacerbated by climate change have carryover effects on a person's physical health, the economy and the community. Changes in weather patterns can affect agriculture and infrastructure, which may force some people to migrate.\Displacement because of natural disasters can lead to a variety of negative consequences, such as a loss of social support, strains on personal relationships, absences from work and higher medical costs, according to the report.\The weather people experience also influences their mental health, the report says. Prolonged exposure to warmer weather makes people more aggressive and diminishes cognitive functions, according to earlier studies.\The authors of the report suggest several strategies people can use to cope with or mitigate the negative mental impacts of climate change. The most important thing is to encourage social connections, Clayton said, to make people feel more secure and give them greater access to information. Preparedness is another important factor in mitigating mental health effects caused or aggravated by climate change.\""The fact that most of us ignore climate change paradoxically makes the effects worse because we don't really know what to expect and it seems scary and unknown,"" Clayton said, ""but if we inform ourselves that that's what is likely to happen in our area, we would be more prepared and in control of the situation."""

A Senate committee revived the stalled debate over renewable energy in Florida on Monday and moved forward with a bill to give $16 million a year in tax incentives to businesses and homeowners, beginning next year.
\
The measure, being pushed by Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam, was introduced by the Senate Communications, Energy and Utilities Committee on Monday and will be voted on next week.
\
It was described by energy advocates as a small step toward encouraging a market for renewable energy in Florida and weaning the state off its dependence on natural gas.
\
The bill, SB 7202, would allow large companies, such as Walmart and Publix, as well as individual homeowners, to get sales tax breaks and tax credits if they invest in renewable energy machines, products and technology.
\
Renewable energy includes everything from solar panels to biofuels, wind farms and tidal power. Last year, legislators allowed a series of similar tax credits to expire.
\
The Senate bill also allows companies to install electric car charging stations without having to be regulated like a utility company.
\
It includes algae among the list of authorized biofuels. It also requires the state's utility board, the Public Service Commission, to require that electric utility companies be judged on their fuel diversity when they seek approval for new power plants.
\
Florida utilities rely on natural gas to generate more than half of the state's electricity, a fuel that is dependent on foreign sources and transportation to bring to the state.
\
Proponents of renewable energy have argued for years that the state should encourage the domestic production of alternative fuels with incentives that jump-start competition.
\
Matthew Carter, the committee's staff director and a former PSC chairman, emphasized what the bill did not contain: ""no rate increase for ratepayers.""
\
For the past three years, the state's largest utilities used the renewable energy debate to push for a bill that would allow them to raise rates on customers so they could develop solar farms. Year after year, the measure stalled.
\
This year, Putnam has proposed the state's large utilities get automatic approval to raise rates so they can develop up to 75 megawatts a year in renewable energy, but the Senate has not yet included that provision in the bill.
\
Susan Glickman of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy disagreed with Carter that the bill will not raise costs to customers.
\
She said that if legislators fail to include stricter energy efficiency requirements, and allow the PSC to maintain the status quo, customer bills will automatically rise.
\
Under current law, the PSC is allowed to pass on the fuel costs to customers each year as well as pass along the cost of planning for projected nuclear power plants.
\
""Energy efficiency is always cheaper than a new plant ... even the cheapest power plant,"" Glickman told legislators. But Florida's PSC last year ""threw out the conservation goals for half the state"" rather than require companies to capitalize on energy efficiency programs as regulators do in 17 other states. SACE, the clean energy advocacy group, is suing the PSC for that decision, alleging it has violated state law.
\
The Senate bill ""is a small step in the right direction,"" Glickman said, but added, ""Florida is definitely behind other states under most measures and will remain so.""

On whether humans contribute to global warming
\
Mitt Romney on Thursday, October 27th, 2011 in various statements
\
* * *
\
THE RULING: HALF FLIP
\
Do humans contribute to global warming? There's been a robust debate over whether Mitt Romney has flip-flopped on this question. In this item, we'll try to determine whether he has.
\
We'll start by noting that the Flip-O-Meter rates politicians' consistency on particular topics from No Flip to Full Flop. The meter is not intended to pass judgment on their decisions to change their minds. It's simply gauging whether they did.
\
Romney's campaign website is silent on climate change. But in Romney's 2010 book No Apology: The Case for American Greatness, he wrote that ""I believe that climate change is occurring - the reduction in the size of global ice caps is hard to ignore. I also believe that human activity is a contributing factor. I am uncertain how much of the warming, however, is attributable to factors out of our control.""
\
Then, in a town hall in New Hampshire in June 2011, a voter asked Romney whether he thought climate change existed and was caused by human activity. Here's part of Romney's answer (the full exchange can be seen on C-SPAN starting at the 21:00 mark):
\
""I don't speak for the scientific community, of course. But I believe the world is getting warmer. I can't prove that, but I believe based on what I read that the world is getting warmer. And number two, I believe that humans contribute to that. I don't know how much our contribution is to that, because I know there have been periods of greater heat and warmth in the past, but I believe that we contribute to that. So I think it's important for us to reduce our emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases that may well be significant contributors to the climate change and the global warming that you're seeing.""
\
Romney added that he opposed the United States unilaterally adopting a cap-and-trade plan if other countries weren't taking similar steps to reduce greenhouse emissions. A cap-and-trade plan would require industry to pay for their carbon emissions with new permit fees. There would be a limited amount of permits (the ""cap""), but companies would be able to buy and sell the permits among themselves (the ""trade"").
\
Later, in an Aug. 24, 2011, event in Lebanon, N.H., Romney said, ""Do I think the world's getting hotter? Yeah, I don't know that, but I think that it is. I don't know if it's mostly caused by humans. ... What I'm not willing to do is spend trillions of dollars on something I don't know the answer to.""
\
And Romney discussed the issue in an Oct. 3, 2011, interview with reporters and editors of the New Hampshire Union Leader. (It was recorded here by C-SPAN; check around the 22-minute mark.)
\
Romney said, ""One, I believe what I said before, I think it's getting warmer. Two, I believe we contribute to it. And three, I don't know by how much -- a lot or a little. And so I am not willing to adopt multi-trillion dollar programs to reduce greenhouse gases in America. They don't call it America warming, they call it global warming.""
\
Both the book excerpt and the three New Hampshire comments suggest pretty clearly that Romney sees a role for humans in climate change, though he's less committal about how large an impact humans are having.
\
But at a campaign event in Pittsburgh, Pa., a few months later, Romney offered a somewhat different perspective. His comments were videotaped and promoted by the liberal advocacy website Think Progress.
\
A voter asked Romney, ""What is your position on man-made global warming and would you reject legislation, such as cap and trade, which is based on the idea of man-made global warming?""
\
""My view is that we don't know what's causing climate change on this planet. And the idea of spending trillions and trillions of dollars to try to reduce CO2 emissions is not the right course for us. My view with regards to energy policy is pretty straightforward. I want us to become energy secure and independent of the oil cartels. And that means let's aggressively develop our oil, our gas, our coal, our nuclear power.""
\
Much of Romney's underlying policy proposals -- reducing foreign oil dependence; increasing the use of natural gas and nuclear power; and opposing cap-and-trade -- remained the same in both comments.
\
But this time he left out human activity as a cause of global warming. Rather than saying, as he had in the past, that we don't know how much of a role humans are playing in climate, Romney said, ""We don't know what's causing climate change on this planet.""
\
After Romney's remarks were widely reported, Romney spokeswoman Andrea Saul told the Boston Globe that Romney was not flip-flopping.
\
""This is ridiculous,"" she said in a statement. ""Gov. Romney's view on climate change has not changed. He believes it's occurring, and that human activity contributes to it, but he doesn't know to what extent. He opposes cap and trade, and he refused to sign such a plan when he was governor.""
\
We were unable to find any remarks since then about whether he thought human beings contribute to global warming or not.
\
Our ruling
\
In June 2011, Romney said he believed ""the world is getting warmer"" and that ""humans contribute to that."" In October 2011, by contrast, Romney said that ""we don't know what's causing climate change on this planet.""
\
It's unclear to us whether this was an inadvertent omission or a calculated attempt to say divergent things to different audiences. Because Romney, in our view, is savvy enough to know the difference between suggesting a human role in climate change and leaving it out, we think it's reasonable to perceive Romney as taking two distinct stances in these two statements. We rate this a Half Flip.

162,"The statement \""We've doubled our use of renewable energy."" \President Barack Obama, in a speech in Seminole Sept. 8 \The ruling: MOSTLY FALSE\* * *\During his Pinellas County rally Sept. 8, President Barack Obama touted the nation's achievements in expanding the use of renewable energy. \""I've got a plan to control more of our own energy,"" Obama said. ""After 30 years of inaction, we raised fuel standards so that by the middle of the next decade, your cars and trucks will go twice as far on a gallon of gas. That will save you money. It will help the environment. We've doubled our use of renewable energy, and thousands of Americans now have jobs building wind turbines and long-lasting batteries."" \We wondered whether Obama was correct that we've ""doubled our use of renewable energy."" \We began by asking the Obama campaign to back up the claim. A spokeswoman cited three statistics from the Energy Information Administration, a federal agency that collects energy data. \- Net electricity generation from wind, which more than doubled between 2008 and 2011. \- Net electricity generation from solar has more than doubled over the same period. \- During the first five months of 2012, the United States has produced more electricity from wind than it did in all of 2008. \We checked the data and found out that all of these comparisons are accurate. But that doesn't tell the whole story. The problem for Obama is not that the trend is inaccurate, but that he used the wrong words to describe it. \More than solar, wind \The agency's tables include several additional categories of renewable energy, including hydroelectric, geothermal and various types of biomass energy. If you put them all together by BTUs, wind energy in 2011 accounted for 11 percent of all renewable-energy production. That's not 11 percent of all energy production, including coal, oil and natural gas - that's 11 percent of just the production from renewable sources. Solar, meanwhile, was even smaller. It accounted for about 1 percent of all renewable energy production. \If you look at all types of electricity generation from renewables, the increase isn't double between 2008 and 2011 - it's 55 percent. \Energy vs. electricity \Not all renewable energy is used to create electricity. For instance, some renewable energy is used for transportation, primarily ethanol in gasoline. This ethanol is counted in the ""energy"" category but not in the ""electricity"" category. Much smaller amounts of biomass are used for heating in colder locales or in industrial facilities like paper mills. \So, to use Obama's words, did renewable energy - not just electricity - double between 2008 and 2011? No. The increase in megawatt hours was about 25 percent, according to EIA data and estimates. \Our ruling \Obama said, ""We've doubled our use of renewable energy."" But while the nation has made strides in expanding electricity generated by wind and solar, the increase for all kinds of energy, and for all types of renewables, was about 25 percent. We rate the statement Mostly False. \This ruling has been edited for print. Read the full version at PolitiFact.com.\Credit: Times staff writer"

Fund proposals to help fish and game survive climate change
\
Supports proposals ""to devote billions of dollars annually to state game and fish agencies and federal land management agencies to help them ensure that fish and wildlife survive the impacts of climate change.""

\
The Obameter: COMPROMISE
\
During his campaign, Obama promised to help fish and wildlife survive the impacts of climate change with billions of dollars in funding.
\
The billion dollar promise was based on a piece of failed legislation called the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 -- also known as the cap and trade bill.
\
This bill would have done just what the name suggests, cap greenhouse gas emissions and then allow groups to buy and sell emissions permits. The goal was to use a market-based mechanism to lower overall emissions by gradually reducing the cap.
\
The bill included a financing component that would have distributed funding to various climate change programs.
\
While Obama pushed for the inclusion of a Natural Resources Climate Change Adaptation Fund in the climate change legislation, never passed.
\
But Obama has included funding in his yearly budgets that aims to accomplish similar goals, and yearly budgets show that climate change funding has increased during this administration.
\
Most recently, the 2012 budget provides $2.6 billion to the multi-agency U.S. Global Change Research Program which is a 5.6 percent increase from last year.
\
The administration has also invested $320 million in programs under the U.S. Interior Department to address climate change.
\
We spoke with Taryn Tuss, communications director at the White House Council on Environmental Quality who said these programs focus on creating ""climate change adaptation strategies, improving climate-related science and monitoring of natural resources, and conserving and restoring vital landscapes.""
\
In addition, she pointed us to a government-wide initiative to ""incorporate adaptation into agency planning and risk assessment, with the goal of protecting infrastructure and other taxpayer investments, natural resources, and public health.""
\
The only realistic way for Obama to secure billions for fish and game would have been through the passage of the cap and trade bill. While cap and trade didn't pass, the administration has supported the goals initially outlined in the promise by supporting agencies that run climate change programs. We rate this a Compromise.

164,"If Gov. Rick Scott wants to see Florida's future as the planet warms and sea levels rise, he should take a drive on State Road A1A along the Fort Lauderdale strip where street flooding from the Atlantic Ocean occurred off and on for weeks last year. The flooding was blamed on a confluence of high winds, a low-pressure system, Superstorm Sandy and the moon's pull. And while it's impossible to say if global warming is the cause, it is certainly true that the oceans are higher because of a warming climate, meaning more coastal flooding. The governor and the Legislature should finally acknowledge that the scientific community is right and climate change is real. \Sandy was a wake-up call for New York City and much of the Eastern Seaboard. The devastation prompted Michael Bloomberg, the independent mayor of New York City and a former Republican, to publicly endorse President Barack Obama's re-election bid. He said that climate change should be a bipartisan concern and that Republican challenger Mitt Romney had abandoned his onetime interest in the issue. \Scott should join in Bloomberg's pragmatism. Scientific studies continue to pile up evidence that we are contributing to a warming planet by polluting the air with heat-trapping gases. Sea levels have risen 8 to 10 inches in the past 100 years, and that rise is accelerating. With 2.5 million Floridians living along threatened coastline, Scott should show some of the postelection flexibility he has demonstrated on health care and embrace the science of climate change, even if it challenges Republican Party orthodoxy. \One recent study published in the journal Nature Climate Change found that by continuing on our current path of greenhouse gas pollution, the seas will rise 5 feet by the first half of the next century. That would wipe out coastal areas of Florida, submerging 94 percent of Miami Beach and 20 percent of Miami. But the study also suggests that even if we immediately and significantly cut fossil fuel pollution, the best we could do is slow the seas' rise. \That means preparation has to proceed along dual tracks. First the nation has to commit to demonstrable goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions domestically and internationally. The first international climate change agreement, the 1997 Kyoto protocol, was one the United States signed but never ratified. Second, federal, state and local planners should prepare for rising seas by building them into designs for infrastructure as well as into zoning plans. \Scott could be at the forefront of this planning process and join with Bloomberg to depoliticize the issue and adopt a long-term strategy for Florida. All he has to do is take a ride along the coast and see what is at stake for the future of the state."
165,"The news is grim. New measurements show that the climate-changing gas carbon dioxide is at the highest atmospheric concentrations - 400 parts per million - in at least 3 million years. Evolved human beings have never seen it like this. And yet a recent Gallup poll shows that only a minority of Americans - 50 percent of Democrats and 18 percent of Republicans - believe that global warming will ""pose a serious threat to them or to their way of life during their lifetime."" \With such a disconnect and so little political will, action seems impossible. But there is a way. There are many things we can do ourselves if we shift our focus from climate change to the well-established biological concept of carrying capacity. \Carrying capacity is the maximum population size that the environment can sustain indefinitely, given the food, habitat, water and other necessities available in the environment. \We'll get to the math later, but it works out that if only a minority of the population reduced their footprint by 25 percent right now, eventually increasing to half the population by 2050, it might be possible to avoid crossing a point of no return, a tipping point for the planet. That is not an unreasonable possibility. To be sure, individuals will still need to push institutions to change, but the answer, fortunately can start within ourselves. \Let's begin with an analogy. Think of a rowboat that can hold a limited number of people. Add one too many, and the boat will sink. Everyone drowns. Likewise, the planet can support a limited number of people. Add too many and its capacity to support life will collapse. \In a rowboat, it is not the number of people but their combined weight that matters. For the planet, this is the ""effective population;"" it is the number of people multiplied by their average impact that is the total burden of the human footprint on the planet. As you might guess, an American has a much bigger footprint than someone from the developing world, where population growth is fastest. \Additionally, a rowboat, when exposed to stormy weather, rocks and dips in ways it did not when the water was still. Nature is the same. When a growing population cuts down trees to clear land to grow food, the result is soil erosion decreasing the amount of food to feed the increasing number of people who are cutting down the trees. \When collapse occurs in nature, there is a ""tipping point"" in which the accelerating demands produce a rapid decline in capacity. The process is similar to the overcrowded rowboat that, with the addition of a small amount of extra weight, starts to take on water and quickly sinks. Once the tipping point is crossed, neither the boat nor nature can support life. For thousands of years this has not been an issue for the planet. It is today. \Fortunately, we can do something about it. And in surprising ways, the math works in our favor, if enough of us change our ways. If, between now and 2015, just 3 percent of the effective population would reduce their total footprint by 25 percent, and by 2020 the percent doing so doubled to 6 percent, and by 2030 double again to 12.5 percent, and by 2040 to 25 percent, and by 2050 to 50 percent, then the total footprint of the effective population would be reduced, the planet could start to recover, and the danger of crossing the tipping point would be averted. The collective effective footprint of the human population on the Earth would start to decrease at around 8 billion, even though the actual population is projected to reach 9 billion by 2050. \The impact of total distances traveled and the efficiency of transportation, the amount and sources of energy used, and what we eat and how it is produced can each be divided into subcategories, which can be further broken down to the number of gallons of gasoline, diesel and aviation fuel refined; the tons of fertilizer and pesticides used; the number of wind farms created; and the BTUs of coal and oil that must be remain in the ground. These can all be measured. They are all subject to public political control, and the policies required to regulate these events are known. \This challenge is of particular relevance to those of us living in the United States, because we are putting in jeopardy our way of life, far more so than China, which is our major competitor. \While China contributes more to carbon emissions, its population is four times larger. Per person, it is we who are the biggest offender in the world of overuse of natural resources. We have more to lose than any other nation if, collectively, the human race exceeds the carrying capacity of the planet. And it is within our power, personally and politically, to reduce our footprint and the effective size of our population - in other words, the per person load we put on the planet. \A small percentage of people making regular small contributions, and encouraging progressively more people to join with them, can have a large cumulative effect. These individual efforts are all necessary, but they alone are insufficient. Rather, they must be our daily reminder that public policy issues, such as effective mass transit to replace commuting by car, the infrastructure of alternative energy sources and national policies independent of the short-term self-interest of big agriculture, big oil and multinational corporations are also essential. Averting a crisis in our lifetimes doesn't make the Earth habitable forever. \The same new dire report on carbon dioxide offers one hopeful and helpful note. It points out that atmospheric levels will briefly dip this summer before heading back up to ever more dangerous levels. Why? Trees will leaf out and absorb carbon dioxide during photosynthesis in the Northern Hemisphere, which contains the majority of the Earth's land mass. \This temporary natural relief does not have to be seasonal. In the short term, we have direct personal control over hundreds of specific everyday actions, such as using fewer plastic water bottles, driving one less mile, eating less meat, planting a garden and eating seasonal local produce, among a long list. Every bit counts. \In the longer term, if a growing number of us change our personal ways, we will begin to build the necessary social and political awareness to shift our focus away from the abstract event of climate change to government and corporate accountability for specific and measurable policies and practices of not using more resources and producing more waste than the planet can replace or absorb in a year. \Add them up, and we can save the planet. \Edward Renner is a professor in the Honors College of the University of South Florida. He may be contacted at kerenner@usf.edu. The environmental data is from the Global Footprint Network data base: www.footprintnetwork.org. He wrote this exclusively for the Tampa Bay Times.\* * *\World population growth \For 6,000 years of recorded history the number of people on Earth increased gradually. With industrialization, modern medicine and mechanized agriculture, the number of people has risen so rapidly that we are in danger of sinking the good ship Earth with all those aboard within the lifetime of the majority of people alive today. In relative terms, a house that held four people in 1940 would be home to 13 today. The solutions are ones we have to find now; there is not time for them to be left for our children to solve. \---\The U.S.-China overshoot \This chart compares the ""carrying capacity"" (the biocapacity) of China and the United States with the ""carbon footprint"" of an average resident of each country. The United States has a higher biocapacity per capita, but it also has a far bigger average footprint. Both countries are outpacing their landmasses' capacities, but the gap is much wider for the United States. (A hectare is 2.47 acres.) \The United States has been using more resources and producing more waste longer and to a greater extent than any other nation. Other countries have been our environmental creditors. Some are becoming resentful and unwilling to continue to carry our ecological deficit. Because we share a common planet, any effective solution must be a cooperative international response. We cannot other countries to indefinitely support the size of our overshoot at the relative expense of its own population. We are in a position to lead the world in a positive direction. \---\Avoiding the Tipping Point \This chart shows the trend lines for the ""carrying capacity"" of the Earth and the globe's rising population. When the two lines cross, the planet can't support the people. A tipping point occurs when the cascading bad effects multiply and reinforce each other's damaging effects, bringing trouble faster and faster. But reducing our footprint can ""bend"" the population curve down by reducing the load each of us places on the planet, and letting the Earth heal itself can ""bend"" the carrying capacity curve upward. Changing those two trends would keep the lines from crossing. \If over the next two years, 3 percent of the population reduces its footprint by 25 percent, and the percentage of the population doing so increased to 50 percent by 2050 the effective size of the human footprint would peak at 8 billion and then begin to decline. As a result of reversing our destruction of the biocapacity of the Earth, nature can begin the recovery process, such as allowing the rain forest to regenerate new areas and reclaim grass lands to sequester nitrous oxide and support grazing. We know that when nature is allowed to heal our biocapacity will slowly start to recover.

""Only 3 percent of voters 18 to 34 don't believe that climate change is really happening.""
\
Chris Murphy on Wednesday, January 15th, 2014 in remarks at a news conference
\
* * *
\
THE RULING: TRUE
\
More than a dozen Senate Democrats called a news conference on Jan. 14, 2014, to draw attention to their efforts to curb climate change. One of those senators -- Chris Murphy, D-Conn. -- focused his remarks on the impact of public opinion on advancing an agenda on climate-change policy.
\
Murphy said that advocates for policies to address climate-change ""have to convince Republicans -- and those who would stand against the action that we're proposing -- of the electoral consequences of continuing to ignore this issue. We have to tell Republicans that if they ultimately want to stop the hemorrhaging from young voters in this country, they need to start paying attention to this issue, because only 3 percent of voters 18 to 34 don't believe that climate change is really happening.""
\
We wondered whether Murphy's polling data was sound.
\
Thanks to some previous reporting by our colleagues at PolitiFact Rhode Island, we quickly found a poll that appears to be the source for Murphy's claim. It was commissioned by the League of Conservation Voters, an environmental group, and conducted by a polling team that included one Democratic firm and one Republican firm. The poll was taken between July 8 and July 10, 2013, with 600 respondents, all of whom were registered voters between 18 and 34 who voted in the 2012 general election.
\
The poll asked, ""Which of the following best describes your view of climate change?"" Here are the responses:
\
- Climate change is a severe threat that we must start addressing now: 55 percent
\
- Climate change is an issue to address in the years ahead, but it's not urgent now: 11 percent
\
- Climate change may be happening, but it's a natural event that humans can't affect: 27 percent
\
- Climate change is not really happening: 3 percent
\
- Don't know: 3 percent
\
This appears to support Murphy's claim.
\
We should note a few quibbles.
\
- The poll was paid for by an environmental group. We always believe it's worth noting whenever someone cites a poll paid for by a group with a perspective and a stake in the issue. However, the fact that two polling firms, one from each party, were included makes the poll somewhat more credible.
\
- On a subsequent question in the same poll -- ""When, if ever, will the consequences of climate change personally affect people like you?"" -- the number answering ""never"" was 6 percent. That's higher than 3 percent, though both are small percentages in the larger scheme of things.
\
- There's one other poll that asks a similar question and finds different results. But they aren't exactly comparable.
\
The Pew Research Center -- an independent polling organization -- surveyed a national sample of 1,504 adults age 18 or older between Oct. 9 and Oct. 13, 2013. One of the questions Pew asked was: ""From what you've read and heard, is there solid evidence that the average temperature on earth has been getting warmer over the past few decades, or not?""
\
Among 18- to 29-year-olds, 73 percent said the earth is warming, and 18 percent said it was not warming -- quite a bit higher than the 3 percent from the other poll. The two polls use different age ranges, but if respondents up to age 34 were added in, that would likely increase the percentage of global-warming deniers further, since an even higher percentage of 30- to 49-year olds said there was no global warming -- 28 percent.
\
Why such divergent responses? One factor could be the precise wording of each poll. But a bigger difference is likely the pool of respondents. The LCV poll only counted answers from ""registered voters ... who voted in the 2012 general election,"" while the Pew poll simply asked ""adults."" This means the poll results aren't comparable in an apples-to-apples fashion.
\
This difference might have posed a problem for Murphy, but he was careful with how he worded his claim. He said ""3 percent of voters"" -- not ""3 percent of Americans."" So we don't find fault on these grounds.
\
""Pollsters don't ask about climate change very often,"" said Karlyn Bowman, a polling analyst at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. ""Most polls show that most people believe global warming is real. The question for policy makers is what kind of priority it should be, and here, many pollsters show it not to be very high.""
\
Our ruling
\
Murphy said, ""Only 3 percent of voters 18 to 34 don't believe that climate change is really happening."" It should be noted that Murphy cited a poll that had been paid for by an environmental group. Still, we couldn't find any poll with genuinely comparable data that clashed with Murphy's carefully worded assertion. We rate his statement True.

167,"Former lobbyist David Jolly may have spent too much time in Washington if he doesn't recognize the connection between Congress' role in setting environmental policies and campaigning in a vulnerable coastal county with rising high tides and flood concerns. Both Jolly, a Republican candidate for U.S. House District 13, and Lucas Overby, his Libertarian opponent, are refusing to acknowledge the overwhelming scientific evidence that humans have had an extensive impact on climate change and by extension, rising tides in Pinellas County and elsewhere. Theirs is an irresponsible position based on ignorance, or worse, pandering. Only Democrat Alex Sink has shown a commitment to helping turn the tide on climate change. \Jolly told the Tampa Bay Times, ""I don't think the impact that humans have had on our climate is so dramatic as it requires a significant shift in federal policy."" Overby said he was skeptical ""that we have radically altered the course of our planet."" Both are speaking pablum to a cadre of science deniers who are more interested in protecting their own ignorance or economic interests than ensuring a future for the planet. \Their comments belie decades of research, including the fifth report of the well-regarded Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued last year that went further than ever before in linking climate change to human actions: ""It is extremely likely that human influence on climate caused more than half of the observed increase in global average surface temperature from 1951 to 2010. There is high confidence that this has warmed the ocean, melted snow and ice, raised global mean sea level and changed some climate extremes in the second half of the 20th century."" \They're also ignoring research released just last week involving scientists at the University of South Florida St. Petersburg that showed high tides were exponentially rising in the Gulf of Mexico, doubling in just 20 years the risk of hurricane-induced flooding all along the coastline. \They are ignoring the very real successes of efforts such as the international 1989 Montreal Protocol that is now credited with phasing out nearly 100 ozone-damaging chlorofluorocarbons. Perhaps they also forgot it was conservative President Ronald Reagan, a victim of skin cancer, whose administration helped orchestrate the accord. \Every member of Congress should have an interest in impacting a phenomenon that has such devastating potential for Americans and their way of life. But for congressional candidates hailing from a peninsular county in a peninsular state where high tides are already rising due to climate change, it should be an automatic top priority. Jolly and Overby need to go back to their science books and learn some facts, not just talking points. And then they need to sign up to do something about it for the people they say they want to represent in Congress."

Earth ""has not warmed for the last 17 years.""
\
Patrick Moore on Tuesday, March 11th, 2014 in an interview on 'Hannity'
\
* * *
\
THE RULING: MOSTLY FALSE
\
Fox News pundit Sean Hannity set the stage for a screaming match on climate change when he invited liberal Bob Beckel of The Five to debate Patrick Moore, a former Greenpeace activist who says there is no proof man is contributing to a warming planet.
\
Beckel criticized Moore for his work as a spokesman for the nuclear energy industry and for saying carbon emissions go back into trees and food rather than the atmosphere.
\
""Come on, Patrick. You know better than that,"" Beckel said during the March 11 edition of Hannity.
\
But Moore said cries about climate change are actually just about fits of weather.
\
""Basically, they're just saying weather these days,"" Moore said. ""They're saying the weather is climate change, but that's not true. Weather is just weather, like the cold weather we're getting this year. It has not warmed for the last 17 years. We know that for sure. And that brings into question the whole hypothesis.""
\
PunditFact wanted to know if the Earth has not warmed for the last 17 years, and what it means if anything for the theory of climate change.
\
We found clues, and seeming contradictions to his claim, in the PolitiFact archive.
\
Lately it's been hot a lot
\
President Barack Obama warned the nation there will be consequences from not doing more to combat climate change in his 2013 State of the Union address, pointing out ""the 12 hottest years on record have all come in the last 15.""
\
PolitiFact rated his statement True. (Actually it's 13 or 14 of the last 15.)
\
But that doesn't necessarily rule out Moore's claim about the earth not getting warmer lately. The statements can co-exist, with some additional context.
\
Moore's claim is a popular argument of people who say climate change isn't real. The problem is it is cherry-picked and leaves out the rest of the story about earth's dramatic temperature increases over the last century.
\
NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies tracks global land-ocean temperatures using a temperature index.
\
As you can see, Earth's land-ocean temperatures escalated starting in the 1970s, setting off a new era of rising sea levels, increased greenhouse gas emissions and melting sea ice. Temperatures spiked about 17 years ago in 1998, an outlier year that involved a strong El Nino with abnormally warm ocean temperatures.
\
Since then, temperatures have remained relatively, but not entirely flat.
\
That's the basis for Moore's claim.
\
There are several problems with his analysis, however.
\
Data for 2014 isn't available yet. So really there are only 16 data points (years) between 1998 and 2014. If you include 1997 to the analysis, Moore is clearly wrong.
\
The years 2005 and 2010 were both warmer than 1998, though only slightly. That also makes Moore's statement technically inaccurate, though most scientists agree that temperatures have remained relatively flat recently.
\
Moore cherry-picked a year when temperatures spiked. ""What was an extraordinary event in 1998 is now the new normal,"" said Goddard Institute program analyst Reto Ruedy, program manager at NASA's Goddard Institute.
\
Moore would be incorrect if he chose 1999, 1997, 1996 or any year before that.
\
""If you start with an extremely warm year, the warming trend going forward is going to be mostly flat,"" said Gordon Hamilton, associate research professor at the Climate Change Institute at the University of Maine.
\
""You could easily choose 1999 and 1996 and you would find that there's an upward trend,"" said Kevin Trenberth, a distinguished senior scientist in the climate analysis section at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo. ""It's cherry-picking to get the result that he apparently desires.""
\
Moore's response
\
While Moore used the 17-year-statistic on Hannity to make the argument that climate change isn't happening, he told us the figure ""does not prove much.""
\
Moore said NOAA and NASA recordkeeping only go back 150 years and the planet's temperature has fluctuated over the course of time. It is cooler now than for ""most of life history,"" he said.
\
""It is a pause, flat, whatever you want to call it, for 17 years,"" Moore said.
\
Hamilton and Ruedy dismissed Moore's qualms, saying the 150-year record is reliable to determine statistically significant trends. For pre-19th century estimates, scientists use other methods, such as tree rings and ice core bubbles, to detect climate trends, Ruedy said.
\
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group operating under the United Nations that reviews climate change research, has concluded the warming of the climate is ""unprecedented over decades to millennia.""
\
Moore's Greenpeace ties
\
A final note about Moore. In his interview on Hannity and in many other places, Moore has been described as a ""founder"" of Greenpeace. The organization, however, disputes that.
\
Greenpeace devotes a webpage to explaining Moore's lack of credentials, though they agree he was involved in the group's early days. The group was founded in 1970 as the Don't Make a Wave Committee with the goal of stopping an American nuclear weapons test on Amchitka Island in the Aleutians. Moore, a college student, wrote a letter to the group in 1971 asking to join the crew of activists sailing to protest the nuclear test.
\
Moore was one of three Greenpeace members on board the Phyllis Cormack, which carried a dozen passengers to Amchitka Island for the protest. Greenpeace says the group's founders include seven people, but not Moore.
\
Greenpeace leaders voted Moore out of his positions as director of Greenpeace Canada and one of five directors of Greenpeace International, and Moore left in 1986, said Greenpeace spokesman David Pomerantz. He served as a consultant and co-chairman of the nuclear industry-funded Clean and Safe Energy Coalition until he retired from it in 2013.
\
Our ruling
\
Moore said the whole theory of climate change is called into question because ""it has not warmed for the last 17 years.""
\
It's true that global surface temperatures have remained relatively flat for 17 years, since 1998. However, both 2005 and 2010 were warmer than 1998.
\
Moore's statement alone ignores that the first decade of the 21st century was the warmest on record.
\
And Moore is cherry-picking a timeframe to support his argument by starting at an extremely warm year. Global surface temperatures have risen, for instance, if you started at 1999, 1996, or any year before that.
\
Moore's statement contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

169,"
In a federal report being called ""the loudest and clearest alarm bell to date"" regarding climate change, the Tampa Bay area is labeled as one of three areas in Florida particularly vulnerable to rising sea levels, with the others being Miami and Apalachicola.
\
The report, the Third National Climate Assessment, also warns of increases in harmful algae blooms off Florida's coast, worsening seasonal allergies for people already made miserable by springtime pollen and heavier rainstorms and flooding in low-lying areas, such as the storm that clobbered the Panhandle last week.
\
Unveiled Tuesday, the report, a product of five years of work by a team of 60 scientists, spells out that climate change is not something awaiting in the future - it's affecting life now.
\
Based on weather records going back to the 1800s, the period from 2001-2012 was the warmest on record globally. Summers are lasting longer across the United States, and storms are dumping more rain than ever before.
\
Meanwhile sea levels already have risen by about 8 inches since reliable record keeping began in 1880 and are projected to rise another 1 to 4 feet by 2100. That's already worsening rain-related flooding in the streets of coastal cities such as Miami.
\
The report spends no time on the political debate about whether climate change is real: ""Evidence for changes in Earth's climate can be found from the top of the atmosphere to the depths of the oceans. ... This warming has triggered many other changes to the Earth's climate. Snow and ice cover have decreased in most areas. Atmospheric water vapor is increasing in the lower atmosphere because a warmer atmosphere can hold more water. Sea level is increasing because water expands as it warms and because melting ice on land adds water to the oceans.""
\
The cause, it says flatly, is ""human activities, primarily the burning of fossil fuels.""
\
The report is ""the loudest and clearest alarm bell to date"" about the need to take action on climate change, John P. Holdren, who heads up the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, said in a Tuesday conference call with reporters. ""It's already affecting every region of the country.""
\
Unlike global reports from the United Nations' International Panel on Climate Change, this report focuses strictly on the impacts on the United States. It splits the country into eight regions and examines the impact on each, as well as discussing ways to adapt.
\
Southeastern states such as Florida, the report says, are ""especially vulnerable to sea level rise, extreme heat events and decreased water availability."" That means ""large numbers of cities, roads, railways, ports, airports, oil and gas facilities and water supplies are at low elevations and potentially vulnerable.""
\
During hurricanes and tropical storms, ""homes and infrastructure in low areas are increasingly prone to flooding,"" the report notes. ""As a result, insurance costs will increase and people will move away from vulnerable areas.""
\
Given Florida's porous limestone geology, a rising sea spells bad news for the drinking supply. Salty water pushing inland will invade the aquifer, tainting it and forcing local and state officials to find other, more expensive sources, the report says. That affects not just homeowners but also businesses and farmers.
\
An upcoming follow-up report, expected within a few months, will spell out ways local and state governments can try to cope, such as raising highways and moving hospitals and power plants inland.
\
In state parks on the coast, the signs of a rising sea are easy for scientists to spot. At Waccasassa State Park in Levy County, palm trees have been toppling over dead as rising saltwater creeps up the beach. At Rookery Bay Preserve near Naples, saltwater mangroves have invaded what used to be freshwater marshes.
\
Tidal charts in Key West, which date back to before the Civil War, have documented a rise of 9 inches in the past century. Tidal flooding that used to be a rare occurrence in Key West now happens so frequently that some businesses on the city's famed Duval Street have stockpiled sandbags for quick deployment.
\
However, Gov. Rick Scott has said he does not believe climate change is real. As a result, the state Department of Environmental Protection has no specific programs aimed at dealing with climate change. Spokeswoman Dee Ann Miller said the agency has ""various programs ... indirectly working on projects and collecting data that may be used for the purposes of studying climate change.""

170,"
This month, a new report written by a group of scientists said that climate change was not only real, but it was already affecting people in the United States, particularly in Florida, where 75 percent of all residents live near the coast.
\
Three of those Florida coastal residents are among the state's most prominent Republicans - Gov. Rick Scott, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio and former Gov. Jeb Bush. Shouldn't they be worried?
\
The day after the Third National Climate Change Assessment report came out, the New York Times said Scott would not respond to its questions about what Florida is doing about sea level rise. When a Palm Beach television station asked him about it, Scott said the state's emergency management division would handle any flooding problems - period.
\
Three years ago, Scott made his position plainer. ""I've not been convinced that there's any man-made climate change,"" he said in a 2011 interview.
\
Scott has a vested interest in how Florida fares amid the rising seas. He owns a $9.2 million mansion in Naples that sits right on the beach, a foot above sea level and about 200 feet from the water. He and his wife, Ann, bought the house for $11.5 million in 2003 when they moved to Florida from Connecticut.
\
""He's definitely in one of the most vulnerable positions,"" said Jim Beever of the Southwest Florida Regional Planning Council.
\
When a Tampa Bay Times reporter asked Scott last week whether he thinks sea level rise is a threat to his house, he replied, ""No. I'm not a scientist but I can tell you what, we're going to make sure we continue to make the right investments in the state to take care of our environment. We love living here.""
\
Despite Scott's denial, Beever said, the sea is creeping up on him already. Along that stretch of the Collier County coastline, he said, it has been rising at the rate of about 8 to 9 inches over the past century.
\
Because Florida is so flat, even a few inches of increase means water pushes a long way inland. For instance, 60 miles north of Naples, the mangroves lining the shores of Charlotte Harbor have retreated the length of a football field from where they were 50 years ago, Beever said.
\
The rising sea will lead to greater beach erosion and other problems, Beever said, but what poses the most immediate threat to Scott's home is not the slow creep of higher waves. It's the increasing reach of the storm surge that accompanies tropical storms and hurricanes.
\
On Scott's beach, he said, the water will sweep in from two directions: pushing in from the Gulf of Mexico but also swirling up the road in front of the house because ""the road is lower than the house. The road will flood before the water reaches the foundations of the houses.""
\
Beever said the storm surge threat to Scott's mansion illustrates one of his favorite sayings: ""Belief in climate change is optional, but participation is mandatory.""
\
Two other prominent Floridians who didn't return the New York Times' calls about the climate change report were Rubio and Bush, both said to be contemplating runs for the presidency.
\
Rubio subsequently told ABC News, ""I do not believe that human activity is causing these dramatic changes to our climate the way these scientists are portraying it."" He told the Miami Herald last week he believes the climate could be changing but has doubts about whether humans are causing it.
\
Bush has kept mum. The last time he said anything about climate change was in 2011, when he told Fox News that ""global warming may be real"" but ""it is not unanimous among scientists that it is disproportionately man-made.""
\
Both Rubio and Bush live in Miami, identified in the climate report as being one spot in America that's particularly vulnerable to a rising sea. A coalition of South Florida governments studying climate change has settled on 2 feet as the likely rate of sea level rise by 2050.
\
But neither man has a place on the beach like Scott. Bush lives 2 miles from the water in Coral Gables, and Rubio is 4 miles inland, in West Miami. Bush's place is 17 feet above sea level while Rubio's is 12.
\
That doesn't mean they can avoid the consequences of climate change, said Harold Wanless, who chairs the geological sciences department at the University of Miami. The sea level will affect ""our gravity-fed sewage lines, our roads and our electrical connectivity,"" Wanless said.
\
The streets in Miami Beach, which has an average elevation of 4.4 feet and some 7 miles of beaches, are already flooding more often from high tides rather than from heavy rains. Rubio should not count on those flooding woes being confined to the coast, said David Enfield, a climate scientist with the University of Miami.
\
On the western side of Miami where he lives, the water table is close to the surface and pressure from a rising ocean will push that even higher, causing frequent floods in those inland areas.
\
""If I were he, I'd be worried,"" Enfield said.
\
The worst thing, said Jim Murley of the South Florida Regional Planning Council, will be the loss of water to drink. Miami-Dade County residents get their water from the Biscayne Aquifer. The rising Atlantic will push saltwater into the aquifer and make those drinking wells unusable, he said, forcing local leaders to hunt for more expensive sources.
\
One Florida official who does not deny the existence of climate change is Sen. Bill Nelson. Last month Nelson, a Democrat, convened a special Senate hearing on climate change in Miami Beach, which he described as ""ground zero"" for impacts from human alterations to the Earth's climate.
\
While he was born in Miami, Nelson is a longtime resident of Orlando, in a house that's 17 feet above sea level and about 30 miles from the Atlantic Ocean. Sea level rise is unlikely to affect his property any time soon. Instead, according to the climate report, he has to worry about increased wildfires, less rain, longer summers and a longer allergy season.

171,"
Democratic candidate for governor Charlie Crist fueled the climate wars Friday and called Florida State University oceanography professor Jeff Chanton offering to meet with the scientists who asked to meet with Gov. Rick Scott.
\
Scott said this week that someone in his administration would meet with the 10 climate scientists from universities and colleges across the state, but after Crist agreed to meet them, the governor also agreed.
\
""I would be happy to meet with them. We have a great record on the environment and restoration projects in Florida,"" Scott said in a statement released by his campaign.
\
The state's top climate experts want to explain the research that shows the impact human-induced global warming is having on Florida.
\
Chanton delivered their letter to the governor Tuesday asking for the meeting to explain to him the impact human-induced global warming will have on Florida. The letter has prompted media attention for Chanton all week, and on Friday, after Crist's call and the governor's updated answer, he said he was ""very pleased.""
\
Crist was governor when climate change policies had become politically popular for Republicans like former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. Crist launched a series of aggressive policies aimed at targeting greenhouse gas emissions.
\
The GOP-controlled Legislature has since dismantled nearly all of those programs with the agreement of Scott, who in 2010 signaled he was in the climate change deniers camp.

"
172,"We're looking back at 10 recent fact-checks from PolitiFact and PunditFact on climate change in light of the U.N. summit in New York last week. These fact-checks cover some of the key points of the climate change debate. \1.""Climate change is a hoax."" \Earlier this year we looked at a detailed video from Louisiana congressional candidate Lenar Whitney, who repeated the assertion that climate change is a hoax. We found - as we have before - that there's an overwhelming consensus among respected scientists that human-caused global warming is real. In this fact-check, we looked at some of Whitney's supporting evidence to argue that global warming is a hoax and found that it was weak. We rated her statement Pants on Fire. \2. The United States is the leading nation in the world ""with the highest amount of doubt about the conventional wisdom of climate change."" \Talk show host Rush Limbaugh says he doesn't believe in climate change, and he gives himself the credit for convincing others of the same. Recent reports showed the United States is the leading nation in the world ""with the highest amount of doubt about the conventional wisdom of climate change,"" Limbaugh said in July. \Aside from Limbaugh's bragging, PunditFact looked at recent studies on global opinions on health care. We found that a good proportion of developing countries have higher rates of doubt than the United States. But among its peers, the United States is one of the most - if not, the most - skeptical when it comes to believing climate change has human factors. So we rated Limbaugh's statement Mostly True. \3. ""Virtually no Republican"" in Washington accepts climate change science. \California is in the forefront of regulations to address carbon emissions that are causing climate change. Gov. Jerry Brown said that's in part because Washington won't act. Brown told journalist George Stephanopolous in May that ""there's virtually no Republican who accepts the science that virtually is unanimous. ... There's just political denial for various reasons, best known to those people who are in denial."" We found few Republicans in Congress who accept the prevailing scientific conclusion that global warming is real and man-made; we named them in our fact-check, concludingBrown's qualified statement was Mostly True. \4. Cap and trade legislation ""was originally a Republican idea."" \Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz also serves as a member of Congress who represents parts of South Florida. She said in May that rising sea levels and flooding will make part of her district uninhabitable in the future, and she called for Republican support on solutions, singling out a cap and trade plan as an area where the parties could agree. \""That was originally a Republican idea. It was developed in the 1970s when the Clean Air Act was initially adopted,"" she said. \PolitiFact Florida recapped the history of cap and trade and found she was largely correct, though it's important to note that Democrats supported cap and trade at key points. We rated her statement Mostly True. \5. Surface temperatures on Earth ""have stabilized."" \Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., has repeatedly questioned the need for proposals that address climate change, but he often tries to do it without sounding anti-science. \In an interview on Fox News in May, Rubio said he never denied that the climate was changing, but he also said that ""the left loves to go around saying there is a consensus"" when there is no consensus on the sensitivity of the climate, ""which is why, despite 17 years of dramatic increases in carbon production by humans, surface temperatures (on) the Earth have stabilized."" \Rubio has a point that over roughly the past 15 years, global surface temperatures have plateaued, particularly compared to their rapid rise in previous decades. But scientists we interviewed said the evidence suggests that the pause is temporary, with temperatures poised to rise once the oceans start releasing more heat. We rated Rubio's claim Mostly False. \6. ""NASA scientists fudged the numbers to make 1998 the hottest year to overstate the extent of global warming."" \Fox News host Steve Doocy repeated something that's been all over the Internet: the claim that scientists have fixed numbers to make 1998 the hottest year. \Scientists have adjusted historical data to account for weather stations that have moved or when temperatures were recorded at different times of day. That's hardly the same thing as fudging the numbers in pursuit of a political agenda. We rated Doocy's statement Pants on Fire. \7. New carbon regulations will increase electric bills by ""$17 billion every year"" and ""potentially put an average of 224,000 more people out of work every year."" \In June, President Barack Obama unveiled tough regulations on existing power plants to curb carbon emissions in the coming decades. On his website, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said, ""The president's plan would indeed cause a surge in electricity bills - costs stand to go up $17 billion every year. But it would also shut down plants and potentially put an average of 224,000 more people out of work every year."" \Those numbers aren't correct; they were calculated for more dramatic restrictions than what the Obama administration proposed. The study's authors even said they don't apply to what the administration put forward. So we rated the statement False. \8. ""What (the Obama administration is) going to come out with in the next several months is you're not even going to be able to burn coal very limitedly in the existing plants."" \U.S. Rep. Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican running for Senate in West Virginia, released a campaign ad saying that Obama's regulations meant the end of burning coal in existing coal plants. \""The president's come out with rules that say 'no new coal-fired power plants,' "" Capito says. ""But what he's going to come out with in the next several months is you're not even going to be able to burn coal very limitedly in the existing plants."" \She was referring to plans that will force cuts to carbon emissions in some existing power plants, but those rules do not prohibit the burning of coal. Experts expect coal to remain part of the national portfolio for years to come. We rated the statement False. \9. ""Only 3 percent of voters 18 to 34 don't believe that climate change is really happening."" \Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said Republicans should come around on climate change because voters will eventually demand it. ""We have to tell Republicans that if they ultimately want to stop the hemorrhaging from young voters in this country, they need to start paying attention to this issue, because only 3 percent of voters 18 to 34 don't believe that climate change is really happening,"" he said. \The polling on this particular question is limited, but the polling that has been done supports Murphy's carefully worded statement. We rated it True. \10.""There are already more American jobs in the solar industry than in coal mining."" \U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., delivers regular Senate speeches about the dangers of climate change and authors commentary on the topic. In May, he argued that addressing climate change makes economic sense, adding, ""There are already more American jobs in the solar industry than in coal mining."" \PolitiFact Rhode Island found that the most recent data from three objective sources support his claim. We rated his statement True. \Edited for print. Read the full rulings at PolitiFact.com.\Credit: PolitiFact Editor"
173,"The agreement between the United States and China to curb carbon emissions is a historic step toward addressing the dire threats posed by climate change. The deal sends a timely message to other industrialized states as world leaders prepare to draft a broader climate pact next year, and it should inspire the clean energy industry, which has been looking for a sign that the global community is prepared to move away from its reliance on dirty fossil fuels. The agreement hinges on mutual cooperation and a heavy dose of public faith, but it's a solid starting point that should have a positive domino effect across the globe. \The deal marks the first time that China, the largest emitter of global-warming greenhouse gases, has pledged to curtail its emissions. And it marks a more aggressive stance by the United States, the world's second biggest carbon polluter, to curb emissions over the long term. China pledged to cap its growing emissions by no later than 2030, and set a goal of having clean energy sources like wind and solar power account for 20 percent of its energy mix. The Obama administration, in return, accelerated its plan to cut emissions by 2025. \Whether the cuts actually take place remains to be seen. China is a rapidly expanding industrial power looking to broaden its grip in Asia. The Republican takeover of the Senate in the midterm elections leaves Obama facing an uphill battle to enshrine these cuts into law. \But the deal could change the dynamics of the climate debate in a substantive way. Having an agreement between two nations with opposite political systems that account for 40 percent of all global greenhouse gas emissions sets a powerful example in all camps across the globe. Developing states looking to China can see that fossil fuels are not the only way to grow their economies. Western nations can follow the U.S. lead in balancing economic and environmental concerns. Having the world's two leading economies on the same page also will send a jolt of confidence to clean energy entrepreneurs who are working to make renewable sources and conservation efforts more reliable and efficient. \China still has a long lag time to comply, which gives leader Xi Jinping breathing room. Obama has shown he intends to move forward if necessary through executive action. But the deal weakens the obstructionists on both sides by removing a need for one nation to act first. Even a modest start by the two world powers and leading economies creates a momentum of its own. Both nations also are responding to growing calls domestically for more responsible energy policies - ones that promote both jobs and public health. \The agreement testifies to the value of engaged diplomacy, and on an immediate level, it opens a generous window between now and the Paris climate summit in late 2015 for more countries to follow with pledges of their own. It is no empty exercise to raise expectations."
174,"
Says. Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, once said, ""Wind is a finite resource and harnessing it would slow the winds down, which would cause the temperature to go up.""
\
- Facebook posts on Tuesday, January 13th, 2015 in a meme on social media
\
* * *
\
The Ruling: MOSTLY FALSE
\
Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, is not popular among environmentalists. A former chairman of the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee, Barton is a staunch advocate for fossil fuels and expressed skepticism about the role of manmade carbon emissions in climate change.
\
Barton's critics like to paint him as blindly supportive of Big Oil and as anti-science. Exhibit A is a series of social media memes that mock him for suggesting that wind power can actually intensify global warming.
\
The most extreme version we found said Barton had claimed that ""wind power would stop the Earth from rotating."" That's clearly not true, but it's also not clear that this claim was meant to be taken seriously. Instead, we decided to check a less outrageous -- and more common -- meme mocking Barton.
\
A reader recently sent us a meme featuring a picture of Barton alongside the quotation, ""Wind is a finite resource and harnessing it would slow the winds down which would cause the temperature to go up."" The meme's creator went on to comment, ""The only thing more stupid than this idiot heading the House-Senate energy conf(erence) is Michelle Bachmann's stint on the House 'Intelligence' Committee!"" (Michele Bachmann's name is misspelled.)
\
Ultimately, we concluded that Barton's words were significantly altered.
\
What did Barton actually say?
\
As it turns out, the comments from the meme we're checking stem from a congressional hearing held almost six years ago, on Feb. 26, 2009.
\
As part of a lengthy question-and-answer session, Barton pressed witnesses on some of the risks of shifting the nation's energy portfolio from fossil fuels to renewable sources. In one exchange, Barton referred to a paper by Jay Apt, director of the Carnegie Mellon Electricity Industry Center and a professor of technology at the Tepper School of Business. In turn, Apt's paper relied on research in an earlier paper by David W. Keith, currently a professor of applied physics and public policy at Harvard University.
\
Barton's off-the-cuff comments are somewhat meandering, but the general gist of what he said was to raise questions about some of the downsides of using wind to generate electricity.
\
""I am going to read a paragraph which is, if true, very ironic. And this is from Dr. Apt's paper, and I quote: 'Wind energy is a finite resource. At large scale, slowing down the wind by using its energy to turn turbines has environmental consequences. A group of researchers at Princeton University ... found that wind farms may change the mixing of air near the surface, drying the soil near the site. At planetary scales, David Keith, who was then at Carnegie Mellon, and coworkers found that if wind supplied 10 percent of expected global electricity demand in 2100 ... the resulting change in the earth's atmospheric energy might cause some regions of the world to experience temperature change of approximately 1 degree Centigrade.' ...
\
""Now, wind is God's way of balancing heat. Wind is the way you shift heat from areas where it is hotter to areas where it is cooler. That is what wind is. Wouldn't it be ironic if in the interest of global warming we mandated massive switches to energy, which is a finite resource, which slows the winds down, which causes the temperature to go up? Now, I am not saying that is going to happen, Mr. Chairman, but that is definitely something on the massive scale. I mean, it does make some sense. You stop something. You can't transfer that heat and the heat goes up. It is just something to think about.""
\
Reading the full text shows that the meme glossed over some important nuances, perhaps by relying on a brief summation published by Time magazine in 2010.
\
First, even though the meme used quotation marks to frame the comment as a single, unified quote, it's actually a stitched-together mix of several snippets from Barton's remarks.
\
Second, the meme ignores that when Barton said that ""wind is a finite resource,"" he was explicitly quoting Apt's paper, rather than saying that was his personal belief.
\
Third, the meme overlooks that when Barton supposedly said that harnessing the wind ""would slow the winds down, which would cause the temperature to go up,"" he was actually asking the witness a question rather than stating his view.
\
And fourth, the meme ignores that Barton said in the same exchange, ""Now, I am not saying that is going to happen, Mr. Chairman."" In other words, what he was doing was posing a scenario to be discussed further.
\
So, while Barton's comments clearly show an openness to the ideas he addressed, the meme is off-base in suggesting that Barton was stating his own opinion.
\
For the record, Barton's spokesman, Sean Brown, told PolitiFact that the congressman ""believes in an all-of-the-above energy plan that includes wind and solar power but also doesn't ignore traditional sources of energy like coal or natural gas.""
\
Is there any credibility to the idea that wind energy might contribute to global warming?
\
So Barton didn't say what the meme said he did. But what about the substance of the claim -- that wind turbines can exacerbate global warming?
\
The idea isn't entirely out of left field, but it's a lot more complicated than it seems on the surface.
\
Let's start with what was known at the time Barton made his comment six years ago. The paper ultimately referenced by Barton -- the one that Keith coauthored -- found some intriguing interactions between wind turbines and climate, namely that ""very large amounts of wind power"" can produce changes to climate ""at continental scales.""
\
However, the authors leavened this assessment with a more optimistic note -- that such changes in climate disappear at the global level, and that, on balance, using wind power rather than fossil fuels reduces climate change, rather than exacerbating it.
\
Keith, who didn't respond to an inquiry from PolitiFact, and his coauthors also emphasized that what negative impacts emerged from wind-turbine use could be eased, fairly economically, by better turbine design and placement.
\
Subsequent research has bolstered this conclusion.
\
A 2012 study that used satellite data for west-central Texas, published in Nature Climate Change and co-authored by Liming Zhou of the State University of New York at Albany, found a ""significant warming trend"" of up to 1.3 degrees Fahrenheit per decade over wind farms, compared to nearby regions that didn't have wind farms. However, Zhou told the Daily Telegraph that the climatic changes from wind farms paled when compared to the impact of manmade global warming.
\
And Mark Z. Jacobson, a Stanford University professor of civil and environmental engineering, told PolitiFact that a 2012 paper he coauthored found that the impact of large arrays of wind turbines would be to cool climate -- not warm it. ""That paper is the most detailed to date,"" Jacobson said.
\
Jacobson agreed that even installing enough wind-power capacity to power ""half the world"" would have ""small"" global impacts on climate, even though the impacts locally could be more significant. If you weigh the negatives of wind power against the negatives of fossil-fuel use, he added, ""there is only a net benefit of switching to wind.""
\
Our ruling
\
A social media meme says Barton once said, ""Wind is a finite resource and harnessing it would slow the winds down which would cause the temperature to go up.""
\
Barton raised that possibility while questioning a witness during a 2009 congressional hearing, but contrary to the meme's implication, he did not say that it was his personal belief. Rather, the meme makes fun of Barton by stitching together parts of his comments in a way that is misleading.
\
The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.

175,"Contrary to popular misconception, especially in Tallahassee, Rick Scott isn't really the governor of Florida. He is, in fact, one of Monty Python's addled Knights Who Say ""Ni!"" \Really now, don't you suspect that if the first floor of the Governor's Mansion was 2 feet under water due to climate change, Scott still would be holding his hands over his ears while chanting ""Wawawawawawawa,"" all the while insisting the flooding was the result of a heavy dew? \How else to explain recent revelations that upon Scott assuming the governorship, employees at the Department of Environmental Protection were ordered never to mention the science that dare not speak its name. \Or more simply, the very state agency charged with protecting and nurturing the environment was barred from using terms reflecting the greatest threat to Florida's environment: ""climate change,"" ""global warming,"" ""sustainability"" and ""sea level rise."" Scott might just as well have tossed in ""reality,"" ""willful ignorance"" and ""Luddite."" \Banning DEP employees from using the vernacular of their jobs would be akin to Attorney General Pam Bondi excising the word ""crime"" in the workplace, or Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam decreeing that henceforth no one would be allowed to whisper ""citrus greening."" \Of course, as Tristram Korten of the Florida Center for Investigative Reporting discovered, you will not find any written official order barring the expression of climate change at the DEP, since that would have required printing the censored language. Pillars of salt to follow. \But Korten found no shortage of former DEP employees engaged in the science of protecting the environment who confirmed they had been verbally ordered by Scott's office to delete any references to climate change from their work product. \Things got so loopy that DEP agency employees were instructed to replace the phrase ""sea level rise"" with ""nuisance flooding."" \Now you might well expect this sort of dictatorial edict-making to occur in places like Turkmenistan, which was once ruled by Saparmurat Niyzov, who ordered the months of the year to be renamed after his family and outlawed lip-synching. \But this is Florida, the third-largest state with a university system that aspires to become a world-class leader in scientific research, being presided over by Scott, R-Bring Me A Shrubbery, a denier of an overwhelming number of peer-reviewed studies concluding (Shush!) is very, very real. \Days ago, Scott emerged from his Cone of Babel to deny he had attempted to muzzle DEP employees from speaking English. Ah - a conflict. \So whom do you believe? Former DEP professionals who claim the Scott administration undermined their scientific work, or a governor with a lengthy rap sheet of dissembling, fibbing and obfuscation who wouldn't give you a straight answer if you asked him where did Abraham Lincoln deliver the Gettysburg Address? \Scott delivered his Hummana-hummana-hummana response to the DEP flap while visiting Hialeah, which was the first time reporters had a chance to ask him questions since he ducked out a back door rather than respond to scribblers after his State of the State address last week before the start of the legislative session. Good grief, this guy spends more time on the run than The Fugitive's Richard Kimble. \Once again the artful dodger refused to say whether he believes if global warming is real, accepts mankind's contribution to the problem, or outline what the DEP is doing to combat its impact on a vulnerable peninsula. \Just what Scott hoped to accomplish by suppressing state employees charged with safeguarding the environment from merely using factual language to describe the climate challenges confronting Florida isn't entirely clear - or rational. \Perhaps it was merely a ham-handed, sloppy air-kiss sop to Scott's tea party acolytes, who somehow have accomplished the Gordian knot delusion that objective, empirically scientifically validated climate change is linked to dreaded liberal ideology. Man-made climate change = socialism? \You could probably make a modest argument that the body politic doesn't demand all that much literacy from their elected officials. Expecting the governor to acknowledge established science and avoid banning the state agency mandated to protect the environment from using accepted terms is a low bar to clear. \But this is Florida, a state at great risk from the chilling side effects of semantic chicanery.\- druth@tampabay.com"
176,"Gov. Rick Scott's chief of emergency management testified Thursday before the Legislature and had a half dozen chances to use the term ""climate change."" \But Bryan Koon would not say the C words. \Scott has denied news reports that Department of Environmental Protection employees were barred from using the terms ""climate change,"" ""global warming"" and ""sustainability,"" but he has declined to discuss the subject in detail. \In a televised hearing before a Senate budget subcommittee, Koon was talking about his agency's request for federal funds to improve emergency life safety notifications for residents and visitors in advance of floods, tornadoes and hurricanes in Florida. Sen. Jeff Clemens, D-Lake Worth, asked Koon if it's true that states need to have ""climate change plans"" to qualify for that federal money. \Yes, Koon replied, referring to ""language to that effect."" \""I used 'climate change,'"" Clemens said, ""but I'm suggesting that maybe as a state we use the term 'atmospheric re-employment.' That might be something that the governor could get behind."" \Senators roared with laughter, and the chairman, Sen. Jack Latvala, R-Clearwater, almost literally fell out of his chair. \Koon said Clemens was right and the state's next hurricane mitigation plan, due in 2018, must include ""language discussing that issue."" \""What issue is that?"" Clemens asked. \""The issue you mentioned earlier,"" Koon replied.\Credit: TIMES/HERALD TALLAHASSEE BUREAU"
177,"An alarming new report puts the impact of climate change in the stark terms that many skeptics might appreciate. By midcentury, the study found, tens of billions of dollars worth of property could be below sea level, while rising temperatures could devastate agricultural crops and spawn heat waves that force workers indoors and put the poor, sick and elderly at risk of medical emergencies. These findings should be a wake-up call to Gov. Rick Scott and other Florida leaders to change direction and shore up the state's defenses. \The report by a bipartisan group of leaders in politics and business, including former U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz and former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, seeks for the first time to quantify the financial impact of climate change across every region of the country. Its purpose is to try to bridge the partisan debate over global warming by framing in clear financial terms the risks of inaction to property, industry and public health. \In the short term, the report estimates, higher sea levels caused by warming likely will increase the annual cost of storms along the East Coast and the Gulf of Mexico by up to $3.5 billion. Crop yields in the South and Midwest could drop 10 percent, while new demands for cooling systems could cost homeowners and businesses up to an additional $12 billion per year. \By midcentury, between $66 billion and $106 billion worth of property will likely be below sea level nationwide, a figure that rises to a half-trillion dollars by the end of the century. The Southeast would be one of the hardest-hit regions; some parts would be so ""unbearably hot"" that workers would be forced indoors, cutting productivity, while some homes threatened by rising seas ""could quite literally be under water"" before their 30-year mortgages are paid. \In Florida, rising seas that breach the porous limestone could put up to $23 billion worth of property underwater by 2050, the report estimated, a figure that grows to $208 billion by the end of the century. And the heavily urbanized Tampa Bay area would suffer some of the highest summer temperatures in the Southeast, putting more people at risk of heat-related deaths. \These findings by a group of longtime leaders from both major political parties, including former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Donna Shalala, a former U.S. Health and Human Services secretary, should force state and local governments to show more urgency in addressing climate-related impacts, from working to curb development along the coasts and protecting wetlands to developing cleaner energy sources and hardening public works. \Floridians should insist that the governor, who has long questioned whether climate change is real, start investing the financial resources that communities and homeowners need to deal with rising seas in a low-lying coastal state. Scott may not want to hear it, but he has a responsibility as governor to put lives and property over his obsession with partisan appeals to climate change skeptics."
178,"President Barack Obama hiked up a melting Alaskan glacier on Tuesday as part of a weeklong trip to surmount an arguably more difficult task: getting the world to act climate change.\""The fact is that climate is changing faster than our efforts to address it,"" Obama said in a speech on Sept. 1. ""We're not acting fast enough.""\But some environmentalists are saying the visit is contradictory, if not downright hypocritical. After all, less than a month ago, Obama gave Shell the okay to drill for oil on Alaska's coast.\Progressive activist group Credo Action annotated a White House video promoting the Alaska trip. In its video, Credo says the Obama administration is ""proposing to mine another 10 billion tons of Wyoming coal, which would unleash three times more carbon pollution than Obama's Clean Power Plan would even save through 2030.""\We rated the claim Mostly False. A Credo spokesperson said its source is a 2015 report by Greenpeace, another environmental activist group.\Burning 10 billion tons of coal over would unleash more carbon pollution than the federal clean energy regulations expect to save over the next 15 years.\However, there is no plan to mine for 10 billion new tons of coal. Greenpeace -- and others who have quoted this figure -- are distorting a single line buried in a 3,000-page report. The figure refers to an estimate -- developed solely for analysis -- of the maximum amount of coal that could be available for mining in a particular region of Wyoming over the next 20 years.\In his speech, Obama also slammed ""the critics and the cynics and the deniers"" of climate change, saying, ""Those who want to ignore the science, they are increasingly alone. They're on their own shrinking island.""\Republican presidential hopeful Rick Santorum, who has repeatedly called climate change ""a hoax,"" would beg to differ. In a Aug. 28 appearance on HBO's Real Time with Bill Maher, Santorum argued he's not alone.\""The most recent survey of climate scientists said about 57 percent don't agree with the idea that 95 percent of the change in the climate is caused by CO2,"" he said.\""Rick, I don't know what ass you're pulling that out of,"" Maher retorted.\Santorum's numbers are not made up, but his claim commits ""two orders of mischaracterization,"" an expert said. He uses a blog's flawed analysis of a survey (and misquotes what it's allegedly disapproving). The survey actually supports the idea of scientific consensus on climate change, its lead author told us. We rated his claim False.\Santorum's other claim on scientific consensus also received a False rating. He said the claim that 97 percent of scientists believe climate change is man-made - a figure cited by Obama - was debunked by the ""head"" of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\""The head of the UN IPC (sic) said that number was pulled out of thin air. It was based on a survey of 77 scientists,"" he said. ""Not even 97 scientists responded to that survey.""\The claim confuses several points. First, the critic of the figure he's referring to isn't the ""head"" of the IPCC, but an economist who worked on the IPCC's fifth report.\Second, the 97 percent doesn't come from one specific survey - it appears in at least three. And finally, the study Santorum describes isn't the one the economist objects to.The economist takes issue with with the methodology of a different survey of over 1,300 climate change studies, but he says he has ""very little reason to doubt that the consensus is indeed correct.""\* * *\About this article\Researchers: Lauren Carroll, Linda Qiu\Names in this article: Bill Maher, Barack Obama, Rick Santorum\Credit: TAMPA BAY TIMES"
179,"Climate change is real, and its effect on hurricanes - their frequency and their severity - is no longer a distant concern but one that Tampa Bay must face now. This is bad news for a region whose drainage and sewage systems have been overwhelmed this summer by heavy rains. Just imagine what would happen during even a low-level hurricane. \Several new serious scientific studies point out what's coming, from rising oceans to worsening hurricanes. Now is the time to force politicians to face reality, to reduce carbon pollution and to prepare the Tampa Bay area - its coasts, its sea walls and its infrastructure - for seas that will rise and storms that will worsen. \Gov. Rick Scott, whose mansion in Naples is 1 foot above sea level (for now), should be leading on this issue, not pretending it doesn't exist. And the Florida congressional delegation, never mind most of the presidential candidates, are proposing little to nothing to lessen the impact of climate change and serious storms. \MIT and Princeton researchers published a paper this week that combined hurricane computer models with solid science on climate change and ran thousands of simulations. Tampa was one of three cities across the globe that was studied. And the news from thousands of computer simulations is bad. The researchers looked for so-called ""gray swan"" events, worst-case scenarios that are quite uncommon but will happen once in a long while. \The study found that Tampa's chances of such a rare but severely catastrophic storm will increase by three to far more than 10 times this century because of climate change. Such a hurricane would bring a storm surge of 20 feet and in one case, 36 feet. Their study didn't even account for any effects from sea level rise. \No one can adequately prepare in advance for a storm surge of 36 feet. But you can hope to prevent it. And that's why action on the climate - think carbon tax, think serious focus on renewable energy sources - is important. The simulations also included destructive but not worst-case hurricanes that aren't nearly so rare. It found that storms with 10 feet of storm surge - roughly akin to the 1921 hurricane that hit Tampa Bay - are 100-year events, and even a slight change in the model could make it a 60-year event. \NASA has looked at sea level rise, just releasing several satellite observations spanning the past quarter-century. The data show that the oceans have risen 2.5 inches on average and up to 9 inches in places - more than expected. As the oceans warm and the ice shelves melt into the sea, the problem will only accelerate. \Combine these and other studies based on actual science and statistics, not Googling and cherry-picking ""sources,"" and reasonable people are left with a load of worry. It's time for our leaders to get nervous, too, and to act now with an eye toward the long-term future of Florida."

Says ""the cascading effects"" of climate change contributed to the rise of ISIS.
\
- Martin O'Malley on Thursday, September 10th, 2015 in interview with Democracy Now!
\
* * *
\
THE RULING: MOSTLY TRUE
\
""Absurd,"" ""embarrassing,"" and ""brazenly silly"" were some of the insults hurled at Democratic presidential candidate Martin O'Malley when he suggested in July that climate change contributed to the rise of ISIS. Despite the derision, the former governor of Maryland continues to stand by his talking point.
\
""One of the things that preceded the failure of the nation-state of Syria and the rise of ISIS was the effect of climate change and the mega-drought that affected that region, wiped out farmers, drove people to cities, created a humanitarian crisis,"" O'Malley told Bloomberg TV on July 20.
\
Two months later, O'Malley repeated his argument in an interview with the progressive radio show Democracy Now! on Sept. 10: ""Their government could not take care of the basic needs of families in those conditions. Civil war rose up as a result of protest and repression ... then the vacuum to that led to ISIS. So these are the cascading effects that happen in a world that's very, very connected and in a world where climate change is now creating extreme weather conditions, prolonged droughts.""
\
With recent events -- the pope's visit highlighting climate change and the United States' decision to accept more Syrian refugees -- converging on the topic, we were curious if O'Malley's claim really was ""absurd.""
\
O'Malley's source
\
A spokesperson for the O'Malley campaign told us that his source was a March 2015 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The study, which was well received in its field, does not mention ISIS at all, but its authors told us O'Malley's extrapolation makes sense.
\
The study found evidence that climate change led to an extreme drought in Syria's breadbasket between 2006 to 2009. Food prices skyrocketed, nutrition-related diseases became widespread, and 1.5 million internal refugees abandoned their farms and flooded into Syrian cities already crowded with 1.5 million Iraqi refugees displaced by the Iraq war, according to the study.
\
This influx of people exacerbated existing problems like unemployment, corruption and brewing discontent with the regime of Bashar al-Assad, which failed to respond to the situation, according to the study. In 2011, the unrest reached boiling point and erupted into the Syrian uprising.
\
If we follow the sequence of events like O'Malley does, it's reasonable to say the next fallen domino is the rise of ISIS.
\
""Once the war had begun all sorts of pre-existing actors took advantage of the situation to pursue their goals -- ISIS was one and the collapse of Syria provided fertile ground for their actions,"" said co-author Richard Seager, a professor of climatology at Columbia University.
\
O'Malley's campaign also forwarded us many reports and comments from the Department of Defense linking climate change and ISIS. We should also note that the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences study is not the first rigorous, academic investigation into the links between climate change and conflict (there's at least one other on the Syrian conflict alone).
\
Drought's not the sole culprit
\
In the grander scheme of things, experts say, the drought was just one of many sparks that set the Syrian powder keg ablaze. But both the study and O'Malley acknowledge that and get credit for not overstating climate change's impact.
\
While climate change may have played an indirect role in the Syrian uprising and ISIS' rise, other causes - Assad's recruitment of al-Qaeda members, the genocide against Sunni Arabs, etc.- are direct and ""crystal clear,"" according to Ali Khedery, a former special assistant to five American ambassadors in Iraq.
\
Michael Doran, a senior fellow on Middle East security issues at the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank, pointed out that unrest in region is not confined to areas suffering from drought. He, however, said that O'Malley's correct that the drought played a role in generating disaffection.
\
""The drought did not cause the Syrian revolution or the fall of Assad,"" said Kenneth Pollack, a senior fellow on Middle East policy at the Brookings Institution. ""A very complex mix of factors did that, but the study suggests that climate change was part of that mix even if we can't tell how important it was.""
\
The study, which Pollack said is garnering a lot of attention among Middle East experts, notes that there is no single cause for conflict, while O'Malley emphasized the ""cascading effects"" of the drought, rather than the drought itself.
\
""It's fair to say the uprising was going to happen at some point. But the drought did happen when it happened and based on the timing of it, the agricultural collapse and the migration were direct results,"" said study lead author Colin Kelley, a climatologist at the University of California at Santa Barbara. ""The drought creating this chaotic situation also created better opportunity for ISIS to thrive. If you say that in the way (O'Malley) said, it's fair to argue.""
\
Our ruling
\
O'Malley argued that ""the cascading effects"" of climate change contributed to the rise of ISIS
\
The O'Malley campaign referred us to a credible March 2015 study that supports his point. According to the study, a drought in Syria in the 2000s displaced millions of refugees and added to discontent that eventually erupted into war. While the study does not mention ISIS by name, the authors say O'Malley is simply taking their argument one step further.
\
Experts agreed that the drought, spurred by climate change, was one of many factors that led to the Syrian conflict. O'Malley's phrasing suggests he understands this and is careful not the overstate it.
\
We rate his claim Mostly True.

""Our community (Tampa Bay) is one of the 10 most threatened by the sea level rise in the world."" - Sierra Club on Monday, February 22nd, 2016 in a letter from Tampa Bay Group chairman Kent Bailey to Hillsborough County commissioners* * *The Ruling: MOSTLY TRUEThe head of Tampa Bay's Sierra Club chapter warned the Hillsborough County Commission that building more roads will only make global warming's consequences worse for the entire region.Chapter chairman Kent Bailey told commissioners in a Feb. 22, 2016, letter that the Sierra Club would not be supporting a proposed half-cent transportation sales tax referendum known as Go Hillsborough.Bailey said the measure doesn't set aside enough money to pay for expanding mass transit. He argued that adding more roads and more cars to an already congested system will only make matters worse by increasing carbon pollution.""Our community is one of the 10 most threatened by the sea level rise in the world,"" Bailey wrote. He added that the Tampa Bay area will be among the first to suffer from flooding caused by climate change.There's no doubt the oceans are rising, and Tampa Bay will feel the effects. But is the region among the most endangered in the world? Let's just say that we found the bay area has a lot to lose.---Flooding vs. sea level riseThere are a bunch of ways to measure how climate change will affect the world's cities. People will be displaced, economies will be ruined, or you may end up with not enough water (or too much). These are all issues Tampa Bay faces, so buckle up.When we asked Bailey how he came up with his ranking, he said he was referring to potential property losses, mostly in terms of real estate.""We can move our people. But our fixed assets are a different story,"" he said.He cited several sources, including a report from global-warming researchers Climate Central, and a Scientific American article that said St. Petersburg was in particular danger from sea level rise. He also pointed to a 2008 paper from the international Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The study focused on the effects of climate extremes on port cities - particularly storm surge.Coastal flooding is different than sea level rise, but experts told us Bailey is using a fair benchmark for comparison. Vulnerability to storm surge and sea level rise often are conflated in discussions on climate change, they said.""They are related, but not exactly the same,"" said Ben Strauss, vice president for sea level and climate impacts at Climate Central. In general, sea level rise can make a big impact on flooding, and will assuredly make storm surges and flooding worse in the future.David Hastings, a marine science professor at Eckerd College in St. Petersburg, said storm surges are especially dangerous in Tampa and St. Petersburg because of the relatively shallow offshore shelf in the Gulf of Mexico. Higher sea levels will make surges even more dangerous.But back to the OECD study: Economists examined 136 port cities and found that Tampa and St. Petersburg together were among the 10 cities with the most property at risk to wind damage and coastal flooding from storm surge. And that's for right now, let alone after sea levels increase.""The top 10 cities in terms of assets exposed are Miami, Greater New York, New Orleans, Osaka-Kobe, Tokyo, Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Nagoya, Tampa-St. Petersburg and Virginia Beach,"" the paper read. Those rankings could get better if steps were taken to mitigate flooding, the study said. But they could also get worse, as cities grow and gain more people. The effects of subsidence (the physical earth below the city changing or sinking, which is a major issue in Tampa Bay) and the changing climate could magnify the risk, too.Many of the same economists revisited the rankings in a 2013 study published in the journal Nature Climate Change. Tampa-St. Petersburg came in as the seventh-most at risk of flooding.If you're looking for a price tag for how much Tampa Bay stands to lose, the OECD has one: In a catastrophic, once-in-100-years flood, losses to the region currently could be $49.6 billion.University of South Florida oceanography professor Gary Mitchum noted real estate losses are only part of the story. As the oceans rise permanently, the region's tourism-based economy will suffer extensively. Many people who can afford to simply move away probably will, but low-wage workers dependent on disappearing service industry jobs will be stuck.Of course, the region's property loss ranking may change some as population, planning and even geography shift. But these are from economists, considering economic impact. If we examined this another way - say, how many people will be permanently displaced by the eventual coastal floods that won't recede - other places will have it much worse than Tampa Bay.Even the OECD researchers said their rankings would be different by that measure. Cities in China and southeast Asian countries, like Bangladesh and Vietnam, will be much more affected that way. It's much harder to quantify how the human toll will affect regions because you can't easily attach a dollar amount to it.""The social impact of this is much more complicated,"" Mitchum said. ""The result that you get depends on how you assess it.""---Our rulingSierra Club's Bailey said, ""Our community (Tampa Bay) is one of the 10 most threatened by the sea level rise in the world.""He cited credible research that showed the region is among the most at risk of property damage from coastal flooding. He's conflating that research with the effects of sea level rise, but several experts told us the problems are related.It's striking that Tampa Bay is already in great danger when it comes to potential property loss, but Bailey should have been more specific. There are other ways to measure the consequences of rising oceans beyond real estate. When we consider some of these factors, other major cities could be considered worse off than Tampa Bay.The statement is accurate but needs clarification. We rate it Mostly True.* * *About this statement:Published: Friday, February 26th, 2016 at 2:24 p.m.Researched by: Joshua GillinEdited by: Katie SandersSubjects: Climate Change, TransportationSources:Kent Bailey, Letter from Tampa Bay Sierra Club to Hillsborough County commissioners, Feb. 22, 2016Tampa Bay Times Bay Buzz blog, ""Sierra Club to Commissioners: Go Hillsborough needs more transit funding,"" Feb. 22, 2016OECD iLibrary, ""Ranking Port Cities with High Exposure and Vulnerability to Climate Extremes,"" November 2008OECD iLibrary, ""Ranking Port Cities with High Exposure and Vulnerability to Climate Extremes abstract,"" November 2008Scientific American, ""Scientists Seek Strategy to Convey Seriousness of Sea-Level Rise,"" Sept. 10, 2012WUSF, ""Rising Sea Levels: How Much of Tampa Bay Would Be Under Water?,"" Jan. 22, 2013Climate Central, ""Cities Below Future Seas,"" July 29, 2013247WallSt.com, ""Seven Cities at Risk of Rising Seas,"" Aug. 12, 2013Globe and Mail, ""Vancouver near top of list of cities threatened by rising sea levels,"" Aug. 20, 2013Nature Climate Change, ""Future flood losses in major coastal cities,"" September 2013Nature Climate Change, ""Future flood losses in major coastal cities abstract,"" September 2013Tampa Bay Times, ""Impact of climate change on Florida economy could be huge,"" May 7, 2014Florida Water and Climate Alliance, ""Seeing Beyond Sea Level Rise: Visualizing Local Climate Change in Tampa Bay,"" November 2014Tampa Bay Times, ""'Climate change' ban boosts Florida's image as the Punchline State,"" March 12, 2015Karen Clark & Co., ""Most Vulnerable US Cities to Storm Surge Flooding,"" August 2015Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, ""Carbon choices determine US cities committed to futures below sea level,"" Sept. 18, 2015Statista.com, ""The cities most threatened by rising sea levels,"" Nov. 23, 2015Washington Post, ""Seas are now rising faster than they have in 2,800 years, scientists say,"" Feb. 22, 2016Climate Central, ""The Human Fingerprints on Coastal Floods,"" Feb. 22, 2016Mashable.com, ""The American cities most threatened by rising sea levels,"" Oct. 12, 2015Washington Post (via Tampa Bay Times), ""This is how rising sea levels will reshape the face of the Tampa Bay area,"" Oct. 14, 2015Interview with David Hastings, Eckerd College marine science professor, Feb. 22-23, 2016Interview with Gary Mitchum, University of South Florida oceanography professor, Feb. 22-23, 2016Interview with Ben Strauss, Climate Central vice president for sea level and climate impacts, Feb. 22-23, 2016Interview with Maya Burke, Tampa Bay Regional Planning Council senior environmental planner, Feb. 22, 2016Interview with Nicholas Keyes, World Bank group spokesman, Feb. 23, 2016Interview with Kent Bailey, Tampa Bay Group Sierra Club chairman, Feb. 23-24, 2016Interview with Robert Nicholls, University of Southampton coastal engineering professor, Feb. 26, 2016

182,"""There is not a single candidate in the Republican primary that thinks we should do anything about climate change."" - Barack Obama on Tuesday, February 16th, 2016 in a press conference* * *The Ruling: MOSTLY TRUEForeign leaders are ""troubled"" by some of the rhetoric coming out of the Republican presidential primary, and it's not just what they're hearing from Donald Trump, says President Barack Obama.""But this is not just Mr. Trump. Look at the statements that are being made by the other candidates,"" Obama said at a Feb. 16 news conference. ""There is not a single candidate in the Republican primary that thinks we should do anything about climate change, that thinks it's serious. Well, that's a problem. The rest of the world looks at that and says, how can that be?""Obama's statement sounded similar to a take from Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, who recently said, ""Not one Republican has the guts to recognize that climate change is real."" We rated that claim False because a couple GOP presidential candidates (including some who are no longer in the running) have acknowledged its existence.Obama's claim is different: He said none of the Republicans thinks the country should do anything about climate change.To different degrees, the remaining candidates don't believe man-made climate change is happening, or at least not to the extent that Obama and a vast majority of climate scientists believe it's happening.All of the Republican candidates - Donald Trump, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, John Kasich and Ben Carson - call for scaling back environmental and energy regulations. Some support going through the private sector for renewable energy source development, alongside continued development of fossil fuels, and environmental protection.But none have a fleshed-out plan to specifically address the issue of climate change.Here's where the remaining Republican presidential candidates stand on climate change and what they propose to do (or not do) about it.---Donald TrumpTrump has said repeatedly that he does not believe in climate change, even suggesting it's a conspiracy invented by China to make the United States less competitive.His website doesn't have any information on his plans to combat climate change or how he would approach energy issues. He has said he would abolish the Environmental Protection Agency, and the environment will be ""fine.""When MSNBC's Joe Scarborough asked Trump in November what he would do about climate change, Trump did not outline a specific plan, but he said, ""We want to have clean air to breathe and we want to have beautiful clean water. That's very important to me.""---Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.Rubio believes the climate is changing, but he questions how much of it is man-made.""The climate has always changed,"" Rubio said in January. ""There's never been a time when the climate has not been changing.""He has criticized international climate efforts, as well as Obama's regulatory measures, saying they are more damaging to the economy than they are helpful to the environment.""If you're overly dependent on any one source of fuel, then you become vulnerable to disruption,"" he said at the same event in January. ""I want America to truly have a truly all-of-the-above strategy.""Rubio has not released a plan to quell the effects of climate change.---Sen. Ted Cruz, R-TexasCruz believes man-made climate change is not real. He has called it a ""pseudoscientific theory"" and has criticized Obama for calling it a major security threat.His website says he would abolish the Energy Department and eliminate at least 10 existing climate change and environmental programs.Like Rubio, he calls for an ""all-of-the-above"" approach to energy, meaning he supports development of fossil fuels as well as renewable resources, which he says amounts to an ""energy renaissance.""""We must harness our nation's energy resources and remove federal impediments to energy exploration, development and trade,"" he wrote.---Ben CarsonCarson does not believe in man-made climate change. He has said it's part of a natural cycle and cannot be ""an excuse not to develop our own God-given natural resources.""His energy plan calls for reducing government regulations on energy production, including fossil fuels that contribute to climate change, but also developing renewable fuels. He also calls on people to be stewards of the environment, but not at the expense of jobs and the economy.He did tell Time in October 2015 that if there is ""clear-cut evidence"" that a certain manufacturing practice is causing significant harm to the environment, President Carson might take some action.""I would use the EPA to work with business industry and academia to find the cleanest, most environmentally friendly way to do things, rather than just all right, we're coming in here and we're shutting you down,"" he said.---Ohio Gov. John KasichAs recently as Feb. 29, Kasich has said he believes there is a climate change problem, acknowledging he is going against the grain of his party.But he has not proposed a full-fledged strategy to address it, and his fact sheet on energy does not mention climate change. He has, though called for pursuing renewable energy sources as one possible response.In August, he questioned the extent of man's impact on the environment, calling full-blown climate change ""some theory that is not proven."" He said he wouldn't want to destroy any jobs in order to address these concerns.---Former Florida Gov. Jeb BushBush has dropped out of the race, but we're including him because he was still in the running when Obama made his statement.He believes climate change is real and human activity is a contributing factor. He had an energy plan but not a specific environmental protection plan.He has argued that some of the Obama administration's regulations go too far, such as Obama's Clean Power Plan. Like most of the other Republican candidates, he called for reducing regulations and increasing growth in the energy sector, both fossil fuel and renewable sources.""Energy resources must be developed in a way that protects human health and the environment,"" his energy plan said. ""Rules play an important role in making sure this is the case. But the Obama administration's excessive rules too often usurp state and tribal authority and go beyond what is necessary.""---Our rulingObama said, ""There is not a single candidate in the Republican primary that thinks we should do anything about climate change.""None of the remaining Republican presidential candidates have laid out a specific plan to address climate change. All of them call for scaling back Obama's environmental regulations, to boot.Some have called for private-sector development of renewable energy sources. Bush, who was in the race when Obama made his comment, and Kasich both have said they believe human-caused climate change is real and have said pursuing these alternative energy sources could mitigate the problem. But neither has outlined a specific plan.For some Republican voters, this stance might be a plus. But it doesn't change the veracity of Obama's statement.We rate it Mostly True.* * *About this statement:Published: Tuesday, March 1st, 2016 at 1:43 p.m.Researched by: Lauren Carroll, C.

183,"Ecology and spirituality do not conflict, they coincide, according to theologian Matthew Fox. On May 13 and 14 Fox, author of 32 books, will appear at the Metropolitan Community Church of Tampa to discuss the relationship between God and Earth. Referencing works of sages, including 13th century mystic Meister Eckhart and 20th century Catholic Thomas Merton, Fox will address current topics such as climate change. Spiritual leaders must recognize how man's actions affect the planet, then work together to ensure a better future, said Fox, 75. ""Religious and spiritual people need to get on board here,"" Fox said. ""There's been this psychologizing of religion, what Pope Francis calls the narcissism or our species. Really we are in a relationship with the Earth and the other creatures. This is the bigger picture. You can have your psyche perfectly in order but if you don't have water to drink or cook with, well, that's a problem."" At the Tampa event, presented by the Bridge, a nonprofit organization, Fox will draw from his latest book A Way to God: Thomas Merton's Creation Spirituality Journey. The book analyzes the life and work of Merton, a pioneering Catholic monk whose writings called for contemplation and action within religious life. Merton, who died in 1968, encouraged the faithful to mind their place within creation and was a proponent of interfaith relations. Fox, who served the Dominican order for 34 years before becoming an Episcopal priest, recognizes wisdom in such voices from the past. ""There have been a lot of prophets who spoke about these issues before today's headlines,"" Fox said. Fox teaches that positive action beneficial to others, the world and nature itself offers inner peace. ""We are too busy fighting wars and imaginary wars,"" he said. ""But if we could direct some of that energy to good works, it would be much more satisfying for everyone.""

184,"""I believe we should have tax on carbon and deal aggressively with climate change. That is not (Hillary Clinton's) position."" - Bernie Sanders on Sunday, May 29th, 2016 in an interview on ""Meet the Press""* * *The Ruling: MOSTLY TRUEBernie Sanders still doesn't want to talk about Hillary Clinton's damn emails.Asked for his reaction to the State Department report of Clinton's use of a private email server, Sanders told Meet the Press' Chuck Todd that he'd rather talk policy differences.""Our campaign is about defeating Secretary Clinton on the real issues,"" he responded. ""I want to break up the Wall Street banks. She doesn't. I want to raise the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour. She wants $12 an hour. I voted against the war in Iraq. She voted for the war in Iraq. I believe we should ban fracking. She does not. I believe we should have tax on carbon and deal aggressively with climate change. That is not her position. Those are some of the issues that I am campaigning on.""Sanders is right about Clinton's Iraq war vote and where she stands on breaking up banks, a $15 minimum wage and fracking. (For more of their policy differences, read this.) But is he also right about their differences on carbon tax and climate change?There's no doubt that Sanders' rhetoric on climate change and his plan to deal with it are aggressive and, unlike Clinton, he has advocated for a carbon tax. Clinton does, however, have a climate change plan. While some environmentalists have said it isn't tough enough, others have given it positive reviews.Both the Sanders and Clinton campaigns referred us to each candidate's climate change plan.Sanders' plan is long and comprehensive. Beyond a tax on carbon, it includes an array of proposals from banning certain drilling and mining practices to improving the national public transit system. Clinton's plan is shorter and, though it doesn't include a tax on carbon, contains similar provisions on renewables. Here's an overview:Sanders' planFOSSIL FUEL INFLUENCE- Cut tax subsidies for oil and gas companies- Prohibit fossil fuel lobbyists from working in the White House- Investigate climate change deniersENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS- Enact a tax on carbon- Ban fossil fuel leasing on public lands and promote conservation and habitat preservation- Ban Arctic oil drilling, offshore drilling, fracking, mountaintop removal coal mining and pipeline projects- Stop exports of natural gas and crude oil- Defend and close loopholes in the Clean Air Act- Increase fuel efficiency standards- Begin a moratorium on nuclear power- Create a national environmental and climate justice planRENEWABLES- Invest in clean energy infrastructure and modernize the energy grid- Invest in clean energy, alternative fuels and energy efficiency programs---Clinton's planFOSSIL FUEL INFLUENCE- Cut tax subsidies for oil and gas companiesENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS- Reform fossil fuel leasing and expand clean energy production on public lands- Defend and extend environmental standards like the Clean Power Plan- Eliminate lead poisoning, clean up brownfield sites, and create an Environmental Justice Task ForceRENEWABLES- Invest in clean energy infrastructure- Launch a $60 billion local-state-federal clean energy partnershipAs in her plan, Clinton prefers to focus on renewables on the stump. In a January Medium post responding to the Sanders camp, Clinton's campaign manager highlighted her pledge to ""make America the clean energy superpower of the 21st century"" in her launch speech. Clinton, who played a role in negotiating the Paris climate change agreement, herself touted her goals for more solar panel and clean electricity as ""big"" and ""bold.""Clinton has gotten her best reviews from the League of Conservation Voters, who endorsed Clinton last fall (to some controversy). The green group considers Clinton's plan strong and aggressive and, more importantly, achievable, Tiernan Sittenfeld, its senior vice president of government affairs, told PolitiFact.""Hillary is focused on practical solutions,"" Sittenfeld said, pointing out that there are many lawmakers in Congress who still deny climate change science. ""So (a carbon tax) is pretty remote possibility.""But some are skeptical of Clinton's ""boldness."" Pulitzer Prize-winning website InsideClimate News called Clinton's plan ambitious but said it ""falls short of bold."" The Washington Post's editorial board said her ideas are ""second best."" Environmental news magazine Grist summed up her positions as not bad but ""not quite the climate hawkishness we need."" ---Our rulingSanders said, ""I believe we should have tax on carbon and deal aggressively with climate change. That is not her position.""Unlike Sanders, Clinton doesn't advocate for a carbon tax. And while Clinton doesn't go as far as Sanders in her climate change plan, she does have one. The League of Conservation Voters supports her plan as realistic and achievable.

185,"Says ""Donald Trump says climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese."" \- Hillary Clinton on Thursday, June 2nd, 2016 in a foreign policy speech \* * *\The Ruling: MOSTLY TRUE\During her take-no-prisoners foreign policy speech on June 2, Hillary Clinton reminded listeners of controversial things that Republican presidential rival Donald Trump has said over the years.\At one point, Clinton said, ""Donald Trump says climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese.""\Did he? Yes, though he later said it was a joke.\The original source of this claim was a tweet Trump sent on Nov. 6, 2012, as we noted in a January 2016 fact-check of a similar claim by Clinton's Democratic opponent, Bernie Sanders.\Trump's tweet said, ""The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.""\So Clinton certainly has evidence to support her claim. But we should also note that Trump backed off his claim after Sanders noted them in January on NBC's Meet the Press, calling the Chinese link a ""joke.""\On Jan. 18, after Sanders had attacked Trump's climate change views in the Democratic debate, Trump told Fox & Friends, ""Well, I think the climate change is just a very, very expensive form of tax. A lot of people are making a lot of money. I know much about climate change. I'd be - received environmental awards. And I often joke that this is done for the benefit of China. Obviously, I joke. But this is done for the benefit of China, because China does not do anything to help climate change. They burn everything you could burn; they couldn't care less. They have very - you know, their standards are nothing. But they - in the meantime, they can undercut us on price. So it's very hard on our business.""\Trump may call the mention of China's role a joke, but he certainly has a lengthy record of using the word ""hoax"" to describe climate change. (For the record, in 2014 we rated the claim that climate change is a ""hoax"" Pants on Fire.)\On Dec. 30, 2015, Trump told the crowd at a rally in Hilton Head, S.C., ""Obama's talking about all of this with the global warming and ... a lot of it's a hoax. It's a hoax. I mean, it's a money-making industry, okay? It's a hoax, a lot of it.""\That's three times using ""hoax"" in one sentence. Trump has also used the word on Twitter since his 2012 tweet.\On Jan. 25, 2014, Trump tweeted, ""NBC News just called it the great freeze - coldest weather in years. Is our country still spending money on the GLOBAL WARMING HOAX?""\On Jan. 29, 2014, Trump tweeted: ""Snowing in Texas and Louisiana, record setting freezing temperatures throughout the country and beyond. Global warming is an expensive hoax!""\That same day, he tweeted, ""Give me clean, beautiful and healthy air - not the same old climate change (global warming) bullshit! I am tired of hearing this nonsense.""\Trump also called climate change a ""hoax"" on the Jan. 6, 2014, edition of Fox & Friends.\In addition, he said on the Sept. 24, 2015, edition of CNN's New Day, ""I don't believe in climate change.""\And on Jan. 18, 2016, Trump said that climate change ""is done for the benefit of China, because China does not do anything to help climate change.""\We didn't find Trump using the word ""hoax"" in the months since our previous fact-check, but he hasn't backed off his aggressive skepticism of climate change and policies designed to alleviate it. In fact, he's enshrined opposition to climate change efforts as a key part of his platform.\In a high-profile speech on energy policy in North Dakota on May 26, 2016, Trump attacked ""draconian climate rules."" He advocated rescinding ""all the job-destroying Obama executive actions, including the Climate Action Plan"" and said he would ""cancel the Paris Climate Agreement and stop all payments of U.S. tax dollars to U.N. global warming programs.""\""President Obama entered the United States into the Paris Climate Accords unilaterally and without the permission of Congress,"" Trump said. ""This agreement gives foreign bureaucrats control over how much energy we use right here in America.""\---\Our ruling\Clinton said, ""Donald Trump says climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese.""\Trump did tweet that view in 2012, though he made efforts earlier this year to describe that remark as a ""joke.""\However, Trump has repeatedly called climate change a ""hoax"" in speeches, tweets and media appearances, and while he hasn't necessarily repeated the charge that China ""invented"" climate change, he has said as recently as Jan. 18, 2016, that action on climate change ""is done for the benefit of China.""\We rate the claim Mostly True.\* * *\About this statement:\Published: Friday, June 3rd, 2016 at 12:00 p.m.\Researched by: Louis Jacobson\Edited by: Katie Sanders\Subjects: Climate Change, Foreign Policy\Sources:\Hillary Clinton, foreign policy speech, June 2, 2016\Bernie Sanders, comments on NBC's Meet the Press, Jan. 24, 2016\Donald Trump, tweet, Nov. 6, 2012\Donald Trump, tweet, Jan. 25, 2014\Donald Trump, tweet, Jan. 29, 2014\Donald Trump, tweet, Jan. 29, 2014\Donald Trump, comments on Fox & Friends, Jan. 6, 2014 (accessed via Nexis)\Donald Trump, comments at a rally in Hilton Head, S.C., Dec. 30, 2015 (accessed via Nexis)\Donald Trump, ""An America First Energy Plan,"" May 26, 2016\Wall Street Journal, ""Donald Trump: 'I Don't Believe in Climate Change,' "" Sept. 24, 2015\Mother Jones, ""This Is the Stupidest Anti-Science Bullshit of 2014: A catalogue of shame,"" Mon Dec. 22, 2014\Mother Jones, ""13 Tweets That Definitively Prove That Donald Trump Is Not a Scientist; The reality TV star has a long history of firing the facts,"" June 16, 2015\Talking Points Memo, ""Sanders: Trump Thinks 'Climate Change Is A Hoax Invented By The Chinese,' "" Jan. 17, 2016\Business Insider, ""TRUMP: I was joking when I said the Chinese 'created' the concept of climate change,"" Jan. 18, 2016\Huffington Post, ""Donald Trump On Climate Change: 'I Believe It Goes Up And It Goes Down,' "" Sept. 22, 2015\Daily Mail, ""Trump insists it was a 'joke' when he claimed the Chinese invented global warming,"" Jan. 18, 2016\PolitiFact, ""Global warming is a hoax, says Louisiana congressional hopeful Lenar Whitney,"" Aug. 1, 2014\PolitiFact, ""What Donald Trump said about the Chinese inventing the 'hoax' of climate change,"" Jan. 24, 2016\Washington Post Fact Checker, ""Here's a guide to Clinton's claims about Donald Trump,"" June 2, 2016\E&E Daily, ""Trump's energy speech today: substance or sound bites?""

186,"Says Hillary Clinton ""negotiated the first agreement - ever - where China and India officially committed to reduce their emissions."" \- Bill Clinton on Tuesday, July 26th, 2016 in a speech at the Democratic national convention\* * *\THE RULING: HALF TRUE\In detailing their much-scrutinized marriage and love story at the Democratic National Convention, former President Bill Clinton also took care to list his wife's numerous legislative and foreign policy achievements.\Among them: ""She put climate change at the center of our foreign policy. She negotiated the first agreement ever - ever - where China and India officially committed to reduce their emissions.""\While Bill Clinton's claim is largely accurate, he's offering a rosy spin on the Copenhagen Accord of 2009, which was at the time and continues to be widely panned.\Hillary Clinton did play a key -- but not solo -- role in the talks with China and India, and it was the first time the two countries made emissions reduction pledges in an international agreement.\But unlike the Kyoto Protocol of 1997 or Paris Agreement of 2015, the accord wasn't actually an official agreement. It wasn't ""adopted"" by signatories, but merely ""taken note of"" (in other words, they formally recognized the accord's existence).\Furthermore, the ""agreement"" was non-binding and the countries set their own voluntary targets, leading some environmentalists and experts to cast it aside as essentially meaningless.\Let's dive in.\Before Copenhagen, China and India had both signed and ratified the Kyoto Protocol, which the United States backed out of. But because they were developing countries, they were not required to curb their carbon emissions.\In 2007, in response to overtaking the United States as the world's biggest carbon emitter, China released its first national climate change program and said it would reduce its energy consumption by 20 percent by 2010 and ""consequently reduce CO2 emissions.""\Similarly, India released a national action plan on climate change in 2008, in which it didn't commit to reducing emissions but laid out steps that would.\But it wasn't until Copenhagen that the two countries finally committed to reducing carbon emissions.\In this sense, the accord ""played a major role in breaking"" the ""firewall"" between developed countries and developing countries when it came to climate action responsibility, according to David Ciplet, an environmental studies professor at the University of Colorado Boulder who wrote Power in a Warming World: The New Global Politics of Climate Change and the Remaking of Environmental Inequality.\""However, whether the Copenhagen Accord was a positive development overall is definitely controversial,"" Ciplet told PolitiFact.\Nonetheless, like her husband, Hillary Clinton often touts the accord as one of her major climate change accomplishments, referring to it as a ""key diplomatic breakthrough"" on her campaign website and recounting how she and Obama were ""hunting down the Chinese"" to get them to the table.\She devotes a significant chunk of a chapter in her 2014 memoir, Hard Choices, to the talks. She notes the role of Todd Stern, a key negotiator, as well as her and Obama's famous tag-team chase to find the Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiaobao during the talks.\""In a makeshift conference room whose glass walls had been covered by drapes for privacy against prying eyes, we found Wen wedged around a long table with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, and South African President Jacob Zuma. Jaws dropped when they saw us. 'Are you ready?' said President Obama, flashing a big grin,"" Clinton writes. ""Now the real negotiations could begin. It was a moment that was at least a year in the making.""\But according to news reports, world leaders, environmental activists and experts, the ""real negotiations"" didn't actually lead to anything with teeth. China and India did end up agreeing to reduce their emissions and set their own targets, but emphasized the pledge was not legally binding.\This basically changed the international approach to climate action from Kyoto Protocol, which had a compliance mechanism, to ""a voluntary approach where countries are free to determine unilaterally what forms of action they would like to commit to,"" said Ciplet.\""Many, including myself, saw this as a much weaker mitigation framework than a robust second commitment period to the Kyoto Protocol,"" he said, adding that even after the Paris Agreement, ""we are still not on track"" in mitigating climate change. \Our ruling\Bill Clinton said Hillary Clinton ""negotiated the first agreement - ever - where China and India officially committed to reduce their emissions.""\Clinton was at the table at the Copenhagen Accord, though she wasn't the only U.S. official present. And while it was the first time China and India made pledges in an international agreement, their pledges were not legally binding.\Many, if not most, environmentalists and experts say the agreement was a wash at best and a failure at worst.\We rate Clinton's claim Half True.\* * *\About this statement:\Published: Thursday, July 28th, 2016 at 8:00 p.m.\Researched by: Linda Qiu\Edited by: Angie Drobnic Holan\Subjects: Climate Change, Foreign Policy\Sources: CQ search; Nexis search; InsideClimate News, ""Conference of Parties 'Takes Note Of' Copenhagen Accord,"" Dec. 19, 2009; New York Times, ""A Grudging Accord in Climate Talks,"" Dec. 20, 2009; Der Spiegel, ""The Copenhagen Protocol: How China and India Sabotaged the UN Climate Summit,"" May 10, 2010; Reuters, ""INSTANT VIEW: Reaction to Copenhagen,"" Dec. 18, 2009; Greenpeace, ""Greenpeace statement on the Copenhagen outcome,"" accessed July 26, 2016; The Guardian, ""Hillary Clinton's green path to the White House: will she be 'careful' on climate?,"" April 20, 2015; Email interview with David Ciplet, environmental studies professor at the University of Colorado, Boulder, July 27, 2016\Credit: TAMPA BAY TIMES"
187,"As a scientist, I know that continuing climate change is the biggest threat to the security and prosperity of our state, our country and, indeed, the whole world. I also see the enormous economic opportunities provided by mitigating climate change. \At the same time I also see that a large number of political leaders continue to ignore the threat with such unintelligent remarks as ""climate is always changing"" (Sen. Marco Rubio) or ""I am not a scientist"" (Gov. Rick Scott). While it is frustrating to me as a scientist to hear such remarks, the reason they are made might be that scientists have not clearly explained the consequences of climate change. I don't think the political leaders who dismiss climate change understand the disastrous consequences of inaction. \This spring, Alex Sink, Florida's former chief financial officer, wrote a column for the Tampa Bay Times describing the importance of climate change to the state. I applaud her courage and vision to discuss this topic. At the same time, we continue to hear some leaders dismiss climate change, saying that even if there is some climate change it is inconsequential. \I don't believe that the political leaders who dismiss climate change are evil - they are just not educated about the consequences of climate change. Therefore, they continue to talk about the costs of actions needed to mitigate what they believe is inconsequential. \When we say that the mean global temperature will rise by a couple of degrees, the normal reaction of people would be, ""So what?"" and some may even say that it may be good for the colder areas. Or when we say that we will lose some coastal land because of sea level rise, many people may say that it is something that the rich who own real estate on the beaches should worry about, not them. Or when we point out that the extreme climate events in the last five years - such as sudden floods in Texas, Colorado, South Carolina, West Virginia and other states and extreme drought in California - occurred due to ongoing climate change, most people don't care because they are not personally affected. \But there is something that everyone can relate to, the biggest impact of climate change: the emergence of new microorganisms and diseases. This is something not addressed by the media. The emergence of Zika and Ebola are examples of such changes that we can relate to, especially now that Zika is threatening to be one of the biggest health threats to the people of Florida in years. \Although we can prepare to protect our people at a cost of billions of dollars, we cannot ensure that people will not get infected. While these viruses have existed in nature, even the smallest change in global temperature allows them to spread to areas where they were not known to exist before. \Scientists including professor Paul Epstein of the Harvard School of Public Health have been studying the health consequences of climate change for more than three decades and have long predicted the consequences that we are seeing now and can expect to see in the future. \Twenty years ago, as the co-editor in chief of Advances in Solar Energy with Karl Boer, I invited Epstein to write a detailed article on ""The Nature and Implications of Environmental Change: Climate, Ecology and Human Health."" \He predicted in that article and others some of the emerging disease agents that we are concerned about today and expect to see in the future as a direct consequence of global climate change. \Here are some quotes from his article: ""An expected redistribution of infectious disease is but one of the biological consequences of global environmental change;"" ""but warming and increased CO2 can also stimulate microbes and their carriers;"" ""the emergence of new diseases like Ebola affect not only the health of individuals but also of national economies."" His conclusion was that,"" overall, the current evaluation is that impacts of an unstable and rapidly changing climate on human health are overwhelmingly negative."" \I believe it is our responsibility as citizens and the responsibility of the news media to educate people and political leaders about the disastrous consequences of inaction, especially for Florida. At the same time, I hope people understand that actions necessary to mitigate global climate change represent one of the biggest economic opportunities that we should not miss. \These opportunities include, but are not limited to, new solar and renewable energy technologies based on the vast new understanding of nano-, molecular and biotechnologies. These technologies are essential to mitigate global climate change. Years of research funded by the federal government have resulted in the development of these technologies, which present trillions of dollars of opportunities around the world. These are the technologies that will ensure continued leadership of our nation in the emerging competitive global landscape. \D. Yogi Goswami is Distinguished Professor at the University of South Florida and is the director of its Clean Energy Research Center. He is also editor in chief of the Solar Energy Journal, an international scientific journal."
188,"The effects of man-made climate change, which scientists have warned about for decades, are now lapping at Florida's coastlines. In South Florida, rising sea levels are already overwhelming stormwater systems, damaging infrastructure and flooding homes. Tampa Bay can't be far behind. But local governments can do only so much to confront this global challenge. Floridians must demand that state and national leaders shed any notion that climate change can be ignored and confront the problem with urgency. \A recent New York Times report described cities along the East Coast, from Virginia to the Florida Keys, where frequent tidal flooding is no longer a distant threat. In low-lying coastal areas, the newspaper reported, ""a high tide and a brisk wind are all it takes to send water pouring into streets and homes."" \The ramifications are vast and varied. On the environmental front, saltwater intrusion will cause widespread damage to plants and animals, as well as drinking water. For homeowners and residents, quality of life will be harmed or they will be uprooted altogether. Some property owners who live on the water are paying to elevate their houses and seawalls. What about the millions of Floridians who can't afford those daunting expenses? \Lacking any meaningful help from Washington or Tallahassee, local governments are taxing their residents and attacking the problem neighborhood by neighborhood, intersection by intersection. In Miami Beach, workers tear up chronically flood-prone streets, raise them with extra dirt and rebuild them with added drainage capacity. The approach appears to help - until the next flood washes it all away. St. Petersburg Mayor Rick Kriseman and Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn have made planning for climate change part of their agendas. To do anything else would be head-in-the-sand foolish, and both mayors are well ahead of Gov. Rick Scott in confronting the inevitable. \Scott famously avoided answering questions about climate change by stating he's not a scientist, and his Department of Environmental Protection was ordered not to even use the term. Sen. Marco Rubio, a Miami native, has resorted to pseudo-science, acknowledging climate change by saying the climate has always been changing. But he refuses to commit to any policy fixes that could curb the calamitous effects of greenhouse gas emissions. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump represents the willfully ignorant fringe, mocking progressive leaders for sounding the alarm about climate change, which he has called a hoax. Between the presidential candidates, only Hillary Clinton takes the matter seriously. She accepts the fact that climate change is happening and is committed to addressing it through laws and technologies that create clean-energy jobs. ""The science is clear,"" Clinton said at a campaign rally Tuesday at the University of South Florida. ""It's real."" \With more than 1,300 miles of coastline, Florida is undeniably vulnerable to the effects of swelling seas. But local, piecemeal fixes can't come close to addressing this crisis. Officials who dismiss the urgency of climate change do so at the peril of residents, businesses and natural resources. Yet instead of searching for ambitious solutions, Republican leaders in Florida dismiss the threat as a nonissue and then use it as a partisan wedge. How high will the water have to rise before Republican leaders accept this reality?"
189,"Says Miami Congressman Carlos ""Curbelo supports drilling offshore"" and ""repeatedly voted against President Obama's ability to fight pollution and combat climate change."" \- Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee on Tuesday, September 27th, 2016 in a TV ad\* * *\The Ruling: MOSTLY FALSE\While Miami Republican Rep. Carlos Curbelo portrays himself as an environmentalist, the Democratic Party says he is no treehugger and is aligned with Donald Trump.\""Republican Carlos Curbelo and Donald Trump's ideas about the environment are more alike than you think. Curbelo talks about protecting the environment,"" says a TV ad by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\The ad then shows a clip of Curbelo talking about protecting the environment and then pivots to a clip of him on an oil rig.\The narrator continues: ""Curbelo supports drilling offshore just like Trump, and Curbelo repeatedly voted against President Obama's ability to fight pollution and combat climate change.""\Curbelo represents a Democratic-leaning Westchester-to-Key West district. He faces a rematch Nov. 8 with former U.S. Rep. Joe Garcia, D-Miami. (Curbelo does not support Trump but said he won't vote for Hillary Clinton, either.)\We found that Curbelo supports current drilling but opposes an expansion near Florida's coasts. And while Curbelo has taken some votes related to pollution and climate change that Democrats criticize, he has been one of the more outspoken Republicans about combating climate change. \Trump on drilling\Trump has generally spoken in favor of offshore oil drilling in recent months, although his position hasn't always been clear.\He sounded skeptical about expanding offshore drilling in an interview with the Tampa Bay Times in February.\""They've already got plenty in the Gulf,"" Trump said. ""It would be a little bit of a shame (to expand drilling closer to Florida), because there's so much fracking, and there's so much oil that we have now that we never thought possible. That's an issue I'd absolutely study and do the right thing.""\But Trump has been more forceful about his support for drilling since that time.\""We're going to revoke policies that impose unwarranted restrictions on new drilling technologies,"" he said in North Dakota in May.\In September, Trump said in a fact sheet that he will ""open up vast areas of our offshore energy resources for safe production"" and will eliminate ""unnecessary restrictions"" on offshore oil and gas.\'Curbelo supports drilling offshore'\While Curbelo defended current offshore oil drilling in 2015, he has fought against efforts to expand it closer to Florida than the current 125-mile restriction.\Curbelo made a video of himself standing on an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico in 2015:\""The offshore oil industry in the United States fuels about 20 percent of our economy and assets like this are an important part of an all-of-the-above energy strategy that will grow the American economy and make our country more secure,"" he said.\But Curbelo has voted three times in favor of Democratic amendments to protect coasts from drilling by banning funds, research or testing. He also got the House to pass a bill to force companies that spill oil in foreign waters to clean up any damage to Florida coasts.\'Repeatedly voted against President Obama's ability to fight pollution and combat climate change'\The Democrats point to a handful of votes that Curbelo took that were contrary to Democratic efforts to fight pollution and climate change. In all four cases, Curbelo sided with Republicans in party line votes on legislation or a resolution. But the votes are cherry-picking Curbelo's record, which also reflects his efforts to combat climate change and pollution.\o In January Curbelo took a stand along with virtually all Republicans against a controversial proposal by the federal government to define which bodies of water fall under its jurisdiction. Curbelo thought the ""Waters of the United States"" rule was too vague and it was later stayed by the courts.\o In 2015, Curbelo voted in favor of a bill Republicans said would prevent the EPA from using ""secret science"" and require transparency. The EPA argued it already is transparent and uses sound science.\o The only vote directly about climate change was minor. The House, along with Curbelo, barred funds for a government climate model program in 2015. Curbelo opposed it because he said it was duplicative, National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Chris Pack said.\o Curbelo also voted in favor of a bill to limit environmental reviews to move projects along in 2015.\Importantly, the ad omits that Curbelo has been one of the leading Republican voices in Congress to come up with solutions to combat climate change.\In September 2015, Curbelo signed onto a congressional resolution acknowledging climate change's existence and later, along with U.S. Rep. Ted Deutch, D-Fla., formed the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus.\""It is vital for Congress to acknowledge the reality of climate change as a legitimate issue requiring feasible solutions, and we need leaders on both sides of the aisle to pursue policies that will make a difference,"" Curbelo wrote in an op-ed in the Miami Herald Oct. 24, 2015.\We found other actions that Curbelo took in an effort to fight pollution.\In December 2015, Curbelo was one of 10 Republicans to vote against a resolution to nullify the EPA's rules to regulate carbon emissions from new power plants.\In July 2016, Curbelo opposed a vote by a Florida commission to increase allowed levels of toxins for over two dozen known chemicals in waterways. \Our ruling\The DCCC said,""Curbelo supports drilling offshore just like Trump and Curbelo repeatedly voted against President Obama's ability to fight pollution and combat climate change.""\Curbelo supports current drilling, but the ad omits that he has repeatedly voted against expanding drilling off Florida's coasts. Trump, though not always consistent, has sounded more favorable to drilling than Curbelo.\Curbelo has taken votes against Democratic efforts to curb pollution and to model climate change, but that is cherry-picking his record. The ad omits that Curbelo has been a leader among Republicans speaking out about the need to combat climate change.\We rate this claim Mostly False.\* * *\About this statement:\Published: Thursday, September 29th, 2016 at 5:08 p.m.\Researched by: Amy Sherman\Edited by: Angie Drobnic Holan\Subjects: Climate Change, Environment\Sources:\Political TV ad archive, Ad, Sept. 27, 2016\U.S. Rep.

190,"Climate change linked to storm's strength - Oct. 9 \Thanks for this article linking climate change and hurricane strength. Heat increases the severity if not the frequency of all storms. \The World Economic Forum, our Joint Chiefs of Staff and Physicians for Social Responsibility will tell you that climate change is the greatest threat to our economy, national security and our health. Why then do we not hear more about it in the media? I can understand that people have different senses of value based on their different moral upbringing, but climate change affects all of us, and I cannot imagine that anyone would not want to know what is going on. Furthermore, the solutions I know - whether local, national or international - are not at odds with anyone's sense of values. \Scientists write mainly for scientists. Journalists are the folks who should inform the general public, and must do so with great attention to the pertinent facts. Mike Pence and his supporters, for example, should be made aware that, for our survival, coal must be eliminated as an energy source, and it is actually fracking, which I assume Pence favors, that is winning his ""war on coal."" Now, for survival, we need a war on fracking by wind, water and solar power. \John E. Darovec Jr., Bradenton \* * *\Amendment 1 \Reject deceptive solar plan \For decades, consumers have heard about the hope of a solar future, one that would allow consumers to generate their own electricity. Given that Florida is the Sunshine State, it's appropriate that the freedom to make solar power into usable energy is protected here under state law. \But an issue on the November ballot, Amendment 1, is deceptively titled ""Rights of Electricity Consumers Regarding Solar Energy Choice."" It would actually create new barriers and costs for consumers interested in generating their own power through rooftop solar panels. By making solar more expensive for electric customers, Amendment 1 would reduce the benefit and accessibility of solar power, and favor the utilities over ordinary consumers. \Amendment 1 also would make it easier to pile excessive fees on residents who add solar panels. Such fees are unjustified, as shown by studies in Arizona, Colorado and North Carolina, where research found the benefits of rooftop solar outweighed the costs to the system by between 40 and 100 times. \It's clear from who opposes and who supports Amendment 1 what is at stake. Power companies have spent more than $16 million on their campaign to restrict customer-owned solar choices, and the issue is on track to be the most heavily industry-funded ballot measure in the state's history. Their strategy is sneaky: They know that Floridians support solar and that a simple vote against solar would fail. So the utilities are masking their anti-solar amendment as pro-solar. \Consumers deserve a fair choice on their energy needs. So don't be misled - vote no on Amendment 1. \Shannon Baker-Branstetter, Washington, D.C. \The writer is policy counsel for Consumers Union. \* * *\Campaign 2016 \An ugly, ominous time \My mother grew up under Mussolini's dictatorship in Italy. She often told me stories of neighbors standing outside her window, listening in on private family conversation. Anyone who spoke against the Fascist regime was reported to authorities. Punishment was swift and cruel. \I have been active supporting Democratic candidates since 1972. This year, I am afraid to put a simple Clinton/Kaine bumper sticker on my car because I fear retaliation from a certain element of Trump supporters. \Americans have never lived under a repressive political regime and have no idea of what it is like to lose their civil liberties. Good people need to speak out against this dangerous trend before it is too late. \Nancy Catania, Wesley Chapel \* * *\Trump's character is set \The spate of ""boys will be boys"" letters from Donald Trump apologists in Wednesday's Times was predictable. After all, Trump has been spewing inexcusable, often hateful, rhetoric for over a year and it has not fazed his supporters. \But the notion that such disgusting behavior is somehow imprinted on the male chromosome is, quite simply, a bald-faced lie. It is impossible to imagine President Barack Obama allowing any of the countless loutish utterances we have heard from Trump over the years to pass his lips. The president is a gentleman. This is not a trait you can put on or take off when it suits you. You have it or you don't. And you would scour a Trump rally in vain looking for evidence of either one. \Even more disturbing than Trump's lewd comments, however, is his underlying rationale. He knows the behavior he is bragging about is out of bounds. He just doesn't care. He can get away with it because he's a ""star."" He doesn't have to pay taxes because he's ""brilliant."" He doesn't need foreign policy experts because he has a ""great brain."" \Clearly, Trump thinks that rules simply don't apply to him, a fact that gives the lie to his faux populism. Since the rules don't apply, he thinks that after decades of exposing himself as a classless, petty swindler he can now fool the country into giving him the thing he craves even more than the presidency: respect. Sadly for Trump, that was gone a long time ago. And, like integrity, once lost it is never recovered. \Buck Beasom, Tampa \* * *\Rubio sticks with Trump - Oct. 12 \Profile in cowardice \By maintaining his support for the vile, despicable person and candidate that is Donald Trump, Marco Rubio has shown all the cowardice and utter lack of principle we've come to expect from him. He could, as many of his fellow Republicans have done, withdraw his support for Trump without backing Hillary Clinton. But clearly he places what he sees as his political interests above those of community and country. \By so doing, he has forfeited whatever shred of dignity and humanity he may have had left - if any - after his shameful (non-)performance as our U.S. senator. \Morry Bornstein, Seminole"
191,"Scott Stephens, a federal meteorologist based in Asheville, N.C., said what people in his profession usually say about the link between freakish weather and global warming. \""You can't tie a single event to climate change,"" Stephens said. ""But one of the tenets of climate change is that you have greater extremes."" \Drought in a temperate rain forest certainly qualifies as ""extreme,"" and that is what my family and I encountered on our Thanksgiving trip to the mountains of North Carolina - bone-dry conditions in one of the wettest parts of the eastern United States, a two-month stretch of negligible rainfall in a place that routinely receives more than 80 inches of precipitation per year. \Believe me, there's nothing like waking up day after day to choking smoke from drought-fueled forest fires to get you thinking about environmental end times. \Yes, it's some consolation that, as Stephens said, we can't be sure that the drought and fires have been caused by climate change, which means we can't be sure that this is a view of things to come. \That is less reassuring, though, considering that 2016 is set to break yet another recent global record as the warmest year ever and that temperatures in the Arctic have been running a stunning 36 degrees higher than normal for this time of year, according to a recent story in the Washington Post (which you might not trust because of a supposed left-wing bias, but which I do because reporters there actually get fired if they make things up). \It is less reassuring still because of the skepticism about climate change we've heard from President-elect Donald Trump and the outright denial from his choice to lead the transition of the Environmental Protection Agency, Myron Ebell. \To what extent the two of them start dismantling controls on global warming probably depends on how much Trump thinks people care about the issue. \The good news is that polls indicate images of melting polar ice, of flooded streets in Miami Beach and, yes, of raging forest fires may finally be making a dent in the national consciousness - 64 percent of Americans are at least somewhat concerned about climate change, according to a Gallup poll earlier this year. \But there are also signs that we don't care that much. The popularity of big, hideously inefficient pickup trucks has soared nationally in recent years as gas prices have fallen, and they remain a particularly high-status mode of personal transportation in much of Hernando County. Many of their owners apparently think nothing of letting them idle, spewing exhaust fumes and carbon dioxide, to keep the cab at an ideal temperature during waits in parking lots. Another local sign of our lack of concern: 63 percent of the county's presidential vote went to a man who has said global warming is a ""concept ... created by and for the Chinese."" \So, obviously, we need to care more. \By the way, a front swept through the southern Appalachian Mountains on Monday night. Its winds fanned fires that destroyed dozens of buildings, including a 16-story hotel in Gatlinburg, Tenn. But it brought the first heavy rain in weeks, rain that should help control the worst of the forest fires. \More storms are expected in the next few days, meaning that we might not be facing a climate-based apocalypse after all. \Not yet."

""One hundred and ninety-four countries signed the Paris Agreement to control greenhouse gases. Our own voluntary agreement to accomplish the same goal - the Under2 MOU - has 165 signatories, representing a billion people.""
\
- Jerry Brown on Tuesday, January 24th, 2017 in his State of the State address
\
* * *
\
The ruling: MOSTLY TRUE
\
California Gov. Jerry Brown offered an energetic rebuke to the Trump administration's ""alternative facts"" and ""blatant attacks on science"" in his State of the State address.
\
The solidly blue state voted overwhelmingly for Hillary Clinton, prompting Brown to reflect on California's place in a broader national context in a speech traditionally used to set a state policy agenda. Contrasting Trump's positions, Brown promised to oppose deportations of undocumented immigrants, to protect health care and to continue to act on climate change.
\
""One hundred and ninety-four countries signed the Paris Agreement to control greenhouse gases. Our own voluntary agreement to accomplish the same goal - the Under2 MOU - has 165 signatories, representing a billion people,"" Brown said. ""We can do much on our own and we can join with others - other states and provinces and even countries, to stop the dangerous rise in climate pollution. And make no mistake, we are going to do exactly that.""
\
We wanted to know more about what Brown was talking about and if it is accurate.
\
The Under2 MOU, or Subnational Global Climate Leadership Memorandum of Understanding, is a pact spearheaded by California and the German state of Baden-Wurttemberg in the leadup to the Paris agreement in 2015. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called it a ""game changer.""
\
Its 165 members represent about 1 billion people and pledge to limit carbon emissions to below 80 to 90 percent from 1990 levels with the goal of keeping global temperatures from rising 2 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels by 2100.
\
That's the same goal and framework of the Paris agreement, the major international deal between nearly 200 nations. But there are a few differences between the two deals.
\
First, Brown's numbers need explanation. Of the Under2 MOU's 165 members, 155 are signatories, meaning they've declared their commitment to limit emissions and to provide action plans. The other 10 are countries that have endorsed the MOU, meaning they support the goal but don't have to submit plans.
\
MAP: The Under2 Coalition
\
Second, the MOU is voluntary and nonbinding, and while the Paris deal is also voluntary, it includes binding obligations on reporting emissions and progress.
\
Third, unlike the MOU, the Paris agreement has increasingly stringent targets for signatories. The United States, for example, pledged to cut emissions 17 percent from 2005 levels by 2020, and then 26 to 28 percent percent by 2025 (equivalent to 19 to 24 percent from 1990 levels).
\
Despite these differences, experts we spoke with said the Under2 MOU was a strong and forceful compact. But they said the MOU was a complement to the Paris agreement rather than its equivalent in terms of potential impact.
\
""They're part and parcel to each other. If you're driving those kind of reductions, those can help you get to the national targets. They're not distinct realms. They're nested within each other,"" said Brendan Guy, the international policy manager at the Natural Resources Defense Council.
\
Under the MOU, California pledged to reduce emissions 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030 and actually enacted legislation that codifies the target and sets a regulatory process in place. That's a ""really high watermark"" that hardly any national governments have met, said Danny Cullenward, an energy economist at Carnegie Institute for Science.
\
Experts also pointed to California's five-year-old cap-and-trade program (which the Obama administration tried but failed to implement on a national scale), extended renewable portfolio standards and its pledge to get 1.5 million zero emissions cars on the road by 2025 as examples of strong climate change action.
\
Just how far-reaching are these targets and policies? To state the obvious, cities and states do not account for all of a country's emissions, so their reduction pledges will not have an equivalent impact to a national commitment.
\
California, despite being the largest state and equivalent to the world's sixth-largest economy, accounts for 6 to 7 percent of the United States' emissions. The other nine U.S. states that are part of the MOU (Connecticut, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington) represent another 10 percent of the country's total emissions.
\
Looking at it another way, if all 23,458 cities from the Energy Department's city energy profile tool enacted best energy-saving practices, it would lead to a 3 to 7 percent reduction in emissions, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.
\
""Will these subnational efforts be enough to prevent a dangerous increase in average global temperature? Probably not,"" said Rachel Krause, a University of Kansas professor who focuses on local policy and sustainability. ""But they still can have meaningful impact.""
\
Cullenward pointed out that the Paris agreement's depth is the result of two decades of negotiations, while the MOU is a relatively new compact and will likely become much more sophisticated over time.
\
""It's no substitute for eventual national action. But it's a really appropriate strategy where you have national governments that aren't interested in taking action on climate change,"" he said.
\

\
Our ruling
\
Brown said, ""194 countries signed the Paris Agreement to control greenhouse gases. Our own voluntary agreement to accomplish the same goal - the Under2 MOU - has 165 signatories, representing a billion people.""
\
The Under2 MOU, spearheaded by California and the Germany state Baden-Wurttemberg, is a climate change agreement signed by 155 cities and states that have pledged reductions in carbon emissions and endorsed by 10 countries.
\
While its emissions impact is not as far-reaching as the Paris agreement, experts told us it is a very similar deal that fosters international cooperation on climate change and fills a void in times of national hesitation to act.
\
We rate Brown's claim Mostly True.

193,"As it struggles to feed the hungry, the U.N. World Food Program often reminds the public that in the face of great need, there is also great waste. \Right now, the U.N. relief agency is active in about 75 nations, including conflict zones in Syria, Iraq, Nigeria and South Sudan. In a tweet, the World Food Program connected the loss of food to global climate change. \""Food waste is the 3rd largest contributor of GHGs (greenhouse gases) to our climate,"" the organization tweeted Feb. 5. \The tweet no longer exists. The program deleted it after we raised some questions, so kudos for that. \Here's why it was inaccurate. \World Food Program senior spokesman Steve Taravella told us they relied on a report from the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization. That article included a chart that said, ""If food wastage were a country, it would be the third largest emitting country in the world."" FAO researchers estimated that a third of all food never makes it to the kitchen table and calculated the emissions that went in to growing and transporting those wasted tons. \The problem is, agriculture is an activity, not a place. It makes sense to compare its emissions to other activities, and no sense to rank it against countries. \""It's comparing apples to oranges,"" researcher Brian Lipinski at the World Resources Institute told us. ""The number for food loss and waste is comprised of numbers from individual countries, and so the data isn't mutually exclusive. So while the comparison to countries helps to establish the scale, flat-out labeling food loss and waste as the world's third largest emitter is missing necessary context."" \When we raised this issue with Taravella, he agreed. \""In our effort to illustrate the scale of the problem, it seems we inadvertently mistook the metaphor in the graphic - a mythical country - for an actual source of waste,"" Taravella said. \He deleted the tweet to ""avoid giving our Twitter followers inaccurate data,"" and told us he would take this up with his colleagues to find other ways to draw attention to food waste. \So how do emissions from food lost and wasted stack up against other human activities? \The latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimated total greenhouse gas emissions to be equal to 49.5 gigatons of carbon dioxide. Out of that, agriculture, forestry and other productive uses of land account for about 25 percent. Food waste is about 9 percent, but that's not a separate piece all by itself. Emissions tied to industry (the production of fertilizer), transportation (moving food around), buildings (to store food), energy (to refrigerate it), and agriculture all contribute a bit to the food waste total. \The current research doesn't tease out emissions due to food waste separate from other activities, so there's no way to rank it by itself. \The Food and Agriculture Organization estimated that food loss and waste accounted for about 4.4 gigatons of carbon dioxide each year. That's a little bit less than emissions from road transportation. A research group at Potsdam University in Germany used very different methods and reached a similar conclusion on the total emissions tied to wasted food. \We rate this claim False. \* * *\Read more rulings at PolitiFact.com.\Credit: TIMES STAFF WRITER"
194,"""The EPA director under Obama said the Clean Power Initiative would have no effect on man-made CO2 emissions. That's what she said. Go look it up.""\-- Rick Santorum on Friday, March 31st, 2017 in a conversation on HBO's ""Real Time with Bill Maher""\* * *\The ruling: FALSE\During an appearance on Bill Maher's HBO show, former Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., tried to convince the generally liberal host that Donald Trump was right to shelve Barack Obama's Clean Power Plan, which placed stricter standards on carbon emissions from power plants as a way of curbing pollution and climate change.\""The EPA director under Obama said the Clean Power Initiative would have no effect on man-made CO2 emissions,"" Santorum said. ""That's what she said. Go look it up.""\As if Santorum's suggestion to ""look it up"" wasn't enough of a prompt for us to take a look, a number of readers also suggested we analyze his statement. So we did.\- - - \What was the Clean Power Plan?\In August 2015, the Obama administration announced that its Clean Power Plan regulations would require power plants to reduce carbon emissions, from 2005 levels, by 32 percent by 2030. Scientists say that carbon emissions are a significant contributor to global climate change. Advocates added that the Clean Power Plan would also reduce other emissions that create soot and smog.\However, after opponents sued the Obama administration and found some success in the courts, the plan was never implemented. Then, on March 28, President Donald Trump, as expected, issued an executive order that set in motion the plan's dismantling.\- - - \What was Santorum referring to?\The primary piece of evidence for Santorum's statement, according to Santorum spokesman Matt Beynon, was an exchange at a House Science Committee hearing on July 9, 2015, including questioning of Obama EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy by Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas. Here's the exchange:\Smith: ""On the Clean Power Plan, former Obama Administration Assistant Secretary, Charles McConnell said it best, that it will reduce global temperature by only 1/100th of a degree Celsius. At the same time, it is going to increase the cost of electricity, that's going to hurt the lowest income Americans the most. How do you justify such an expensive burden, some -- rule that is really not going to do much good, and isn't this all pain and no gain?""\McCarthy: ""No sir. I don't agree with you. If you look at the RIA we did, the Regulatory Impact Analysis, you would see it's enormously beneficial. The value of this...""\Smith: ""Would you consider 1/100th of a degree to be enormously beneficial?""\McCarthy: ""The value of this rule is not measured in that way. It is measured in showing strong domestic action, which can actually trigger global action to address what is a...""\Smith: ""Do you disagree with my 1/100th of a degree figure? Do you disagree with my 1/100th of a degree?""\McCarthy: ""I'm not disagreeing that this action in and of itself will not make all the difference we need to address climate action. But what I'm saying is if (we) don't take action domestically, we will never get started.""\Smith: ""But if you're looking at the results, the results can't justify the cost and the burden that you are imposing on the American people.""\McCarthy: ""Actually this is a cost-beneficial rule...""\- - - \Did McCarthy say the rule would have ""no effect on man-made CO2 emissions""?\First, we should point out that neither Smith nor McCarthy mentioned emissions per se in their exchange -- they discussed temperatures, a related but separate factor.\Beyond that, though, McCarthy actually didn't say the plan would have ""no effect."" It would be more accurate to say McCarthy sidestepped the question.\After McCarthy's non-response to Smith's question, the lawmaker didn't follow up on that specific line of questioning. Because of McCarthy's verbal fancy footwork, it's a stretch for Santorum to say McCarthy acknowledged the view that the Clean Power Plan would have ""no effect"" on carbon emissions.\In the meantime, Benyon provided some additional pieces of supporting evidence. However, they did not directly support Santorum's statement.\Benyon cited comments by an earlier EPA administrator under Obama, Lisa Jackson, at a hearing of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. At the hearing, Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., showed Jackson a chart showing ""virtually no change"" in carbon dioxide and asked her if she agreed with it.\Jackson responded, ""I believe that essential parts of the chart are that the U.S. acting alone will not impact the world's CO2 levels. But as we've all said, and as many members of this committee said, the race is on for us to enter into a clean energy future. There is technology in this country that can be used to move markets not only here, but abroad, and that means jobs for Americans that we are currently losing.""\This is actually a stronger example of an Obama EPA administrator acknowledging the limitations of curbing carbon emissions. However, this hearing was held in 2009, long before the Clean Power Plan was unveiled. (In fact, in 2009, the Obama administration was pursuing legislation, not regulation, on carbon emissions.)\Benyon also cited prepared testimony in 2016 by former Obama assistant energy secretary for fossil fuels Charles McConnell.\""What is also clear both scientifically and technically is that the EPA's (Clean Power Plan) is not a plan that will significantly impact global CO2 emissions."" McConnell wrote. He cited calculations that the Clean Power Plan would reduce global temperatures by 0.01 degrees Fahrenheit and that the reduction in sea level rise would be only as wide as two human hairs. ""These are facts, and facts are stubborn things,"" he said.\But again, Santorum wasn't citing just any senior Obama administration official but specifically the head of the EPA.\Does Santorum have a point anyway?\Some researchers have expressed skepticism about the Clean Power Plan's value. Benjamin Zycher of the conservative American Enterprise Institute and Patrick Michaels and Paul Knappenberger of the libertarian Cato Institute, have pointed to calculations using a model known as MAGICC, which EPA itself has used. The model suggests that the Clean Power Plan would reduce temperatures by small fractions of a degree, varying by the assumptions made.\A wide range of climate scientists and policy experts we checked with offered some counterpoints. First, they said the United States needs to take its own steps to curb carbon production if the rest of the world is going to follow.\""Everyone acknowledges that the Clean Power Plan alone isn't enough to stop climate change, but that's a rather ridiculous bar to hold for a single regulation,"" said William Anderegg, a biologist at the University of Utah. ""What is clear, however, is that the Clean Power Plan is likely the single most critical piece of U.S. action to fulfill our commitments under the Paris Agreement.""\Second, they argued that even a small reduction would be preferable to the upward trend line the world would likely see otherwise. ""Reducing the temperature of the atmosphere by 1/100th of a degree is in fact really significant,"" said Harold Wanless, who chairs the department of geological sciences at the University of Miami. ""We shot up several hundredths of a degree last year alone. Every hundredth of a degree cooled is a step in the right direction.""\Finally, Santorum's perspective ""misses the thousands of lives per year we're already saving each year by cutting coal use,"" said Rob Jackson, a professor at the Stanford University School of Earth, Energy and Environmental Sciences. And tallying up the impact of just the Clean Power Plan ignores other carbon-reduction policies pursued by the Obama administration, including higher vehicle fuel economy standards, regulations on other greenhouse gases such as methane, and heightened energy-efficiency requirements for buildings and appliances.\Reasonable people can disagree about whether the costs on utilities, their employees and local economies justify such benefits. But focusing only on the global warming impact of the Clean Power Plan, as Santorum did, ignores these other considerations.\- - - \Our ruling\Santorum said, ""The EPA director under Obama said the Clean Power Initiative would have no effect on man-made CO2 emissions. That's what she said. Go look it up.""\Many scientists would acknowledge that the climate-change impact of U.S. action by itself would be modest. However, McCarthy didn't actually say that, and few experts would peg the impact at zero, as Santorum did. We rate the statement False.\* * *\CORRECTION, April 6, 2017: This version corrects the academic affiliation of Rob Jackson.\* * *\Sources:\Rick Santorum, comments on HBO's Real Time with Bill Maher, March 31, 2017\U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, ""Clean Power Plan for Existing Power Plants,"" accessed April 5, 2017\White House, ""Presidential Executive Order on Promoting Energy Independence and Economic Growth,"" March 28, 2017\U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, ""Regulatory Impact Analysis for the Clean Power Plan Final Rule,"" Oct. 23, 2015,\New York Times, ""What to Know About Trump's Order to Dismantle the Clean Power Plan,"" March 27, 2017\U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, ""Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator,"" accessed April 5, 2017\Gina McCarthy, comments at the House Science Committee, July 9, 2015 (video, transcript)\Lisa Jackson, comments before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, July 7, 2009\Charles McConnell, testimony before the Senate Science, Space, and Technology Subcommittee on the Environment, May, 26, 2016\Benjamin Zycher, ""President Obama's Clean Power Plan: All Cost, No Benefit,"" Aug. 5, 2015\Patrick J.

195,"Power surge - July 30 \This breathless article on the construction of a gas-fired electric plant seems like a free commercial for the company. It did not address what the cost of natural gas has to be to provide power at $6.55 per kilowatt, nor did it comment on the external costs of production and burning of the gas. Extraction through fracking or otherwise has costs of remediation, as does the carbon and other pollutants put into the environment. That's the problem with any extraction-based energy source, all of which ignore the total costs involved from drilling the first well to dealing with the external costs. \Florida must begin to move away from a command-and-control economy whereby monopolies in power production manipulate the Legislature and deny alternative energy production a level playing field. For example, the oil depletion allowance and other tax breaks cost taxpayers about $4 billion a year. Solar power is there for the taking and it costs nothing to produce; no external costs. Costs of panel fabrication are paid for in about three to five years in energy used, and given the life expectancy of a panel, power is then generated free for another 20-plus years. \The solar power available here is better than anywhere east of the Mississippi. Such unsunny climes as New Jersey and Massachusetts produce more solar power than Florida. When the giant power companies allow for competition instead of pushing for deceptive solar amendments to the Florida Constitution, we will see the amount of energy increase, decrease the externalities and costs of fossil fuels and become more energy independent. \Robert Tankel, Dunedin \* * *\Health care \Heading toward a crisis \President Donald Trump's outlandish tweet stating that ""BAILOUTS for insurance companies and BAILOUTS for members of Congress will end very soon!"" refers to the elimination of government-funded subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. If Trump ends the subsidies, insurers will have to take on the cost-sharing as they are not immediately able to drop anyone until 2018. This results in financial instability for the insurers, which would certainly lead to layoffs in not only the health insurance industry but potentially in the broader health care system. The second effect would be skyrocketing premiums and millions uninsured in 2018. With no current replacement from Republicans, this would quite literally cause a jobs crisis in the health care sector as well as punishment to the most innocent of citizens for no other reason than politics. \This president continues to show no evidence of a moral compass or evidence that he understands the nuance of any public policy decision he makes. It is incumbent upon citizens now more than ever to elect officials on either side in any local, state or federal race who carry a nuanced approach to solving our toughest challenges. \Thomas Vacca, Tampa \* * *\Baker for mayor - July 30, editorial \Baker's dubious record \It is truly sad that this once-great newspaper that I have been reading for over 58 years has endorsed Rick Baker over Rick Kriseman for mayor of St. Petersburg. I agree that Kriseman has had his disappointing moments, but they pale in comparison to Baker's. You failed to mention the attempt by Baker to close Albert Whitted Airport that was overwhelmingly rejected by the voters. You failed to mention Baker's lack of support for all citizens regardless of sexual orientation. You failed to mention Baker's unwillingness to initiate curbside recycling or his unwillingness to confront climate change in a meaningful way, an extremely important issue for the residents of St. Petersburg. \You failed to explain why you have more confidence in Baker to overhaul the sewer system. Since it is perfectly obvious that the sewer system needed an overhaul, why didn't Baker do it as mayor? If Baker's main positive is education, he should run for the School Board. \John Avery, St. Petersburg \* * *\Here is the math on single-payer - July 30, Perspective \All should contribute \You write, ""A single-payer system would be similar to Medicare, which covers Americans who have turned 65."" In order to get Medicare Part B, those over 65 contribute money every month. I see no contribution from those who want the government to pay for their health insurance needs. In fact, encouraging Americans to believe that our government will supply their every want is troubling. Where will the motivation for people to make better health care decisions come from if there is no connection to costs? Weight loss, quitting smoking, choosing healthier foods and routine exams all help in improving health, but creating a system where your only input is showing up and handing over your insurance card doesn't assure participating in your own health care. \If single-payer insurance was enacted, the efforts for finding fraud and misuse would have to at least double. Why create a ""government company"" when insurance companies already exist? \P.C. Walsh, Port Richey \* * *\State sees voter cancellations - July 31 \Possible double voters \This article omits a most logical reason for the increase in cancellations. It mentions the president's commission on voter fraud and suggests that some voters may have cancelled because they don't want their personal information revealed to that commission. Ignored is the possibility that some people cancelled their Florida voter registration because they were registered to vote in two different states - just as President Donald Trump has alleged. \Looking at the list of counties seeing the biggest increases in cancellations, they appear to be the ones with the greatest number of snowbirds/winter visitors who may be registered in their home states as well as in Florida. I think a comparison of those cancellations against the voter registration rolls of those folks' home states might reveal something interesting. \Alfred J. D'Amario, Hudson"

197,"The statement:\""30,000 scientists have come forward confirming that man-made climate change is a hoax perpetuated by the elite in order to make money.""\-- Bloggers on Saturday, September 2nd, 2017 in an article on an unreliable website\* * *\The ruling: PANTS ON FIRE!\Climate change doubters have no patience for claims that the overwhelming number of climate researchers believe that humans are the driving factor. Facebook users flagged a recent article on the website News Punch that asserted much more disagreement in the scientific community than is commonly thought.\""30,000 scientists have come forward confirming that man-made climate change is a hoax perpetuated by the elite in order to make money,"" was the subheadline in the Sept. 2 story.\That striking number of dissenting scientists has been around for many years and dates back to a 1998 petition drive conducted under the auspices of a climate change skeptic named Arthur Robinson. Robinson is a biochemist, conservative activist and four-time Republican congressional candidate in Oregon. Robinson believes human-driven climate change is a myth.\Robinson's Petition Project now counts 31,487 signatories. Before we get to who those people are, the key flaw in the News Punch statement is that the petition doesn't say what the article claims. Here's what people sign:\For the purposes of this fact-check, the key sentence is, ""There is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide, methane, or other greenhouse gases is causing or will, in the foreseeable future, cause catastrophic heating of the Earth's atmosphere and disruption of the Earth's climate.""\The petition says nothing about hoaxes or profit motives.\On its face, someone signing the petition need not believe that climate change is a hoax, nor that it has been perpetrated to make money. While some or even many who signed it might hold those beliefs, the petition itself doesn't speak to either of those conditions.\In terms of the mindset of the signers, the statement relies on speculation.\- - - \Challenges to the petition\There are many reasons to question what it means to have over 31,000 people signing this petition.\First of all, the meaning of ""scientist"" is vague. The minimum requirement is a bachelor's of science degree. That's no guarantee that the person studied a science related to climate change, or that the person pursued a career in science. The petition's website says that 12,715 signers hold ""BS or equivalent academic degrees.""\When we look at the number of people with some sort of background in fields that tie directly to climate change, the petition website said, ""there are 3,805 scientists trained in specialties directly related to the physical environment of the Earth.""\That would be about 12 percent of the total.\There are, according to the site, 9,029 people with PhDs, which comes closer to meeting a higher bar for being thought of as a scientist. Based on the site's figures, most of them don't specialize in climate change, but they likely are more familiar with scientific methods.\These important nuances get lost. A 2012 opinion piece in Forbes described the signers as ""more than 31,000 American scientists from diverse climate-related disciplines.""\That's way off the mark, unless you count veterinarians -- one of the degrees that qualifies you as a scientist in the petition project -- and physicians.\We also don't know much about when people signed the petition. The website tells us that thousands of signatures came in 1998 and 1999 when the petition was first circulated. It also says, ""The majority of the current listed signatories signed or re-signed the petition after October 2007.""\The problem is, the scientific consensus on mankind's role in climate change has grown over time. Even if more than half of the signers came after that date, it doesn't mean that those who came before remain skeptical of climate change.\There's reason to think that opinions can shift. When the magazine Scientific American reached out to a random sample of 30 names on the list in 2006, it found ""six said they would not sign the petition today, three did not remember any such petition, one had died, and five did not answer.""\We reached out to the publishers of News Punch and did not hear back.\- - - \Our ruling\An article on the News Punch website said that ""30,000 scientists have come forward confirming that man-made climate change is a hoax perpetuated by the elite in order to make money."" The source is a well-known petition project.\The key flaw is that the petition challenges the science, but it doesn't cast human-driven climate change as a hoax aimed at making some people rich. That is pure interpretation by the website.\The use of the word ""scientists"" is misleading, since a signatory need not be a scientist today and need not have done more than earned a bachelor of science degree in any field. The actual number of climate-related specialists is about 12 percent of the total. And these are not currently confirmed signatories as the list has been circulating since 1998.\For all these reasons, we rate this claim Pants on Fire.\* * *\Sources:\News Punch, Tens of Thousands Of Scientists Declare Climate Change A Hoax, Sept. 2, 2017\Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine, Global Warming Petition Project, accessed Sept. 7, 2017\Snopes, Not All Climatologists, Oct. 24, 2016\Forbes, hat Scientific Global Warming Consensus...Not!, July 17, 2012\American Association for the Advancement of Science, Thirty-One Top Scientific Societies Speak with One Voice on Global Climate Change, June 28, 2016\Scientific American, Skepticism about skeptics, Aug. 23, 2006\PolitiFact, Santorum: UN climate head debunked widely cited 97% climate change consensus figure, Sept. 2, 2015\National Review, The 97 percent solution, Oct. 8, 2015\Credit: TAMPA BAY TIMES"
198,"Florida's coastal and stormwater infrastructure are ""two of the most critical areas during a storm, and received D-plus and D ratings, respectively, by the American Society of Civil Engineers in 2016."" \-- Gwen Graham on Monday, September 18th, 2017 in an opinion-editorial\* * *\The Ruling: TRUE\Gwen Graham, a former Democratic congresswoman running for Florida governor, said state leaders need to do more to prepare for the next hurricane, especially in the face of climate change.\In an opinion-editorial for the Tampa Bay Times, Graham specifically focused on the state's significant problem with infrastructure.\""Our coastal and stormwater infrastructure are not prepared to handle climate change,"" Graham wrote. ""They're two of the most critical areas during a storm, and received D-plus and D ratings, respectively, by the American Society of Civil Engineers in 2016.""\We wondered about these grades as well as Graham's larger point about climate change preparedness.\---\Why Florida's grades are poor\Every four years since 2008, the Florida Section of the American Society of Civil Engineers has issued a report card outlining the condition of Florida's infrastructure.\The organization was founded in 1852 and represents more than 150,000 members of the civil engineering profession in 177 countries, making it the oldest engineering society in the country.\A committee of civil engineers updates the card and gives out 11 grades on different sectors of infrastructure, including bridges, energy and school facilities, to create an an average grade. (Florida's grade point average was a C in 2016.)\Florida's highest marks were in ports (B-minus), aviation (B-minus) and bridges (B) in the group's 2016 report card. As Graham said, coastal and stormwater infrastructure scored poorly.\The worst grade, F, is given out to infrastructure with ""widespread advanced signs of deterioration,"" and designates that the infrastructure is unfit for what it's supposed to do.\Getting a D isn't much better: ""The infrastructure is in poor to fair condition and mostly below standard, with many elements approaching the end of their service life. A large portion of the system exhibits significant deterioration. Condition and capacity are of serious concern with strong risk of failure.""\The section about coastal areas takes a close look at the Sunshine State's 825 miles of beaches. That area received a D-plus grade in 2016, jsut like Graham said. \According to the organization, almost 61 percent of Florida's beaches are eroding and need ""ongoing maintenance"" to fight the trend. The group put some of the fault on state policymakers, adding that ""over the last 10 years, the average difference between requested and state appropriated funds exceeded $40 million per year.""\It shouldn't come as a surprise that hurricanes and major storm events can really mess up coastal areas and beaches. During periods of extreme rain, the chance for flooding increases. Flooding combined with wind, leads to beach erosion and jeopardizes the integrity of important infrastructure, like power plants, along the coast.\Florida's stormwater infrastructure, which include the drains that capture excess rain water and transport it for cleaning, received a D. Based on the ASCE's assessment, Florida needs about $1.1 billion through 2019 to update its stormwater infrastructure. However, as needs for improvement have increased, utility fees to upkeep the systems have decreased since 2011.\Stormwater infrastructure is put into overdrive during storms and hurricanes. Increasing the amount of water compromises the natural ability of the ground to absorb water, making stormwater systems function worse.\There's no doubt that stormwater and coastal area infrastructure are critical when a storm hits, and experts agreed that the ASCE's assessment is right on track.\Experts said that coastal infrastructure does not work well under ""king"" tides, heavy storms, or heavy rains in part because of the state's low elevation, lack of pumping of water and some lack of attention.\""Stormwater (issues), like water and sewer, are not very glamorous and are therefore often ignored until they hit crisis mode,"" said Fred Bloetscher, an American Society of Civil Engineers member and a civil, environmental and geomatics engineering professor at Florida Atlantic University.\Experts also agreed that the crux of Graham's claim -- that Florida's coastal and stormwater infrastructure is not prepared to handle climate change -- is also accurate.\That's in part because the state isn't taking preventative measures to better prepare. For example, experts said a starting point for Florida would be to tighten building codes and increase the number of ""disaster reduction structures.""\Experts at the University of South Florida pointed to the ""monolithic concrete dome home"" that easily withstands hurricane winds and flooding events.\""We wonder why we don't see more of these,"" said T.H. Culhane, the director of climate change and sustainability at the University of South Florida.\But not all hope is lost, according to Dave Randle, USF's director of sustainable tourism.\""It might be too late for the next hurricane but the sooner we start the more we could prevent damage in the future,"" Randle said.\---\Our ruling\Graham said that Florida's coastal area and stormwater infrastructure are not prepared to handle climate change, adding that the state ""received D-plus and D ratings, respectively, by the American Society of Civil Engineers in 2016.""\Graham is accurately citing a report card given out by the oldest engineering society in the country and experts vouched for the group's assessment and Graham's larger point. Florida has failed to take preventative measures in the past and it needs to update its existing infrastructure to prepare for climate change.\We rate this claim True.\* * *\About this statement:\Published: Monday, September 25th, 2017 at 4:45 p.m.\Researched by: Allison Graves\Edited by: Katie Sanders\Subjects: Environment\Sources:\Interview, Matt Harringer, Gwen Graham's spokesman, Sept. 20-21\American Society of Civil Engineers, Report Card Florida's Infrastructure 2016, accessed Sept. 21\Email exchange, Florida Section of the American Society of Civil Engineers, Sept. 21\Interview, T.

199,"When it comes to electricity from the sun, Georgia has largely remained in the dark.\But a proposal is in the works to boost the amount of sun-powered  electricity, and it comes from two unlikely sources: Georgia Power and one of the state utility regulators.\The utility has been reluctant to add solar to the grid, saying it is too pricey and would raise customer bills. The Public Service Commission has shied away from making Georgia Power get more electricity from renewable sources for the same reason.\But a behind-the-scenes effort by Georgia Public Service Commissioner Chuck Eaton and Georgia Power has led to a project that will give Georgians more opportunities to buy solar power. Few details were available, but the project will be ""significantly"" larger than the 50 megawatts of solar electricity Georgia Power must have on the grid by 2015, Eaton said. One megawatt of solar can provide electricity for one large department store, such as a Super Target.\""I've been working with Georgia Power over the last couple of months to get more solar in the marketplace and do it in a manner that does not put upward pressure on rates,"" Eaton told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. ""The price of solar has come down dramatically.""\Georgia Power said it has been ""working with the PSC for the past several months to find new ways to responsibly add more solar to our mix without causing rates to go up for customers.\""We have been and will continue to look at ways to incorporate cost-effective resources into our generation portfolio,"" the company said.\The efforts are a sea change for the state, which, along with the Southeast, lags in getting electricity from renewable fuels. Georgia Power's parent, Atlanta-based Southern Co., gets 2 percent of its electricity from renewable sources, including hydroelectricity. California, in contrast, gets 47 percent, Florida 4 percent and North Carolina 2 percent, according to the most recent data, for 2011, from the Solar Energy Industries Association.\Georgia Power devised a plan to get 50 megawatts of its power from solar energy last year after state utility regulator Bubba McDonald asked the company to do so.\But the utility, along with state electric cooperatives, successfully lobbied in the state legislature against allowing consumers to lease solar panels from a private company with the help of bank financing.\Unlike traditional power plants that produce several hundred or thousand megawatts of electricity that travels over long power lines, solar systems typically are much smaller and are built on or near a home or business. The proposed project for Georgia Power would likely follow that model, with the utility buying solar electricity from other companies through competitive bidding, Eaton said.\""It would be from all of the solar companies that were out there,"" Eaton said.\One company, Georgia Solar Utilities, is eager to sell solar energy in the state and has proposed building an 80MW solar farm in Putnam County. Company executives presented the plan to the PSC at its energy committee meeting Thursday morning. By law, the company is forbidden to compete with Georgia Power or any other utility in the state.\Credit: STAFF"
200,"Georgia Power plans to substantially boost the amount of solar power it distributes to customers, citing falling costs that have made the source more competitive.\The utility said Wednesday it will buy more than 10 times the amount of solar electricity it currently gets from solar farms and rooftop array by 2017. If added today, the additional electricity would catapult the state to No. 4 in use of solar power, according to the most recent data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.\Other states will also likely be boosting solar power use at the same time, however, and even with the addition solar would comprise only about 2 percent of Georgia Power's output.\""We see this as a good first step toward increasing Georgia's infrastructure,"" said Jessica Moore, executive director of the Georgia Solar Energy Association.\Georgia Power disclosed the plan in a proposal Wednesday to the state Public Service Commission, which must approve. Customer bills will not be affected, the utility said.\The plan calls for Georgia Power to buy an additional 210 megawatts from solar sources. One megawatt can power about 450 homes or one SuperTarget store. The utility generates 16,000 megawatts in total, with coal, natural gas and nuclear the dominant generation sources.\Georgia Power, the state and the Southeast have been criticized by alternative energy advocates for lackluster use of renewables such as solar and wind power.\The utility's parent, Atlanta-based Southern Co., currently gets 2 percent of its fuel from all renewable sources, including hydroelectricity.\Georgia Power and Southern have vigorously fought policies to mandate levels of renewable electricity use. In Georgia, the company also lobbied against a bill that would let outside companies lease solar panels and then sell the electricity to that homeowner or business at a fixed rate.\Georgia Power will not build or operate the solar farms or rooftop panels to supply the sun-power boost. Instead the company will buy most of the power from large ""utility-scale"" solar farms. It will buy a smaller amount from homes and businesses with solar systems. The plan calls for lining up suppliers over the next couple years and ramping up purchases from 2015 through 2017.\Dropping solar costs are the main driver, company executives said, while pressure from customers, the solar industry and some utility regulators also figured in.\""Solar now is a lot more economic than it used to be,"" said Greg Roberts, Georgia Power's vice president of pricing and planning. ""And we've really done a lot of talking and listening to our customers and developers and are working with the [PSC].\The average cost of a rooftop solar array has dropped more than 46 percent since 2010, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. The cost of a solar panel system for a typical home has fallen to $15,000 from $40,000. Decreased technology and manufacturing costs, simpler designs and rising overseas competition are among the reasons.\A bill in the state legislature last winter would have allowed companies to install, own and maintain solar systems on homes and businesses. Customers would sign a long-term contract to pay for the electricity generated by those solar panels.\Georgia Power and the state's municipal and cooperative utilities argued that such companies would be illegally operating as a utility.\Roberts said Georgia Power's proposal is not a move to pre-empt any repeat effort this winter.\Some PSC members have pushed Georgia Power to boost alternative sources. Commissioner Chuck Eaton, running for a second term, said he has changed his stance on solar now that the cost has decreased.\""Solar has now entered the realm of competitive energy,"" he said. ""There have been folks that have been critical that we haven't gotten in earlier, but really what they are saying is, 'You should have paid three times for the solar what you are paying today.' ""\Large-scale solar projects mean more business for companies such as Alpharetta-based United Renewable Energy. The company is an engineering, procurement and construction contractor for commercial and industrial solar projects.\""The scale of what they are proposing is high,"" said Bill Silva, president and chief executive officer. ""To have clarity in the market in terms of the value renewable energy brings, then we'll be able to have our customers move forward on larger projects.""\Kim Kooles, a policy analyst with the Raleigh-based North Carolina Solar Center and the Database of State Incentives for Renewable Energy, noted that Georgia will remain among states without a mandated percentage of power from renewables. The state also should loosen its restrictions on how homeowners and businesses install and use solar panels, she said.\""If it's not doing those ... things, I wouldn't say it's 'cutting edge,' "" Kooles said. ""I say it's great for Georgia, but it's not a game changer.""\Credit: STAFF"
201,"It's hard to think of any contemporary writer who does a better job than Barbara Kingsolver of marrying fiction to the political: Native-American adoption in ""The Bean Trees,"" mining rights in ""Animal Dreams,"" colonialism and U.S. foreign policy in ""The Poisonwood Bible,"" the plight of the urbanized coyote in ""Prodigal Summer,"" and most recently, McCarthyism in 2009's ""Lacuna.""\Following in those footsteps, ""Flight Behavior,"" Kingsolver's 14th book, offers a master class in climate change through its impact on the kind of rural community most vulnerable to its effects and the least likely to recognize it.\As in her previous work, the lessons are so tightly woven into the story that every scene, every sentence, relays a part of the message, charting connections between subject and characters to emphasize one of her core themes: Everything is interrelated.\For the many conversations between the natural and the divine, the familiar and the unknown, ""God's will"" and science that take place in ""Flight Behavior's"" classroom --- tiny Feathertown, Tenn. --- main character Dellarobia Turnbow is the ideal go-between and a most willing student.\Whip smart and rebellious, fascinated by nature and science, Dellarobia has a hard time swallowing her Bible-belt community's one-size-fits-all answer for everything: ""The Lord works in mysterious ways.""\Though she once planned for college, a high-school pregnancy locked her into a dull-as-dishwater marriage at 17 with local farm boy, Cub Turnbow, and now, swamped with the care of two small children, she buries what's missing in her life under serial flirtations with local heartthrobs.\As the story opens, Dellarobia is on the verge of taking one of those casual flings much further, headed for a mountain cabin and a potentially home-wrecking rendezvous with her crush du jour, when what looks like a raging forest fire blocks her route.\But this is no ordinary fire: ""This consternation swept the mountains in perfect silence ... no smoke, no crackling howl.""\Reminding her of Moses' burning bush, the sight of the glowing forest --- which she doesn't realize yet is a biological event --- seems both personal and transcendent.\""Unearthly beauty had appeared to her, a vision of glory to stop her in the road. For her alone these orange boughs lifted, these long shadows became a brightness rising. It looked like the inside of joy, if a person could see that.... It had to mean something.""\Whatever it portends, the sight turns her right back around to her husband and kids, as well as the crushing boredom of life on his family farm, under the iron thumb of his tyrannical father, Bear, and overbearing mother, Hester.\Neither Dellarobia nor Cub have any say-so in the farm's affairs, the most recent of which is Bear's plan to clear-cut the timber on the mountain behind their home, even though it could have disastrous environmental effects.\But Dellarobia's fiery vision changes everything. ""Something had gotten into her. ... The arguments she'd always swallowed like a daily ration of pebbles had begun coming into her mouth and leaping out like frogs.""\Silent no more, she protests the deforestation that might rescue her father-in-law from foreclosure, and finds an unexpected ally in her mother-in-law, who sees the mountaintop ""miracle"" as ""the Lord's business.""\When a small cadre of biologists arrive to study the phenomenon, Dellarobia, hired on to help with cataloging data, becomes infatuated with the lead scientist, a strikingly tall, good-looking man with the improbable name of Ovid Byron.\Unlike her other flirtations, this one --- in one of many echoes of the book's title --- will follow a different flight pattern.\Dellarobia is one of Kingsolver's most appealing characters to date, her frustrations, twists and turns a familiar line of defense to anyone who's tried to keep a marriage going past its due date.\Yet despite walls that have long-ago closed in, her outlook is compassionate, combining tolerance and affection for her self-righteous in-laws; her best friend since childhood, Dovey; and the two children that tumble around her like puppies.\Kingsolver extends the same treatment to the residents of Feathertown, portraying them with dignity, humor and insight, even when their most important conversations take place in dollar and second-hand stores, kitchens and sheep-shearing barns.\Indeed, one of the most intriguing questions Kingsolver poses in ""Flight Behavior"" is whether hard science underpins the farming community's homespun wisdom, hinting at layers of knowledge that link the two.\The college students working under Ovid may be highly skilled research aides, but they're in awe of Dellarobia's sewing skills.

(It is) more and more being put into question.""\The Republican governor from Texas has made it clear he doesn't believe that human beings are contributing to global warming, and he expounded on the issue in detail at a stop in New Hampshire during his short run for president in the 2012 race.\PolitiFact asked the Perry campaign for comment on this, but we didn't hear back. In response to similar questions from The Washington Post, the Perry campaign pointed to various writings questioning climate change. But the Post's report noted these writings were anecdotal and ""not evidence of the groundswell of opposition suggested by Perry.""\PolitiFact reviewed several reports on the subject. Each concluded that the emissions of greenhouse gases from human activity were a factor in global warming.\A 2010 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences --- the official publication of the United States National Academy of Sciences --- found that out of 1,372 climate researchers under review, approximately 97 percent to 98 percent of those actively publishing in the field said they believe human beings are causing climate change.\Perry's remarks give the impression that the science of global warming is in dispute, that some scientists feel one way, and some scientists feel another way. He says that skepticism is growing. In fact, our research shows that's not the case. PolitiFact found that there is solid consensus among the major scientific organizations and that the skeptics seem to be a small minority.

Rick Perry in a September 2011 speech when the president said, ""You've got a governor whose state is on fire denying climate change.""\A White House spokesman defended Obama's remarks, saying there is a link between severe weather and climate change.\Historically, scientists have drawn a clear distinction between specific weather events and longer-range changes in climate, and that sentiment persists. The situation in Texas that Obama was referring to could be described as something broader than a specific weather event, and there is peer-reviewed evidence linking broader climate change in the American Southwest with the incidence of wildfires in the region.\The Texas state climatologist wrote around that time he believes climate change has had an effect in encouraging the current wildfires, but only as a modest contributing factor. This caution, combined with the difficulty of determining cause and effect in a system as complex as the Earth's atmosphere, led PolitiFact to rate Obama's claim Half True.\www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/28/barack-obama/barack-obama-slams-rick-perry-climate-change-citin/\Tim Pawlenty: ""The weight of the evidence (on global warming) is that most of it, maybe all of it, is because of natural causes ... it's fair to say the science is in dispute.""\Pawlenty, the former Minnesota governor who was briefly in the race for the 2012 GOP presidential nomination, made these comments to The Miami Herald.\PolitiFact divided his statement into two parts:\1) Evidence points toward climate change being primarily a natural, rather than manmade, phenomenon.\2) The science about the causes of global climate change is in dispute.\Based on our research, there is very little dispute in the scientific community, especially among climate specialists, on whether climate change is primarily caused by natural or manmade forces. The majority of scientists polled feel human activity is the primary driver of climate change. Based on scientific studies, global warming over the past 50 years has been primarily driven by human activity.\Pawlenty's claims are both incorrect and misleading to the public, who may not be familiar with the science behind climate change. It is not ""fair to say the science is in dispute,"" as if there are good arguments on both sides. Rather, there is significant scientific consensus that human beings are contributing to global warming.

203,"If at first you don't succeed, try, try again. Watching environmental groups eroding sound energy policy through death by a thousand cuts is a strong reminder.\For years, alternative energy was promoted as preparation for ""peak"" oil. Domestic energy exploration was hindered to ""protect the land."" Air and water pollution were cited to demonize coal. Then global warming/climate change was the reason to reduce coal and petroleum use.\Policymakers concerned about national security were urged to achieve energy independence, with no regard for how global markets operate. In this, biofuel profiteers have been complicit and protectionist. States were pressed to mandate energy portfolios with a percentage of renewable energy including wind, solar and biomass. The pot was sweetened with tax credits, subsidies, grants and rebates, all at taxpayer expense.\Georgia has wisely resisted such mandates. But more recently, a new strategy has become clear: the call for legislators to embrace alternative energy sources because ""it's good for the economy and the right thing to do.""\In an economy where job creation is important, legislators may fall for this ""moral"" argument. But it's as unpredictable as the future of renewable energy. Why? First, peak oil arguments were soundly defeated by recent discoveries of vast resources of domestic shale gas. In fact, current recoverable gas provides enough for at least the next 100 years. Technological advances are certain to improve upon that estimate.\Air quality has improved even as energy use increased. Between 1980 and 2011, GDP increased 128 percent, vehicle miles traveled increased 94 percent, energy consumption increased 26 percent and the U.S. population grew 37 percent. During that period, total emissions of the six principal air pollutants dropped by 63 percent. While carbon dioxide emissions increased 21 percent between 1980 and 2010, CO2 energy-related emissions are expected to decline to 5 percent below 2005 levels by 2040, according to the Energy Information Administration. That's largely thanks to better cars and more (cleaner, shale) natural gas energy.\The moral ""justification"" includes job creation. That hasn't worked in Spain, where a 2010 study found that for each green job financed by Spanish taxpayers, 2.2 real jobs were lost as an opportunity cost, and that 9 out of 10 green jobs created over the previous 10 years no longer existed. It hasn't worked in Germany, whose 80 percent renewable goal is proving so unaffordable that manufacturing industries --- and their jobs --- are leaving the country. Meanwhile, other countries are expanding their economies, using or extracting fossil fuels with far less regard for the environment. Europe is using the demonized coal exported from the U.S.\Imposing renewable energy upon Georgia's taxpayers raises the cost of living. The right thing to do is for government to allow the ingenuity of Americans to continue to create an affordable, reliable energy mix, not legislate on the basis of ""morality"" agendas of a vocal minority.\Benita M.

204,"If you lose a couple of toes to frostbite this morning, all Marshall Shepherd asks is this: Don't blame the polar vortex.\The previous deep freeze could be attributed to that mystical force spiraling over the North Pole. The current one is just a traditional, run-of-the-mill cold snap.\If Shepherd seems a little touchy about it, you can't blame him. The University of Georgia professor has spent a good part of this month trying to rescue the phrase from a tug of war between Rush Limbaugh and the White House.\Putting out such fires --- protecting his science, in other words --- has been his job for the past year as president of the American Meteorological Society.\The latest incident began with the dry, cold blast that shattered pipes, killed plants and closed schools across metro Atlanta --- and much of the Eastern United States. Limbaugh pronounced the explanation for the weather to be part of the leftist, global-warming conspiracy.\""Do you know what the polar vortex is? Have you ever heard of it? Well, they just created it for this week,"" the conservative radio provocateur said that cold Monday. ""Wackos are saying it's a great example of climate change.""\Believe it or not, the White House listens to Limbaugh.\Two days later, John Holdren, President Barack Obama's science adviser, was featured in a YouTube video. ""A growing body of evidence suggests that the kind of extreme cold being experienced by much of the United States, as we speak, is a pattern we can see with increasing frequency as global warming continues,"" Holdren said --- after throwing in a few caveats.\Enter Shepherd as referee. Limbaugh was dead wrong, the AMS president said. But the White House ""was a bit heavy-handed as well,"" he said in an interview this week.\A bit of background: The polar vortex has had an official presence in the meteorological lexicon since 1959. Limbaugh's lack of exposure notwithstanding, references date further, to the 1940s, Shepherd said.\Think of a jet stream of cold air that circles above the North Pole (and the South Pole, too) like water around a drain. Every now and then, a piece of the vortex runs off track --- freezing the bejeezus out of everyone in its wake.\The question is why. The White House cited research that points to Earth's increasing temperature as a counterintuitive reason for that particular dose of arctic air.\Like most scientists, Shepherd believes the data overwhelmingly supports global warming --- which has now been rechristened as climate change. But in politics, 80 percent certainty is called a landslide. In science, it's a call for more data.\So Shepherd, unlike the Obama administration, wasn't quite ready to tie the hot topic of global warming to a rampaging polar vortex.\""I think it's actually quite plausible, but from my lens, it's a bit too early to completely anchor that as a conclusive reason,"" Shepherd said in a White House-sponsored conversation of experts on the Internet.\Shepherd's term as president of the American Meteorological Society ends next month with a five-day conference at the Georgia World Congress Center. He will leave his post as he entered it --- concerned about the gap between what science has proved and what the general public is prepared to believe.\""In this state, it's still a bit tricky,"" Shepherd said. Georgia doesn't compare to North Carolina, where state lawmakers forbade discussions of climate change. ""But I still think there are some challenges,"" he added.\There is the general frustration when it comes to the acceptance of global warming. Shepherd's message for those who point to the continued existence of cold weather: Just because it's night, you can't argue that the sun has disappeared.\But there's more to his worry. A great deal of on-the-ground data is being generated as well, which will need to be absorbed by your city, county and state governments. Because global warming is coming to your neighborhood.\Shepherd said one of his doctoral students is about to publish a paper showing a substantial increase in extreme weather events around Atlanta that can be tied to climate change. The same study picks out counties that will be particularly vulnerable to drought in South Georgia.\Then there's the Georgia coast. I asked Shepherd whether residents there had accepted the fact that sea levels are rising --- another consequence of climate change. He referred me to Charles Hopkinson, another UGA professor and director of the Georgia Sea Grant College Program.\""We've spent the last five years working with communities to get them to rethink their vulnerability to flood and rising waters,"" Hopkinson said.\It is possible that the closer you live to big water, the more likely it is you believe in global warming. Hopkinson said his group is finishing up a study for Tybee Island, near Savannah, on the impact that rising sea levels will have on that community.\The community of St. Marys, farther south, is interested, too. All have felt the impact of skyrocketing costs for federally subsidized flood insurance. Make the right preparations and file the right paperwork, and everybody in the community gets a 5 percent break on flood insurance, Hopkinson said.\This is how ideological barriers are breached in America. We don't have to believe in science. We have insurance companies to do that for us.\Credit: STAFF"
205,"Heat-related deaths are likely to soar over the next 40 years due to climate warming, but new research has found that increase could be cut by more than half --- and virtually eliminated in Atlanta --- if major cities across the nation embraced a greener footprint.\The four-year study out of Georgia Tech is the first major national assessment of city residents' health, the impact of rising temperatures and what local officials could do to alleviate a growing crisis.\Heat already kills more people in the United States than hurricanes, tornadoes and earthquakes combined, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And science shows most major cities, including Atlanta, are already warming at two times the rate of the planet.\With the mercury likely to head higher in coming decades, the number of heat-related deaths in U.S. cities is projected to more than double by 2050, as the Tech report notes. A rise, too, is expected in heat-related illnesses including exhaustion and stroke, which can be fatal especially among vulnerable populations and can also add costs to the public health system.\Enter Tech planning professor Brian Stone Jr., whose research over the past few years has concentrated on climate warming and the concept of ""urban heat islands"" --- where a predominance of concrete and minimal amounts of vegetation exacerbate rising temperatures in cities.\The next obvious step, Stone said, was to look at what cities could do to counteract those conditions, especially the effects related to health and heat. ""We're moving into an era of climate adaption,"" said Stone, the director of Tech's Urban Climate Lab. ""But very few cities are studying how to manage rising temperatures.""\It is an issue of interest for the CDC, which funded Stone's new study. ""Climate change is very concerning from a public health standpoint,"" said Gino Marinucci, a strategy and policy adviser to the CDC's climate and health program at the National Center for Environmental Health.\The CDC has begun working directly with local communities about how to combat the effects of climate change, an effort helped by Stone's work. ""Awareness is increasing, but we still have a long way to go,"" Marinucci said.\Using Atlanta, Philadelphia and Phoenix as his models, Stone found the projected increase in heat-related deaths would be cut by nearly 60 percent if cities adopted sustainability measures including planting more trees and adding green space, decreasing impervious surface areas such as parking lots, and using more reflective materials on roads and rooftops.\Better yet, in his backyard of Atlanta, he found these measures could effectively prevent any increase, not least because they have greater effect if done in increasing numbers. Atlanta, Stone said, includes such a large, sprawling metro region that suburbs taking similar action to modify heat's impact would have a bigger effect on the core city.\The findings, published online last month by the academic journal PLOS ONE, are likely to encourage local efforts. Suzanne Burnes, the executive director of the nonprofit Sustainable Atlanta, said her group's work, including Look Up Atlanta, can build on Stone's work, which she said could be applied to related sustainability issues such as water and air quality.\""It's a positive step in seeing how these solutions are interrelated,"" Burnes said.\Credit: STAFF"

207,"It didn't take NNaserri Carew-Johnson long to learn how to discern the role the environment played in the length and severity of her asthma attacks or whether she had one at all.\From the day's pollen count to sudden changes in the seasons, she knew to be on high alert and keep her inhaler nearby.\""She learned very early on to police herself,"" said her mother, Vicki Carew of south Fulton County. ""She knows what symptoms to look for and what the triggers are, including climate change.""\That alone might put the 16-year-old far ahead of most of us.\While the majority of Americans think of melting snow caps and helpless polar bears sweltering under rising temperatures, climate change experts and a growing number of physicians are trying now to shift the conversation away from an environmental and national security issue to one of public health.\Here's why: Climate change will, absent other changes, amplify some of the existing health threats the nation now faces, said Dr. George Luber, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Climate and Health Program.\Children like NNaserri, the elderly, the sick, the poor, and some communities of color are especially vulnerable, he said.\""Some of these effects on health are already underway in the United States,"" Luber said. ""Children, primarily because of physiological and developmental factors, will disproportionately suffer from the effects of heat waves, air pollution, infectious illness, and trauma resulting from extreme weather events.""\According to the Georgia Department of Public Health, nearly 1 in 10 children in Georgia has asthma, and African- American children are twice as likely as white children to have asthma.\Asthma, which affects the lungs' airways, is considered the most chronic condition among children and the No. 1 cause of school absenteeism.\Dr. LeRoy Graham Jr., a pediatric pulmonologist and associate clinical professor at Morehouse School of Medicine, said the prevalence of asthma among Georgia children is now 12 percent, one of the highest in the nation.\""When I came in 1993, it was 6-7 percent,"" Graham said. ""It's undeniable that people living in the urban core, concentrated around central transportation corridor are at even greater risk of being diagnosed with asthma and dying from the disease.""\Not only is asthma more common in African-Americans, it is more common for all children living in congested urban environments, Graham said. And African-Americans as a group are two to four times more likely to be admitted to the hospital or emergency room for asthma and two times as likely to die of asthma, nationally.\Laura Seydel, who co-founded Mothers & Others for Clean Air with Stephanie Blank, has been working to improve the state's air quality since 2004.\""In the early 2000s, you couldn't turn on the news in the summer without hearing a forecast for a code red or a code purple day for air quality in Atlanta,"" Seydel said. ""In 2014, the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America ranked Atlanta 13th among the largest 100 U.S. metro areas as the most challenging place to live with asthma.""\Seydel said medical studies confirmed what they already knew --- that air pollution increases the risk of underdeveloped lungs, diminished lung function and other respiratory symptoms in healthy children.\The women founded Mothers & Others for Clean Air, a program of the American Lung Association, to help raise awareness about the negative health impacts of air pollution and to create change.\""Children should get to be children, and part of being a child is playing outside,"" Seydel said.\Because children like NNaserri, a track and field enthusiast, spend more time outdoors and breathe in more air than adults, they are particularly susceptible to air pollution.\Seydel said that while overall air quality has improved, more needs to be done to ensure everyone can breathe cleaner air every day.\""We have learned that even lower levels of air pollution are harmful,"" she said. ""The other threat comes from unregulated carbon emissions, which hurts us all because it contributes to global climate disruption, leading to rising temperatures, more air pollution, more frequent extreme weather events like we've seen here at home in the Southeast, and contributing to the spread of certain diseases. We are also likely to see more pollen and mold affecting children with allergies.""\As she's gotten older, NNaserri has fewer asthma attacks, her mother said, but only because she has remained diligent in sniffing out her triggers, including milk protein and sudden changes in the weather.\""It's times like these, when we go from winter to summer in one week that always seems to impact her,"" said Vicki Carew.\Even though 97 percent of climate scientists have concluded that human-caused climate change is happening, she and others fear the issue isn't being taken seriously enough.\""Climate change or global climate disruption is a threat to public health --- it's not just about polar bears anymore,"" Seydel said.\MORE ABOUT ASTHMA\Symptoms of an attack\* Coughing\* Shortness of breath or trouble breathing\* Wheezing\* Tightness or pain in the chest\Triggers\* Allergens (like pollen, mold, animal dander, and dust mites)\* Exercise\* Occupational hazards\* Tobacco smoke\* Air pollution\* Airway infections\Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\Credit: STAFF"
208,"WASHINGTON --- Georgia Tech climate researcher Judith Curry does not deny that humans contribute to global warming.\But the professor in the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences has won praise from Republicans on Capitol Hill by questioning the prevailing verdict that humans are the primary cause of rising temperatures and doubting the need for drastic, economy-shifting action by policy-makers.\Now one key Democrat is investigating whether Curry's voice is being funded by interests that profit from the energy status quo, a notion Curry flatly rejects and suggests ""intimidation and harassment"" as a motivation for the inquiry.\U.S. Rep. Raul Grijalva, D-Ariz., sent letters to the employers of Curry and six other climate researchers who have testified on Capitol Hill, asking for their funding sources and other information.\Grijalva, the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, cited a New York Times story about a Harvard-Smithsonian researcher who did not disclose grants from utilities such as Atlanta's Southern Co.\""They've all testified before Congress, and they've all been against the consensus about the warming of the planet,"" Grijalva told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution of the seven researchers he is investigating.\""Especially on Natural Resources, issues like climate change, you have to value the integrity of the science,"" he said.\Curry told the AJC that all her funding comes from government sources.\In a lengthy response on her blog, Curry pointed out that every time she testifies before Congress she includes information about her funding sources in written testimony, and she has never been asked about it before.\""I think that biases in testimony related to climate change are more likely to be ideological and political than related to funding,"" Curry wrote.\""So what is the point of asking for detailed financial information (including travel) from these academic researchers?"" she asked. ""Intimidation and harassment is certainly one reason that comes to mind.""\U.S. Rep. Jody Hice, a Monroe Republican who also serves on the House Natural Resources Committee, questioned whether the inquiry was a valuable use of the committee's time and energy.\""It is a shame that because a scientist has reached a different conclusion on climate science than the liberal elite that the integrity of her research would be called into question,"" Hice said in a prepared statement.\Curry has never testified before the Natural Resources Committee, but she has appeared multiple times on Capitol Hill.\Last year, she told the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee: ""Anthropogenic greenhouse warming (originating with human activity) is a theory whose basic mechanism is well understood, but whose magnitude is highly uncertain. Multiple lines of evidence presented in the recent (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) fifth assessment report suggest that the case for anthropogenic warming is now weaker than in 2007, when the fourth assessment report was published.""\Also on the panel that day before the Democratic-controlled committee was Andrew Dessler of Texas A&M University.\""We know the climate is warming,"" Dessler testified. ""We know that humans are now in the driver's seat of the climate system. We know that, over the next century, if nothing is done to rein in emissions, temperatures will likely increase enough to profoundly change the planet. I wish this weren't true, but it is what the science tells us.""\The story of Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics researcher Wei-Hock Soon prompted Grijalva's inquiry. The New York Times found that Soon accepted $1.2 million from the fossil fuel industry in the past 10 years and often did not disclose the funding.\Soon has said that global warming can be explained by variations in the sun's energy. The Times, via documents unearthed by the environmental group Greenpeace, found that $409,000 of Soon's funding came from Southern Company Services, a subsidiary of the Atlanta-based utility giant. Southern has been one of the most aggressive and active forces in Washington opposing the Obama administration's regulations on carbon emissions.\In his letter to Georgia Tech President G.P. Peterson, Grijalva wrote: ""My colleagues and I cannot perform our duties if research and testimony provided to us is influenced by undisclosed financial relationships.""\Among other requests, Grijalva asked for Georgia Tech's policy on financial disclosure, Curry's disclosure forms, Curry's government testimony, any correspondence related to preparing her testimony, a detailed description of Curry's external funding and her pay since 2007.\Credit: STAFF"

Some wineries are already moving their production toward the poles, where the heat can be less unrelenting. Warmer weather may also affect the taste and alcohol content of wine because temperature-induced chemical processes that occur within growing grapes could make them less desirable to consumers.""\""Oh my, that's bad.""\""No, that's good.

He said the plan is the best chance for the U.S. to show leadership, ahead of a possible United Nations climate agreement to be negotiated by mid-December.\He called the Clean Power Plan ""the single most important step America has ever taken in the fight against global climate change.""\Overall, EPA estimates the plan will result in a 32 percent reduction in carbon emissions from 2005 levels. The mandates phase in from 2022 to 2030, and states are to come up with their own strategy for meeting the targets. Georgia's target --- a reduction of 16 million tons of carbon from 2012 levels --- is in the middle range of states, as the state already uses a fairly diverse mix of electricity.\U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., whose state is almost completely dependent on coal-generated power, has urged states to ignore the rule. Janet McCabe, acting assistant administrator for EPA's Office of Air and Radiation, said the federal government would impose its own plan on states that fail to produce one, but ""we're quite a long time away from that event.""\More than a dozen states sued the EPA based on the proposed rule, but Georgia was not among them. Now that the plan is final, Georgia is expected to challenge it in court.\For a president who said during his first campaign that future generations will look back and say ""this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal,"" Obama's climate policy has had its ups and downs.\Congress, even under Democratic control, stymied Obama's first-term plans for a cap-and-trade system to reduce carbon emissions. So Obama has pushed the limits of EPA's powers under the Clean Air Act to regulate power plants and the heat-trapping gases scientists say threaten the planet's future. He has been met with resistance at every turn.\Critics argue that restricting power generation harms the economy, that renewable energy is not reliable enough and that Obama's efforts will have little practical effect on climate change --- particularly with China surpassing the U.S. as the world's top emitter.\The White House and environmental groups paint a dirty picture of Georgia's carbon-damaged environment. Asthma, for example, harms 8 percent of adult Georgians and 11 percent of its children, according to the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\Nearly 60 million metric tons of carbon pollution were emitted into the atmosphere by Georgia power plants in 2013. That's equivalent to the amount of pollution caused annually by 12 million cars.\Georgia politicians have done little to mitigate climate change. Deal, unlike his predecessor, has no energy strategy. A 2006 carbon registry proposal, intended to inventory the state's greenhouse gases, is dead.\Atlanta corporate bigwigs Coca-Cola and UPS joined Fortune 500 companies across the country last week in support of Obama's efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and invest in clean energy. The dozen or so companies pledged to spend $140 billion to reduce carbon emissions and create 1.6 gigawatts of new clean energy projects.\But Southern Company, the parent company of Georgia Power, has repeatedly battled with the Obama administration on its power plant regulations.\""The implications of the overreaching rules directly impact national energy policy and impede states' authority to act in the best interests of customers,"" Georgia Power spokesman Jacob Hawkins said.\Hawkins pointed to moves Georgia Power has taken to reduce emissions.\Coal accounts for 41 percent of Georgia Power's energy portfolio, down from 62 percent in 2011. The state's largest electricity supplier has shuttered coal-burning plants and modernized others to increase efficiency. Natural gas --- plentiful, cheap and cleaner than coal --- is increasingly added to Georgia's energy mix.\And more reductions are on the way. Georgia Power plans to eliminate 15 coal- and oil-fired units and is spending $6 billion to retrofit coal plants to reduce CO2, sulfur dioxide and mercury.\The environmental construction program comes as the company has also begun increasing, albeit slowly, its renewable energy portfolio, including solar power. The White House credits Georgia with a 55 percent increase in renewable energy since 2008.\Georgia Power's power sources\Coal 41% Oil and gas 35%\Nuclear 22% Hydro 2%\Coming Sunday\Georgia officials acknowledge the reality of climate change yet have done little to combat the threat.

211,"ST. MARYS --- Georgia's wildlife agency minced no words recently in declaring climate change ""a threat inherent with uncertainty,"" perhaps the state's starkest warning ever on a politically sensitive subject dismissed by many elected officials.\Here, though, on Georgia's 100-mile-long coast, most everybody takes seriously rising seas and dying marshes caused by drastic changes in the Earth's climate. They live already with the proof: greater tidal surges; flooded roads; and ages-old trees killed by salt water creeping further inland.\If the dire predictions of state, federal and university scientists prove true, then billions of dollars of property in Brunswick, Darien, St. Marys and Savannah and on the islands of St. Simons, Sea and Tybee will be under water within a century.\Much of the coast's ecologically critical salt marsh will die off. Upland streams will turn brackish. Sparrows and shrimp will disappear if, as predicted, the Atlantic Ocean rises an additional 3 feet by 2110.\""No matter if you believe climate change is natural or man-made, sea levels are rising and it behooves us to know how to plan and respond,"" said Clark Alexander, the director of the Applied Coastal Research Laboratory on Skidaway Island. ""If we don't start preparing now, it will become a bigger problem later.""\Georgia has no grand plan to combat climate change or its effects. State leaders ignore, sidestep or downplay climate-change warnings. Most remain unconvinced of man's role in Earth's warming.\Brian Robinson, a spokesman for Gov. Nathan Deal, wouldn't answer questions about the governor's views on climate change. U.S. Sen. David Perdue, a Republican who lives on Sea Island, a barrier island threatened by rising seas, said ""the scientific community is not in total agreement about whether mankind has been a contributing factor.""\""That's why we must find an appropriate balance between responsibly protecting the environment and continuing to develop our abundance of natural resources in order to grow the economy and improve people's quality of life,"" he added in a statement.\David Stooksbury, the former state climatologist, said the unwillingness of leaders to address climate change is dangerous.\""I don't think that most of our elected officials understand the long-term seriousness of what climate change will do to the agricultural economy, public health and the environment,"" he said. ""It will be much cheaper and better for the state if we follow a well-developed plan starting now rather than waiting until we must respond.""\Some steps underway\President Barack Obama last week unveiled a major climate-change plan that would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by one-third by 2030. His edict, which met with widespread scorn from many conservatives and others who discount climate change, follows repeated scientific warnings that the Earth is getting hotter. Some states are suing to block the White House ruling; Georgia has yet to take action.\Last year was the warmest since 1880, according to NASA, and the 10 hottest years recorded (with one exception, 1998) have all occurred since 2000. James Hansen, NASA's former lead climate scientist, and 16 co-authors reported last month that glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica will melt 10 times faster than previously estimated. If true, sea levels are projected to rise at least 10 feet within 50 years.\A hotter planet melts icebergs and causes ocean water to warm and expand, fueling the rise of the world's seas and making coastal communities nervous. St. Marys, in Georgia's southeastern corner and surrounded by rivers, creeks and marsh, is precariously perched 10 feet above sea level.\""No one really knows the projected impact of sea rise,"" said John Holman, the city's manager. ""Everyone is trying to understand it. It needs more study. For us, it's an important issue.""\The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts that a 3-foot rise in sea level would inundate St. Marys' historic district with its majestic oaks, white picket fences and 1808 Presbyterian church with an iron bell cast by Paul Revere.\Two years ago, the feds put up most of the cost of a $160,000 study intended to alert St. Marys to the potential dangers of climate change. A report, which will detail the costs associated with protecting the city from surging seas, is expected any day.\St. Marys isn't waiting. The City Council voted three years ago to raise the height of first floors in buildings constructed in flood plains. It's considering raising walkways at new municipal buildings to allow water to seep into the ground and not pool or flood. Officials are also weighing an enterprise fund just for stormwater projects. And the city's 2030 strategic plan will likely emphasize rising seas.\""Sea-level rise will be costly, if the projections are accurate, for the city to prepare for,"" Holman said. ""But, by working in advance, we'll get a head start. We'll take precautionary measures.""\He added, ""I believe we're in better shape than Tybee Island.""\As much as two-thirds of the popular beach town near Savannah would disappear by 2110 if NOAA's sea-level predictions hold true.\""It's good to see the state agency charged with protecting Georgia's environment catching up with the military in factoring climate change into long-range plans,"" said Paul Wolff, a Tybee councilman. ""As a resident of a community on the front lines of sea-level rise, I believe every level of government needs to be proactive in reducing, planning for and adapting to the effects of a changing climate.""\Last month the wildlife resources division of the Department of Natural Resources issued its State Wildlife Action Plan, or SWAP, which states unequivocally that ""climate change presents unprecedented challenges."" The federal government requires states to submit a SWAP every 10 years or risk losing conservation money for at-risk fish and wildlife. Georgia received $1.2 million the past fiscal year.\""Climate change is impacting species and habitats, and these effects are projected to increase substantially over time,"" the SWAP says. ""These climate-driven changes will profoundly affect our ability to conserve fish and wildlife and their habitats.""\The first SWAP, issued in 2005, mentioned climate change and global warming, but it said ""local effects are often difficult to quantify."" Then-Gov. Sonny Perdue followed up a year later with a State Energy Strategy, which stated that ""strong scientific evidence exists that increasing emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases (GHG) are affecting Earth's climate."" The 138-page report, with three pages devoted to climate change, listed potential dangers and recommended that the state inventory carbon dioxide emissions.\South viewed at risk\A tidal gauge off Fort Pulaski near Tybee has tracked the slow but steady rise --- 11 inches over the past 80 years --- of the Atlantic Ocean. The sea began rising dramatically in the 1990s. Climate scientists now predict an additional 40-inch surge by 2110.\""Every storm that comes ashore will intrude further inland and will become more dangerous, and we will have more days of nuisance flooding,"" said Alexander of the University of Georgia's Skidaway Institute below Savannah, where scientists study marine and environmental sciences.\Georgia Tech researchers estimate that 30 percent, or 419 square miles, of Chatham, Liberty and McIntosh counties will be under water by 2110 if the sea keeps rising at its current rate. Georgia's barrier islands will be swamped, and some coastal towns will experience billions of dollars of damage to municipal infrastructure --- road, water and sewer --- and private property.\Man, though, can adapt. The natural world may take it on the chin as salt water pushes further inland into fresh water. Two-thirds of Georgia's saltwater marsh system --- an ecologically critical habitat for fish and wildlife --- could disappear.\""You have a whole host of species dependent on that salt marsh environment,"" said Jason Lee, a DNR coastal expert who helped write the SWAP's 11-page section on climate change. ""The food web would collapse. Marsh birds would have to seek habitat elsewhere. Shrimp and crabs would be affected. Sea turtles would also be a primary concern, (as) would several shorebirds that nest and forage along the coast. You could see significant ecosystem impacts.""\Hotter weather, droughts and more frequent and intense downpours will make an impact on the natural environment statewide, the SWAP reports, and harm North Georgia habitats for mountain brook trout and patch-nosed salamanders. Rising temperatures --- some estimates predict an 8- to 20-degree increase in future Julys --- would allow invasive species such as kudzu, gypsy moths and feral hogs to spread further north.\""It's a really good sign that the state of Georgia is recognizing and planning for the impact of climate change,"" said Jennette Gayer, the director of Environment Georgia. ""This is a great first step, and I hope to see more forward-thinking reports like this to really plan for the future.""\Other state agencies and universities have also sounded the climate-change alarm. The website for the DNR's coastal resources division says that ""the Earth's changing climate is one of coastal Georgia's greatest environmental challenges."" A 2012 Georgia Ports Authority presentation listed the impact of rising seas on the docks and terminals.\UGA's agriculture extension agency educates farmers about the risks of climate change. The university's Sea Grant program steers federal and state money to coastal communities, including Tybee and St. Marys, preparing for rising seas, climate change and other threats.\The Georgia Initiative for Climate and Society, a network of UGA scientists, including Marshall Shepherd, seeks to better understand the threats posed by a warming climate. Shepherd, who runs the university's Atmospheric Sciences Program, says the South is particularly vulnerable to climate change.\All the warnings, though, have failed to translate into concerted and meaningful action by Georgia leaders.\Many skeptics among leadership\The governor hasn't crafted an energy strategy as his predecessor did. The 2006 carbon registry proposal is dead. State senators passed a resolution in 2012 urging Congress to prevent the Environmental Protection Agency from further regulating greenhouse gases without more research on carbon dioxide's impact on climate change.\States, though, must take climate change seriously or risk losing hundreds of millions of federal dollars.\Georgia is one of nine states that doesn't mention climate change in federally required disaster mitigation plans. It has until 2019 to comply. But, starting next year, the Federal Emergency Management Agency will only give money to states with plans that address climate change. Through 2012, according to the Center for Climate Change Law, Georgia had received about $180 million in FEMA grants to help buy land vulnerable to flooding as well as other prevention measures.\The SWAP recommends a slew of research and conservation measures to combat climate change over the next decade. Sea turtles, saltmarsh sparrows, Nelson's sparrows and right whales should be further monitored and protected.\Butterfly and migratory bird habitats within utility corridors should be upgraded. The northern march of kudzu and gypsy moths should be halted. Large swaths of the Altamaha River corridor, and other vulnerable waterways, should be joined and protected to allow unfettered migration of animals. Streams and wetlands should be further buffered.\It's questionable, though, whether state and federal officials will put up the money to help a warming planet.\""By not having a comprehensive climate-change plan and following it, Georgians, in the long run, will be spending more to adapt,"" said Stooksbury, the state's former climatologist who was fired by Deal in 2011. ""I am not very hopeful that these changes will be made until is it painfully obvious.""\Deal, like many Georgia politicians, takes a half-pregnant position on climate change. Most don't deny that the climate is changing, yet they question whether the problem is man-made. Deal says it's a federal, not state, issue. Yet, he passed on an opportunity in September to slam the EPA over efforts to curb power plant emissions.\The chairmen of the state House and Senate committees that craft environmental and energy policies blame nature, not man, for the projected surge in temperatures and sea levels.\""We should understand that Mother Nature is the lead power in climate change,"" said state Sen. Ross Tolleson, the chairman of the Natural Resources and Environment Committee.\State Rep. Don Parsons, the chairman of the House Energy Committee and a Marietta Republican, said ""there's always a point when you have to ask about what doing more will cost the state of Georgia.""\Some coastal lawmakers also question the urgency to do something about climate change.\""I, for one, don't see it as being a serious problem,"" said Barry Brown, a Tybee city councilman. ""Sometimes these things just get brought up to get people in a panic to buy something. Whether or not they have the facts to back it up, I haven't seen any.""\Georgia hasn't gone as far as neighboring states in dismissing climate change. Florida Gov. Rick Scott reportedly ordered government officials in March not to use the term in reports or press releases. In 2012, the North Carolina Legislature imposed a four-year moratorium on state rules, plans or policies based on expected changes in sea level.\U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson, like Perdue, cites ""mixed scientific evidence"" about the origins of Earth's warming. While both senators acknowledged in January that ""climate change is not a hoax,"" they also opposed legislation linking changing temperatures to human activity. Each takes a conservative, pro-business position that carbon dioxide regulations will hamper business.\""We all care about the environment,"" Isakson said on the floor of the Senate in March. ""We just don't all subscribe to the same theory about what happens.""\Wolff, the Tybee councilman and environmentalist, says politicians in Washington and Atlanta need to embrace the dangers of climate change, regardless of who's at fault, before it's too late.\""It's unfortunate that they don't seem to understand the urgency we're facing on the coast,"" he said. ""They should be doing a lot more to (fight) climate change. The science is irrefutable. It isn't hypothetical to us. It's real life.""\Credit: STAFF"
212,"TYBEE ISLAND --- There wasn't supposed to be any water, let alone waves lapping U.S. 80 as Paul Wolff tooled back from Savannah on a spring evening five years ago. The Chevy Metro rolled down the eastern side of the Bull River bridge and smack-dab into an unnaturally high tide pushed leeward by strong southeasterly winds.\""The water was coming right over the marsh. It was scary,"" said Wolff, a Tybee Island councilman. ""I just plowed right through it.""\He learned two costly lessons that night. One, the car's undercarriage had to be replaced. Two, high tides are dangerous, occur with greater frequency and will cost coastal Tybee Island tens of millions of dollars to prepare for.\U.S. 80 is the only road on and off Tybee Island and it floods, in spots, about a half-dozen times a year, usually during spring high, or ""king,"" tides. By 2060, according to Georgia scientists, the road is expected to flood 50 times a year due to climate change and its impact on sea levels.\Tybee, largely at the urging of Wolff, takes climate change more seriously than any other Georgia community. With good reason. Two-thirds of the island could be under water within a century if current predictions of sea-level rise prove true, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\A tidal gauge just off Tybee's western edge shows that the Atlantic Ocean here has risen, on average, an inch every decade since 1935. Since the 1990s, though, the degree of sea-level rise has tripled, says Clark Alexander, the director of the nearby Skidaway Institute of Oceanography.\An additional 3 feet of water, as projected, would submerge Tybee's southwestern corner and hundreds of homes built there upon river bottom reclaimed in the 1930s for real estate development.\""Tybee,"" Alexander said, ""would be in a world of hurt.""\In 2012, the feds put up $100,000 for a Community Climate Adaptation Initiative to study the impact of sea-level rise on Tybee over the next 50 years. The report details the most endangered parts of the island and which infrastructure --- roads, wells, storm water drains --- should be climate-proofed.\A flooded U.S. 80 isn't the only precursor of what's in store for the island's 3,000 year-round residents. High tides and heavy rains create ponds of water that too slowly disappear. Flooding is exacerbated by tidewater clogging the storm drains.\""We are facing imminent challenges from rising sea levels due to climate change,"" said Wolff, 64, who runs a bed-and-breakfast, draws energy from rooftop solar panels and bikes everywhere on the island. ""The good news is it's coming slowly enough. We hope we'll have time to adapt.""\The city is planning for a 14- to 20-inch sea-level rise by 2060. It has already mandated that new driveways be permeable to allow rainwater to seep into the ground. It is identifying properties at risk of flooding. It will study the financial feasibility of elevating houses out of the flood plain, which, eventually, could result in lower flood insurance premiums.\The city spent $60,000 on two tide gates to prevent seawater from clogging storm drains during heavy rains. A ""living shoreline,"" created with mud and oyster shells, will be built around the island's southwestern edge. The electronics controlling Tybee's three water wells will be flood-proofed at a cost of $200,000 each.\Federal and state treasuries covered most of a recent $11 million beach renourishment plan. State transportation officials are considering a $100 million upgrade to flood-proof U.S. 80.\""If we don't want to be treading water or having our grandchildren growing gills, we definitely need to spend this money now instead of putting it off,"" Wolff said as distant thunder presaged a storm. ""The longer we procrastinate, the more expensive it will be.""\Credit: STAFF"
213,"Under the new climate-change plan released by the Obama administration, Georgia will be required to reduce carbon emissions from its power plants by 25 percent over the next 15 years, a considerably more modest target than state leaders had feared.\Nonetheless, the reaction has been predictable: Such a reduction can't be accomplished, or if it can be done, it will come at enormous cost to electricity customers and the economy. As U.S. Sen. David Perdue put it, ""The damaging effects of this hostile executive action will drive up energy prices for Georgia families and businesses, while the ripple effect throughout our economy will increase costs of basic necessities for those already struggling to make ends meet.""\Relax. We've been through this before. Back in the early to mid-'90s, for example, the federal government classified metro Atlanta as a serious non-attainment area for air pollution, requiring the region to set a strict schedule for air-quality improvement. The reaction was much as you see today.\Georgia Power complained that it would send electricity rates soaring. The new standards were supposed to be the ""death knell"" of economic development in the region, and the degree of air-quality improvement required was claimed by some to be all but impossible.\Then-Gov. Zell Miller wrote an angry letter of protest to the EPA, warning of ""enormous economic and jobs consequences."" For a short period, highway projects were canceled and the region was stripped of federal transportation money until it complied and committed to an improvement plan. (The state's auto emissions-inspection program is the most visible outcome of that plan.)\Today, despite the naysayers, the air in metro Atlanta is demonstrably clearer than it was two decades ago. The eye-stinging, throat-burning ozone that routinely accumulated on hot summer days is now a rare occurrence. It's safer for human beings to play outside, work outside. It is safer to simply breathe. What supposedly couldn't be done --- or couldn't be done without turning metro Atlanta into a economic wasteland --- has in fact been largely accomplished at relatively low cost, although continued improvement is still necessary.\In many ways, complying with the Clean Power Plan should be even easier, because many of the required changes are already underway. Georgia is already getting credit for taking coal-fired generation out of service and replacing it with nuclear power. And just a few years ago, Georgia Power steadfastly dismissed solar power as a possible option in Georgia, saying it was too expensive and the state didn't get enough sunshine; today it says that ""the future of solar is bright in Georgia.""\Judging from his own measured response, Gov. Nathan Deal seems to accept that reality. Rather than grandstand, Deal has instructed state officials to find the best possible way to meet the new standards. As a report last month by researchers at Georgia Tech concluded, a strategy of renewable energy and energy efficiency here in the South would not only bring us into compliance but produce ""substantial collateral benefits including lower electricity bills across all customer classes, greater GDP growth, and significant reductions"" in air pollution.\Credit: STAFF"
214,"Atlanta-based Southern Company, for the second time this week, said Wednesday it is buying a controlling interest in a California solar farm.\The acquisition of the 300-megawatt Desert Stateline Facility, from First Solar Inc., marks the utility's largest push into solar. It's also another step in Southern Co.'s expanding renewable energy portfolio.\The company has 20 solar, wind or biomass projects across the country. More than 3,300 megawatts of renewable energy projects have been added or announced since 2012, though solar remains a small part of the overall mix.\The utility giant is moving away from coal-generated electricity. Last week Southern said it would buy AGL Resources, an Atlanta gas pipeline company, for $12 billion in cash and debt.\Southern Co.'s energy mix breaks down like this: 45 percent generated by natural gas; 35 percent by coal; 16 percent by nuclear; and 4 percent by hydro and renewables.\Earlier this week, Southern Power, a subsidiary of what will become the nation's second largest utility based on customers served, announced the purchase of a controlling interest in Recurrent Energy's 200-megawatt Tranquillity Solar Facility in Fresno County, California.\""We are accelerating the development of solar as an important component of a diverse fuel mix now and in the future,"" Southern Co. CEO Thomas Fanning said in a statement about the deal announced Wednesday.\Construction of the 1,685-acre Stateline solar farm in San Bernardino County began last October. It is Southern Power's seventh California acquisition. Once on-line, Stateline could generate enough electricity for nearly 100,000 homes. It should be fully operational in late 2016. The energy will be sold to Southern California Edison.\Credit: STAFF"
215,"President Barack Obama used his recent trip to Alaska -- and about every other opportunity he's gotten -- to proclaim that climate change is the most important issue of our time. ""We're here today to discuss the challenge that will define the contours of this century more dramatically than any other -- that's the urgent and growing threat of a changing climate,"" he said.\While not all environmental scientists agree with the president, most of the mainstream media emphatically do. And they are the ones who will be grilling Republican candidates -- and not just the presidential candidates.\That means GOP office-seekers need to be informed about climate change matters and ready with clear, evidence-backed answers. What are some of the key issues?\Is the earth warming? Well, it certainly has warmed since what was known as the Little Ice Age -- a cold period that lasted from about 1550 to 1850. There has been a gradual increase since about 1910, with a strong uptick between the mid-1970s and about 1997. Since then, global temperatures have been relatively flat.\But the flattening came after a significant warming trend. That means even a slight temperature increase in a given year allows the media to claim it is the warmest year on record, even if the change is within the margin of error.\While we don't know whether the warming trend will resume in the near future, we do know that almost all the global warming proponents never saw the flattening coming. They incorrectly predicted much warmer temperatures that have not occurred.\And now some climate scientists are predicting a multiyear cool-down, a mini-ice age, within the next decade or so that could raise further questions about the temperature trend.\Is Arctic ice melting? While in Alaska, the president visited Exit Glacier, which has been shrinking for decades. Yes, Arctic ice has been gradually declining -- but Antarctic ice has been growing.\We know the rise-and-fall process has been going on naturally for millennia, without any help from mankind. What we don't know -- though many will say we do -- is whether the recent temperature increase is part of the natural variation that occurs about every 100,000 years or is caused by human activity.\Are humans to blame? Carbon dioxide has been increasing, and most climate scientists believe man is playing a role in that increase. But is carbon dioxide causing the warming?\As the Environmental Protection Agency shows, for the past 400,000 years, temperature levels and carbon dioxide levels have followed virtually identical tracks.\Can the U.S. solve the problem? Journalists will ask what Republican candidates intend to do about climate change.\The U.S. is responsible for about 14.5 percent of world carbon emissions, with China at 23.5 percent. When you're only 14.5 percent of the total, you have to make huge carbon reductions just to decrease total emissions by a fraction of a percent.\The good news, at least for conservative candidates, is that the public ranks cutting carbon emissions very low among their priorities for the upcoming election.\Even so, the environment, and specifically climate change, is one of the media's biggest issues, and they are likely to make it very hot for Republican candidates who don't know the facts or give them politically incorrect answers.\Credit: STAFF"
216,"Oglethorpe --- Construction of Stagecoach Road lopped off two smallish tracts from Donald Chase's corn and peanut farm, rendering the land all but useless. Until, one day, Chase had a bright idea.\Why not lay in 10 acres of solar panels, he thought, and connect the power to a nearby substation?\""A farmer's got to look out 20 years and say, 'Do I want to rent my land for $250 to $300 an acre or do I want to lock into $1,400 an acre each year?' "" Chase said recently. ""Farmers, in the future, are not going to be able to continue to farm here or provide for their folks. Solar can help them.""\Georgia, finally, is farming the sun. Solar only accounts for about 1 percent of the state's electric power. Yet Georgia has one of the highest per capita growth rates for solar power in the country. The amount of electricity produced by the sun over Georgia has quintupled since 2010.\Farmers across the state are leasing plots where solar ""developers,"" many of them metro Atlanta-based companies, can erect fields of glistening panels to collect rays. The power then goes into the grid for distribution by Georgia Power or another utility.\Nearly 200 companies and 3,000 people now work in the solar industry in Georgia.\About 90 percent of the Georgia-generated power comes from huge solar arrays built mostly atop former cotton, peanut and hay fields, the rest from rooftop arrays on homes or businesses. Federal tax credits, along with Georgia Power, created the state's solar industry almost overnight. Plentiful sun, cheap land and rural counties desperate for any community-sustaining work provided the local ingredients.\""Georgia, obviously, has made huge progress in solar farms and almost all are in rural counties,"" said Shan Arora, a project manager at Southface, an Atlanta nonprofit that promotes environmentally sustainable living. ""And counties going solar have shown their neighbors that solar is possible --- it's not something that's a theory.""\The surge may prove fleeting. The tax credit and Georgia Power's solar-inducement program, both to encourage installation, are set to soon expire or be scaled back. And Georgia, unlike other states, doesn't mandate that a certain amount of energy be derived from the sun, wind or other renewable sources.\""But the tax credit and Georgia Power project did exactly what they were supposed to do: kick start a market and generate economies of scale,"" said Jennette Gayer, director of the nonprofit Environment Georgia. ""They made solar easier and cheaper to install in the future.""\Down on the farm\After a life spent milking cows, first on his daddy's farm and then on his own, B.L. Kent says it's time to retire.

His children left the farm long ago too.\He rents 262 acres of non-irrigated land to a peanut and cotton farmer for $48 an acre, not enough to retire on. So Kent was all ears when Atlanta-based Beltline Energy contacted him last year with a ""way better"" offer to lease his land for 20 years.\Beltline put the deal together and, along with Hecate Energy, won a piece of Georgia Power's solar portfolio. Jenkins County Commissioners approved the industrial rezoning. Hecate, out of Tennessee, will erect about 65,000 solar panels on 200 acres of Kent's property. Georgia Power will buy the electricity from Hecate which will maintain the array and pay county taxes on the infrastructure.\The key to the deal, Kent says, is a 5-acre plot of land that his father sold to the utility 50 years ago. On it sits an electric power substation in very close proximity to the future solar array.\""We already got a lot of wires going this way and that over the property,"" Kent said. ""That's what the solar company was wanting.""\The criteria for a successful solar farm are pretty basic: strong sun; relatively inexpensive, flat land; proximity to a substation; low taxes; and eager local officials. Beltline and other solar developers look particularly for power lines criss-crossing the state's Fall Line which stretches from Augusta to Macon to Columbus. Much of the sandy soil is worn out, ruined by decades of cotton production and, therefore, inexpensive.\Farmers like Chase in Oglethorpe offer up smaller, unused parcels of land. The two, five-acre solar fields on Stagecoach Road are now covered in panels. A substation sits alongside one of the fields.\""It's something you should at least look into if you have marginal land that's not earning any money,"" said Chase, 50.\Taylor County, up the road from Oglethorpe, is fast becoming Solar Central. Commissioners and farmers have eagerly approved four large-scale solar arrays, ranging in size from 150 to 911 acres --- the largest east of the Mississippi --- controlled by a subsidiary of Atlanta's Southern Company.\Other utilities own Taylor County arrays. In all, 3500 acres in the county southwest of Macon will soon be covered in photovoltaic cells, generating enough juice to power about 63,000 homes. The county leased hundreds of acres in its industrial park to the sun seekers.\Taylor offers some ad valorem tax breaks, but nonetheless expects property taxes and permit fees to add as much as $40 million to county coffers over the next two decades. About 2,000 temporary construction jobs are being created, backers say. It took half an hour the other day to order lunch at the Subway in Butler.\""Our school system is already trying to figure out what to do with all these resources,"" said Clinton Perry Jr., a commissioner. ""We're an agricultural community that's been waiting a long time for projects like these. We hope this will be the seed to bring about more growth for our county. We're very excited. We feel blessed.""\Tax credits give push\Congress in 2006 kick started the nation's solar industry with a 30 percent construction tax credit for businesses and homeowners. Georgia Power furthered the state's renewable energy push with its Advanced Solar Initiative (ASI) approved by the Public Service Commission in 2012.\The state's largest utility committed to buy 745 megawatts of power generated by the sun. In all, 500 residential, commercial and industrial-sized projects should be on line by the end of 2016, a Georgia Power spokesman says.\The state ranked No. 20 in the total amount of solar energy created last year, Environment Georgia reports.\North Carolina generates more solar energy than all Southeastern states combined. A 35 percent state tax credit, and mandated solar energy production targets, makes the industry much more viable in the Old North State. Georgia has neither. And Georgia Power will end its solar program in 2016, about the same time Washington all but ends its tax credit program.\""We still subsidize fossil fuels, so it's unreasonable to (limit) solar subsidies after only a couple of years,"" said Environment Georgia's Gayer.\President Obama's Clean Power Plan, which requires states to dramatically reduce carbon pollution by 2030, could re-energize the solar industry. If so, large-scale arrays will continue to grow across South Georgia further transforming the rural economy and the landscape.\""It'll be all right,"" said Kent whose farmhouse will be surrounded on three sides by row upon row of solar panels, ""but it won't be like the cows walking out there.""\Credit: STAFF"
217,"At the 35,000-foot level, climate change remains a matter of loud dispute among Republicans.\In the undercard portion of last Wednesday's CNBC presidential debate, U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham pushed the GOP envelope and acknowledged that ""we're heating up the planet."" Likewise, former New York Gov. George Pataki declared it ""not appropriate"" to think that human activity isn't at least partially to blame.\But those are outlying opinions, offset by hardcore skepticism expressed by Republicans closer to the front of the pack.\Donald Trump, for instance, has called climate change a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese, who are out to sabotage the U.S. industrial base. In an interview with conservative firebrand Glenn Beck, recorded just before last week's debate, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz said that climate change wasn't science, but a Sierra Club-generated religion.\Such is the high-altitude situation among Republicans. At sea level, however, the view is much different. Take, for instance, Jason Buelterman, mayor of Tybee Island on the Georgia coast.\Last Sunday, Buelterman had returned from a trip to New Hampshire, where he participated in Rising Tides 2015, a conference on the coastal impact of rising sea levels in the United States, aimed at local government officials. It was a nonpartisan event, but Republican attendees --- count Buelterman among them --- outnumbered Democratic ones.\Forty-eight hours after the mayor returned, Tybee Island made a little history. On Tuesday morning, a 10.47-foot high tide swamped much of the island and U.S. 80, the only road that links 3,000 residents to Savannah and the mainland.\It was the third-highest tide on record. But that doesn't really tell the story. Those higher tides in 1940 and 1947 were produced by surges from hurricanes.\No such storms struck the Georgia coast last week. We would have noticed.\The king tides on Tuesday and Wednesday were the product of the moon making a closer-than-usual pass, a stiff wind and rising sea levels.\That last condition is the result of climate change. Heated water expands and ice caps melt. Volume increases.\""It's unfortunate that we had this incident with the tide, but I think what it has done is gotten people's attention all over this state,"" Buelterman said. ""I can't think of another island anywhere that is completely cut off from the mainland for hours at a time.""\What happened on the Georgia coast last week was predicted last year by a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration report, which said that ""clear evidence"" of rising sea levels would increase flooding throughout the coastal United States.\A U.S. 80 that is covered with water three or five times a year now might see that happen 35 to 40 times a year by 2050. Much of it would be ""nuisance"" flooding, the report said. Which might have applied to Tybee Island last week, except that it didn't.\""We had to have a helicopter on standby, we had the Coast Guard on alert in case we had a heart attack. The school's shut down,"" Mayor Buelterman said in a phone interview on Thursday. That's slightly more than a nuisance.\During his 10 years as mayor, Buelterman said he's been pushing for a rebuilt and raised U.S. 80 --- ""doing everything short of a hunger strike."" But his argument has been based largely on the vulnerability of the mostly two-lane road, and thus his tourist-heavy island, to traffic accidents. A rising sea is now another argument in his favor. Maybe a strong one.\""All this money gets spent to get people to work 10 minutes faster. We have an island that's inaccessible. This is a safety issue. That should be the priority,"" Buelterman said.\Tybee Island is addressing other issues as well. ""I got a fairly dysfunctional city council to vote unanimously to plan and budget for 14 to 20 inches of sea level rise by 2060,"" said Councilman Paul Wolff. ""That was in 2010.""\An inventory of at-risk infrastructure followed. The road to the mainland was named a top priority. Another: three freshwater wells. The wells themselves are sealed, which protects them from saltwater swamping. But the electronic controls need to be raised.\This kind of work is occurring up and down the Georgia coast, often courtesy of federal grants, often with the help of University of Georgia researchers and the state Department of Natural Resources.\""The state of Georgia has scientific data that demonstrates the need to plan for an increase in sea level rise at a rate of one meter for the next 100 years. This data comes from NOAA's tide gauge at Fort Pulaski, Ga.,"" said DNR spokeswoman Mary Kathryn Yearta, in an email.\This is the same state Department of Natural Resources that, earlier this year, reported that climate change --- and the study did use that term --- could put Georgia wildlife on the move over the next three or four decades. In some cases, the destination will be extinction. Think songbirds.\The point is that, yes, you may have GOP presidential candidates who prefer to dispute volumes of data about climate change. Possibly, they are obliged to constituencies on higher ground.\You may even have governors and state lawmakers, in Georgia and elsewhere, who prefer to duck cause-and-effect by declaring themselves non-scientists. When you acknowledge a problem exists, you tacitly admit an obligation to fix it. And that could be expensive.\But you do have a class of people on the Georgia coast who see things with their own eyes and their own gauges. They are mayors, council members, county commissioners, scientists and even government bureaucrats. Republicans as well as Democrats.\Moreover, an official arm of state government says now it possesses evidence that climate change is real.\The sea is rising, and not everyone can wait for Donald Trump and Ted Cruz to change their minds.\Credit: STAFF"
218,"PARIS --- Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed, in Paris this week with thousands of other leaders concerned about climate change, says cities can play a significant role in addressing global warming.\Atlanta already has enacted significant sustainability measures, he notes, including requiring large-scale commercial property owners to track energy and water usage; pledging to reduce its own greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020; adding electric vehicles to its city fleet; and pursuing a solar energy program for municipal buildings.\While Reed isn't part of negotiations held at the official United Nations summit, he traveled to France to participate in gatherings of mayors and regional leaders being held in tandem with the international talks.\Friday's Climate Summit for Local Leaders, led by Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo and U.N. Special Envoy for Cities and Climate Change Michael Bloomberg, highlighted what city leaders can do to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and water consumption.\The message is especially meaningful in states like Georgia, which still lacks agreement by top officials on the nature and threat of global warming.\""We're taking on the issue of climate action right now, and we're trying to act in a decisive manner,"" said Reed, in between sessions at Paris City Hall.\But asked what state leaders should do on climate issues, Reed --- known for his positive relationship with Republican Gov. Nathan Deal and members of the Legislature --- was circumspect.\""I think we have the leadership in place if they want to act, but I'm not really focused on what other people are doing,"" Reed said. ""As long as the state structure isn't an impediment to municipal action, I think we can accomplish quite a lot.""\Friday's local leaders summit, one of several events that Reed is attending while here, attracted nearly 400 mayors from across the world, according to its organizers. Many, like Reed, have signed the ""Compact of Mayors,"" an agreement to enact policy changes to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and track the results.\French President Francois Hollande spoke at the event, thanking local officials for coming despite the Nov. 13 terror attacks in his country. Several Democratic U.S. senators came to rally behind President Barack Obama's climate agenda, which is facing opposition from Senate Republicans.\Also speaking were technology bigwigs, political heavyweights and Hollywood celebrities, including Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk, Al Gore, Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert Redford. That's to say nothing of the countless climate change scientists and environmental leaders in the crowd.\""This is the Disney World for climate geeks,"" said Stephanie Stuckey Benfield, a former state legislator who now serves as Reed's sustainability director.\Benfield was in her element as she swapped business cards with politicians and environmental movers and shakers from around the globe, a networking of grand order against the backdrop of Paris City Hall's Versailles-like architecture.\She said she hoped to score 30 seconds with Bloomberg --- former New York mayor --- while here to ask him to fund a project manager position for Atlanta's new solar energy program. As of Friday, she had been unsuccessful in cornering the magnate. She came close earlier, only to have Bloomberg whisked away.\""I had my pitch ready and a mayor from Jordan totally intercepted,"" she lamented.\Benfield said she hopes the summit will lead to even greater discussions with like minds about ways cities can work together on environmental issues.\She also noted that Georgia, despite its lack of accord on the source of global warming, has taken some significant steps. Earlier this year, the state Legislature passed House Bill 57, the Solar Power Free Market Financing Act, which makes it more affordable for Georgia homeowners and small businesses to put solar panels on their rooftops.\""You don't have to embrace climate change to make progress,"" she said.\Credit: STAFF"
219,"Georgia halted work Wednesday on plans to meet new federal rules to fight global warming, after the Supreme Court temporarily blocked the Obama administration from imposing them.\The decision was roundly applauded by politicians and industry officials in Georgia who complained that the mandated carbon reductions from coal-fired power plants --- 25 percent statewide by 2030 --- would hurt businesses and ratepayers.\Georgia joined 28 other states last year in a lawsuit against the president's Clean Power Plan. Gov. Nathan Deal nonetheless directed the state's environmental agency to start on a compliance plan.\Wednesday, a day after the high court stopped the rules pending further legal review, the state Environmental Protection Division said it has postponed research and stakeholder meetings devoted to the Clean Power Plan.\""We are pleased that Georgia will not need to begin plan development at this time given the uncertainties surrounding its ultimate legal status,"" said Mary Walker, an assistant EPD director.\Last summer the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency mandated that states reduce carbon emissions by one-third, with compliance plans due later this year. Coal-fired electric power plants were targeted.\A district court will hear arguments in the states' case June 2, and the Supreme Court could take it up by mid-2017.\""We will continue to fight this executive overreach which will put Americans out of work and drive up the cost of electricity for consumers,"" Georgia Attorney General Sam Olens said in a statement.\Environmentalists lamented the decision. It ""hits pause on the country's strongest action to lower harmful carbon pollution,"" said Frank Rambo, an attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center.\Georgia was expected to rather easily meet the EPA guidelines. Its carbon-emission targets were relaxed from earlier goals and the state also received credit for the under-construction nuclear power Plant Vogtle.\Credit: STAFF"

222,"Memo to environmental activists: It's the oceans, stupids.\This summer, people will flock to beaches to swim, surf, wade, boat, fish, sunbathe, or even fall in love. To these revelers, the oceans are eternal -- a permanent bounty in an impermanent world.\But there is a rub: The oceans are living entities and they are in trouble.\Mark Spalding, president of The Ocean Foundation, says, ""We are putting too much into the oceans and taking too much out.""\Whether deliberately or not, we are dumping stuff into the oceans at a horrifying rate and, in places, we are overfishing them.\But the No. 1 enemy of oceans is invisible: carbon.\Carbon is a huge threat, according to ocean champion U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I. The oceans are a great carbon sink, he explains, but they are reaching a carbon saturation point, and as so-called ""deep carbon"" resurfaces, it limits the oxygen in the water and destroys fish and marine life.\There is a 6,474-squaremile ""dead zone"" -- an area about the size of Connecticut with low to no oxygen -- in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Dead zones are appearing in oceans around the world due to excessive nutrient pollution (especially nitrogen and phosphorous) from agribusiness and sewage. Two great U.S. estuaries are in trouble: the Chesapeake Bay and the Long Island Sound.\Warming in the North Atlantic is disturbing fish populations: Maine lobsters are migrating to Canada's cooler waters.\The shallow seas, like the Baltic and the Adriatic, are subject to ""red tides"" -- harmful algal booms, due to nutrient overenrichment, that kill fish and make shellfish dangerous to consume.\Polluted waterways are a concern for Rio de Janiero Olympic rowers and other athletes. Apparently, the word is: Don't follow the girl from Ipanema into the water. The culprit is raw sewage, and the swelling Olympic crowds will only worsen the situation.\My appeal to the environmental community is this: If you are worried about the air, concentrate on the oceans. It is hard to explain greenhouse gases to a public that is distrustful, or fears the economic effect of reducing fossil fuel consumption. If I lived in a West Virginia hollow, and the only work was coal mining, you bet I would be a climate denier.\The oceans are easier to understand. You can explain that the sea levels are rising; that it is possible for life-sustaining currents, like the Gulf Stream, to stop or reverse course; and you can point to the ways seemingly innocent actions, or those thought of as virtuous (like hefting around spring water in plastic bottles) have harmful effects.\Plastic is a big problem. Great gyres of plastic, hundreds of miles long, are floating in the Pacific. Flip-flops washed into the ocean in Asia are piling up on beaches in Africa. Fish are ingesting microplastic particles -- and you will ingest this plastic when you tuck into your fish and chips. Sea birds and dolphins get tangled in the plastic harnesses we put on six-packs of beer and soft drinks. They die horrible deaths. Sunscreen is lethal to coral.\It is hard to explain the way carbon, methane and ozone in the atmosphere cause the Earth to heat up. It is easier, I am telling my environmentalist friends, to understand that we will not be able to swim in the oceans.\I have met climate deniers, but I have never run into an ocean denier.\Llewellyn King is executive\producer and host of ""White House Chronicle""on PBS.

223,"Note: Farmer Donald Chase (right) leases land on his Oglethorpe farm for solar farms. Hundreds of acres of solar farms are under construction across South Georgia. BOB ANDRES / AJC 2015 GEORGIA POWER LONG-TERM PLAN Under a compromise agreement being considered by state regulators Thursday, Georgia Power will shut down some traditional plants, add some ""green""energy plants, and make other changes in coming years.Here are some highlights: Renewable energy: The utility plans to add up to 1,600 megawatts of renewable energy. It would contract with outside firms to supply up to 1,050 megawatts from large-scale solar power and other renewable energy plants by 2021.The balance would come from smaller projects built by Georgia Power or by factories, offices, churches, small businesses and homes.Most is likely to be solar, though the compromise allows up to 300 megawatts from wind power, likely imported from the Great Plains states. New nuke study: There was no agreement on Georgia Power's request for a study costing at least$175 million of a potential nuclear power plant south of Columbus.That decision was left to the state regulator's board. Closing plants: The utility will close one coal unit and two oil-fired units at Plant Mitchell near Albany, and an oil-fired unit at Plant Kraft near Savannah.Combined, they account for 375 megawatts. Limit spending on old plants: The utility agreed to limit annual investments to$1 million at Plant McIntosh, near Savannah, and $5 million at Plant Hammond, near Rome.Critics wanted Georgia Power to close the old power plants, which are used only part of the year during peak demand times. Coal ash pond project: Georgia Power wants to do a 10 megawatt demonstration solar power project on one of its closed coal ash ponds near a traditional power plant, allowing it to reclaim land and take advantage of its existing power lines. High wind study: The utility would be allowed to conduct a study into whether wind power turbines on towers up to\Georgia Power is making a big move into solar power and other renewable energy -- about three times bigger than it originally planned -- under a deal state regulators are expected to approve today.\If the Public Service Commission's five-member board approves a recent compromise on Georgia Power's long-term plan, the utility will add as much as 1,600 megawatts of new renewable energy capacity, or roughly enough ""green"" capacity to power about 264,000 homes.Most of the increase would be over six years.\""It's going to be a sizable increase in renewable energy,"" said former PSC commissioner Bobby Baker, who now represents the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, an environmental group.\Baker said Georgia Power currently has about 1,000 megawatts of solar, wind or other renewable power projects online or under development, representing roughly 5 percent of the utility's overall capacity.\The proposed additions could boost that share to roughly 12 percent. That comes on top of more than 1,000 megawatts of power expected to come from an expansion of the Vogtle nuclear plant near Augusta by 2020.\The Atlanta utility had originally proposed 525 megawatts of solar, wind and other alternative energy to be added over three years in its so-called Integrated Resources Plan. The plan is a 20-year blueprint for the utility's power generation projects, conservation programs, power plant retirements and other goals that is reviewed every three years by state regulators.\The PSC's board is voting today on a recent ""stipulation"" agreement resolving most of the disputes between the utility, regulators, environmental groups and others over the long-term plan. The PSC's board could amend some pieces before approving it, but it probably won't toss the agreement aside.\Whatever the PSC board approves could eventually affect Georgians in many ways.The longterm plan will indirectly affect\electricity bills, pollution levels, and whether Georgia Power eventually begins building a second nuclear plant in the state.\Nuclear study\One issue still up in the air is whether the utility commission will approve Georgia Power's request to approve a study -- at a cost at least $175 million -- to evaluate a site south of Columbus to potentially build a new nuclear plant.\The state regulator's staff and environmental groups pressed for the higher green energy target. The state regulator wants more renewable energy partly because solar and wind power projects can now produce cheaper energy than traditional sources such as coal and natural gas-fired plants.\""We're adding it because it's cheaper than running existing capacity,"" said Tom Bond, the PSC's director of utilities. ""It's like if you have two cars and one gets 20 miles to the gallon and the other gets 50. It's cheaper to drive your car that gets 50 miles per gallon.""\Although the long-term plan doesn't directly affect customers' rates, Bond said the lower-cost renewable energy will help keep rates down.\Calls for more\During hearings over several months, the regulators' experts, environmental groups and others had questioned the utility's planned pace of new solar-and wind-power additions as a slowdown from previous years.\""We're adding more (renewable) energy but it's added over a longer period,"" Georgia Power spokesman Jacob Hawkins said. ""We definitely think it's a good stipulated agreement,"" he said, that will broaden the utility's sources of power and save money for customers.\There are big differences between the power-generating capacity of traditional and renewable energy power plants. Most nuclear and gas-fired plants run full-time, so 1 megawatt from those plants supplies about 1,000 homes. Most renewable energy plants only produce when the wind blows or the sun shines, so 1 megawatt from those plants supplies homes only part of the day, or in effect significantly fewer homes.\But solar and wind-powered installations also are much cheaper and quicker to build and run. Georgia Power expects contracts to supply 1,050 megawatts of green energy to cost about $2 billion.\The Vogtle nuclear expansion, on the other hand, is over three years behind schedule and $3 billion over budget.\(Box)\Farmer Donald Chase (right) leases land on his Oglethorpe farm for solar farms.

225,"Note: HOT STREAKS Six of the 10 hottest stretches of summer ever recorded in Atlanta, when the low temperature never dipped below 70 degrees, have occurred since 2005.

If so, it has been 73 days -- a record -- since the city felt so cool. The once-typical late-in-the-day cooling-off periods have disappeared, and if future summers mimic this year's, then Atlantans can expect worsening weather, health and ecological problems for decades to come.\One recent study predicts that by the year 2100, Atlanta will succumbto94dayswhenthehightemperature is at or above 95 degrees. Current average: seven days.\Future weather, of course, is hard to predict. The summer of 2017, for example, may be cooler than 2016 due to the La Nina weather pattern newly ensconced in the Northern Hemisphere. Most climatologists, though, expecttemperaturestowarm over the next century, and they point to man-made carbon dioxide stifling the atmosphere as the main culprit.\""One of the hallmarks of global warming is the rise of extreme heat,"" said Alyson Kenward, a senior scientist with Climate Central, an environmental research nonprofit in New Jersey. ""All of a sudden the types of temperatures we think of as being pretty unusual and only happening a handful of times a year will be happening a lot more in the future.\""So the question is,"" she continued, ""how ready are people to face three months of 95-degree weather?""\For climatologists, summer runs from June 1 through Aug. 31. Only Atlanta's summer of 1980 was hotter than 2016, according to National Weather Service records that date to 1887.\2016 is also shaping up as North Georgia's second-hot-test year ever, behind only 2012. Atlanta's eight warmest years have all come since 1980, proof that Georgia is steadily -- and rapidly -- warming, climatologists say.\Extreme heat, like intense downpours and rising seas, is increasingly linked to global warming. Marshall Shepherd, who runs the University of Georgia's Atmospheric Sciences Program, recently co-authored a National Academy of Sciences study that ""overwhelmingly found that extreme heat events have the strongest attribution signal to climate change.""\The journal Nature Climate Change also reported last year that the high temperatures three out of every four days can be tied to global warming.\Most Atlantans can easily relate to the number of days (75 this year) when the temperature hit 90 degrees or higher at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport and DeKalb-Peachtree Airport. Less known, but potentially of greater significance, is the number of days in a row when the low temperature hasn't fallen below 70 degrees.\This year far surpasses 2010, the previous record-breaking year, when Atlanta registered 55 straight days without the mercury ever dipping below 70. The city's heat is fueled by more than the Earth's overall warming.\""In general, cities hold heat more at night because of all the concrete. It's an urban effect,""said Pam Knox, UGA's climatologist. ""And more widespread humidity seems to be going up, and humidity tends to keep things warmer at night. You really get the coolest nights in summer when it's dry.""\Bill Murphey is Knox's counterpart with the state of Georgia. He's also the state's chief meteorologist. Murphey says the lack of wind, due to high pressure systems, also keeps Atlanta hot at night.\""We had very few, if any, air mass changes or frontal systems to help us out,"" he said. ""Hopefully, we'll get some (wind) changes here in the fall and maybe get a tropical storm system to help us out as far as the dryness goes.""\Tropical Storm Hermine cooled temps and replenished reservoirs and aquifers. Yet parts of metro Atlanta and northwest Georgia still suffer ""extreme drought,"" according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\""You're likely to see drought more frequently with higher temperatures and higher evaporation (rates) that suck more moisture out of the soil,"" Knox said. ""That puts more stress on plants. It probably makes more farmers convert to irrigation. So there could be water shortages.""\Warmer weather might afford farmers longer growing seasons. But high temperatures also bring more pests and invasive species, prompting farmers to spend more on pesticides and herbicides.Mosquitoes, perhaps carrying Zika or malaria, also thrive on warm weather.\Air quality, too, suffers the longer it's hotter. Metro Atlanta, so far, has violated federal air quality standards about three times as much as last year.

226,"Climate change is a myth invented by the Chinese government to undermine U.S. manufacturing, at least according to Donald Trump.\If so, those Chinese are tricky dudes. Among other things, they've apparently hacked into computers at NASA, which has announced that globally, July of 2016 was the hottest month ever recorded. That followed June of 2016, which was the hottest June ever recorded, just as May was the hottest May and April the hottest April. Every month since last October has been the hottest such month ever recorded, and once the data are final, August may become the 11th consecutive month to join that list.\The evidence doesn't stop there. Last year, 2015, was the hottest year ever recorded globally. The previous champion had been 2014. According to Gavin Schmidt, climatologist and director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, there's a 99 percent chance that 2016 will top both of them, producing three consecutive years of record heat globally.\And a global phenomenon is being felt locally as well.\Down along the Georgia coast, rising sea levels are causing widespread alarm from officials who had previously denied the existence of climate change. Scientists at Climate Central predict that under moderate sea-rise assumptions, record flooding of at least 3 feet above high tide will strike the Georgia coast by 2040, affecting billions of dollars in property and more than 170,000 acres.\""Under high-range projections, floods exceeding 4 feet -- a level not seen in the past 100 years -- become every-year events by 2060"" all along the Georgia coast, the study warns. Savannah, Sea Island, Tybee Island -- all would be threatened.\In south Georgia, longtime farmers report weather patterns never before witnessed, and researchers warn that native plants and animals will have to migrate northward, and quickly, to escape the heat. ""A lot of them are going to have a hard time,"" says Jenny McGuire, a research scientist at Georgia Tech and co-author of a new report on climate-change adaptability. ""For plants and animals in the East, there is a higher potential for extinction due to an inability to adapt to climate change. We have a high diversity of amphibians and other species that are going to struggle.""\And of course, the drought has returned. Climate models have long predicted that global warming would create more intense drought and fewer but more intense rain events here in the Southeast, and that's the pattern that seems to be occurring.\Those models also predict that higher levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere would keep the heat from dissipating at night, producing many more evenings in which the air conditioners keep humming. Through Sept. 13, we have experienced a record 58 consecutive days in which overnight temperatures have remained above 70 degrees, according to the National Weather Service office in Peachtree City. The last time we enjoyed temperatures in the 60s was on June 21. Here in Atlanta, we've so far endured 82 days of temperatures exceeding 90 degrees. The annual average is 37 days.\In short, we have a whole world of evidence -- literally -- that global climate change is real and serious. And yet sheer cussedness still stifles effective action.\Credit: STAFF"
227,"In ( ""We have a whole world of evidence on climate change,"" Opinion, Sept. 13), Jay Bookman correctly points to the overwhelming evidence of the very real phenomenon of global climate change. Instead of debating the obvious existence of a warming planet, we need to be working on solutions.\The U.S. Congress has dithered on this issue for far too long. We need a strong, national response to meet urgency of the task. In the absence of meaningful action in Congress, the executive branch has taken steps to curb global warming, but it isn't enough. Both political parties need to come together, put aside their differences, and work to preserve a livable world for everyone.\ATLANTA\Jay Bookman's ( ""We have a whole world of evidence on climate change,"" Opinion, Sept. 13) makes as much sense ""The sun always rises in the East."" Climate change has taken place throughout the 4.5 billion-year history of the planet. He cites NASA's claims that May, June, July of 2016 are the hottest years in recorded history. This is from unreliable ground-based temperature measurement. Satellite temperature measurements are not subject to errors from urban heat island effects. Satellite data, readily available on the Internet, shows April, May, June, July, and August 2016 were cooler than the same months in 1998. Only January, February, and March 2016 were warmer than corresponding months of 1998. And 1998 and 2010 were warmer years than 2015. A host of global weather data from centuries in the past to the present shows negligible effects of carbon dioxide changes on global warming.\JAMES H. RUST, OF THE HEARTLAND INSTITUTE\Credit: STAFF"
228,"The government's top public health agency has canceled a February conference on climate change and health but isn't saying why publicly.\But a co-sponsor was told by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that the agency was worried how the conference would be viewed by the Trump administration.\In an email response to a request from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, a CDC spokeswoman wrote that three days before Christmas, the agency began telling registered participants the February 2017 summit would be postponed. :\""We are exploring options to reschedule the meeting while considering budget priorities for fiscal year 2017,"" the Atlanta-based agency wrote in an official statement. It would also look for ""potential overlap with an APHA (American Public Health Association) conference on the same topic also being held later in 2017.""\The incoming administration did not ask or order that the meeting be canceled, said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association.\""They had no idea or not whether the new administration would be supportive,"" said Benjamin, whose group was a co-sponsor of the event with the CDC.\Rather, the decision was ""a strategic retreat,"" intended to head off a possible last-minute cancellation or other repercussions from Trump officials who may prove hostile to spending money on climate change science, Benjamin said Monday.\""They decided the better part of valor was to stop and regroup"" until it could be discussed with Trump's new health leadership, Benjamin said. A new CDC director has not been named.\Benjamin called the decision understandable but worrisome. He was echoed by Kristie Ebi, a professor of global health at the University of Washington in Seattle, who was invited to speak at the conference.\""In the long run, climate change is affecting the health of Americans,"" she said. ""At some point, I hope they will go forward with the conference.""\Ian Karra, an organizer for the Sierra Club, said the move to cancel the summit was ""deeply disturbing.""\""The Trump administration has a responsibility to take climate change seriously,"" Karra said. ""If the CDC is taking this step preemptively, we hope it will show some climate courage going forward.""\Public health experts say climate change is a man-made problem that contributes to a range of health issues and illnesses, including heat stroke and diseases spread by tropical insects. The CDC has a $10 million program on climate and health, and published guidelines to help local health officials deal with human vulnerability to climate change.\In 2012, Trump tweeted that the concept of global warming was created by the Chinese to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.

229,"A climate change meeting in Atlanta on Thursday had all the ingredients of a political spectacle.\With Donald Trump, a noted skeptic of climate change science winning the White House, a nervous federal agency scrapped plans to host the event. Enter Al Gore. The former vice president helped revive the conference and took to the podium Thursday to talk about his signature issue.\But it was science -- not politics -- that carried the day.\In the climate and health meeting held at The Carter Center, Gore, a former Democratic presidential candidate, steered clear of mentioning Trump. Instead, he stressed that climate changes could render parts of the Middle East -- including some of the holiest cities on the planet -- uninhabitable. It could also cause deadly health problems and reduce life expectancy. Those in poverty will be hardest hit, he said.\The event was supposed to be a three-day conference held at the Centers for Disease Control. But when that event was cancelled following the presidential election, Gore helped organize a condensed, one-day meeting instead.\Gore urged scientists and health care providers to unite in efforts to combat the effects of climate change.\Among the most serious problems presented to conference attendees was the belief that the rising heat index could make parts of the world uninhabitable, Gore said.\""This is a relatively new finding, that in some areas of the Middle East and north Africa, there will be, according to the scientific predictions, areas that will no longer be fit for human habitation -- beyond the limits for human survival,"" Gore said. ""The holy cities of Mecca and Medina are in this zone. Two years in Iran, the heat index -- the combination of temperature and humidity -- reached 165 degrees Fahrenheit.\""No human being can live for more than a few hours outdoors in those conditions,"" Gore said.\Despite the gloomy outlook, Gore said there are ways to deal with the effects of climate change, but those will take collaboration both in the U.S. and abroad.\""We do have the solutions at hand,""Gore said. ""Hope is justified.We are going to win this. We have solutions that are now readily available.""\Experts from Columbia University, Harvard University, the University of Wisconsin the World Health Organization and the CDC were among the speakers and panelists at the fast-paced conference.\""We're doing three days in one day,"" Gore joked at the microphone during sessions.\Atlanta resident Cindy Powell, who has worked in critical care, attended the conference because she's returning to school and is interested in public health. She was saddened the initial conference was cancelled, but said Thursday's meeting was a resilient effort.\""It's better than nothing. It's a start,"" Powell said. ""The positive forces of the world intend to move forward regardless.""\Leslie Bass, a commercial photography student, didn't know exactly what she'd be attending as part of an internship. But she was shocked at the staggering numbers of health issues and deaths related to climate changes.\""This is way bigger than politics, but politics in our country are going to hinder progress,"" Bass said. ""It's not some myth. These are not alternative facts.""\Credit: STAFF"
230,"In a second tense debate on Thursday, Democrat Jon Ossoff and Republican Karen Handel clashed over highly politicized issues as they assailed each other over climate change policy, healthcare changes and the specter of Russian interference in the U.S. election.\The two honed their messages to distinct audiences in the 6th District contest: Handel tried to rev up a conservative base with tried-and-true pitches while Ossoff attempted to walk a more delicate line to appeal to liberals and enough moderates and independents to win.\In a race where Donald Trump has played a central role, both wrestled with former FBI director James Comey's testimony that the president tried to interfere with the investigation. And the two candidates had another heated exchange over Handel's controversial role at a breast-cancer charity.\It was another feisty showdown marked by sharp words from Handel -- at one time she tersely told Ossoff ""with all due respect, do not interrupt me"" -- and biting responses by the Democrat.\Multiple times the two accused each other of misstating facts. ""Voters need to know that,""Ossoff said during one disagreement over health care. ""And candidates need to know that, too."" Later, Handel interrupted him to counter what she said was a falsehood, and in her closing called him ""deceptive, fake Jon Ossoff.""\The two are at the center of the most expensive U.S. House contest in the nation's history, and both parties are desperate for a victory. Republicans have long held the suburban Atlanta district, but Democrats hope Trump's struggles could give them an opening.\'Not there yet'\Held just minutes before Comey's blockbuster testimony, both candidates faced challenges over how to respond. For Handel, it was a particularly vexing issue: After holding him at arm's length in the early part of the campaign, she embraced the president after she won a spot in the June 20 runoff.\Pressed by moderator Denis O'Hayer, who noted she held a fundraiser with Trump in late April, Handel pleaded for patience with the investigations while also trying to assert her independence from the president.\""Let's let the facts go where they need to go on this. President Trump is the president, and having his support ... I'm happy to have his support. But I'm also happy to have, frankly, the support of the people of the 6th District,"" she said, adding: ""I understand full well that I am not an extension of the White House. I am an extension of the people of the 6th District.""\Ossoff tried to navigate his own divide. Even as liberals call for impeachment proceedings, many Democrats are wary that such talk could turn off the independents they will need to flip GOP strongholds such as the 6th District.\He said he was outraged by Russia's attempts to interfere with the election and said it demands a ""firm response and a transparent, independent investigation."" But he stopped short of calling for Trump's impeachment.\""We're still not there yet,"" said Ossoff.\'Collapsing in on itself'\The two revived the fiercest exchanges from Tuesday's debate, arguing again over the GOP plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act and Handel's role at the Susan G. Komen Foundation.\Handel said replacing Obamacare is a top priority, saying that the system is ""collapsing in on itself."" She said her own health insurance premiums under the exchange have quadrupled.\Ossoff pointed to government projections that the plan would leave more than 20 million without insurance, and he pushed back on Handel's claims that the measure has enough funding to help those with pre-existing health conditions.\""I appreciate you sharing your personal story,"" Ossoff said after Handel talked of her sister's serious medical condition. ""But the facts are the facts ... This bill guts protections for Georgians who have pre-existing conditions.""\Handel swiped back, saying Ossoff was wrong while invoking the House's Democratic leader, a favorite foil of the GOP: ""I guess Jon, you subscribe to the Nancy Pelosi style -- just pass it and then you'll read it.""\The measure bans health insurers from limiting access to coverage for people with pre-existing conditions, but allows states to let insurers charge people more. Experts warn that high-risk pools meant to keep premiums lower for sick people might not be effective.\When Ossoff was asked whether he supported a ""single-payer"" health-care system, an idea that conservatives fear will lead to runaway costs, the Democrat didn't give a direct answer: ""I think we need a lot less ideology around health care, and a lot more of a focus on how we can make progress on a bipartisan basis.""\From there, the two scrapped over Handel's time at the breast-cancer charity, where she served as a vice president of public policy during a controversial decision to cut ties with Planned Parenthood. The move made her a hero to religious conservatives and propelled her to the national spotlight.\Calling it a self-serving political move, Ossoff said it cost the foundation millions of dollars and made it harder for women to get health screenings and other treatment.\Handel, who asserted in Tuesday's debate that she didn't ""engineer"" that move, dropped that line of response on Thursday.\""I led the effort to find a way to have those dollars that were going to an organization that did not even provide mammograms, cannot legally provide mammograms, be reinvested,"" she said.\(Planned Parenthood doesn't perform mammograms but conducts hundreds of thousands of breast-cancer screenings each year.)\'Why we have scientists'\One of the testiest exchanges between the two rivals was over Trump's decision to withdraw from the 2015 Paris Accords, a pollution-cutting international compact aimed at slowing climate change.\Calling it a ""very bad deal for America and Americans,"" Handel said she's confident Trump will renegotiate the agreement. She said there are ""clearly"" changes in the climate, but did not say whether she believed the temperature changes are caused by human activity.\""I am not a scientist, so I read all of that and take it all in,"" she said. ""What I am set on is making sure we do the right thing in the right way. I don't think a single person in this room, regardless of their political persuasion, disagrees with the fact that we must be responsible stewards of our environment. But let's do it in the right way.""\That brought a quick retort by Ossoff:\""Well, neither of us are scientists. That's why we have scientists,"" he said. ""And 97 percent of scientists, as well as the military and the intelligence community, agree that climate change is a threat to our security and prosperity and that it's driven in part by human activity.""\Credit: STAFF"
231," Atlanta isn't home to any icebergs at risk of melting. It's not on the coast, where rising sea levels can flood communities. And while summers in the city are hot, Atlanta is far from becoming a dry desertscape.\But the impacts of climate change are likely to still put long-term stress on metro Atlanta, scientists, officials and activists said, one day after The New York Times published a report that predicts rising temperatures nationwide and reduced rainfall in the southeastern United States.\The study, which had not been made public but was obtained by the Times, was conducted by researchers from 13 federal agencies and concluded that the average U.S. temperature is expected to rise. In the southeast, the report predicts, conditions are getting drier.\""We look at the science; we are aware of the trends that only seem to be worsening when it comes to the impacts of a warming climate,"" Stephanie Stuckey, the chief resilience officer for the City of Atlanta, said. ""We're very aware of the drought and the increasing temperatures.""\An overwhelming majority of scientists agree that the climate is changing, and that humans are primarily responsible for global warming.\Even land-locked cities like Atlanta, Stuckey said, will witness the effects of climate change, specifically a water supply that could decrease over the next several years. At the same time, the city is also likely to face population growth as an indirect result of sea level rise, which can force coastal residents to move inward, she said.\The report published Monday night ""rings true to what we've seen in previous reports,"" said Marshall Shepherd, a meteorologist and the director of the Atmospheric Sciences program at the University of Georgia.\Different parts of the state are vulnerable to climate change in different ways, Shepherd said. Urban areas are more likely to see extreme heat and intense bursts of urban flooding, while southern parts of the state are more susceptible to drought, he said.\Within the metro area, Stuckey's team is preparing a climate action strategy, which includes longterm solutions for increasing energy and water efficiency. The city hopes to build a water reservoir, install solar panels on public buildings and partner with the private sector to increase sustainability.\One area already seeing the impacts of climate change is the Chattahoochee River, which creeps across almost the entire state and provides water to about 4 million people.\""Climate change is a real threat to river flow, and to rainfall, and to heat -- all factors that affect the river system,"" said Juliet Cohen, the executive director for Chattahoochee Riverkeeper. ""That changing climate will affect many aspects of the human and environmental experience. We know that they are occurring, scientists have documented them.""\Less rainfall, which the recent federal report anticipates, would ""aggravate an already contentious relationship between the various users of the river system,"" Cohen said.\Rising temperatures can impact fish and wildlife, and flooding damages infrastructure, she said.\Georgians have turned a closer eye to climate change in recent years, research suggests. Almost 70 percent of residents believe global warming is happening, and 55 percent said they are worried about global warming, according to a 2016 study by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication.\This weekend, outspoken climate change activist Al Gore is scheduled speak at the progressive Netroots Nation conference in downtown Atlanta. And next month, Chattahoochee Riverkeeper is hosting their first-ever conference on climate change. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution is one of the sponsors of that conference.\The report published by the Times raised eyebrows because the scientists' conclusions contradict statements made by President Trump and members of his administration, the newspaper noted. Trump announced in June that he will pull the U.S. out of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt has said he does not believe carbon dioxide emissions are a primary driver of global warming.\Actions by the federal government, however, have little impact on what Atlanta officials do to fight climate change, Stuckey said. ""I tend to focus on where I can actually have impact and where we have direct control,"" she said. ""Our energies are directly spent on (asking), where can we as cities be really forward-thinking and innovative?"" Mayor Kasim Reed, in conjunction with many mayors across the country, pledged to still uphold the city's commitment to the Paris accords. ""All the cities jointly,"" Stuckey said, ""are so much more powerful than a federal entity, because it's a global network.""\CREDIT: Staff"
232," Georgia U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson was met by a thunderous crowd Monday in Kennesaw that heckled and shouted down many of the Republican's remarks on health care, climate change and police brutality but cheered his swift denunciation of last weekend's attacks in Charlottesville, Va.\Monday's town hall at Kennesaw State University, on Isakson's home turf of Cobb County, careened from the rocky to the uproarious as a largely unfriendly crowd took the rare opportunity to vent about President Donald Trump and the GOP agenda before a Republican member of Congress.\Attendees peppered the third-term senator with questions on everything from individual members of the Trump White House to gay rights and Isakson's recent vote to overhaul Medicaid. Isakson was booed after he said ""all lives matter"" and as he explained his votes last month in favor of various Republican health care proposals, which he said were designed to set up negotiations with the House.\""You've got to get it to a conference committee or it's not going to happen,"" he said, as some in the crowd roared their displeasure. ""I didn't like it, but I voted for it. I couldn't get to where I wanted to go unless I followed the road that led me there.""\The testy moments started even before the third-term Republican made his official entrance onto the stage and continued as Isakson turned to leave, when he was hit with shouts of ""shame.""\KSU President Sam Olens, who introduced Isakson, was met with laughs and jeers after he mentioned Isakson's position as the chairman on the Senate Ethics Committee.\""We're here to have a civil discussion, ain't we?"" said Olens, a former state attorney general.\For his part, Isakson paused and let members of the crowd shout for a few seconds before stepping in with his answers. And even though the at-capacity crowd of 600 was testy, Isakson largely maintained control of the room.\""I'm trying to answer your question, but I don't want to interrupt,"" he snapped back as several members of the crowd jeered his initial answer to a question about health care, a topic that dominated Monday's discussion.\""What's your insurance policy?"" one member of the crowd shouted. ""We're scared to death,"" another said, referring to the GOP's effort to repeal Obamacare.\Isakson is one of three Georgia members of Congress who have held in-per-son town halls during Congress' August recess; U.S. Reps.Buddy Carter and Doug Collins are the others. Both House Republicans also faced fired-up crowds.\Isakson sought to ease some of the tensions at the start of the town hall, unequivocally condemning the Ku Klux Klan and white supremacist groups behind the deadly violence last weekend in Charlottesville. His remarks drew a standing ovation.\Earlier in the day on GPB Radio, Isakson leveled sharp criticism at the president for failing to immediately condemn the racist organizers of this weekend's fatal protest.\""If something that rises to that level of horror takes place, it should be expeditiously and quickly addressed by the leader of that country,"" he said on ""Political Rewind.""\At one point during Monday's town hall, facing a biting question about cuts to disability services in the failed GOP health care plan, he showed his cane to the audience and said he recently became disabled. He was invoking the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease that he revealed a few years ago, and some in the crowd groaned.\""I know how lucky I am to live here,"" he said, saying that Congress hasn't cut funding for disability services yet. ""And as far as I'm concerned, we're not going to.""\And targeted with a question about whether humans contribute to climate change, Isakson said he was a ""full believer"" that carbon contributes to the rise in temperatures. But he was roundly booed -- one person in the crowd cried ""go back to school"" -- when he suggested it was impossible to pin rising temperatures solely on human activity.\Before Monday, neither of Georgia's Republican U.S. senators had held a town hall since Trump's November victory, a strategy that many other of the state's GOP lawmakers have deployed.\Some have opted to meet with invite-only crowds. Others have used the more controlled telephone town hall format. Isakson held three of those this spring and summer, all of which were generally polite affairs. But some have criticized the strategy as a way of shutting out critics.\Ashley Grizzle Soeder, a 37-year-old magazine writer from Senoia, said Isakson needed ""to see the people face to face.""\""I feel like over the phone they can kind of choose who they answer,"" she said, ""but withthistheycan'treallyavoid directly speaking to them.""\Justin Kelley, a 31-year-old veteran and KSU student, said he was frustrated by the way the senator was treated.\""This is an elected official here to represent us and our voice,""he said. ""The fact that a lot of people just kept interrupting him before he was allowed to make his point, it was utter contempt and disrespect, in my opinion.""\Several members of the crowd, even attendees who asked critical questions, thanked Isakson for holding the event.\One said, ""It is outside of the city during rush hour, but I do appreciate you being here.""\Another added, ""I know a lot of your colleagues don't have the guts.""\Speaking to reporters after the event, Isakson found no problem with the sometimes-testy crowd.\""I would encourage all 99 of my colleagues to jump in,"" he said. ""The water's fine.""\ (Box)\ COMING SOON\The Atlanta Journal-Constitution is getting ready to launch a new premium experience for readers across the state who care about Georgia politics, policy and state news.PoliticallyGeorgia will bring you reporting you can't get anywhere else, thought-provoking opinion writing, and tools to help you navigate the world of government and make your voice heard.\CREDIT: Staff writer Jim Galloway"

234," For 82 years, a tidal gauge has been located at the same spot on the Georgia coast, at the Fort Pulaski National Monument on Cockspur Island.\On Tuesday, it became clear that Hurricane Matthew's record sea surge of last October would not be surpassed. Hurricane Irma's shoreward push fell short by a mere 3 inches and change.\You might think this good news, until you realize that Matthew was corralled in the Atlantic. Irma clawed her way up the west coast of Florida, and still had energy to maul the East Coast -- inundating Jacksonville, covering much of Tybee Island, and flooding the streets of Savannah and Charleston.\In other words, the second-place finisher at Fort Pulaski did all that with one hand tied behind her back. Never mind her ability, at the same time, to cover the entire state of Georgia with a green radar mitten.\You no doubt have heard that Scott Pruitt, the head of the federal Environmental Protection Agency, thinks it ""insensitive"" to discuss climate change policy in this particular climate, which has given us both Harvey and Irma over a three-week period.\Yes, we need to be respectful of a grim body count that stretches 2,000 miles, from the Caribbean to well beyond Houston. Lost homes and other property will take years to recoup as well.\But I will take my permission from Tomás Regalado, the mayor of suffering Miami. Of course, we should talk about it, he said: ""This is a truly, truly poster child for what is to come.""\Harvey and Irma were killer storms, no doubt. But they were policy drivers, too. Beyond the death and destruction, the past four weeks have amounted to a nonstop, TV-driven campaign against federal cuts to this country's meteorological operations -- as proposed by President Donald Trump this spring.\Aside from cuts to scientific research elsewhere, Trump proposed to end a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration program to build better prediction models for tornadoes in the South, and $11 million from a tsunami-warning program for the West Coast.\The National Weather Service would receive a 5 percent haircut. But NOAA's weather-satellite budget would be trimmed by 17 percent. Scientists presume the Trump administration has attempted to target climate change research rather than weather forecasting. But the two bleed into each other.\""So yes, they're not cutting the actual weather service, but one of the primary tools that the weather service uses -- that office is going to get cut massively,"" said Scott Weaver, leader of the climate science team at the D.C.-based Environmental Defense Fund.\Both Harvey and Irma demonstrated that more intense storms require closer watching. ""As we're starting to experience more extreme events, the ability to predict the weather in real time becomes even more important than it was just 20 or 30 years ago,"" Weaver said.\In Athens, Marshall Shepherd, director of the atmospheric science program at the University of Georgia and a former president of the American Meteorological Society, characterized the tracking of Harvey and Irma as an effective demonstration of science that works.\The first National Hurricane Center bulletin on Harvey was issued at 11 a.m. on Aug. 17. It made landfall in Texas eight days later. Irma was first noticed on Aug. 30, and struck the Keys nine days later.\""With both Harvey and Irma, we were talking about the threat of these days to weeks in advance. That's not by accident. That's because of advances that we're making,"" Shepherd said.\He thinks Trump's cuts are being reconsidered. ""My sense is that cuts won't be as dramatic as originally proposed by the administration,"" Shepherd said. ""Congress is learning the value of NOAA.""\It's possible that Harvey and Irma may even make it easier for Republicans to utter the words ""climate"" and ""change."" Together.\Daniel Rochberg is a former U.S. State Department worker on the faculty of Emory University. He's one of the organizers behind the Georgia Climate Project, which debuted this spring. It's intended to become a network of academics encompassing the entire state.\""The idea is that, any time a leader in the state wants to work this issue, now or in the future, from the Republican side or the Democratic side, they should have a team of folks to turn to, ready to roll with information at their fingertips,"" Rochberg said.\I asked him whether any Republicans, from Gov. Nathan Deal to U.S. Sens. Johnny Isakson or David Per-due, or GOP members of the U.S. House, had expressed any interest. Not yet, Rochberg said.\But he is optimistic, and noted two ""small but important"" messages from Georgia's state government.\In 2015, the wildlife division of the state Department of Natural Resources produced a report on climate change's impact on animal species throughout the state.\Last November, DNR convened a ""climate ready"" conference. ""We know that sea level's rising. To not prepare for it is really not a responsible course of action, no matter what your political inclinations,"" Spud Woodward, director of DNR's coastal resources division, was quoted as saying afterward.\That conference, Rochberg said, ""was a signal that the state is willing to convene a conversation around this, despite the politically charged nature of the issue.""\The needle that's being threaded here: Conversations about the effects of climate change may be necessary --especially when crop losses, flooding, or other observable effects are involved. Dialogue about the causes remains off-limits, for that could also lead to a discussion of remedies. And that's where the polarization starts.\Rochberg is kicking around the idea of inviting 50 conservative and 50 liberal students to Emory next spring, to see if some common ground on the topic might be found.\Just in time for the 2018 hurricane season.\CREDIT: Staff"
