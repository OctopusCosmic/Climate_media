Numerous species already have enough to contend with as climate changes drive them out of their natural habitats; a new study shows that they also have to compete with each other in outrunning those changes. 

The University of Connecticut study, to be published Wednesday in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, suggests that the effects of climate change on wildlife are a good deal more complicated than previously thought. 

Mark Urban, an assistant professor of ecology and environmental biology who led the new research, said many studies conducted on climate change and its potential impact on wildlife feature complex meteorological models to predict changes in climate. 

What they don't feature, he said, are equally complex models of how wildlife will react to those climate changes. Real-world factors -- the different rates at which animals migrate, how they prey on each other and how they get in each other's way -- need to be included for a more accurate picture. 

"Those models are really simplistic, and they're not including certain things that are really important," Urban said. "If we start looking at these complexities in predictive models, we will see striking differences in predictions." 

And, he said, some of those differences won't be for the better. 

"When we add those changes, we're going to see some surprises, and some of those surprises won't be good ones," he said. 

The study offers a new mathematical model that factors in migration rates and the intensity of competition from other species during migration. 

As climates change, species disperse to friendlier habitats. But they disperse at different rates. Urban compares this to several species moving along a single-lane highway. 

"What you don't want is a car that's really fast coming up from behind you," he said. Getting to a new environment is only half the battle. If another species has settled there first and is taking up limited space and consuming limited resources, the friendlier climate won't help much. 

In other words, it's not enough to outrun changes in the climate; species have to do so faster than their competitors. 

Differing dispersal rates will lead to entirely new relations among species, which also confounds predictions, he said. With climate changes, ecosystems are much more fluid and lead to what's known as "no-analogue communities" -- groups of species that never before interacted now contending with each other. 

"You'll see these communities that never occurred before suddenly occur; climate change creates these no-analogue communities," he said. "You don't know how they might interact." 

The mathematical model in Urban's study has not been applied to existing environments, so it's too early to say which species are most at risk. But the study suggests that climate change may have a drastic effect on species in the tropical regions. Unlike, for instance, species native to New England, which are exposed to several kinds of climate, those in the tropics live in a more uniform climate. As a result, they will have far fewer options for migrating to more livable habitats and will face much fiercer competition for the space. 

Further research, he said, might identify species that are particularly vulnerable, and that could lead to preservation efforts. One possibility, he said, is to facilitate migration -- moving a slow species into a more conducive habitat or even creating "competitor-free areas" for the more vulnerable species. 

He adds that this would have to be done with great caution because of unintended consequences that can come from that kind of intervention. 

Frank La Sorte, a postdoctoral researcher in the ornithology lab at Cornell University, said the study adds "biological realism" to the body of research on climate change. 

"To really understand the overall complexity, we need to look at these more refined biological factors," he said. "I think it adds to our current understanding and brings these important issues to the forefront." 

Gary Langham, vice president and chief scientist for the National Audubon Society, said the study is a reminder that "we need to appreciate all the complexities as we seek to protect the most important places for birds and other wildlife. 

"This paper underscores the 'web of life' problem -- species interact with each other and habitats in many complex ways," Langham said in an email. "Dispersal and competition are important considerations along with range changes and habitat resilience in making conservation decisions."

The Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority has approved the zero-emissions and low-emissions renewable energy credit program authorized last year as part of the state's landmark energy reform bill. 

The program, intended to increase the number of clean energy projects throughout the state, will be administered by Connecticut Light &Power and United Illuminating. The utilities are required to procure renewable energy credits under 15-year contracts with owners or developers of renewable energy projects. The program allows qualifying projects, such as a customer's rooftop solar panels, to sell their renewable energy credits to companies at a fixed price for a period of 15 years. 

Each year, CL&P And UI will sign power purchase agreements worth $8 million for zero-emission projects and $4 million for low-emissions projects, "an approach that will roll out over the next several years," said Dennis Schain, spokesman for the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. 

"The program will deploy hundreds of projects across the state at the lowest possible cost to ratepayers" and "will help jump start Connecticut's clean energy industry," DEEP Commissioner Daniel C. Esty said in a prepared statement. 

CL&P and UI are set to begin accepting bids from renewable energy project developers. 

The projects that require the smallest subsidies from the program will be selected for funding. Winning bidders will receive 15-year contracts for the payment of a set price per megawatt hour of energy output in the form of renewable energy credits.

After approving four sites in town for the installation of solar arrays, East Hartford is looking into seven additional sites for the purpose of producing more electricity savings. 

According to documents presented to the town council, which is scheduled to review the issue next Tuesday, the town has identified more roofs of public buildings that could be suitable for solar panels. 

Earlier this summer, the council approved the contracts between SunEdison, a solar company, and East Hartford. SunEdison will receive Zero Emission Renewable Energy credits -- energy subsidies by Connecticut Light &Power -- to help install and maintain solar panels at four schools and sell energy to the town. 

It has been predicted that through these initial installations by SunEdison, the town will save about $800,000 over the course of a 20-year contract. 

These projects will soon begin the local approval process, according to town memos. 

The state, through its Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, has released more credits for smaller projects this time and will begin receiving applications in late September, town Finance Director Michael Walsh wrote. 

If a power purchasing agreement is approved by the council, it "will commit the town to paying for electricity generated by a solar roof array canopy at each location to the owner of the equipment," he wrote. 

"The owner, in turn, will use the committed revenue stream from the town coupled with the ZEREC credits to make the infrastructure investment on behalf of the town," Walsh added, referring to the physical structures of the solar arrays. 

If the seven new sites are approved, Walsh estimated that between $700,000 and $1.6 million would be saved over another 20-year contract.

HURRICANE SANDY CLIMATE CHANGE MESSAGE 

Thorson, Robert . Hartford Courant ; Hartford, Conn. [Hartford, Conn]01 Nov 2012: A.14.

ProQuest document link 



 





ABSTRACT

  

[...]a picture is worth a thousand words. [...]some recommended reading. 



LINKS

FULL TEXT

 

Let Hurricane Sandy be our tipping point toward a better America. 

First, we're all in this together. As the wind strengthened and the hurricane neared, the political negativity and hostility waned. There's nothing like a common adversary to unite us, even a benign atmospheric one. It wasn't just that Sandy wreaked havoc on campaign plans. It's that both presidential candidates began to act more like governors than ideological opponents beholden to a spectrum of groups. Watching them gave me more faith in America's potential than all the bickering I've been forced to hear. Apparently, when push comes to shove we can work together because we must. 

Second, a picture is worth a thousand words. The satellite images showed a white, counterclockwise pinwheel of clouds just like every other hurricane I've seen -- except for its size. With what the pundits are calling a wingspan a thousand miles across, Sandy was two to three times larger than typical. Keep in mind that one of the most robust predictions of climate change theory is that extreme events will be more powerful, whether this unprecedented storm or last summer's unprecedented drought. 

Let this pinwheel become a pinup to move us toward a saner, safer, smarter future. A cultural shift similar to what I remember happening after earthlings got a chance to see our spherical, cloud-gauzed, green-swathed living planet from space. I refer to the famous earthrise photo taken from the moon during the Apollo 11 landing in July 1969. It helped launch the most potent phase of the American environmental movement, which centered on pollution and wilderness. Let the new pinup energize a third phase already underway, one focused on a sane energy policy and policy adaptations to the good and bad things of climate change. 

Third, some recommended reading. During the hurricane I kept thinking of a pair of books that ought to be hinged together as Part I and Part II of a larger work. The word diptych comes to mind. It's a pair of images hinged to fold inward for protection. In this case, the problem and the solution we're now facing. 

My diptych consists of two books: "The Control of Nature," by John McPhee and "America the Possible," by James Gustave Speth. Read the first till you weep with relief, having realized that control of nature remains an illusion. Read the second until you smile, knowing that the planetary wisdom it promulgates can be a more important part of the future. 

I've recommended "The Control of Nature" to every student I've taught since it was published in 1989. Its two main conclusions are pretty simple. First, we can't control nature. Second, we persist in believing that we can. That we can live or build directly in harm's way. That our engineers can protect us. That our emergency response systems will work and that endless quantities of government money will be there to pay for the cleanups. We delude ourselves, even when everyone is doing his or her best. 

Speth's latest book is just out. He's a wounded veteran of the environmental wars. Trained as a lawyer, he spent a lifetime working within the law with a special expertise in climate change policy. His antagonist was the corporatocracy currently running the United States through high-pressure lobbying and campaign contributions to elected beholders. Having realized that working within the law got him hardly anywhere on this issue, he decided to follow Henry David Thoreau's example and break the law in an act of civil disobedience. 

His book is a readable prescription for the future that's actually possible. His message is clear. A new political economy is coming, and will eventually win the day. One that is more democratic, sustainable and, in a word, better for us all. 

Let me be specific. (1) Politics need not be so petty. (2) Pin Sandy up. (3) Mandate and provide incentives for a retreat from the shore. (4) Support global carbon reductions. (5) Nature rules. (6) Democracy and dollars should not be the same. 

Robert M. Thorson is a professor of geology at the University of Connecticut's College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. His column appears every other Thursday. He can be reached at profthorson@yahoo.com.

More than a month after Hurricane Sandy wreaked havoc on the East Coast, a number of scientists are looking at how such a storm came to be and whether it can help us better predict future storms, or shed some light on larger weather patterns. 

At Avery Point, UConn scientists have spent the last few weeks entering data into the computer simulation of Sandy. That will be followed by a few months of analyzing the data. Current weather models are very helpful in simulating weather events and predicting major storms, said James O'Donnell, professor of marine sciences at University of Connecticut. But it could always be better. 

"All I'm saying is that things are changing ? the sea level is rising, the ocean is getting warmer," he said. "We could do a slightly better job at the prediction." 

The effects of a storm can vary greatly within a relatively small area within Long Island Sound, he said. Knowing where a storm is going to cause flooding and where that flooding is going to hit hardest is crucial to knowing how to minimize the damage, he said. 

The data that scientists have now does a good job in general prediction, but O'Donnell said what it means for specific geographical points is still a work in progress. 

"How it translates to Stonington and Groton and sedimentation in New Haven harbor ? all those things can be improved," he said. 

To that end, O'Donnell's team analyzes data collected by computers at four points in Long Island Sound. Meters on 600-pound buoys, weighed down by even larger anchors, measure current velocity, wind speed, wave height and water temperatures. The computers record and automatically email the data every 50 minutes. 

"What we've done so far is compare observations with what would have been expected for a typical hurricane," he said. "The flooding was a lot worse for a hurricane of those characteristics." For instance, it moved more slowly and to the west instead of the north. 

We can expect more major storms in the next several years, he said. "We're not sure what they'll look like ? they may be like Sandy, Irene or Bob, so we need to arrange a number of likely flooding scenarios," he said. 

O'Donnell's program began recording data in the Long Island Sound about 10 years ago, and works in collaboration with the state Department of Environmental and Energy Protection and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 

Regular maintenance of the equipment happens once a year. "We scrape it and paint and anything that's rusted, we fix." 

It costs about $500,000 a year to collect the data, and that doesn't include the maintenance and other operations of the program. 

So while O'Donnell and his team work to glean some information about Sandy to save Connecticut's coast, what does Sandy say about larger weather patterns? 

NOAA officials noted that Sandy's arrival happened during the 332nd consecutive month with an above-average temperature. Or as Philip Bump wrote in Grist, "if you were born in or after April 1985, if you are right now 27 years old or younger, you have never lived through a month that was colder than average." 

Kerry Emanuel, a scientist with NOAA, said that it was only in the last 10 years that meteorologists have developed a set of objective data to definitively identify hybrid storms such as Sandy. While much work has been done on looking at the frequency of conventional hurricanes, little has been done in considering whether hybrid storms are increasing either in frequency or intensity. 

"What Sandy did was to remind my colleagues and I that we haven't done our homework," he said. "We don't really know if they've increased. We don't know. But we should be able to know." 

Climatologists are currently studying Sandy to glean whatever insight they can about the storm and what it says about climate change, Emanuel said. But "the wheels of academia turn slowly," he said, and it will probably be about two-and-a-half years before you see papers published in journals. But he wouldn't be surprised if he hears several Sandy-related lectures at meteorological conferences in the spring. 

"There's some projects that we've been mulling over," he said. "One is to ask a hypothetical question of what would Sandy have been like hypothetically, had it occurred before this global warming?" 

Of course, Sandy was hardly the only hurricane this year. It wasn't even the strongest ? that would be Michael, which formed in September and reached Category 3, but fortunately never made landfall. According to the National Weather Service, 2010, 2011 and 2012 are all tied (along with 1887 and 1995) as the third most active hurricane seasons in recorded history with 19 named storms. Hurricanes and tropical storm names made it all the way to the Ts this year. 

Scientists have been singling out and anatomizing storms for research long before Sandy. Kevin E. Trenberth of the Climate Analysis Section at the USA National Center for Atmospheric Research, was part of a team that created a similar model for Hurricane Katrina, tweaking certain circumstances to see how outcomes might have changed. 

"We fiddled with the sea temperatures to see what it did to the storm," he said. "We were able to quantify at the time that maybe the global warming component added maybe one inch of rain. You can still say that it's only 10 percent, but if it's one inch on top of 11, it contributes to the risk that it will break the levees." 

But there's only so much one storm ? however big and unique it might be ? can show about the climate at large, said Thomas Knutson, also at NOAA. 

The confluence of events that created Sandy mean that it's a "once in 700 years storm," Knutson said. Whether that means that we're "wretchedly unlucky" to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, or whether the climate has changed in such a way that these storms will start happening a lot more frequently than once every 700 years is a question that requires more data. 

"We're more interested in things that are systematic and systematically changing over time. If you can establish such a pattern of more record highs than record lows, that tells you something," he said. "For instance, global mean temperatures are a good example, and how they've changed systematically over the century. It's the systematic part that counts."

STATE'S PLAN LOOKS TO HYDROPOWER 

Dowling, Brian . Hartford Courant ; Hartford, Conn. [Hartford, Conn]19 Mar 2013: A.6.

ProQuest document link 



 





ABSTRACT

  

The new study of renewable energy sources sets up the state to buy power from large hydropower projects such as Hydro-Quebec or those in the Canadian Maritimes. 



LINKS

FULL TEXT

 

State environmental officials are trying to decrease reliance on energy from wood-burning biomass and tap into hydropower from dams in Canada to help meet its escalating renewable-energy targets, something it expects this year to miss for the first time. 

"The incentives in this marketplace haven't produced enough on-the-ground renewable projects," Commissioner Daniel Esty of the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection said in an interview. 

The department on Tuesday will release details of a study addressing proposed changes in its renewable-energy strategy. A summary of the study was available for review Monday. 

The plan supports proposed changes to state laws governing how much of which type of energy the state should promote. 

Ratepayers suffer when the state falls short of its renewable energy targets, as is expected this year, Esty said. The main reason: State incentives have gone to the wrong technologies, he said. 

The new study of renewable energy sources sets up the state to buy power from large hydropower projects such as Hydro-Quebec or those in the Canadian Maritimes. It would also wean the state off of old, out-of-state biomass plants and create more renewable projects in Connecticut. 

But some critics say that the state's approach might run against the goal of lower rates. 

"They have a couple different priorities, and they tend to work at cross-purposes," said Nick Culver, an analyst with Bloomberg New Energy Markets. "It will be very difficult to reduce reliance on out-of-state renewables and at the same time reduce electricity bills at home." 

The state wants more renewables, too, from sources such as solar, wind, fuel cells, tidal power and hydropower. The study plans to extend the state's push for renewables from 20 percent of its total energy use by 2020 to 25 percent by 2025. 

Pending legislation would include hydropower from large out-of-state dams in the state's portfolio of renewable energy. The power would be acquired by contract, rather than the existing system of renewable energy credits. If the legislation goes through, the state hopes to join with Massachusetts and Vermont to procure renewable energy as a group, with the hope of buying the power at lower prices. 

To get more energy from Connecticut sources, state environmental officials hope, through legislation, to change regulations on the largest source of out-of-state renewable energy: biomass. 

The proposal would tighten emission limits for biomass plants -- which burn mainly wood to create energy -- and require the plants to buy carbon offsets for the energy it takes to transport wood. The state expects the new rules to drive some biomass plants out of the Connecticut market. 

The changes could reform the market into "a game of 'Survivor' from here on for New England biomass," Culver said. "Some plants won't be able to stay afloat if Connecticut steadily tightens emission criteria. This could ultimately increase costs for ratepayers, forcing regulators to double down on imported hydropower." 

It's also unclear how many biomass plants the regulatory tightening might push out of the Connecticut market. William Dornbos, Connecticut director of Environment Northeast, said, "Existing and proposed biomass facilities in Massachusetts demonstrate that it is feasible to meet or exceed this limit." 

Further, some are warning that jumping into large hydropower could run counter to the state's call for more in-state renewables. 

"This bill will stifle the growth potential of the state's renewable energy industry by providing economic incentives for well-established, utility-owned Canadian hydropower," said Paul R. Michaud, executive director of the Renewable Energy and Efficiency Business Association.

CRRA CAPS LANDFILL, PUTS UP SOLAR ARRAY 

Dowling, Brian . Hartford Courant ; Hartford, Conn. [Hartford, Conn]08 June 2013: A.5.

ProQuest document link 



 





ABSTRACT

  

The cap and one-megawatt solar array will cost the trash-to-energy authority about $11.6 million and will make the landfill the first in the state to develop its limited-use real estate into a renewable energy project. 



LINKS

FULL TEXT

 

The Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority is putting in a six-acre array of solar panels on a section of its Hartford landfill. The solar project coincides with the authority's plan to cap the remaining 35-acre section of the landfill. 

The cap and one-megawatt solar array will cost the trash-to-energy authority about $11.6 million and will make the landfill the first in the state to develop its limited-use real estate into a renewable energy project. 

Across the country, there are more than 70 similar projects on contaminated sites, former landfills or mined areas that create 216 megawatts of clean energy, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Most are solar projects such as Hartford's, but others include wind power, wood-burning biomass, hydropower and geothermal. 

"When we began working with the city of Hartford on the future of the landfill, we wanted to find innovative ways to use the land," CRRA President Thomas D. Kirk said in a written statement. 

"Solar energy was an idea we all agreed on right away." 

Output from the solar panels will receive an 11-cent per kilowatt hour subsidy from the Zero Emissions Renewable Energy Credit program, Connecticut Light &Power's clean energy effort mandated by the state. 

The cost of building the project will be covered by a Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority fund dedicated to closing the landfill. 

E. T. &L. Corp., hired to close the final 35-acre part of the landfill and put in the solar array, first will install a synthetic grass surface that will ensure that water doesn't seep through the landfill waste and contaminate the groundwater. 

In 2007, the resources recovery authority began closing the landfill, and the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection approved the plans for a solar array in 2011.

A shot at a long-term contract is reviving a renewable energy project here that has spent the past few years idling. 

The project -- 42 megawatts of power from biomass, 2.3 megawatts from solar, and 5.6 megawatts from fuel cells -- is one of many proposals submitted Monday in response to a call from the state energy department for contracted renewable energy. 

Other projects include: at least five wind turbine projects in Maine and New Hampshire, a 28-megawatt fuel cell park in Killingly and a Connecticut-based solar project. 

The developer of the Montville renewable energy park, NRG Energy Inc., expanded its initial plans to just convert an old coal boiler. The new plans include a solar farm and some fuel cells, a diversity the company says will aid it in its bid for a long-term renewable energy contract with the state that it filed Monday. 

"This is the legacy of Connecticut's electricity generation behind us," John Baylor, NRG Energy's senior director of development and head of the Montville project, said while standing in front of the old, riverside power plant. 

"This," he said, pointing at the new project plans, "is our future." 

The state's step into contracting renewable energy projects signals a continuation of its proactive approach to developing renewable power through programs such as its low- and zero-emissions subsidy programs. 

Until now, the state's electric companies mostly ran the clean energy purchasing though a market, where supply and demand on any given day dictated the amount of subsidy a solar farm or fuel cell park could get. For some, such as NRG, the uncertainty made getting financing difficult, if not impossible. 

Baylor said that without a long-term power contract, financing for the more than $100 million project wasn't possible. The end of the state's Project 150 clean energy contract program closed that door. And last year, an attempt to lock in a power purchase contract as a stipulation to Northeast Utilities' merger with NSTAR failed. 

"This is the first opportunity we have to bid into a contract," Baylor said. 

Adding some certainty for developers through a long-term contract, the approach mirrors one Massachusetts launched in late 2010, when the state directed its electric distribution companies to enter into long-term power agreements for clean energy rather than buying the energy off the oftentimes volatile markets. 

Criteria for acceptance of the bids, such as NRG's, focus on dollars and cents -- in the end, a determination of how much of a subsidy the projects will need. Viability and reliability of the project also play a significant part in the application. The latter item on the bid could favor Connecticut projects that rely on fewer miles of transmission lines. 

Developers plan to convert an old coal steam unit that burns oil and gas into a biomass unit, which would run on locally harvested wood from tree trimmings, foresters and sawmills. The finished biomass boiler, though set to create 42 megawatts of electricity, still will be able to burn oil or gas when higher outputs are needed. In those cases, the unit could generate 82 megawatts. 

According to NRG estimates, the 80 miles surrounding the Montville park could supply about 2.3 million tons of wood annually. The station would need about 400,000 tons to operate at full bore. The biomass conversion and operation, the company said, would add up to 200 jobs to the local and regional economy. 

The fuel cells also would be locally grown, so to speak, by FuelCell Energy Inc., which manufactures its products in Torrington and is headquartered in Danbury. 

The company is bidding to develop the Killingly fuel cell park, which, if accepted, would be the second largest in the world. The world's largest, also a FuelCell Energy project, is under construction in South Korea. 

Decisions on the bids are expected to be made by Aug. 20, with contract negotiations and regulator approval expected to stretch into mid-October.

RELIGIOUS LEADERS TALK FAITH, CLIMATE CHANGE 

Weir, William . Hartford Courant ; Hartford, Conn. [Hartford, Conn]08 Nov 2013: B.3.

ABSTRACT

  

The Rev. Virginia W.G. Army of St. John's Episcopal Church in Vernon said the religious community played a role in the civil rights movement but has been less aggressive on environmental issues.

Discussions about climate change often include references to extreme weather events, but they rarely go as far back as the flood that sent Noah off on an ark. 

But such was the nature of the Climate Stewardship Summit at the Asylum Hill Congregational Church, an interfaith forum on the role of religion in dealing with climate change. 

"People think of it as a political issue -- it's been so politicized," said Terri Eickel, executive director of the Interreligious Eco-Justice Network and one of the event's organizers. "Our goal is to say that it's not just a political issue, it's a personal issue and a spiritual issue." 

While the environment has increasingly become an issue of concern among interfaith groups, she said, Thursday's summit was "pretty unique, in its scope and its depth." 

Attendance was greater than organizers anticipated, with about 200 people. 

During a round-table discussion, Rabbi Joshua Ratner of the Jewish Community Relations Council in New Haven referred to the Book of Genesis, when God gave Adam and Eve the job of tending to the Garden of Eden. And the covenant that God made after the flood, he said, wasn't specifically with humanity but with all the Earth. 

"The main notion being that we are entrusted with a sense of stewardship over the Earth," Ratner said. "The Earth is the Lord's, it's not ours. We are here as guests, as stewards. I think that's something that's not particular to the Jewish faith, but something we share across religious sensibilities." 

Looking at the Earth and the climate from a theological perspective, he said, allows people to approach the issue away from the "secular, Western modern, tradition of human centrism" that views the Earth's resources as belonging specifically to humanity. 

"If you look at it from a Jewish perspective, the Earth itself has rights," Ratner said. "The Earth itself is entitled to rest and revivification, and is not just there for us to use and exploit as we see fit." 

The Rev. Virginia W.G. Army of St. John's Episcopal Church in Vernon said the religious community played a role in the civil rights movement but has been less aggressive on environmental issues. 

"I think for people who are faithful and want to provide leadership and direction on this ethical question, it means engaging in conflict, and I think that's hard for us as people of peace and people with a lot on our plates," she said. "Part of the way we're going to get there is by bearing witness and being prophetic, even when there's deep personal cost to that."

RENEWABLE ENERGY LAWSUIT: ESTY OVERSTEPS AUTHORITY 

Haar, Dan . Hartford Courant ; Hartford, Conn. [Hartford, Conn]28 Dec 2013: A.9.

ABSTRACT

  

Allco Renewable Energy Ltd., based on Wall Street in New York City, submitted bids from five solar facilities when the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection sought bids in July for 15-year contracts to sell power to Connecticut Light &Power.

Connecticut's headaches over two long-term deals for renewable power, including a large contract with a Maine Wind Farm, now include a lawsuit by a New York firm that owns competing solar generation facilities. 

Allco Renewable Energy Ltd., based on Wall Street in New York City, submitted bids from five solar facilities when the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection sought bids in July for 15-year contracts to sell power to Connecticut Light &Power. In September, the department awarded contracts to a Maine wind project and a solar project in Connecticut -- but not to Allco. 

Allco filed a lawsuit against Dan Esty, the DEEP commissioner, in U.S. District Court in Connecticut, claiming the contracts amount to the state setting wholesale power rates. That's against the Federal Power Act that gives U.S. regulators the exclusive right to oversee wholesale markets, Allco said in the lawsuit, which was filed Nov. 27 and seeks to have the deals revoked, along with other relief. 

Allco's lawsuit also said pricing of contracts was not done properly under federal law, and its offer was for a lower amount than one of the winning bids. 

The most controversial of the contracts is for 250 megawatts, with the so-called Number Nine Wind Project in Maine, which has not yet been built. Critics say that agreement raises concerns about transmitting the power, and could lead the state to ignore renewable energy sources that are based locally. 

Allco "will suffer irreparable harm" because its solar facilities "are competing for a limited supply of long-term renewable energy contracts in Connecticut, and the defendant's interference with the wholesale energy market in violation of the FPA will cause the Plaintiff to suffer substantial economic losses," the lawsuit said. 

The department said it conducted the bidding and awarded the contracts properly after working closely with the state Attorney General's office, the Office of Consumer Counsel and outside lawyers. 

"We are confident we followed all legal requirements during this process and are eager to advance Governor Malloy's agenda of bringing cheaper, cleaner, and more reliable energy to the residents and businesses of Connecticut," department spokesman Dwayne Gardner said in a written statement.

CLIMATE CHANGE COMES CALLING, NO DENYING IT / OUR VIEW

ABSTRACT

  

The state adopted a Connecticut Climate Preparedness Plan pursuant to 2008 legislation, and in January the state launched the CT Institute for Resiliency and Climate Adaptation at the University of Connecticut Avery Point Campus in Groton, a research center designed to gather data and develop policy tools to help communities prepare for severe weather and rising sea levels.

Think for a minute of the Dust Bowl of the 1930s. Human activity -- plowing of deep-rooted native grasses across a 150,000-square-mile swath of the Great Plains -- caused a human and environmental disaster. 

It can happen, and there is every indication it is happening again, on a broader scale. 

The National Climate Assessment, released this month, says that climate change is not something to be worried about in the future, something that can be palmed off on our children. It is already affecting every part of the country, causing extreme weather with dire consequences. 

In the Northeast, communities "are affected by heat waves, more extreme precipitation events and coastal flooding due to sea level rise and storm surge," which means "infrastructure, agriculture, fisheries and ecosystems will be increasingly compromised." 

The essence of the report is that the U.S. average temperature has increased by 1.3 degrees to 1.9 Fahrenheit since 1895, that most of this increase has occurred since 1970 -- and that nothing but humans burning fossil fuels explains most of this change. This point has been made by numerous studies, including two United Nations studies and one by American Association for the Advancement of Science. It represents an overwhelming consensus among scientists. 

LOW CARBON 

We need to become a low-carbon society. The challenge is getting the public behind that notion. Pew Research and Gallup polls in the past year found that only about a third of Americans think climate change is a serious and immediate problem. Many right-leaning Republicans deny there's a problem at all. 

There's some hope, if the world changes its ways. The report says that if the U.S. and other big emitters enact polices that cut emissions considerably, U.S. temperatures will rise about 3 degrees to 5 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century. Continue what we're doing, and U.S. temperatures will rise by 5 degrees to 10 degrees, which means that summers in Connecticut will be as hot as those in Georgia are now. 

To prevent that unfortunate outcome, we must mitigate the damage through lower emissions of heat-trapping gases, and must adapt to the changing climate. As a state and country, we are in the early stages of both. Yes, other countries have to join the effort, but the U.S. will have no authority if we are still a big part of the problem. 

STATE EFFORTS 

Connecticut has begun to address the issue. The state was a founder of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a nine-state compact that has reduced power plant emissions by 40 percent since 2005. 

The state adopted a Connecticut Climate Preparedness Plan pursuant to 2008 legislation, and in January the state launched the CT Institute for Resiliency and Climate Adaptation at the University of Connecticut Avery Point Campus in Groton, a research center designed to gather data and develop policy tools to help communities prepare for severe weather and rising sea levels. 

Some shoreline communities, aided by environmental organizations such as The Nature Conservancy and Connecticut Fund for the Environment, have created stricter rules for rebuilding homes in flood zones or begun to protect open space near marshes so that the marshes can expand. 

Still, as UConn geologist Robert Thorson noted in a recent Courant column, misguided policies continue to encourage building in vulnerable shoreline locations. 

On the mitigation front, the state has made progress at reducing energy use in buildings, and two transit systems come online in the next two years -- but there is much more to be done.

HYDROPOWER PROJECT RECEIVES PRAISE 

Byron, Ken . Hartford Courant ; Hartford, Conn. [Hartford, Conn]10 July 2014: V.12.

ProQuest document link 



 





ABSTRACT

  

First Selectman Richard Barlow has championed the project and said part of his father's job at the Collins Company was to maintain the dam. 



LINKS

FULL TEXT

 

A hydropower proposal on the Farmington River in Collinsville was cited as an example for Connecticut and the nation July 1 as federal, state and local officials announced an important step forward for the project. 

U.S. Sen. Christopher Murphy, U.S. Rep. Elizabeth Esty and Gov. Dannel P. Malloy gathered at the dam on the Farmington River in Collinsville to announce the passage of the Collinsville Renewable Energy Promotion Act. 

The legislation had been years in the making and its passage was a key boost for a hydropower project the town has been working on since 2007. The bill reinstates two licenses from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to use the dam, as well as for another downstream. The legislation also gives the dams to the town. 

Murphy said the legislation, which President Barack Obama signed into law recently, helps ensure that the project will be completed. He and Esty said that as small as the project is, it's a model for what can be accomplished with renewable energy projects. Officials say the project could generate nearly 2 megawatts of power, enough to power 1,500 homes. 

"This can be a model for Connecticut and the region," Murphy said. "We know we have to commit to renewable energy." 

Murphy promoted the project when he was congressman and continued it in the Senate. The bill was the first that Esty introduced after she was elected in 2012. 

"This is a template for producing local power," Esty said. 

Malloy said the state is ready to move forward with the project. "This is about clean, cheap, more reliable energy and producing as much of it in Connecticut as possible," Malloy said, adding that the Canton project is part of a larger effort the state is pushing to establish clean, renewable energy. 

One dam is in Collinsville and the other is further downstream in Avon and Burlington. They were built by the former Collins Company and generated electricity for the factory it ran in Canton that made axes and machetes. The company closed in 1966 and the dams have not been used for hydropower since then. 

First Selectman Richard Barlow has championed the project and said part of his father's job at the Collins Company was to maintain the dam. 

"We have a lot of work to do but we have cleared a major, significant hurdle," Barlow said. 

Murphy said that under the terms of the bill, the town has two years to get the project going. He said after the press conference that financial assistance from the federal government is unlikely. For that, the town has turned to the private sector. 

In June, the board of selectmen authorized negotiations with New England Hydropower LLC to partner with it on the project. A contract with the company is not expected to be finalized until the fall.

GROWING PAINS

ABSTRACT

  

Global warming in the next few decades might mean that Connecticut vineyards could grow more and tastier crops of classic grapes like chardonnay, merlot and cabernet sauvignon, Ferrandino said. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station is working with a $24,000-a-year federal grant to raise and test hybrid wine grapes at its Lockwood Farm facility in Hamden.

Connecticut isn't at all like the sunny, dry-summer places where most of the world's great wine grapes are grown. Winters are more bitter than in France. Growing seasons are shorter and wetter than in Italy, Spain or California. 

So you'd think that global warming would be greeted with hallelujahs at Connecticut's 32 vineyards and hosannas from scientists trying to help grape growers deal with New England's climate. Warmer average temperatures and extended growing time would seem to be a perfect recipe for better Connecticut wine. 

Except it's not that simple. Experts warn that climate change will bring both new opportunities for Connecticut winemakers and increasing risks. 

"Global warming sounds good," said Jamie Jones, an owner of Jones Winery in Shelton and president of the Connecticut Vineyard and Winery Association. "But it's not a slam dunk." 

Connecticut's 32 state-licensed wineries recently wrapped up their harvest season. 

"This has been probably our largest harvest ever," said Jones, whose family is continuing to expand its vineyard. Jones said that the additional acre of vines picked this year added about 5 tons to the winery's harvest. 

"The complexities here are immense," said Frank Ferrandino, a scientist at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station. Global warming in the next few decades might mean that Connecticut vineyards could grow more and tastier crops of classic grapes like chardonnay, merlot and cabernet sauvignon, Ferrandino said. 

"Grape production in Connecticut will greatly benefit from warmer, drier summers" was one of the conclusions of a 2010 report by the Governor's Steering Committee on Climate Change. "Grapes will have a longer time to mature, making more varieties a viable option in Connecticut (especially red varieties), and the sugar content will increase, making Connecticut grapes more desirable for wine production." 

The trouble is that climate change is also expected to trigger more severe and frequent storms, with uncertain temperature shifts. Winter cold snaps might go deeper and longer, early warm spells could be followed by late frosts, even though overall annual temperatures continue to rise. The possibility of increased rainfall raises the threat of increased grapevine diseases like mildew and mold. 

"Erratic weather is not good," Jones said. "Wine grapes don't like extremes." 

That's especially true for the classic viniferous grapes that evolved and developed around the Mediterranean Sea and in warmer regions of Europe over thousands of years, like cabernet sauvignon from Bordeaux, pinot noir from Burgundy, and warmth-loving vines from elsewhere in France, Italy and Spain. Those sorts of grapes also thrive in the drier, gentler climates of California, Oregon, Australia, Chile and other world wine regions. 

Deep cold, like the frigid periods that Connecticut residents suffered through this past winter, can damage the roots of those European grapevines. "We're expecting a 40 percent crop loss," Cornell University viticulture expert Tim Martinson said, referring to grapevines in the Northeast damaged by extremely cold weather.. 

"For our grape growers, the most important thing is not how warm the summers are, but how cold the winters get," Ferrandino said. 

Various Connecticut vineyards do plant and harvest European-style wine grapes despite the risks. Ferrandino said that the best places to grow them at the moment are near the shoreline, where the waters of Long Island Sound help moderate winter extremes. 

The native grapes that evolved in North America are a lot tougher, more resistant to dramatic shifts in winter and summer temperatures, Ferrandino said. Unfortunately, he said, those native cold-resistant grapes have a different flavor, often described as "foxy" or sweet, and don't make good wine. 

For decades, scientists at Cornell University and other U.S. research centers have been breeding hybrid grape varieties, crossing traditional European grapes with American grapes. Their goal is to create grapes able to survive American weather and also make excellent wine. With names like Saint-Croix, Cayuga and Seyval Blanc, the hybrids "tend to be acidic ... and make a little harsher wine," Ferrandino said. 

Most Connecticut vineyards, even those that plant traditional European varieties, raise hybrids as a backup against cold weather. "If it gets too cold, you have to plant hybrids," Ferrandino said. 

"As a farmer in New England, that's all you do is hedge your bets," said Jones, whose Shelton vineyard plants seven or eight varieties of grapes and has been gradually expanding the amount of acreage devoted to wine fruit. 

Another worry for state grape growers is the possibility that climate change bringing warmer average temperatures could also result in wetter weather at critical times. 

The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station is working with a $24,000-a-year federal grant to raise and test hybrid wine grapes at its Lockwood Farm facility in Hamden. Ferrandino, who is in charge of the project, said 32 varieties are being grown there. 

The hybrid grapes grown in Hamden are tested for things like weight, sugar content, acidity and disease resistance, he said. Once harvested, they are sent back to the research facility for taste tests. Wine made from the grapes grown in Hamden is then compared to wine made from the same hybrids grown in other regions. Ferrandino said the idea is to find out which varieties grow best in which areas and weather conditions. 

"The trouble is, this stuff takes eight years. ... We have to accumulate enough data to make a statement" about a particular hybrid variety, Ferrandino said. 

Such research projects, especially those involving disease-resistant grape varieties, could become even more important as Connecticut's climate changes. 

As Connecticut winemakers wonder how global warming might actually help them, their counterparts in more established wine regions are increasingly concerned that rising temperatures will force drastic, even catastrophic, changes. 

A study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences predicts that there are likely to be dramatic declines in production in many of the world's premier wine regions by 2050. 

Computer models forecast as much as an 85 percent drop in production for areas such as Bordeaux, Rhone and Tuscany, while California's wine grape crops could be cut by 70 percent. 

New York's Finger Lakes wine country, which made its reputation growing high-quality wines from cool-weather Riesling grapes, might also undergo significant changes, according to Cornell's Martinson. "It might become too hot for some varieties that are now adapted to this region," he said. 

The same study also predicted that new areas in places like northern Europe and even the Yellowstone region of North America could become suitable for growing wine grapes. Martinson said that sections of the northeastern United States could eventually end up with a climate similar to what North Carolina has now. 

"Within the industry, there's a lot of head-scratching going on," Jones said. 

"There remains significant opportunities to grow more grapes in Connecticut," said Connecticut's agriculture commissioner, Steven Reviczky. "But it's going to require us to be a little more nimble. ... It's not going to be easy."

Leidos Inc. is selling its Plainfield wood-fired power plant to Greenleaf Power, a Sacramento company that is buying biomass plants across North America. 

Greenleaf Power announced Wednesday it has agreed to buy the 37.5-megawatt power plant in a deal it expects to close later this year. 

The company bought four California biomass plants in 2010 and 2011 and a Canadian plant in 2013. In a statement, Greenleaf President Hugh Smith said, "Plainfield solidifies Greenleaf Power's presence throughout North America as the leading owner-operator of biomass power facilities." 

He added, "This facility holds tremendous promise and we look forward to working closely with the Plainfield community." 

The Plainfield Renewable Energy plant incinerates wood from construction waste and other sources that would otherwise be openly burned or dumped in a landfill, said Greenleaf, which is majority-owned and managed by Denham Capital, a Boston private equity firm. 

The young biomass plant, a project initially valued at $225 million, has already shifted ownership once. 

In October 2013, as the secured lender on the project, Leidos Holdings took the title to the plant from the initial owner, Enova Energy Group, which failed to complete construction on the facility. Months later, the biomass plant began producing power and selling it to Connecticut Light &Power under Connecticut's clean power program known as Project 150. 

But operation of the plant proved difficult for Leidos. The plant failed to be profitable for the company and suffered numerous shutdowns over the last year, according to Leidos. The plant reported $6 million in operating losses in the fourth quarter of 2014. 

"Clearly, the Plainfield project has had adverse impacts to our financials," Mark W. Sopp, Leidos' chief financial officer, said Wednesday in a conference call with investors. 

Sopp said Greenleaf Power will pay Leidos $30 million in cash and provide a secured note of about $80 million at closing. Leidos sold the power plant for $40 million less than what was listed on the company's balance sheet. But the company was glad to be done with it. 

"While we are disappointed with the further impairment to the value embedded in the sales price, we do believe for many reasons that accepting this offer was the best course of action for the company and our shareholders," Sopp said.

MALLOY 'RECOMMITS' TO 2050 GOALS 

Dowling, Brian . Hartford Courant ; Hartford, Conn. [Hartford, Conn]23 Apr 2015: A.7.

ProQuest document link 



 





ABSTRACT

  

Robert Klee, commissioner of the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, who will be chairman of the council, said there is a "moral imperative" to meet the goals Connecticut enacted with the 2008 adoption of the Global Warming Solutions Act.

The Malloy administration picked Wednesday, Earth Day, to reboot a coordinated campaign against climate change that had been dormant since the state completed a report on the subject four years ago. 

While the state is on pace to reach its next emissions target, Connecticut is without a road map to accomplish the ambitious, and statutorily mandated, goal of reducing greenhouse gases to 80 percent of 2001 levels by 2050. 

"It is going to be a big task." Gov. Dannel P. Malloy said Wednesday, steps from the swelling Connecticut River, after signing an executive order "recommitting" the state to the global challenge of climate change by seating a Governor's Council on Climate Change. 

The council will set interim goals and recommend carbon-cutting policies. Its goal is for Connecticut to average 2 percent reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in each of the next 35 years. 

Robert Klee, commissioner of the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, who will be chairman of the council, said there is a "moral imperative" to meet the goals Connecticut enacted with the 2008 adoption of the Global Warming Solutions Act. 

Most of Connecticut's greenhouse gas emissions come from the transportation sector, power plants and residential heating. And while power plants and residents have cut their emissions from 1990 levels, emissions from the transportation sector are higher than they were 25 years ago. 

Following a 1990 assessment from the United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Connecticut was the first in the United States to pass legislation requiring actions to control carbon emissions. A decade later, the state issued its first Climate Change Action Plan, whose goal was to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to levels that eliminate any threat to the climate. 

In 2008, the Global Warming Solutions Act committed the state to cut its greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2010; to 10 percent below 1990 levels by 2020; and finally to 80 percent of 2001 levels by the middle of the century. 

Although Connecticut's 2005 Climate Change Action plan outlined steps for Connecticut to reach its first two goals, it was silent on the final one, which will be the goal of this rebooted climate change council. 

It is unclear what sort of policy changes the council will recommend in its report to the governor's office, due by the end of 2015, but there is agreement that the proposals need gravitas. 

One independent report said the state needs "very different policies" to meet the goal, while the state itself has characterized what's required as "significant additional measures and breakthrough technologies." 

Malloy, who is confident the 2050 goal can be met, nevertheless said the state has some "ground to make up." 

His 15-member council will include state agency officials from energy and environment, economic and community development, transportation, housing, administrative services, insurance, public utilities authority and policy and management.

MALLOY URGES NEW COUNCIL TO LEAD 

Hladky, Gregory B . Hartford Courant ; Hartford, Conn. [Hartford, Conn]11 July 2015: B.1.

ProQuest document link 



 





ABSTRACT

  

Malloy created the new council by executive order on Earth Day 2015, in an effort to push forward with efforts to reduce greenhouse gases and deal with rising sea levels, violent weather and other consequences of global warming.

FULL TEXT

 

*Connecticut has $570 billion worth of insured properties along its shoreline. The amount was incorrect in a story on Page B1 Saturday. 

What a little state like Connecticut does about global warming has "relatively little to do with what happens in the rest of the world," Gov. Dannel P. Malloy acknowledged Friday to members of his new Climate Change Council. 

"Except that someone has to lead," Malloy quickly added, arguing that Connecticut can show the rest of the world "what can be done" to dramatically reduce the manmade pollution he said is clearly having an impact on climate. 

"We can demonstrate here in Connecticut ... that small entities and large entities can have an impact on the environment," Malloy said. "Ultimately, we have to find a cleaner way to do things." 

Robert Klee, commissioner of the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, used the council's first meeting to warn that the panel is facing "a very big challenge" in planning how to meet the state's major anti-pollution goals and preparing Connecticut for the unstoppable impacts of climate change. 

Malloy created the new council by executive order on Earth Day 2015, in an effort to push forward with efforts to reduce greenhouse gases and deal with rising sea levels, violent weather and other consequences of global warming. It includes top-level state officials and representatives from environmental groups. 

Malloy, Klee and other council members offered lots of examples of how well Connecticut has done on climate change issues in the past decade, including cutting greenhouse gas emissions by more than 10 percent since 2004. 

In 2012, according to the most recent statewide emissions inventory, Connecticut pumped 39.5 million metric tons of greenhouse gases into the air. 

"We've just begun the hard work," said Klee, pointing to the state's official target of slashing those gas emissions to 9 million metric tons over the next 35 years. 

One of the toughest parts of the new council's job will be to set interim targets that will determine how quickly Connecticut should move in an anti-pollution effort that is bound to have a major impact on the state's economy. 

Another critical area for the council is preparing the state, cities, towns and residents for the inevitable changes that global warming is expected to bring. Those include a continued increase in sea levels along Long Island Sound and more frequent and stronger weather events, like hurricanes. 

Katie Wade, state insurance commissioner, noted that there are $57 billion worth of insured properties along Connecticut's shoreline. She said that in 2011, between Tropical Storm Irene and a late October snowstorm, Connecticut insurance claims for storm-related damage approached $1 billion. 

Connecticut's new two-year state budget includes $20 million in bonding to help cover the costs of preparing state and local infrastructure to withstand changes in climate. 

Some shoreline communities are already seeing increases in local flooding that experts say is due to the rising water levels in the Sound, and utilities with coastal plants are already working to safeguard their facilities from sea level increases. 

"Where are our assets, and how can we protect them?" was the way Scott Jackson, a former mayor of Hamden and now a top official in Malloy's Office of Policy and Management, described the task ahead.

Greenskies Renewable Energy, a Middletown company that designs, finances, builds and maintains solar panel systems on big box stores and for towns, schools and universities, said it has lined up $165 million to finance coming projects. 

The company said it has an agreement from First Niagara bank and a tax equity investor. The money will finance 127 projects in 12 states. 

Some of the commercial projects in Greenskies' pipeline include 180 solar installations for Target stores in Arizona, Maine, Michigan, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas and Wisconsin and two warehouses in New York. The average array will contain 1,700 solar panels. 

This is the sixth round of financing with First Niagara in the past three years, the company said, but executives declined to say how much the bank had backed in total. The company was founded by Mike Silvestrini seven years ago, out of conversations he had with Art Linares Jr., who at the time had just finished high school. 

Linares, now 26, is a state senator from Westbrook. 

Linares' father, Art Linares Sr., and Centerplan Construction, also of Middletown, were instrumental in guiding and funding the company in its early years. Robert Landino, CEO of Centerplan's parent company, is chairman of the Greenskies board. 

Greenskies contracts with installers, and has 50 workers in Middletown for sales, engineering and administrative duties.

CHRIS SCHWEITZER 

TUHUS, MELINDA . Hartford Courant ; Hartford, Conn. [Hartford, Conn]22 Nov 2015: 38.

ProQuest document link 



 





ABSTRACT

  

Leading up to last autumn's People's Climate March in New York City, Schweitzer and volunteers made a papier-mache Statue of Liberty, festooned with greenery and painted butterflies, which he set out on the street and took to various places, like the Wooster Street Farmers' Market (pictured).

Chris Schweitzer sees art as a way to reach people who haven't thought much about climate change. 

As program director for the New Haven/Leon Sister City Project, his first work was a "tiny house" -- a typical dwelling of a peasant from Nicaragua, where Leon is located. 

"The house underlined the fragility of the lives of the farmers in places like Nicaragua, Bangladesh and Peru who are affected by climate change," Schweitzer says. He took it to 10 schools and the New Haven Green. 

"The goal was to connect with people on a different level," he continues. "There's information about climate change out there, but people aren't necessarily getting the full picture. I hope this will grab them and get them thinking about it in a different way." 

An ongoing project has been the creation of butterflies -- 800 to date -- cut from plastic jugs and painted in realistic or fantastic designs. 

"The butterflies and other art we've done is to get people involved in making the art," Schweitzer says, "and also when it's done, to put it in schools or on street corners and get them to think about climate change." 

Kids and adults in both New Haven and Nicaragua made the butterflies and in the process may have picked up information about climate change. Education is part of the mission of the sister city project, which works in New Haven and Leon "to promote social justice and support education and sustainable development," according to www.newhavenleon.org. 

"I think people, right now, culturally, are not energized," he says, "and the thing about art is it can be really powerful. It can evoke emotion, be playful, be disarming. One of the reasons we do butterflies is they are really pretty, and everyone loves butterflies, but then they can think about the metamorphosis to a new society and can also think about how fragile they are, and how threatened they are from climate change." 

Leading up to last autumn's People's Climate March in New York City, Schweitzer and volunteers made a papier-mache Statue of Liberty, festooned with greenery and painted butterflies, which he set out on the street and took to various places, like the Wooster Street Farmers' Market (pictured). He often pulled it on a platform behind his bike, his main transportation. (He doesn't own a car.) 

All these efforts are part of the Walk/Bike/Transit effort of the Sister City Project. 

Schweitzer is working with students at several high schools on his next theme, "Cows, Cars, Coal and Planes."

OPTIMISTIC MCCARTHY BACK IN STATE 

Keating, Christopher . Hartford Courant ; Hartford, Conn. [Hartford, Conn]19 Dec 2015: B.1.

ABSTRACT

  

McCarthy, who attended the high-level talks in Paris, said the world is taking major steps forward to limit the increase in the global average temperature by 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit).

The nation's top environmental official, Gina McCarthy, returned to Connecticut on Friday to hail the recent landmark agreement by 195 countries on climate change. 

McCarthy, who attended the high-level talks in Paris, said the world is taking major steps forward to limit the increase in the global average temperature by 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit). The United States and most other nations in the world favored the accord. Countries such as Syria and North Korea were not part of the agreement. 

"It is not just our moral obligation, but it is one of the biggest environmental, economic and national security challenges of our time," McCarthy told a crowd gathered in the cold outside the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection in Hartford. 

Before becoming the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency administrator, McCarthy was Connecticut's environmental commissioner, having been nominated in 2004 by Republican M. Jodi Rell. Previously, she had served under Republican Gov. Mitt Romney and others in high-profile positions in the Massachusetts state government for 15 years. 

McCarthy told reporters there was much agreement among the 195 nations in Paris. 

"If you went to the conference, there were no climate-deniers," McCarthy said. "We have joined with a tremendous amount of overwhelming international support for this. We didn't just join. We provided leadership, which is where we should be." 

McCarthy, 61, conceded that the climate change deal would not have enough political support to be approved by the U.S. Congress, but she says the authority of the executive branch is sufficient for the international deal. 

"Right now, we don't feel we need Congress to take action moving forward," McCarthy said. 

Air pollution has gotten so bad in places like Beijing that citizens "unfortunately have to use a mask on many days" in order to breathe properly, she said. 

"There is a path forward that can actually continue the great environmental movement in this country, which is to produce clean air, clean water, and healthy land," McCarthy said. "Now, we're going to have to have a stable climate to go with it." 

McCarthy appeared with Gov. Dannel P. Malloy and other top officials at an outdoor news conference, where the main participants were not wearing overcoats. 

"I never get cold because I am in hot water constantly," McCarthy said. 

Malloy and McCarthy walked over to an electric car parked outside DEEP headquarters, and McCarthy placed the charger into the car. 

"Climate change is happening," Malloy told the crowd. "Make no mistake about that." 

Connecticut has been seen as a leader on battling climate change, and is working on the issue under the nine-state Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, known as RGGI. Along with New York, Vermont, Maine, and others, Connecticut is seeking to reduce carbon emissions. While in Connecticut, McCarthy had worked on the RGGI initiative.

FUNDS LACKING TO PRESERVE OPEN SPACE 

Hladky, Gregory B . Hartford Courant ; Hartford, Conn. [Hartford, Conn]16 Apr 2016: B.1.

ProQuest document link 



 





ABSTRACT

  

According to available figures cited by the CEQ, solid waste recycling in this state has declined since 2008, down from about 25 percent that year to about 22 percent. 



LINKS

FULL TEXT

 

Inadequate public funding to preserve Connecticut's open space and the growing negative impacts of climate change are two of the biggest concerns raised in the latest report from the state's environmental watchdog agency. 

At the same time, the report released Friday by the Council on Environmental Quality includes some good news: Bald eagle and osprey populations in the state are rising; carbon emissions are down; and oxygen levels in Long Island Sound are improving. 

The CEQ's analysis of environmental trends from 2015 data includes a repeat warning that Connecticut is falling behind on its goals for saving the state's remaining forests and other open space. The state's official target is for state protected parks, forests and other open space areas is 320,600 acres by 2023, an amount equal to 10 percent of Connecticut's total land area. 

As of 2015, the total amount of state protected lands amounted to 257,6254, according to the CEQ. 

The state protected or helped to protect 1,807 acres of open space last year, most of that coming through the cooperative purchase of a big section coastal forest lands in southeastern Connecticut called "The Preserve." 

"Even with this outstanding acquisition, progress is not nearly on track to reach the state preservation goal by 2023," according to the report. 

The CEQ's grim conclusion is that "Connecticut's prospects for meeting its land conservation goals are bleak," and that "the same is probably true for the goals Connecticut has set for itself regarding waste recycling and wildlife conservation." 

According to available figures cited by the CEQ, solid waste recycling in this state has declined since 2008, down from about 25 percent that year to about 22 percent. 

Wildlife concerns include dramatic declines in species as diverse as lobsters, bats and turtles, while the fragmentation of Connecticut's forests is contributing to clear population reductions in forest-nesting birds. 

The CEQ reports that state efforts resulted in the preservation of 1,289 acres of farmland in 2015, the greatest amount since 2009. The bad news is that, according to the council, the state needs to save at least 2,000 acres of land a year to meet its current farmland preservation goals. 

Another major environmental negative for Connecticut cited by the report involves the varied impacts of global warming. Those may include rising sea levels in Long Island Sound that are "squeezing wildlife that inhabit Connecticut's coastal marshes," a decline in air quality last year that the CEQ attributed to high summer temperatures, and increasing numbers of invasive plants and insects. 

"After record-breaking low levels of [air] pollution in 2014, Connecticut saw slightly more pollution in 2015," the report stated. CEQ experts attribute that decline in air quality to a surge in ozone at ground levels resulting from higher-than-normal summer temperatures. 

"The changing climate is affecting our environment, and most of the time in negative ways," Karl Wagener, CEQ's executive director, said Friday. 

Lobsters aren't the only aquatic species suffering from the warmer water temperatures in Long Island Sound resulting from climate change, the CEQ reported. Other cold-water fish are becoming more rare, while warm-water species appear to be moving into the Sound. 

Rising sea levels are also flooding coastal marshes along Connecticut's shoreline. The CEQ report cites a multi-year study involving University of Connecticut scientists that found several marsh-nesting bird species populations "in sharp decline." 

One potentially sour environmental note that wasn't included in the report is that Gov. Dannel P. Malloy is once again proposing to eliminate state funding for the council, which has been in existence for more than four decades. Cutting the CEQ's funding is part of the governor's plan to solve a nearly $1 billion budget deficit forecast for next year. 

"We'll see how the budget shakes out," said Wagener, "and hope this is not our last report."

ABSTRACT

  

"More energy, more moisture in the atmosphere ... leads to more extreme and violent storms," said Mel Cote, chief of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's surface water branch for the Northeast. Alan Dunham, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service office in Taunton, Mass., said statistics for the Hartford region indicate that July 2016 was the 10th-hottest July on record, with an average temperature of 76.4 degrees Fahrenheit.

HARTFORD - July was the hottest month for global temperatures since scientists began keeping records in the 1880s, and climate experts say it's another danger signal that has worldwide implications. 

July wasn't the hottest in Connecticut - that occurred in 2013 - but scientists and environmentalists say it has become increasingly clear that climate change has already affected the state. 

Summer and winter air temperatures are significantly higher than they were 200 years ago. Sea levels in Long Island Sound are continuing to rise, and lobsters have largely disappeared from Connecticut's shores. The flow of water in the Connecticut River has increased. Growing seasons are about 30 days longer than a century ago. Invasive insects, including disease-spreading mosquitoes, are expanding their ranges into the state. 

Jim O'Donnell, professor of marine sciences with the University of Connecticut and executive director of the Connecticut Institute for Resilience &Climate Adaptation, said the evidence of how global warming is changing Connecticut is irrefutable. 

O'Donnell recently compared 80 years' worth of air temperature records taken at Yale University in the late 17th and early 18th centuries to temperatures taken in New Haven over the most recent 80-year period. 

"It's pretty clear there has been at least a 2 degree Celsius [3.6 degrees Fahrenheit] average warming in summer air temperatures, and at least a 3 degree Celsius [4.5 degree Fahrenheit] warming in winter air temperatures in New Haven," O'Donnell said. 

A comparison of Yale records from a century ago with Connecticut's last few decades shows that the growing season is starting about 15 days earlier in the spring and lasting about 15 days longer in the fall, according to O'Donnell. 

Most climate scientists, like O'Donnell, are reluctant to attribute short-term weather events, such as this summer's drought in the Northeast, to climate change. Most point to the periodic Pacific Ocean-warming phenomenon known as El Nino as the likely explanation for our current dry conditions and this summer's heat waves. 

The continuing rise in average global temperatures is increasing heat in the oceans and atmosphere and is almost certainly ramping up normal weather events, according to climate experts. Their prediction is that higher global temperatures are causing the ice caps to melt, which triggers rising sea levels, and injecting more energy into weather systems. 

"More energy, more moisture in the atmosphere ... leads to more extreme and violent storms," said Mel Cote, chief of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's surface water branch for the Northeast. The prospect that devastating hurricanes and storms like Irene and Sandy could occur far more frequently is enough to send shudders down the spines of emergency management officials. 

July was the ninth month in a row that set global heat records, according to federal agencies, including NASA. Many experts agree that 2016 is certain to go down as the hottest year scientifically recorded. 

Alan Dunham, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service office in Taunton, Mass., said statistics for the Hartford region indicate that July 2016 was the 10th-hottest July on record, with an average temperature of 76.4 degrees Fahrenheit. Connecticut's hottest July was in 2013, with an average of 77.9 degrees. 

But last month's 10-day heat wave (consecutive days with temperatures above 90) did tie the record set in 1995. 

The overwhelming consensus of climate scientists is that air pollution is a major trigger for global warming. 

"It does affect nearly every other one of our environmental problems," Karl Wagener, executive director of the state's Council on Environmental Quality, said of climate change. The council is Connecticut's watchdog agency for environmental matters. "It drives a lot of other environmental problems in our state, from air quality to invasive species." 

Higher sea levels in the Sound "are squeezing the habitats of many of our coastal species," Wagener said. Shoreline marshlands and dune areas are threatened by both higher water levels and bigger storm surges, putting endangered species like the piping plover at greater risk. 

Warmer winter temperatures mean invasive insects like the Asian tiger mosquito, or Aedes albopictus, which is capable of transmitting the Zika virus, can survive in Connecticut more easily. Wagener said the Southern pine beetle, once confined to states much farther south, is now in Connecticut's evergreen woodlands. 

Wagener also said there is evidence "that heavy rains are becoming heavier and more frequent for Connecticut." O'Donnell is more cautious, warning that more research needs to be done on rainfall. 

More intense rainstorms carry the threat of more flooding in Connecticut, warns Jerry Silbert, executive director of the nonprofit environmental group Watershed Partnership. "These changes take place slowly, but they increase the likelihood of extreme weather events," Silbert said. 

Flooding not only threatens homes and businesses, but can overwhelm sewage systems and pour untreated waste into rivers and Long Island Sound. Many of the waste treatment plants along the coast are at sea level and vulnerable to rising tides and storm surges, Silbert said. 

Although Silbert doubts that most Connecticut residents understand the seriousness of the climate situation, O'Donnell said the risks are becoming increasingly clear, especially those who live along the shoreline. 

"I know for sure that most coastal town planners and politicians are very aware," said O'Donnell, whose organization is helping those officials prepare for global warming's changes. 

O'Donnell adds that, for Connecticut's shoreline homeowners and businesses, there's one more key financial alert being sounded about the risks involved with global warming. "Increasing [flood and storm] insurance costs are making people aware," O'Donnell said.

ABSTRACT

WASHINGTON - A last-minute deal between conservatives and GOP leaders in the House averted votes expected Thursday on a measure to impeach the commissioner of the IRS. 

Instead, IRS Commissioner John Koskinen will testify before Congress next week. 

The conservative House Freedom Caucus celebrated the development as a victory, as conservatives had long pushed GOP leaders for impeachment hearings against Koskinen. They accuse him of obstructing a congressional investigation into the treatment of tea party groups seeking tax exemptions. 

But the agreement canceling the votes came only after conservatives themselves predicted that their impeachment resolution was going to get sidelined by Democratic and Republican opposition Thursday. So instead they settled for a hearing next Wednesday, which would result in an impeachment vote only after the November presidential election, if ever. 

House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin welcomed the resolution, saying that it "was a good way to work things out." Neither Ryan nor other House GOP leaders had embraced the impeachment push, but Ryan, who needs to maintain conservative support, had also avoided publicly criticizing the move. 

However, it would take only one aggrieved conservative to revive the impeachment on the House floor, so the deal does not definitively rule out a vote before the election. 

Koskinen has disputed the allegations against him in private meetings with House Republicans in recent days. 

The original conduct the House was investigating, related to how tea party groups were dealt with by the IRS, happened before Koskinen's tenure. 

Obama: Atlantic marine reserve helps in fighting climate change 

WASHINGTON - Creating the Atlantic Ocean's first marine national monument is a needed response to dangerous climate change, oceanic dead zones and unsustainable fishing practices, President Barack Obama said Thursday. 

The new Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument consists of nearly 5,000 square miles of underwater canyons and mountains off the New England coast. 

Monument designations come with restrictions on certain activities. The White House said the designation will lead to a ban on commercial fishing, mining and drilling, though a seven-year exception will occur for the lobster and red crab industries. Others, such as whiting and squid harvesters, have 60 days to transition out. Recreational fishing will be allowed within the monument. 

Deal with opponents of Arizona immigration law ends lawsuit 

PHOENIX - A coalition of civil rights groups agreed to end its challenge of Arizona's landmark 2010 immigration law in a deal in which the state issued guidelines on how police officers must enforce the law's most contentious section. 

The agreement unveiled Thursday ends the last of seven challenges to the law that was criticized for requiring officers, while enforcing other laws, to question the immigration status of people suspected of being in the country illegally. 

Courts barred enforcement of other sections of the law, but the questioning requirement was ultimately upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court. 

The enforcement guidelines include a requirement that officers document the reasons for their suspicion that a particular person is in the country illegally. 

Police: Man with meat cleaver attacks NYC officer, is shot 

NEW YORK - Police said a man with a meat cleaver attacked an officer in New York City and was shot at least twice during a struggle with officers trying to subdue him. 

The gunshots rang out about a block from Macy's midtown Manhattan flagship department store just as rush hour was getting underway Thursday evening. 

Police said the wounded man has been hospitalized in critical condition. An off-duty police detective was also hospitalized for a slash wound to the face. 

A law enforcement official said the officers chased the man with the cleaver and had unsuccessfully tried to subdue him with a Taser before the struggle that led to the shooting. The official wasn't authorized to release information and spoke on the condition of anonymity. 

Found wing flap confirmed as part of MH370 

SYDNEY - A wing flap that washed ashore on an island off Tanzania has been identified as belonging to missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, Australian officials said Thursday. 

The flap was found in June by residents on Pemba Island, and officials had previously said it was highly likely to have come from the missing Boeing 777. An analysis by experts at the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, which is heading up the search for the plane, subsequently confirmed the part was indeed from the aircraft, the agency said in a statement. 

Several pieces of wreckage suspected to have come from the plane have washed ashore around the Indian Ocean since the aircraft vanished with 239 people on board during a flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing on March 8, 2014. 

Senate OKs bill that includes emergency funds for Flint 

WASHINGTON - The Senate approved a $10 billion water projects bill Thursday that includes emergency funding for Flint, Mich., nearly a year after officials declared a public health emergency because of lead-contaminated water. 

Senators approved the bill 95-3. The measure now goes to the House, where approval of a similar bill - minus the Flint provision - is expected as soon as next week. 

The Senate bill would authorize 29 projects in 18 states for dredging, flood control and other projects overseen by the Army Corps of Engineers. 

The bipartisan bill includes $100 million in grants and loans to replace lead-contaminated pipes in Flint and other cities with lead emergencies, as well as $50 million to test water for lead in schools and $70 million for water infrastructure loans. 

Train crash: At least six passengers were killed and more than 100 others injured Thursday when a passenger train collided with a freight train near the central Pakistani city of Multan. The pre-dawn accident happened near the town of Sher Khan in Punjab province, railway official Saima Bashir said. 

Hunger strike: A judge in Uruguay ordered a medical evaluation Thursday of Abu Wa'el Dhiab, a Syrian and hunger striking former Guantanamo prisoner who emerged from a brief coma but was still in danger from his protest aimed at calling attention to his desire to leave the South American country and reunite with his family.

33rd Senate District: Green Party Candidate: Real Issues Ignored: Colin Bennett Focuses On Climate Change

Colin Bennett is no stranger to running as a Green Party candidate in the 33rd Senate District. He ran and lost in 2004, 2006, 2008 and 2014. The only race he missed in the past decade was in 2012, when he ran for Congress. 

Bennett believes that the issue of climate change is too important not to keep trying to find a way to awaken people to the dangers involved, and if that involves running for office, then so be it, he says. 

"Literally, I feel the world is on the precipice of disaster," said Bennett. "I'm doing everything in my power to turn that around." 

Bennett, 37, lives in Westbrook, runs a small used bookstore in Deep River called Bennett's Books, and has other jobs to make ends meet. In the summer, Bennett works for Sail Connecticut Access, a nonprofit operation that gives people with special needs the opportunity to go sailing. 

The campaign across the 33rd Senate District, which stretches down the Connecticut River Valley from Portland to Old Saybrook, has been dominated by disputes between Republicans and Democrats over Donald Trump and Gov. Dannel P. Malloy. 

The Democratic candidate in the district, Essex First Selectman Norm Needleman, has been hammering away at the ties between the controversial GOP presidential candidate and the incumbent Republican, Art Linares. 

Linares, who supports Trump's candidacy, has sought to capitalize on Needleman's past backing of Malloy and link Needleman to the unpopular governor's policies and tax increases. 

"I do think it has been a distraction," Bennett said this week. Although Bennett is "absolutely not a Trump supporter" and is highly critical of Malloy, the Green Party candidate believes the race has been empty of discussion of major issues like "the climate crisis."

HARTFORD - Holding brightly colored signs, about 300 people rallied at the state Capitol Saturday afternoon to promote clean and renewable energy. 

"We need to green our grid," said Martha Klien, a lead volunteer with the Connecticut Sierra Club. "No more converting of residents to fossil fuels that merely accelerate climate change." 

The rally - sponsored by the Connecticut Sierra Club, 350 Connecticut, and other environmental, labor, faith and social justice groups - aimed to halt global warming, promote clean, renewable sources like solar and wind, and celebrate the state's recent decision to cancel plans for major natural gas pipelines. 

Standing in the shadow of the Capitol, Chris Garaffa of New Haven struggled with the wind to keep his homemade sign upright. The sign read, "Climate change is the symptom, capitalism is the disease." 

Garaffa said jobs and climate change are interrelated. If the country shuts down coal and nuclear power plants, people will lose jobs, he said. But it can replace these jobs by converting to solar or wind energy, which in turn will help with climate change, he said. 

Garaffa said he opposes the major natural gas power-generating projects that have been proposed for the region. 

"There is no such thing as clean natural gas or safe natural gas," he said. "They are done for profit. They are not done with safety in mind." 

Susan Miller of Windsor said she came to the rally to make sure the legislature was paying attention to global warming. 

"Because of the election, it's really inspired me to become more active to fight for things I believe in," she said. "This met all of the needs."

climate change: 2016: Hottest Year Ever: Three-Year Warming Trend 'A Wake-Up Call' 

Mooney, Chris . Hartford Courant ; Hartford, Conn. [Hartford, Conn]19 Jan 2017: A.1.

ProQuest document link 



 





ABSTRACT

  

Last year's warmth was manifested across the planet, from the warm tropical ocean waters off the coast of northeastern Australia that contribute to the widespread death of coral in the Great Barrier Reef, to the Arctic, where melting sea ice hit regular monthly record lows and overall temperatures were the highest on record, at least from January through September of 2016.

In a powerful testament to the warming of the planet, two leading U.S. science agencies Wednesday jointly declared 2016 the hottest year on record, surpassing the previous record set last year - which itself had topped a mark set in 2014. 

The pronouncement comes two days before President-elect Donald Trump, who has tweeted that global warming is a hoax, takes office after a campaign in which he threatened to pull the nation out of an international agreement to fight climate change. 

Trump has since said he has an open mind about the Paris climate accord, even as he has nominated to Cabinet posts men who have raised questions about the extent to which human activity is responsible for rising temperatures around the world. 

Scientists have been far less guarded, noting the striking reality that global temperatures have set a record three years in a row. 

"We don't expect record years every year, but the ongoing long-term warming trend is clear," Gavin Schmidt, who directs NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, said in a statement accompanying the government temperature report. 

NASA announced the record jointly with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 

Last year's warmth was manifested across the planet, from the warm tropical ocean waters off the coast of northeastern Australia that contribute to the widespread death of coral in the Great Barrier Reef, to the Arctic, where melting sea ice hit regular monthly record lows and overall temperatures were the highest on record, at least from January through September of 2016. 

In a catalog of some of the extremes the planet witnessed during the year, the NOAA noted the megafire that engulfed Fort McMurray in Alberta, Canada, at the beginning of May, a conflagration that came relatively early in the year for wildfires. That event was consistent with a warming climate, as well as with the role of El Nino, although scientists are reluctant to formally say that climate change has played a role in an individual event without conducting extensive analysis. 

Extreme high temperatures were seen from India - where the city of Phalodi recorded temperatures of 123.8 Fahrenheit in May, a new national record - to Iran, where a temperature of 127.4 Fahrenheit was recorded in Delhoran on July 22. 

For the contiguous United States, 2016 was merely the second-warmest year on record, but for Alaska, it was the warmest yet recorded, underscoring once again the sharpness of Arctic warmth. 

Last year's warmth was partly enhanced by a strong weather pattern known as El Nino, triggered by unusually warm waters in the Pacific. But the scientists underscore that the event is hardly the only cause. For example, 1998 was also, at the time, the warmest year on record, thanks in part to a strong El Nino - but the 2016 planetary temperature now far surpasses that year, meaning other factors probably contributed to the temperature's rise. 

"This El Nino might have contributed about a quarter or a third" of the record in 2016, Deke Arndt, chief of the global monitoring branch at NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information, said Wednesday. 

Scientists said the three-year rise in temperatures only increases the urgency to battle climate change. 

"2016 is a wake-up call in many ways," said Jonathan Overpeck, a climate scientist at the University of Arizona. "Climate change is real, it is caused by humans and it is serious." 

Officially, average surface temperatures in 2016 were 0.07 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than 2015, and featured eight successive months - January through August - that were individually the warmest since the agency's record began in 1880, according to NOAA. 

The average temperature across the world's land and ocean surfaces was 58.69 Fahrenheit, or 1.69 degrees above the 20th-century average of 57 degrees, NOAA said. The agency also noted that the record for the global temperature has now successively been broken five times since the year 2000. The years 2005 and 2010 were also record warm years, according to the agency's data. 

NASA concurred with NOAA, also declaring 2016 the warmest year on record based on its own data tracking temperatures at the surface of the planet's land and oceans, and expressing "greater than 95 percent certainty" in that conclusion. In contrast, NOAA gave a 62 percent confidence in the broken record.

Immigration Misconceptions

 

Win Heimer's Jan. 11 letter, "Limiting Legal Immigrants Ill-Considered," demonstrates the public's misconceptions of immigration policy and history. Mr. Heimer wrote, "My parents thankfully were allowed to leave Nazi-occupied Vienna and make their way to Connecticut." Over the last eight years, the U.S. admitted nearly 1.1 million immigrants per year. But during the eight-year Nazi occupation of Vienna, the U.S. admitted fewer than 50,000 immigrants per year.

 

Under current law, only one-third of new immigrants are chosen because of their skills or for humanitarian reasons. The remaining two-thirds are chosen because of a family connection and are predominately lower-skilled workers, according to Pew research. A September 2016 study from the acclaimed National Academy of Sciences concluded that massive low-skilled immigration adversely affects the wages of lesser-educated Americans and prior immigrants.

 

NumbersUSA and Sen. Jeff Sessions support an immigration policy that serves the national interest as recommended by the last bipartisan U.S. Commission on Immigration chaired by the late-Civil Rights icon Barbara Jordan. The commission recommended reducing legal immigration to half of their current levels.

Loving The South End

 

Thanks for Jenifer Frank's article about the South End [courant.com, Jan. 8, "Home In Hartford's South End: A City Neighborhood"].

 

Six years ago, I moved from the suburbs and purchased a home in Hartford's South End. While most of my friends asked, "Why Hartford?" and most people assumed I meant the West End, I have really loved living here. I'm minutes from arts, entertainment and history and can walk to Goodwin Park, one of the city's treasures for sure! My diverse neighbors are kind, helpful and are part of the reason I moved back to the city. This is where people come to live as immigrants, as my Swedish relatives did 100 years ago. And I am proud to be here and contribute to my community.

 

Sandra Johnson, Hartford

 

Trump's Bad Swamp

 

I have always cherished swamps as a sustaining source of biological diversity, teeming with life and regeneration. During the presidential campaign, Donald Trump chose to turn this natural source of sustenance and vitality into a metaphoric septic pit of degenerate human corruption and cronyism. From good swamp to bad swamp in one campaign rally slogan and pledge.

 

Chants of "drain the swamp" still play loudly in my head. All I can think of are President Trump's proposed new Cabinet secretaries who, almost to the one, represent the epitome of super wealth, profiteering and special interest - the very qualities that "draining the swamp" was supposed to eliminate in Washington. Instead, the American populace is about to become the victim of the ravenous alligators who will occupy senior positions in the new administration.

 

President Trump has cast his lot with multimillionaires and billionaires. His actions speak louder than words and promises. All of us who symbolically mirror the life-giving and interdependent qualities of a real swamp must seize the day and carry forward President Abraham Lincoln's quest for a just and free society, of the people, by the people and for the people. No time to waste.

 

Anne Foss, Farmington

 

Climate Change Created Refugees

 

Syria has long been troubled with population growth, social unrest, and government authoritarianism and corruption. After a prolonged period of drought, an event made more likely by global climate change, rural populations migrated into cities and organized with urban citizens in opposition to Assad's regime. All of these elements combined created the current Syrian conflict. Climate change on its own did not create this, nor is it directly attributed to its citizens' refugee status. But it exacerbated existing problems and hastened their inevitable conclusion. It is for this reason that the Pentagon has referred to climate change as a "threat multiplier."

 

Not all countries have the resources to easily adapt to and endure climate change. If climate change continues unabated, it is likely that Syria will not be the last country to experience refugee/migrant crises and violent societal upheaval. Comprehensive policies toward the refugee crisis should recognize and ameliorate underlying problems like climate change while providing support toward those unfairly dispossessed.

 

Such obligations are never easy, but we must remember that in a different set of circumstances, any one of us could be a refugee.

 

Arthur Nowell, South Windsor

 

White House Website Changes

 

As the transfer of power was taking place last month, a look at the White House website showed the elimination of the pages on LGBT issues, on climate change, the Affordable Care Act, and the Council on Women and Girls page. Now perhaps these issues are not being totally thrown away, but you can bet if they reappear, they will be much different than the ones that President Obama and the Democrats put in place.

 

Hold on, folks, the greatness is about to begin.

 

Trump voters own every single policy and issue to come.

climate change?: A Salad Shortage Tied To Weather: Warmth, Rains Impact Lettuce 

Dewey, Caitlin . Hartford Courant ; Hartford, Conn. [Hartford, Conn]04 Mar 2017: A.5.

ProQuest document link 



 





ABSTRACT (ENGLISH) 

According to the National Weather Service, February's average temperature was two degrees warmer than the recorded average in recent decades. Britain recently suffered a widely publicized shortage of iceberg lettuce, zucchini, broccoli and cabbage, brought on by extreme weather in Spain, Europe's "salad bowl." The Progressive Farmer recently warned that "almost off the charts" temperatures in Kansas and Oklahoma could put early-growing winter wheat at similar risk, plus expose it to warm-weather pests and diseases.

FULL TEXT

Unusual weather in the Southwest could cause a nationwide salad shortage later this month. But that’s just the tip of the iceberg (lettuce): Scientists say the weird weather is probably caused by climate change - which means these sorts of problems are likely to happen again.

The shortage, first reported by NPR, is the result of two separate phenomena in Arizona’s Yuma County and California’s Salinas Valley, the two places where the United States grows most of its leafy greens. In Yuma, the lettuce harvest, which usually runs from November to April, wound up early because of unusually warm weather. And in central California, which typically picks up the harvest once Yuma is done, heavy precipitation delayed some plantings.

That could cause a gap at some point between lettuce supplies, said George Frisvold, an agricultural economist at the University of Arizona. Frisvold’s colleague, Jonathan Overpeck, the director of the university’s Institute of the Environment, says we can blame ourselves, in part, for the great salad shortage.

“There’s this old adage in climate science that you can’t attribute any one event to human causes,” Overpeck said. “That’s not really true anymore, because now it’s really been established that humans alter the whole global climate system. Anything related to increased warmth in the atmosphere likely has some element of human causation.”

Both the temperature in Yuma and the rain in Salinas have a link to atmospheric warmth. The case of Yuma is pretty obvious: Temperatures in the Southwest have been increasing for 100 years, and this winter was no different. According to the National Weather Service, February’s average temperature was two degrees warmer than the recorded average in recent decades.

In Salinas, the situation is a bit more complex, Overpeck said. The region has seen an unusual number of storms called “atmospheric rivers” -- you might know them by the name Pineapple Express - which push heavy precipitation to the Pacific coast from around the Hawaiian islands. It’s unclear whether climate change has a role in the increased incidence of atmospheric rivers, Overpeck said. While some early research suggests that is the case, more data is needed to confirm it.

That said, it’s “a basic concept of physics” that when the atmosphere is warmer, it holds more moisture, Overpeck explained. That means that, when storm clouds form, you tend to see more snow and rain.

According to the 2012 Census of Agriculture, Yuma County boasts nearly 70,000 acres of planted lettuce, while Monterey County, the home of the Salinas Valley, has 134,000. The 2015 Salinas harvest was valued at more than $1.65 billion.

Both regions primarily grow iceberg and leaf lettuce, followed by spinach and baby greens.

Incidentally, these sorts of cascading disruptions aren’t just limited to lettuce - or even to the United States. Britain recently suffered a widely publicized shortage of iceberg lettuce, zucchini, broccoli and cabbage, brought on by extreme weather in Europe’s “salad bowl,” Spain.

Closer to home, fruit growers across the Northeast and Midwest have expressed concern that unusually high and fluctuating temperatures could cause crops like apples, cherries, plums and grapes to develop too early and expose them to spring freezes. The Progressive Farmer recently warned that “almost off the charts” temperatures in Kansas and Oklahoma could put early-growing winter wheat at similar risk, plus expose it to warm-weather pests and diseases.

In 2012, high winter temperatures cost Michigan $220 million in cherry harvests. That same year, unusually hot nighttime temperatures also cut into Corn Belt yields.

The National Climate Assessment estimated that California and Arizona will have gained 70 extra hot nights per year and 12 to 15 additional consecutive days without rain by the end of the century, because of warming.

“Climate change impacts on agriculture,” the report concludes, “will have consequences for food security both in the U.S. and globally.”

climate change: Apple, Wal-Mart Stick With Pledge 

Flavelle, Christopher . Hartford Courant ; Hartford, Conn. [Hartford, Conn]31 Mar 2017: A.7.

ProQuest document link 



 





LINKS

FULL TEXT

Many of America's biggest corporations including Apple and Wal-Mart Stores are sticking by their pledges to fight climate change even as President Donald Trump guts his predecessor's environmental policies.

 

Companies say their pledges, coordinated by the Obama administration, reflect their push to cut energy costs, head off activist pressure and address a risk to their bottom line in the decades to come.

 

"This work is embedded in our business," Wal-Mart spokesman Kevin Gardner said in an email. It's "good for the business, our shareholders and customers; if ultimately we are able to positively impact the environment in the process, that's a win too."

 

Wal-Mart was one of 81 companies that promised to reduce emissions in the run up to the 2015 Paris global climate negotiations. The company upped its targets last November, saying it would get half its power from renewable sources by 2025.

 

Trump signed an order Tuesday that tells the Environmental Protection Agency to reconsider former President Barack Obama's climate rules, and rescinds a series of orders Obama issued to embed consideration of climate change in government actions from where to lease buildings to whether to allow oil pipelines to be built.

 

"Most big companies in the U.S. recognize that climate change is real," Geoffrey M. Heal, a professor at Columbia Business School, said in a telephone interview. "They need to move ahead on the climate change front no matter what Trump's government does."

 

Business's biggest lobbying force supports Trump on this issue. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce welcomed Trump's order, calling that shift "vital to stimulating economic growth." The group argues that Obama's regulations held back economic growth, preventing business owners from constructing needed pipelines, roads and other infrastructure.

 

But many of the group's members and other corporate titans supported Obama's Clean Power Plan, or have set their own goals. Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world's largest beer-maker, also announced Tuesday that it would get 100 percent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2025. Nearly 90 companies made similar pledges, according to the Sierra Club.

 

"We believe climate change is real and the science is well accepted," General Electric's Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Immelt, wrote in an internal blog post shared by the company. "We hope that the United States continues to play a constructive role in furthering solutions to these challenges, and at GE, we will continue to lead with our technology and actions."

 

Mars, the maker of M&M's, committed to eliminating its emissions entirely by 2040. Andy Pharoah, vice president of corporate affairs, said that Mars is "disappointed the administration has decided to roll back climate regulations."

 

Technology companies including Apple, Amazon.com, Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Microsoft also expressed their support for Obama's policies.

 

"We believe that strong clean energy and climate policies, like the Clean Power Plan, can make renewable energy supplies more robust and address the serious threat of climate change while also supporting American competitiveness, innovation, and job growth," the companies said in a joint statement after Trump's order was signed.

 

Other companies, while stopping short of criticizing the Trump administration, said they would keep pursuing lower emissions in their own operations. Procter &Gamble, Nestle Inc., Ikea, Levi Strauss &Co. and Best Buy Co., which all signed the 2015 pledge organized by the Obama administration, said they still intended to honor their commitments.

 

"We will continue to integrate sustainability into our business practices, operations, innovation, brand building and culture," Damon Jones, a spokesman for Procter &Gamble said.

 

Many energy businesses welcomed Trump's rollback. The Independent Petroleum Association of America, which represents oil and natural gas producers, joined the Chamber of Commerce in praising his move. So did the National Federation of Independent Business, which challenged the Clean Power Plan in court.

 

"People are going to freeze in the dark because of the destruction of the reliable electric power grid under Obama and the Democrats," Robert Murray, the president and CEO of coal-mining company Murray Energy Corp. said in an interview. "Mr. Trump is doing the right things."

 

Some environmental groups cautioned that action from the private sector wasn't enough to make up for the pullback in federal policy.

 

"Policy is going to be required to get us where we need to be," said Karen Palmer, research director at Resources for the Future.

CARACAS, Venezuela - Thousands of protesters were met with plumes of tear gas in Venezuela's capital Wednesday, just miles from where President Nicolas Maduro delivered a decree kicking off a process to rewrite the troubled nation's constitution. 

A combative Maduro told supporters outside the National Electoral Council that the constitutional assembly was needed to instill peace against a violent opposition.

 

"I see congress shaking in its boots before a constitutional convention," he said, referring to the opposition-controlled legislature. 

A short distance away, national guardsmen launched tear gas at demonstrators who tried marching toward the National Assembly. 

"The repression has started," said Miguel Pizarro, an opposition congressman. "That's how those who want to maintain a dictatorship with violence act." 

The latest push by Maduro to settle an increasingly deadly and contentious political crisis comes as the Trump administration warns it might impose more sanctions on Venezuelan officials and members of the U.S. Congress are pushing the administration to act more forcefully to rein in Maduro. 

Five people were killed overnight. The deaths bring to at least 35 the number of people who have died in the unrest over the past month. Hundreds more have been injured. 

Driving the latest outrage is the decree by Maduro to begin the process of rewriting Venezuela's constitution, which was pushed through in 1999 by late President Hugo Chavez. 

4th man accuses Seattle mayor of paying for sex decades ago

 

SEATTLE - A man jailed on drug charges has accused Seattle Mayor Ed Murray of paying him for sex when the man was a teenager decades ago, claims that were denied Wednesday by a spokesman for the mayor. He is the fourth man over the last month to accuse the mayor of sex abuse. 

The man said in a sworn declaration late Tuesday that he was introduced to Murray by Delvonn Heckard, who filed a lawsuit last month claiming he was sexually abused by Murray in the 1980s when Heckard was a teenager. 

Jeff Reading, a Murray spokesman, labeled the fresh claim an "ambush copycat false accusation." 

Murray has also denied the claims by Heckard and two other men who told The Seattle Times they met Murray while living in a center for troubled teens.

 

Environmental groups sue EPA over rollback of pollution rules

 

WASHINGTON - Environmentalists and public health advocates are going to court to fight the Trump administration's move to rewrite Obama-era rules limiting water pollution from coal-fired power plants. 

A coalition of groups filed a lawsuit Wednesday against the Environmental Protection Agency in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. The action challenges EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt's decision last month to rewrite 2015 water pollution rules. 

The regulation would have required utilities to cut the amounts of toxic heavy metals in the wastewater piped from their plants into rivers and lakes often used as sources of drinking water. Harmful contaminants leach from pits of waterlogged ash left behind after burning coal to generate electricity. 

Renewable energy critic chosen to head wind and solar projects

 

WASHINGTON - The Trump administration has named Dan Simmons, a fervent critic of government support for wind and solar projects, to oversee the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. 

Simmons has served as the vice president for policy at the Institute for Energy Research, a Washington think tank that has received funding from the fossil-fuel industry. He previously worked at the American Legislative Exchange Council, a conservative group supported by those who profit from the burning of fossil fuels. 

In an October 2016 blog published on the IER website, Simmons called for ending federal subsidies and tax breaks for wind and solar production. He has also advocated for boosting coal, oil and gas production on federally-owned lands. 

3 Americans injured in attack on Kabul convoy

 

KABUL, Afghanistan - A suicide car bomber struck a U.S. military convoy in the Afghan capital Wednesday, killing at least eight Afghan civilians and wounding three U.S. service members in an attack claimed by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS. 

Najib Danish, deputy spokesman for the Interior Ministry, confirmed the toll and said another 25 Afghan civilians were wounded in the morning rush-hour attack near the U.S. Embassy, which destroyed several civilian vehicles 

U.S. Navy Cpt. Bill Salvin, a military spokesman, confirmed that three soldiers were wounded in the attack. 

Afghan forces have struggled to combat ISIS since the U.S. and NATO officially concluded their combat mission at the end of 2014, switching to a support and counterterrorism role. The U.S. has over 8,000 troops in the country. 

N. Korea holds U.S. instructor over alleged hostile acts

 

SEOUL, South Korea - North Korea on Wednesday confirmed the detention of an American citizen for alleged acts of hostility aimed at overthrowing the country. 

Kim Sang Dok, an accounting instructor at Pyongyang University of Science and Technology, was "intercepted" April 22 at Pyongyang International Airport, according to the Korean Central News Agency. It said he was being detained while authorities investigate his alleged crime. 

The school's report used a different spelling of Kim's name, Kim Sang-duk. Kim's English name is Tony Kim. 

He is the third American detained in North Korea. The others are Otto Warmbier, serving a 15-year prison term for alleged anti-state acts, and Kim Dong Chul, serving a 10-year term for alleged espionage. 

Brexit charges: British Prime Minister Theresa May on Wednesday accused European Union officials of trying to influence the U.K. elections next month, ratcheting up tensions with Brussels over her country's departure from the bloc. May said that "the European Commission's negotiating stance has hardened."

 

Mine explosion: Iranian news agencies reported that 21 miners died Wednesday in a coal mine explosion in Golestan province. Sadegh Ali Moghadam, provincial director general of disaster management, warned that the death toll may rise. He said 35 people were thought to be trapped in the mine.

Kehler Liddell Gallery; One Planet, One Home; Climate Change Topic Of New Haven Exhibit Opening Friday

FULL TEXT

In January, Kehler Liddell was the first gallery in the state to present an exhibit of protest art stemming from the inauguration of the current president. That show focused on myriad human-rights and philosophical concerns.

 

The New Haven art space is doing it again, this time zeroing in on one topic: the environmental devastation of global warming.

 

"We have deemed ourselves gods of this planet, deciding to abuse and ravage our home, rather than cherish her many gifts," Elizabeth Antle-O'Donnell, one of the artists in the show, said in an artist statement.

 

Antle-O'Donnell contributed a piece made of an accumulation of bark shed by sycamore trees. The pieces overlap each other, none of them adhering entirely to the canvas, illustrating humanity's inability to control the natural environment.

 

Gar Waterman used onyx and marble to create sculptures of sea slugs to point out the dangers of ocean acidification. "They're canaries in a coal mine. Like so many reef dwellers, these are entirely dependent on the health of the reef," Waterman said. "When the reef dies, they die."

 

The plight of the oceans also is approached by Marsha Borden, whose hanging sculpture of a seascape is made of blue plastic bags.

 

Zoe Matthiessen takes a humorous approach. Her watercolor depicts a chicken with a trail mix bag stuck on its head, a depiction of "good intentions that have fallen short," she said. Those good intentions are spelled out on the snack bag - organic, vegan, gluten free, all natural - but those attributes don't stop the bag from trapping and blinding the chicken.

 

Frank Bruckmann painted an earth melting into the darkness, North America front and center, as if to blame the United States for this disaster. Amy Browning's abstracted "Cooling Ice" and "Warming Fire" suggests the temperature extremes that lie in the future.

 

David Chorney's "Loss of Innocence" painting juxtaposes a pastel-colored village with encroaching industrial smokestacks spewing black clouds of air pollution.

 

Some of the approaches are representational, some abstract and some even surreal. Brian Flinn shows a fanciful bird in a cage that's too tight to hold it. Joe Fekieta's mysterious, three-part, oil-crayon drawings show ghostly human hands tearing apart a bird and unleashing a gushing of vicious snakes, dogs in cages reaching out for help, and a forest of chopped-down trees.

 

Other artists prefer to be blunt and unsubtle. Penrhyn Cook's photo shows two gravestones, one for a home and one for the planet. Rod Cook photographed a baby's face and printed over it a list of human-caused environmental disasters. Rod Cook concludes his piece with the plea "Does it matter who is to blame when it's happening anyway and humans are the only ones capable of fixing the problem?"

 

Other artists are Marsha Borden, Ari Burling, Julia Coash, Phyllis Crowley, Tom Edwards, Julie Fraenkel, Molly Gambardella, Joan Jacobson-Zamore, Katie Jurkiewicz, Wayne King, Roy Money, Hilary Opperman, Hank Paper, Hannah Rotstein, Alan Shulik, Mark St. Mary, William Thompson, Elizabeth Tranzillo, Robert Wilton and Marjorie Wolfe.

 

ONE PLANET, ONE HOME is at Kehler Liddell Gallery, 873 Whalley Ave. in New Haven, until May 28. The opening reception is Friday from 4 to 7 p.m. A panel discussion "What Can I Do to Fight Climate Change?" will be held on Saturday at 3 p.m. kehlerliddellgallery.com.

Climate change; Malloy: State Will Redouble Its Efforts; Pledges Pursuit; Of Clean Energy 

Blair, Russell . Hartford Courant ; Hartford, Conn. [Hartford, Conn]02 June 2017: A.4.

FULL TEXT

HARTFORD - On the afternoon that President Donald Trump announced that he would pull the country out of the Paris accord on global warming, Gov. Dannel P. Malloy said the state would continue with its own efforts to address climate change.

 

Malloy said Connecticut and other states have "gone above and beyond" the terms of the agreement and will continue to honor their existing commitments to combat global warming.

 

"We're going to look for additional ways to generate clean energy and we're also going to redouble our conservation efforts," he said.

 

In 2008, Connecticut adopted the Global Warming Solutions Act, which committed the state to reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2010 and cutting emissions an additional 10 percent by 2020.

 

The historic Paris agreement, which took effect in November, had 195 signatories, with the nations agreeing to lower carbon emissions in an effort to reduce global temperature increases. The U.S. is the world's second-largest emitter of carbon, following only China.

 

Trump said he was leaving the agreement because it contained "onerous energy restrictions" and disadvantaged the U.S. "to the exclusive benefit of other countries," leaving American businesses and taxpayers to absorb the cost. He claimed the deal would result in $3 trillion in lost gross domestic product and 6.5 million industrial jobs.

 

Connecticut's Democratic congressional delegation said it was a mistake for Trump to remove the U.S. from the agreement and future generations would pay the price.

 

"If climate change continues unchecked, the great coastal cities of the world will be wiped out, crops will fail and people will die," said Sen. Chris Murphy. "That's not hyperbole - that's science."

 

Rep. Joe Courtney warned of the economic impact of leaving the deal, which could hurt the nation's growing clean energy sector. In Connecticut, more than half of all electric power generation jobs are in solar, he said. 

"These jobs are not only going to dominate our economy in the future - they are already a major part of our economy today," Courtney said.

 

Sen. Richard Blumenthal said the U.S. was relinquishing its leadership on the climate change front.

 

"No one can fight and win if they abandon the field," he said.

 

"Now is a moment when we should be banding together with the world to face what could very well be the greatest threat to our continued survival as a species," said Rep. Jim Himes. "Instead, President Trump has once again adopted an extreme, fringe position and is placing our families, nation and world at great risk. This is a shameful day."

 

Connecticut environmental groups called on legislators to do what they can at the state level to blunt the impact of Thursday's news and boost clean energy jobs.

 

"Now, more than ever, Connecticut's leaders must stand up and reaffirm our historically bipartisan commitment to reducing our state's reliance on outdated fuels that pollute our air and water and change our climate," said Claire Coleman, climate and energy attorney at Connecticut Fund for the Environment.

CAIRO - Two German women, both tourists, were stabbed to death while four other foreigners were wounded in an attack Friday at a hotel in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Hurghada, an Egyptian security official said. 

The assault came just hours after a shooting near some of Egypt's most famous pyramids outside of Cairo killed five policemen. 

The motive behind the stabbing was unclear and the Interior Ministry said the attacker at the Red Sea resort was arrested immediately. 

A security official said the attacker, a man in his 20s dressed in a black T-shirt and jeans, wielded a knife and intentionally sought to attack foreigners. 

"Stay away, I don't want Egyptians," the assailant had said in Arabic during the attack, according to the official. 

The Interior Ministry said the attacker had sneaked into the hotel by swimming from a nearby beach.

 

In the killings of the five policemen outside of Cairo, no group claimed responsibility for the attack but it bore the hallmarks of a smaller Islamic militant group known as Hasm that has been behind similar shootings in recent months. 

Friday's attacks are likely to have further impact on Egypt's struggling tourism industry - a pillar of the country's economy that employs millions of people. The industry has suffered from political instability and a fragile security situation since the 2011 Arab Spring uprising. 

The attacker in Hurghada, one of Egypt's most popular beach resorts and diving centers, stabbed the tourists in the face, neck and feet, according to the security official. 

In the attack on the policemen, gunmen on a motorcycle opened fire on a security vehicle patrolling a Giza village, the Interior Ministry and officials said.

 

Cleared in killing of unarmed black man, Tulsa cop resigns

 

OKLAHOMA CITY - A white Oklahoma police officer recently acquitted of fatally shooting an unarmed black man submitted her resignation from the Tulsa Police Department on Friday, saying the desk job where she had been assigned made her feel isolated from fellow officers. 

Officer Betty Shelby's resignation is effective Aug. 3, according to a news release from the Tulsa branch of a national police union. She also said she was praying for healing for the family of Terence Crutcher, who died after she opened fire in September.

 

Shelby was acquitted in May of manslaughter in Crutcher's slaying. Police Chief Chuck Jordan put her in an administrative role May 19, two days after her acquittal. She was not allowed on street patrol while an internal department investigation continued. 

Pentagon: Afghanistan leader 

of ISIS killed in drone strike

 

A U.S. drone strike in eastern Afghanistan earlier this week killed Abu Sayed, the leader of the Islamic State's offshoot there, U.S. officials said Friday.

 

A Pentagon statement said that other members of Islamic State, which also is known as ISIS, were killed in the operation on Tuesday in Kunar province and said that it "will significantly disrupt the terror group's plans to expand its presence in Afghanistan." The statement provided little other detail about the strike.

 

A U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details about the attack, said that the strike targeted a meeting and that U.S. forces had not been tracking Sayed for long.

 

If confirmed, Sayed's death marks another setback for the terrorist group in Afghanistan. 

Court: N.C. officials' prayer practice violated Constitution

 

RICHMOND, Va. - Elected officials in North Carolina violated the Constitution by opening meetings with Christian prayers and inviting audience members to join, a federal appeals court ruled Friday in a closely watched case that could end up in the Supreme Court. 

The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court ruling that found the Rowan County Board of Commissioners' prayer practice to be "unconstitutionally coercive."

 

The Supreme Court has ruled it's appropriate for clergy to deliver predominantly Christian prayers at town meetings in New York. The question in the Rowan County case was whether it makes a difference that the prayers were given by the commissioners and whether their invitation for the audience to join them was coercive. 

Defense bill calls climate change a security threat

 

WASHINGTON - The Republican-led House approved a defense policy bill Friday that declares climate change a national security threat, demands rigorous oversight of the Pentagon's cyber operations and rejects the Trump administration's bid to close military bases. 

Lawmakers voted 344-81 Friday to pass the legislation. The bill authorizes $696 billion in defense spending for the 2018 fiscal year, including nearly $30 billion more for core Pentagon operations than President Donald Trump requested. Yet defense hawks pushing the for the boost in spending face an uphill battle. For the spending increases to materialize, Congress first must agree to roll back a 2011 law that set limits on military spending. Lifting the so-called budget caps will face resistance from Democrats seeking to increase other agencies' budgets.

 

White House: Budget deficit will spike to $702 billion

 

WASHINGTON - The White House said Friday that worsening tax revenues will cause the budget deficit to jump to $702 billion this year. That's a $99 billion spike from what was predicted less than two months ago. 

The report from the Office of Management and Budget comes on the heels of a Congressional Budget Office analysis that scuttled White House claims that its May budget, if implemented to the letter, would balance the federal ledger within 10 years. The OMB report doesn't repeat that claim and instead provides just two years of updated projections. 

The White House budget office also says the deficit for the 2018 budget year that starts on Oct. 1 will increase by $149 billion to $589 billion.

 

Last year's deficit registered $585 billion. 

Former President Jimmy Carter is out of the hospital after being treated for dehydration in Canada, a spokeswoman said Friday. Representatives for Carter and Habitat for Humanity said on Thursday that the 92-year-old became dehydrated while volunteering at a home-building project in Winnipeg.

 

An American doctor who specializes in conditions such as that affecting Charlie Gard will travel to Britain next week to assess the critically ill baby. High Court Judge Nicholas Francis said Friday he is "open-minded about the evidence" to come after the visit of Dr. Michio Hirano of Columbia University.

Op-ed; Trump Policies Made Me A Whistleblower; Interior Department Official Says He Was Transferred To Silence Warnings On Climate Change

FULL TEXT

I am not a member of the deep state. I am not big government.

 

I am a scientist, a policy expert, a civil servant and a worried citizen. Reluctantly, I am also a whistleblower on an administration that chooses silence over science.

 

Nearly seven years ago, I came to work for the Interior Department, where, among other things, I've helped endangered communities in Alaska prepare for and adapt to a changing climate. But on June 15, I was one of about 50 senior department employees who received letters informing us of involuntary reassignments. Citing a need to "improve talent development, mission delivery and collaboration," the letter informed me that I was reassigned to an unrelated job in the accounting office that collects royalty checks from fossil fuel companies. 

I am not an accountant - but you don't have to be one to see that the administration's excuse for a reassignment such as mine doesn't add up. A few days after my reassignment, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke testified before Congress that the department would use reassignments as part of its effort to eliminate employees; the only reasonable inference from that testimony is that he expects people to quit in response to undesirable transfers. Some of my colleagues are being relocated across the country, at taxpayer expense, to serve in equally ill-fitting jobs. 

I believe I was retaliated against for speaking out publicly about the dangers that climate change poses to Alaska Native communities. During the months preceding my reassignment, I raised the issue with White House officials, senior Interior officials and the international community, most recently at a U.N. conference in June. It is clear to me that the administration was so uncomfortable with this work, and my disclosures, that I was reassigned with the intent to coerce me into leaving the federal government. 

On Wednesday, I filed two forms - a complaint and a disclosure of information - with the U.S. Office of Special Counsel. I filed the disclosure because eliminating my role coordinating federal engagement and leaving my former position empty exacerbate the already significant threat to the health and the safety of certain Alaska Native communities. I filed the complaint because the Trump administration clearly retaliated against me for raising awareness of this danger. Our country values the safety of our citizens, and federal employees who disclose threats to health and safety are protected from reprisal by the Whistleblower Protection Act and Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act. 

Removing a civil servant from his area of expertise and putting him in a job where he's not needed and his experience is not relevant is a colossal waste of taxpayer dollars. Much more distressing, though, is what this charade means for American livelihoods. The Alaska Native villages of Kivalina, Shishmaref and Shaktoolik are perilously close to melting into the Arctic Ocean. In a region that is warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet, the land upon which citizens' homes and schools stand is newly vulnerable to storms, floods and waves. As permafrost melts and protective sea ice recedes, these Alaska Native villages are one superstorm from being washed away, displacing hundreds of Americans and potentially costing lives. The members of these communities could soon become refugees in their own country.

 

Alaska's elected officials know climate change presents a real risk to these communities. Gov. Bill Walker, an independent, and Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski have been sounding the alarm and scrambling for resources to help these villages. But to stave off a life-threatening situation, Alaska needs the help of a fully engaged federal government. Washington cannot turn its back. 

While I have given small amounts to Democratic candidates in the past, I have no problem whatsoever working for a Republican administration. I believe that every president, regardless of party, has the right and responsibility to implement his policies. But that is not what is happening here. Putting citizens in harm's way isn't the president's right. Silencing civil servants, stifling science, squandering taxpayer money and spurning communities in the face of imminent danger have never made America great. 

Now that I have filed with the Office of Special Counsel, it is my hope that it will do a thorough investigation into the Interior Department's actions. Our country protects those who seek to inform others about dangers to American lives. The threat to these Alaska Native communities is not theoretical. This is not a policy debate. Retaliation against me for those disclosures is unlawful. 

Let's be honest: The Trump administration didn't think my years of science and policy experience were better suited to accounts receivable. It sidelined me in the hope that I would be quiet or quit. Born and raised in Maine, I was taught to work hard and speak truth to power. Trump and Zinke might kick me out of my office, but they can't keep me from speaking out. They might refuse to respond to the reality of climate change, but their abuse of power cannot go unanswered.

 

Joel Clement was director of the Office of Policy Analysis at the U.S. Interior Department until last week. He is now a senior adviser at the department's Office of Natural Resources Revenue. He wrote this for The Washington Post, where it first appeared.

Climate change may spur suicides; Study: Indian farmers' deaths rise with bad weather 

Doshi, Vidhi . Hartford Courant ; Hartford, Conn. [Hartford, Conn]03 Aug 2017: A.10.

ProQuest document link

FULL TEXT

NEW DELHI - Every year, thousands of Indian farmers commit suicide. Now one researcher thinks it may have something to do with climate change.

 

Tamma Carleton, a researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, compared almost five decades worth of suicide and climate data and concluded that temperature variations in India may have "a strong influence" on suicide rates during the growing season.

 

In her study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA, Carleton estimates that more than 59,000 farmer suicides over the past 30 years can be linked to global warming.

 

Carleton's findings are particularly worrying and come just two months after the Trump administration pulled out of the Paris climate accord, which was adopted by 196 countries, including the United States under the Obama administration in December 2015. As part of the agreement, world leaders committed to holding the average global temperature rise to "well below" two degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit. After Trump pulled out of the accord, many countries, including India and China, said they would continue to honor their commitments under the accord.

 

Senior members of the administration, including Trump, have expressed skepticism that climate change is caused by man-made carbon dioxide emissions. In a tweet in 2012, he wrote, "The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive."

 

According to one estimate cited in Carleton's article, India could experience an average temperature rise of 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit. The study suggests that the implications for India's mostly rural population could be devastating. "My findings suggest that this warming will be accompanied by a rising number of lives lost to self-harm," she writes.

 

High temperatures in the growing season reduce crop yields, putting economic pressure on India's farmers, she writes. "These crop losses may also permeate throughout the economy, causing both farming and nonfarming populations to face distress as food prices rise and agricultural labor demand falls."

 

Rainfall in the growing season, too, is important, Carleton suggests. More rain means higher yields, she writes, noting: "Suicide rates fall as growing season rainfall increases."

 

According to the World Health Organization, India accounts for the highest number of suicides in the world. A staggering 133,623 people took their own lives in 2015, according to data from the National Crime Records Bureau. More than 12,000 of those were farmers and farm laborers.

 

According to Indian authorities, bankruptcy and indebtedness or farming-related issues are cited as the major causes of suicide among farmers in India.

Millstone Mum 

On Finances

 

In the articles written about the Millstone Power Station, few have clarified the state of affairs better than Stephen Singer's Courant piece on Aug. 22 [Business, Dominion Digs In On Finances]. 

According to that story, Dominion Energy Inc. (Millstone's owner) is "doubling down as it resists demands that it hand over financial information" to state legislators, and reiterating "the possibility of closing Millstone if it's denied access" to renewable energy state contracts.

 

Millstone, which says it's worried about financial security, wants a special deal to bid alongside renewable producers. The plant insists it needs this arrangement to remain competitive. But when the state seeks essential financial information, Millstone resists.

 

This should, at the very least, raise questions for lawmakers and consumers. If Millstone is in financial need, wouldn't it welcome the investigation? If Millstone was in a perilous situation, wouldn't it have every incentive to be forthright and prove it? Millstone's reluctance to share financial information is telling. 

Millstone had until Aug. 29 to share information with the state. It requested more time and was given three more weeks. The details the company has shared thus far are sparse at best. Until it follows through with the state's request, we're obligated to keep asking for evidence.

 

Matt Fossen, Greenwich

 

The writer is spokesperson for the Stop the Millstone Payout, a coalition of the independent power generators Calpine Corp., Dynegy, and NRG Energy.

 

Learning From History

 

Thank you for the article about the Civil War re-enactments [Sept. 5, Living, "What Of Civil War Re-Enactments"]. Members of my family fought in the Civil War. In this case they were part of the northern forces, but either way, it's part of history. 

The Phoenix Stage Company in the Oakville section of Watertown is performing a play called "Rebel Yells," which happens to re-enact a hospital room in the South during the Civil War. But it's not about slavery or even about the war. It's about six people coming together to discuss what the war has taken from them - limbs, faith, love. It could be any war in any time period. 

History is not racist or bigotry. It's a learning experience so that we don't repeat it. Isn't that what someone once said? 

Laurie Phillips, Naugatuck

 

The writer's husband is in the cast of "Rebel Yells."

 

Houston, Could It Be Climate Change?

 

Until 1998 no major league hitter had hit more than 61 home runs in a year, but after that there were several. Two of them, Sammy Sosa and Mark McGuire had four years of 50 or more homers, a feat matched only by Babe Ruth. There had to be a reason, and there was. Their ability was boosted by drugs, and uncovering it helped baseball by increasing trust in the game.

 

Then, a financial firm claimed to have only one losing month in over a decade, and further claimed extraordinary annual returns. Again there was a reason. It was a Ponzi scheme led by Bernard Madoff. Ferreting out that crime helped increase trust in the financial profession, and to some degree aid the victims.

 

Now came an unprecedented storm over Houston in which more than 50 inches of rain fell. Reservoirs were facing a perilous situation. More than a trillion gallons of rain fell. Once again, it would seem there has to be a reason - and dare we say that might just be climate change. Admitting it might just help a lot of people and help mitigate many such future weather catastrophes, not just for our beloved country but our precious planet. Truth hurts, truth helps.

 

Norman L. Bender, Woodbridge

 

Pay It Forward Tax Plan

 

Connecticut needs to encourage successful people and businesses to move to here and stay here for the long run. I propose an individually targeted rolling phase-out of the personal and business income tax.

 

Starting in 2019, any individual or business that pays income tax in Connecticut for eight consecutive years will never again have to pay state income tax as long as they retain continuous residency in the state.

 

Alternately, a business or individual could permanently buy out of their Connecticut state tax liability by paying an amount equal to 3 times the average of their current tax liability (as figured by the average payment for the previous three years).

 

This would create an immediate windfall for the state as high income individuals and successful businesses take advantage of this program. It could also be used to lure businesses and high income individuals to the state from our high tax neighbors in New York, Rhode Island and Massachusetts, as well as from other high-tax states throughout the country.

 

These high income individuals and businesses could deduct these state taxes from their federal taxes to reduce the financial impact of the upfront costs and sidestep any future elimination of the deduction of state taxes.

Renewable Energy; Solar Plan Stirs Debate In Simsbury 

JORDAN OTERO SISSON . Hartford Courant ; Hartford, Conn. [Hartford, Conn]15 Sep 2017: A.1.

ProQuest document link

FULL TEXT

SIMSBURY - Some Simsbury residents say a 26-megawatt solar farm proposed for Simsbury farmland will create irreversible negative impacts to the town, including diminishing the town's character, a reduction in property values and adverse environmental impacts on animal migration patterns and water quality.

 

Others insist that it will improve property values, reduce the tax burden on residents and is the lowest impact use for the land, which is currently being farmed but is zoned for residential and light industrial use.

 

More than 50 people turned out for a public hearing at Eno Memorial Hall on Tuesday to learn more about the proposal put forth by Rhode Island-based company Deepwater Wind that is currently being evaluated by the Connecticut Siting Council - the state authority that regulates such projects.

 

Deepwater Wind wants to build the Tobacco Valley Solar Farm on 156 acres in north Simsbury, whose parcels total 289 acres. It is expected to produce enough energy to power 5,000 homes. Deepwater would be selling the energy to utility companies, not to residents.

 

If approved, Deepwater Wind would install 110,000, 10-foot solar panels on the property. Deepwater Wind officials on Tuesday estimated that about 30 acres of trees would be cleared for the project, while 133 acres would be preserved as open space or forested area. 

Deepwater Wind officials noted Tuesday that two of the five historic tobacco barns located on the property - two structures along Hoskins Road - would remain. However, officials stated that the structures are in severe disrepair and that there are no current plans to use them as part of the project.

 

Deepwater Wind was selected from a pool of respondents to the state's Three-State Clean Energy Request for Proposals. The company is also working on solar projects in Foster and Glocester, R.I., and belongs to a group that has completed projects totaling 800 megawatts of solar energy. It recently completed an offshore wind farm for Block Island.

 

About 20 people addressed the siting council Tuesday. The 15 people who spoke in opposition to the plan said they were not opposed to the idea of green energy or solar farms, but called various aspects of the project into question.

 

"We all know, as much as we'd like to go to the light switch for power, we've also got to go to the refrigerator for food," said Joe Pozzato, who lives near the proposed site. "We've got to keep the farms going. They're disappearing."

 

Jason Polayes, who lives nearby, told council members he was concerned about the effect the project would have on water quality, particularly for those with wells in the area. 

"I believe if this project is done, it should be done right and I believe as it stands now, the proposal is not to the benefit yet of the residents around it," Polayes said. "I don't understand the complexity of a wind farm off Block Island. This is a solar farm in a residential area and I imagine it poses other challenges and I don't know if I've seen those taken into consideration yet for the proposal."

 

Six people spoke in favor of the proposal, saying solar panels are a better option for the land than the prospective housing development or light industrial warehouses the current local zoning allows for.

 

Mark Scully said he was "willing to accept the sacrifice of putting a solar farm on this site."

 

"I think looking back, this will not materially influence the residential character of the town," Scully said.

 

"I think there are very serious, legitimate concerns that our citizens have raised and I would encourage you to make the modifications that will allow this solar farm to be built that is in keeping with the character of this community," Scully said. "My reasoning is simple: We all need to do our part to address climate change. ... Future generations will thank us for this project."

 

In addition to the public hearing, Tuesday's events included a site review and an evidentiary hearing, in which the council further questioned Deepwater Wind.

 

Because the project site was too expansive to walk and still privately used as farmland, council members and others in attendance, including town leaders, viewed the land via public vantage points during a driving tour. The tour route extended primarily through the residential areas that abut the property.

 

In several areas, but most notably in the neighborhoods along Munnisunk Drive, Gordon Street and Knollwood Circle, the proposed solar site was visible through the treeline of many backyards. 

In August, First Selectwoman Lisa Heavner formally announced the town's opposition to the project, saying the application to the siting council lacked sufficient information for the council to render a decision. 

Heavner said town leaders called upon the siting council to reduce the project's scope "to lessen the impact on abutters and the public including the removal of the parcel located on the southern side of Hoskins [Road]." 

She added that the project should be amended to include visual buffers and landscaping "based on visual elements characteristic of and already existing in Simsbury," and that historical landmarks should be preserved.

 

Heavner said Tuesday that town leaders would remain willing to work with Deepwater Wind to ensure the proposal considers the concerns of town officials and residents.

 

The evidentiary hearing was continued until Oct. 10 at 11 a.m. at the siting council headquarters in New Britain. The deadline for a decision on the matter is Dec. 26, according to a tentative schedule released by the siting council.

Travel tips; How Climate Change Affects Travel - And What To Do

FULL TEXT

The Southwest endured its worst heat wave in decades. Triple-digit temperatures forced the cancellation of dozens of flights at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. It was too hot to fly. And then there were hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, which disrupted even more travel plans and led to the cancellations of countless others.

 

"Weather events are becoming more frequent, more severe and, in many cases, the seasons in which we worry about them are becoming longer," says Meghan McPherson, who teaches at Adelphi University's emergency management program. "Much of our infrastructure was designed to function in the climate in which it was created. Because of this, roads that never flooded even 10 years ago are now flooding in everyday rainstorms. Our planes are unable to take off in heat they were not designed to withstand."

 

So how do you travel during a time of extreme weather? There's nothing you can do to change the climate, at least in the short term, but there are a few steps you can take to ensure that disruptions are kept to a minimum.

 

If you're concerned about an early thaw this winter, for example, you can plan your ski trip for a time when snow is more of a sure thing - say, move your vacation from early March to mid-February. You can apply this climate-conscious travel planning to other trips, too. Take that Caribbean cruise in December or January to steer clear of hurricane season.

 

The threat of global warming also should influence where you go. Greg Geronemus, the co-chief executive of SmarTours, a tour operator, says more of his clients are asking him about "last chance" destinations that are threatened by climate change.

 

Many travel companies have "Act of God" clauses that let them off the hook for weather-related delays or cancellations. That fine print is in the airline's contract of carriage or in your cruise line's ticket contract, and it means the company can cancel a trip without having to cover your expenses or get you to your destination. A good travel insurance policy can make things smoother - whatever the weather.

FULL TEXT

HARARE, Zimbabwe - Zimbabwe's president said Wednesday he fired his deputy and longtime ally for scheming to take power, including by consulting witch doctors, while Emmerson Mnangagwa said he has left the country after "incessant threats" to him and his family. 

The demonization of the deposed vice president is the clearest sign yet that President Robert Mugabe, who at 93 is the world's oldest head of state, is preparing his wife, Grace, to succeed him. 

Mnangagwa said he was safe but did not mention his location. "I will be communicating with you soon and shall return to Zimbabwe to lead you," he said in a statement. 

Mugabe spoke publicly for the first time since dismissing Mnangagwa, who had been seen as Mugabe's potential successor. Now Mugabe's wife appears poised for the role. 

Mugabe told thousands of cheering supporters that Mnangagwa had plotted to take over since becoming a vice president in 2014. Mnangagwa replaced Joice Mujuru, who had been ousted and accused by Mugabe of using witchcraft to take power. 

"We have kicked him out for the same reasons that saw us chasing away Mujuru," Mugabe said of Mnangagwa.

 

The president added: "People were told that I will retire in March but I did not. Upon realizing that I wasn't, he started consulting traditional healers on when I was going to die." 

First lady Grace Mugabe has been endorsed by ruling party groups to take over from Mnangagwa as vice president at a party congress next month, placing her in prime position to succeed her husband. 

Homeland nominee questions human role in climate change 

WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump's choice to head the Department of Homeland Security said Wednesday that she believes climate change exists, but said she cannot determine whether humans are the primary cause. 

Speaking at her Senate confirmation hearing, Kirstjen Nielsen said she is "not prepared to determine causation" on climate change. 

Nielsen's comment contradicts mainstream climate science, including a U.S. report last week that concludes the evidence of global warming is "extremely likely" - meaning with 95 to 100 percent certainty - that global warming is man-made. 

As head of homeland security, Nielsen would oversee a sprawling agency that leads the federal response to a range of natural disasters, ranging from wildfires to hurricanes. 

NATO boosts military abilities as Russia again looms as threat

 

BRUSSELS - As the specter of conflict with Russia looms over Europe, NATO defense ministers decided Wednesday to expand the alliance's operations for the first time since the Cold War, sharpen its focus on cyber operations and boost their powers to respond to Kremlin aggression.

 

Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis briefed fellow defense ministers Wednesday about Russian violations of the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.

 

Defense ministers approved plans that would bolster their ability to keep an eye on Russian submarines in the Atlantic Ocean, where undersea communications are at risk of being cut.

 

They also said cyberweapons would now have as big a role in NATO planning as ordinary guns and tanks.

 

Egyptian president warns Iran to stop 'meddling' in the region 

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt - Egypt's president said Wednesday that Iran must stop "meddling" in the Middle East and that the security of Arab Gulf countries must not be threatened, but he underscored that he does not want war and believes dialogue can resolve the region's crises. 

President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi threw his support behind Egypt's Gulf ally Saudi Arabia amid the kingdom's mounting tensions with Iran. 

Over the weekend, Saudi Arabia blamed Iran for a missile fired toward its capital by rebels in Yemen and warned that could be considered an act of war.

 

El-Sissi said he did not want more tensions in the region. His comments reflected the recent hardening of Egypt's public rhetoric on Shiite and non-Arab Iran.

 

New Venezuelan law clamps down on dissent, hate 

CARACAS, Venezuela - Venezuela's all-powerful constitutional assembly passed a wide-reaching law on Wednesday that clamps down on social media and broadcasters alike by ordering prison sentences of up to 20 years for anyone who instigates hate. 

The pro-government assembly passed the law, accompanied by applause and flag-waving on the chamber floor. It prohibits Venezuelans from spreading any message through television, radio or social media that instigates violence or hate. 

It drew swift criticism from international human rights advocates, who say the new law cracks down on dissent by criminalizing peaceful protests, the hallmark of a democratic society. 

Backers of socialist Nicolas Maduro have often accused opponents of being fascists spreading hateful messages.

 

Puerto Rico reports a rise in daily deaths after Maria 

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico - The pace of deaths quickened on Puerto Rico immediately after Hurricane Maria - well beyond the numbers officially attributed to the storm. 

The U.S. territory reported an average of 82 deaths a day in the two weeks before Maria hit. That average increased to 117 from Sept. 20 to 30, though the rate has declined since then. 

The territory said 55 people died in the Sept. 20 hurricane or later as result of it. The overall daily death figures hint that storm could have caused other fatalities as well, though officials of the government's forensic institute said Wednesday that they don't have evidence to attribute them to the storm. 

Jose Lopez Rodriguez of the Puerto Rico Demographic Register says the post-storm increase was a "significant difference." 

Angelika Graswald, 37, who admitted removing a plug from her fiance's kayak before it capsized in the Hudson River but maintained she was falsely accused of intentionally causing his death, was sentenced Wednesday to up to four years in a New York prison. Graswald had pleaded guilty in the death of Vincent Viafore, 46.

 

Sen. Rand Paul said Wednesday that he ended up with six broken ribs and a pleural effusion after an attack by neighbor Rene Boucher, 59, last week while mowing the lawn in Bowling Green, Ky. A pleural effusion is excess fluid around the lungs. Boucher was charged with misdemeanor fourth-degree assault.

 

Caption: Smog envelops New Delhi for a second consecutive day Wednesday, forcing schools to shut, halting highway traffic and sending residents scurrying to buy air purifiers and filtration masks. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal called the Indian capital a "gas chamber."

Moody's Puts Price On Climate Change; OP-ED 

Thorson, Robert . Hartford Courant ; Hartford, Conn. [Hartford, Conn]07 Dec 2017: A.13.

FULL TEXT

When I began teaching at UConn in 1984, I started a file of state newspaper clippings for my geoscience courses. One of the first things I learned was that more than 6,000 acres of wetland on the Connecticut shore was converted to dry land prior to the 1970s by ditching, draining and dumping within tidal wetlands. This allowed land-hungry communities to spread out over what was then being called artificial fill. 

At the time, I wondered naively why any government would permit such land use practices during a geological epoch of melting ice sheets and rising sea level. Today, any governing entity for coastal property knows that the pace of sea level rise has accelerated, and that an epoch of stronger subtropical storms is upon us. 

Within the last decade, the owners of Connecticut coastal properties have been kicked in the shins by rising insurance premiums. Now, the state and municipal governments with jurisdiction over those lands are being kicked by Moody's Investors Service. This credit rating agency, arguably our nation's most respected, has put coastal states and municipalities on notice that Moody's credit ratings for state and municipal bonds will hereafter be tied to coastal preparedness. 

The fiscally conservative and hazards aware part of me is loving this news because it proclaims an obvious truth that we geologists have taught for a half-century. Easy come, easy go. Lowlands created easily by shallow fill will be the first to go under. We're talking about our national mall in Washington, D.C., much of the Bay Area in San Francisco, the Florida coastal strip, New York, Boston and countless other cities with large areas of low-lying fill within city limits. 

To understand this sea change in Moody's tone, simply pause and reflect on what the past hurricane season did to poorly prepared coastal communities. The media frenzy has abated, but the financial shocks keeps growing. The estimated recovery costs are: $180 billion for Harvey in Texas; $95 billion for Maria in Puerto Rico; $50 billion for Maria in Florida. The total is triple that of historic Hurricane Katrina, once considered the "costliest hurricane in U.S. history." 

Though the U.S. is $20 trillion in debt, each disaster is met by battalions of federal employees who coordinate recovery and help pay the bills. In Houston alone, more than 10,000 people were physically rescued, and nearly 1 million citizens have asked for financial assistance. Any money our federal government pays them will be borrowed from somewhere else. Though the size of our debt staggers belief and is beggaring the next generation, it's only enough to pay for 61 hurricane seasons like the last one. 

Continuing with the example of Houston, the Dec. 1 New York Times published an investigation about building on the city's reclaimed marshes and swamps. In Houston, 6,000 properties were built in zones designated as safe following minor engineering alterations such as building levees and raising the land surface a few inches with imported soil. In one of these so-called safe zones, a sprawling, upscale residential community called the Woodlands was submerged by the floods of hurricane Harvey. This inundation, the paper said, "underscored the profound vulnerability of a metropolis with an ethos of untrammeled development built, essentially, on a swamp." This quote could also apply to the development-crazed ethos of the Connecticut shoreline prior to the 1970s, after which the state stopped encouraging the filling of floodplains and coastal marshes. Everything built on those lands is now at risk. Easy come, easy go. 

This brings us to the concept of the so-called 500-year flood. To statisticians, it's the flood with a 1-in-500 (0.2 percent) chance of occurring in any given year. To geologists, it's pure fiction because it requires that an unknown future behaves in a way similar to the recent past, and that a century's worth of data can be used to extrapolate the next 400 years. 

This fiction explains why Houston has experienced three 500-year floods within the last three years. Each is a fairy tale on which federal flood policy has been based. I'm glad the private sector reads non-fiction.
