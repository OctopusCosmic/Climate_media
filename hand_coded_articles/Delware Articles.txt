Ted Kaufman's Sunday essay on climate change finally drew together incontrovertible information on the hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of members of professional scientific societies in the U.S. alone who understand and support the concept of present and future climate change brought on by our overuse of carbon-based energy sources. 

The "deniers" of such concepts can only summon up a mere "35,000 scientists disagree" and present zero evidence to support that utterly untenable position. 

Ironically, the same day's paper included two related news items: 

"Mild weather redefines winter landscape" and "Weather officials predicting warmer-than-usual winter." 

How many times must we read such headlines before action is taken to, at least, reduce this threat to our children, grandchildren and generations (if any) beyond?

ABSTRACT

  

According to federal statistics, Delaware has the 13th highest residential electricity rate in the nation, the 13th highest commercial rate and seventh highest residential average monthly bill.

No one would argue that electricity generated from renewable resources is not a desirable thing, but the well-intentioned blind pursuit of it is pushing electricity prices higher in The First State. 

Delaware's businesses and homeowners are already paying dearly to keep the lights on. According to federal statistics, Delaware has the 13th highest residential electricity rate in the nation, the 13th highest commercial rate and seventh highest residential average monthly bill. 

One cost driving up prices is Delaware's membership in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), a nine-state "cap and trade" compact designed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from large power plants. While a case could have been made for Delaware's joining the coalition in 2008, today our participation lacks credibility. 

Unanticipated changes in the energy market, and upgrades at several Delaware power plants, will result in our state's power industry producing about 40 percent less CO2 by 2014 -- far surpassing the RGGI target of a 10 percent reduction by 2019. 

Despite having more than exceeded its goal, Delaware remains in the program because the hidden tax it levies on ratepayers is used to fund renewable energy initiatives supported by Gov. Jack Markell's administration. According to a RGGI report, through the end of 2010, Delaware had reaped nearly $18.9 million though the program. 

Another reason for Delaware's escalating electricity prices is the state's Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) -- a mandate that an increasing percentage of the electricity supplied to Delaware consumers come from renewable sources. 

When the RPS was established in 2005, 10 percent of the electricity sold in the state had to come from renewables by the year 2020. That percentage has since been raised twice. Currently, the RPS now stands at 25 percent by the year 2025. 

The RPS is well-meaning, but short-sighted. Delaware is not well-positioned for the placement of wind turbines. The only wind power resources we have are along the coast or off-shore, neither of which has proven locally viable on a large scale. 

Some Delaware utilities are investing in solar arrays, like the 10-megawatt Dover SUN Park, to help comply with the RPS. In addition to being subsidized through the sale of renewable energy credits and federal tax credits -- which are financed by ratepayers and taxpayers -- the direct costs of solar energy are quite high. 

According to David T. Stevenson, director of the Caesar Rodney Institute's Center for Energy Competitiveness, "electricity from solar farms costs four to five times more than conventional sources." In the case of the Dover SUN Park, Stevenson says "the total added cost ... compared to using conventional power over the 20-year contract will be $65 million or $3.25 million a year." 

Aside from cost is the worrisome reality that wind and solar energy are not reliable. The amount of electricity they produce is impacted by the time of day, as well as weather and seasonal conditions. Neither can be counted on to produce power when demand is at its peak. 

Contrast this with electricity generated from natural gas turbines, which are environmentally friendly, far less expensive for ratepayers, and dependable. Turbines can also be quickly be started and stopped to efficiently meet fluctuating demand. 

The good news is that new technology for capturing natural gas trapped in shale formations has dramatically increased supplies and dropped prices in the last several years. Using this plentiful and relatively clean domestic energy source would be far less expensive for Delaware's homeowners and businesses than that being supplied via the ever-increasing Renewable Portfolio Standard. 

It was with these issues in mind that I sponsored House Bill 247. It sought to freeze the state's renewable electricity mandate at current levels, which stand at 7 percent for this compliance year. I reasoned the freeze would give state officials a chance to reassess the direction of Delaware's energy policy. 

The bill failed to clear the House Energy Committee, which is chaired by one of Gov. Markell's most ardent energy policy supporters. 

Our state's energy policy seems single-minded in its determination to force the use of renewable energy on ratepayers with an utter disregard for the burden those higher costs are placing on homeowners and businesses. 

Our citizens deserve better. Our energy plan should be dynamic and informed, recognizing and adjusting to changing conditions in a way that acknowledges the importance of holding costs in check as well as our responsibility to be good environmental stewards. 

Jack Peterman, a Republican, represents the 33rd District in the Delaware House of Representatives.

Climate change data called politial propaganda

ABSTRACT

  

In the related Aug. 7 article Hansen does not mention that (1) satellite measurements show that there has been no net global warming since 1998, even though atmospheric CO2 levels have been climbing every year; and (2) Hansen's own NASA GISS surface temperature records show that in the U.S. at least, 1934 was as warm as 1998.

FULL TEXT

 

NASA's James Hansen has produced a "statistical analysis" showing that summer heat waves are more common now than in the period 1950 - 1980. He claims that this proves that the earth is warming and that CO2 from burning fossil fuel is the cause. 

In the related Aug. 7 article Hansen does not mention that (1) satellite measurements show that there has been no net global warming since 1998, even though atmospheric CO2 levels have been climbing every year; and (2) Hansen's own NASA GISS surface temperature records show that in the U.S. at least, 1934 was as warm as 1998. 

Hansen chose to ignore the hot, dry "Dust Bowl" years of the 1930s and to base his study in the cooler years from 1950 through 1980, making warming in the late 20th century look more unusual. Hansen's claim that today's weather "is so rare that it can't be anything but man-made global warming" is political propaganda based on a misleading presentation of the scientific record. Happily it will soon be forgotten.

The lead article "Study: Climate shift dramatic" (Aug. 7) featured the viewpoint of Dr. James E. Hansen, a climate change activist highly acclaimed by his fellow peers that continue to forecast "gloom and doom" for our civilization. 

Dr. Hansen has been a frequent advisor to our current President on climate change legislative needs. One should understand that the majority of Hansen's opinions and conclusions are based on his data from the 1950s through 2011. May I remind our readers that during the 1965-1975 period he and his "so called experts" were predicting a global "cooling." 

Did the authors of your article know that Hansen was arrested three times for his political activates? 

Yes, I'm a skeptic, I look to an acclaimed M.I.T. scientist, Dr. Richard S. Lindzen, for his long-term view of climate change from the dark age , which were hotter than today, when London did not flood, to our present day.

GARY EMEIGH/THE NEWS JOURNAL 

Inch by inch along parts of the Atlantic Coast, global climate change is running in what scientists warn is geology's version of fast-forward - swamping and eroding beaches, wetlands and farm fields. 

ROBERT CRAIG/THE NEWS JOURNAL 

Shorelines from North Carolina to Boston are in a 'hotspot' for sea-level rise and will see water levels rise at double the rate of most places on the planet, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The doubling is largely because of a geologic double whammy. Delaware also has the lowest average elevation, at 60 feet, of any state in the country ... and it's sinking.

The treasured lifestyle of residents along the coasts of the Mid-Atlantic could significantly change by the time this year's high school graduates retire, scientists say. 

The larger issue for taxpayers is where to spend money and energy attempting to hold back the ocean - and where to retreat and allow nature to take its course. 

Humans have already changed Earth's atmosphere by releasing vast amounts of carbon dioxide and similar heat-trapping gases from power plants, vehicles and other sources, scientists say. 

The resulting rise in air and sea-surface temperatures, along with melting glaciers and land ice, will push up sea levels globally by more than 1 1/2 feet by 2100. 

Along the Delaware, Maryland, Virginia and New Jersey coasts, sea levels could rise faster and higher - nearly 1 1/2 feet by 2050 and 3 1/2 to nearly 5 feet by the end of the century, according to DNREC and other federal and science agency reports. 

That could swamp tens of thousands of homes and businesses along the coasts and jeopardize big chunks of land along Maryland's fragile Chesapeake Bay. In Delaware alone, DNREC predicts a 1 1/2-foot rise in sea level would inundate more than 110,000 acres. At 3 feet, more than 133,000 acres would be impacted. 

With a higher ocean, saltier water would push farther upstream, especially in summertime and drought years, making it harder to dilute for public consumption. Water supplies for communities along the Delaware River to Philadelphia could be threatened. And Wilmington's port, its riverfront and its Southbridge neighborhood could be inundated with water. 

Delaware is "extremely vulnerable," said Collin P. O'Mara, secretary of Delaware's Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control. 

It may be worse along the Eastern Shore of Maryland. 

"Dorchester County as we know it will simply disappear beneath the tide," says a Maryland assessment for the low-lying county on the Chesapeake Bay . 

Tom Bradshaw, a lifelong Dorchester resident, said, "Unfortunately, that statement is true. I grew up in the lower part of the county, and there are places under water now that were dry marshland when I was a kid." 

Different challenge 

Like Maryland, Delaware has barrier beaches along the Atlantic that take a pounding. But the First State also faces a different challenge along Delaware Bay, where farm fields and homes are already being lost to encroaching brine water, and inland residents find themselves inside newly widened floodplains. 

DNREC computer models show parts of the narrow Del. 1 corridor between Dewey Beach and Fenwick Island will be threatened or flooded daily at high tides by 2050, even in calm weather. With a 3-foot rise, all that's left in spots is a thin, fragile dune ridge between the Atlantic Ocean and the Inland bays, leaving little to protect thousands of homes and resort developments from the force of Atlantic Ocean waves and tidal surges already capable of swamping waterside communities. 

Delaware officials are assessing what it would cost to hold back the tide, or to let the water rise. Statewide, nearly 152,000 acres could be submerged in the worst case, about 11 percent of the total land area, with New Castle and Kent County both losing about 12 percent and larger Sussex 9 percent. 

One scenario estimates an up-to $200 million expense during the next 30 years just to help seven bayside communities withstand, or gracefully retreat from, rising tides. 

And that figure does not include ongoing state and federal costs for replenishing sand lost in coastal communities along the Atlantic Ocean in Lewes, Rehoboth Beach, Bethany Beach and Fenwick Island, or raising evacuation routes. Taxpayers spent $35 million just for sand replenishment during the past 18 months. 

Investing resources 

Eleven of the state's largest environmental groups already have drafted a joint statement supporting DNREC's soon-to-be-released sea-level vulnerability findings, citing dramatic potential losses to the state's economy and ecosystems. 

O'Mara said communities along Delaware's coast and bays are "very special places. But at the same time, if we're going to invest resources from all taxpayers, we need to make sure there is a public benefit." 

In Kent County's South Bowers community along Delaware Bay, homeowner Alfred Izzarone argues the state needs to raise the sole access road so residents can flee, or access, their homes, when water rises. The narrow lane was raised 18 inches in 1996, and it got another 3 1/2-inch boost during a recent repaving. 

But the water sometimes still gets dangerously high around Izzarone's home, built in 1938 and placed on pilings in 1984. 

He can't erase the night a few years ago when he was nearly swept away by water while attempting an emergency gas line repair. 

A monster storm whipped up without warning on Mother's Day of 2008, and water rose 5 feet around the house. His neighborhood lost 16 cars during that storm and several homes were damaged. 

"I luckily grabbed hold of the piling and worked my way back," recalled Izzarone, who believes the state needs to replenish the sand in front of his community. "It's increasing. I live here, walk the beach every day and see the high water line on super high tides and full moons and new moons." 

'Get used to it' 

Get used to it, scientists say. Our weather has changed. Society must adapt to higher tides and storm surges, deeper heat waves and droughts, more intense storms and changes in long-term weather patterns. 

An international army of scientists also warns the world is just a few years away from a "tipping point" in carbon dioxide releases. Carbon dioxide pollution from power plants needs to peak at 32 billion tons annually worldwide by 2017 to avoid a more-than 3.6-degree increase in average world temperature - the threshold where weather, climate, ocean and sea-level changes are expected to have drastic human costs. An Energy Department report last week showed a promising drop in U.S. carbon dioxide emissions, but it won't come close to heading off that tipping point. 

"It would appear that we may have to adapt to at least 1 meter [slightly more than 3 feet] of sea-level rise by 2100 no matter what, and that means that state and local governments will need to work with the federal government to build sea walls and coastal defenses, engage in some degree of 'managed retreat,'" said Michael E. Mann, a Penn State University geophysicist who has been at the center of climate change research and controversy since the 1990s. 

Adds Susan Love, a coastal program planner for Delaware's Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control: "It's a big deal for the state of Delaware, for the way we live our lives, for the places we recreate, where we work." 

Delaware and Maryland officials recognize the danger inherent in sea-level rise and have evolving plans for dealing with it. In North Carolina, however, lawmakers approved a plan banning consideration of sea-level rise based on climate change for development decisions. 

"That's the most absurd thing I've ever heard," O'Mara said. "We're already seeing impacts. Every study that comes out shows that we can't wait" to take action. 

Delaware is cautiously beginning to add up the toll, based on estimates of an up-to-4 1/2-foot sea-level rise. Among the likely losses within this century, as calculated by DNREC in its upcoming vulnerability report: 

* All of Delaware's 73,400 acres of tidal wetlands, and 98 percent of its tidal marsh 

* Up to 15,000 Sussex County homes or businesses; 18,000 statewide, including 5 percent of identifiable commercial properties. 

* 44 percent of the state's parks, refuges, conservation areas and otherwise protected land. 

* 5 percent of roads and bridges, including 6 percent of evacuation routes. 

* 6 percent of railroad lines, including areas around Wilmington's Amtrak station. 

Government help 

There are many examples of communities, institutions and individuals struggling to hold back rising tides, or wondering what to do when high water reaches them. Government assistance is often required. 

In Chincoteague, Va., home of the famous wild pony roundup, townspeople have asked four of the past 10 years that federal dollars be used to repair the public parking lot on the beach savaged by storms. Annual costs range from $200,000 to $700,000, contingent upon the extent of the damage. 

Without the 961-space parking lot there is no tourism economy, they argue. Tourists won't schlep their beach umbrellas, coolers and kids from an inland park lot to a shuttle and make a 2-mile ride to the beach, as environmentalists have proposed. While debate over a long-term solution continued this spring, giant earthmovers repaired the lot at federal taxpayers' expense. 

East of Dover, landowner David Shevock blames the state and other private landowners for failing to fix storm-damaged wetland dikes that once kept briny Delaware Bay tides and surges away from fields where he grows corn and soybeans - and from the once-freshwater wetland habitats where he hunts. 

"If we have a big storm or a northeast storm, the water from the bay lays in there for four days. The whole farm's under water at times," Shevock said. "Some of the land there is in cultivation, but it can't be used now" because of salt buildup in the soil. 

In the city of Wilmington, Delaware Nature Society officials are facing the long-term prospect of losing the marshy Russell W. Peterson Wildlife Area landmark, where the group operates a new educational center visible from I-95. State computer assessments show open water will push inland from the Delaware River and flood most of the marsh by 2050, turning the rest of the center's interpretative marsh into open water within a few decades. 

"You hear about Bowers Beach and Dewey Beach preparing for sea-level rise, but no one is thinking about Wilmington, because we don't have waves," said Brenna Goggin, a DNS environmental advocate. "But we have the river, and if the water is rising, it's going to rise everywhere. If you look at maps for places like Southbridge, you're not seeing a pretty picture." 

At Kitts Hummock, a bayside village south of Delaware's sprawling Dover Air Force Base, homeowner Tom Idnurm is taking his chances - but believes he'll eventually need government help. Late last month on a blazing hot day, Idnurm watched contractors lower a new modular home onto his lot - the same spot where his previous cottage was trashed by an unexpected and record-setting coastal storm in mid-2008. 

"Quite honestly, they [state government] should probably look at a long-term plan of buying out the property owners here, and letting it return to nature," said Idnurm, whose views differ with some bayside landowners eager for permanent beach restorations. "I would hate to lose my place, but the reality is, it's going to flood again." 

About 100 miles south, at NASA's Wallops Island space facility on Virginia's Eastern Shore, federal officials extended a sea wall and pumped 3.2 million cubic yards of sand along the beach last year to protect the $1 billion space agency infrastructure from being washed away. 

To the northwest, along the Chesapeake Bay's Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge near Cambridge, Md., woods and marsh purchased by the federal government are disappearing under rising water, taking away critical habitat for wildlife. 

Federal researchers expect entire islands to disappear in Chesapeake Bay, noting that in recent months a new channel was cut through Tangier Island off the coast of Virginia. 

Skeptics remain 

All this seems a bit over wrought to Rich Collins, a Delaware insurance agent and leader of the Positive Growth Alliance, a business-oriented lobbying group. Sea-level rise forecasts are "way overstated," Collins insists. 

"I have real concerns, because there are many environmental programs that I believe are designed to drive people away from the water," said Collins, a member of the state's Sea-Level Rise Advisory Committee and a critic of past state attempts to factor future climate change into current land-use decisions. "Their intention, in my opinion, is to shut down human use of the coastline." 

Others say the evidence is unequivocal - and alarming. 

In New Jersey, where the state's Coastal Zone Management Program has been working for years to help local governments develop plans for "resilience," environmental scientist Donna Frizzera said current state forecasts are far from worst-case estimates. 

Maps and forecasts of future sea-level rise, offered as guides for long-term planning, only show viewers the calm-weather level of future high tides. Not shown is the height of storm surges pushed up from higher starting points by the more-vicious storms climate researchers say will become more common. 

"For some communities we showed them the current inundation and sea-level rise projections," Frizzera said. "Then we showed them the storm surge on top of the sea-level rise projects." 

"If you really want to be scared, those are very frightening."

ABSTRACT

  

[...]on average an increase in the sea level (ocean's size) at Rehoboth cannot vary from the global sea level. Since 1992, satellites have measured sea level.

FULL TEXT

 

The "apparent" Rehoboth sea level rise is a function of the lowering of the Earth's crust and an increase in amount of the global oceans' water. 

The measurement of the "apparent" sea level is not in dispute. But on average an increase in the sea level (ocean's size) at Rehoboth cannot vary from the global sea level. Since 1992, satellites have measured sea level. The calculated rise averages about 3 mm per year. At that rate, sea level 90 years from now would be about 0.3 meters (11 inches) higher, not the exaggerated numbers that the alarmists project. 

Global warming is not in dispute, either. The globe has been warming since the end of the last ice age, more than 10 thousand years ago. But can you trust those scientists and their computer models when anyone who takes the time to look back can see how far off their alarming global warming forecasts have been. 

These scientist's batting averages are so bad it is puzzling how any organization can take them seriously. Yet, every year the same group of scientists make more forecasts (most of which will also turn out to be wrong). They are the ones that need to be doubted.

A recent News Journal editorial touted a "new" report by NASA scientist James Hansen regarding climate change. In reality, there is nothing new about Hansen's report, except that this time he is using the nationwide drought to scare people (again) into believing we can abate or prevent climate change and extreme weather events by drastically reducing hydrocarbon use. 

Whenever an extreme weather event occurs, Hansen and others say we must act immediately to prevent such events. However, there is no clear scientific evidence that humans are responsible, future climate changes will be calamitous, or slashing energy use will avert anything. 

Hansen's analysis is biased by his decision to focus only on the period from 1955-99, conveniently ignoring the warm period during the 1930s and the lack of an increase in temperature since 2000. Indeed, climate history tells us that America's droughts of the 1930s were longer and more severe than the current drought - and that human greenhouse gas emissions clearly were not the culprits 80 years ago. 

Our climate is changing because it always has changed. It is foolish to believe that the climate should remain constant or claim that energy policies will somehow achieve "climate stabilization." 

Delaware's climate has changed over the years, but not in ways The News Journal asserts. Data from the New Castle County Airport in Wilmington - the longest, most consistent record available - show that summer maximum temperatures are not significantly warmer, recent winters are not drier or less snowy, and storms are no more frequent on average. 

Floods are more common in Delaware, not because of climate change, but because of increased storm runoff due to more impervious surfaces like asphalt and concrete. Water shortages primarily reflect our growing populations' increased demand for water, not climate change. The Palmer Drought Index used by climatologists to quantify climate-induced changes in drought cycles, frequency and severity shows no long-term trend for Delaware. 

Sea levels continue to rise globally. However, as an article in the journal Science observes, satellite records during the past 18 years show no net increase in mean sea level for the mid-Atlantic region. A recent study for the Chesapeake Bay confirms this and notes that any apparent sea level rise can be attributed to coastal subsidence, not to climate change. 

Hansen's latest alarm is intended to promote his view that fossil fuels should be more expensive and less available. The News Journal joins him by advocating a "carbon tax" to force people to curtail their use of fossil fuels. However, such a tax would primarily hurt the poor in Delaware by making it more expensive to commute to work, to heat and cool homes, to use televisions and computers, and to buy food, goods and services that are made more costly by soaring transportation and production costs. 

The poor do not have the luxury of purchasing high-priced solar panels, even with government subsidies. Thus, they are to become more dependent on welfare and food stamps and have less of a chance of becoming middle-class. 

Activists like Hansen say we must act now to "prevent climate change," even before full scientific certainty can be established. This gives carte blanche to policymakers to take extreme steps to "save the planet" even if scientific, economic and overall human welfare facts argue otherwise. 

This is the wrong approach. Actions to abate climate change should not be implemented until it can be demonstrated that they will actually achieve their intended results without creating new problems or exacerbating existing troubles. Imposing immediate, draconian programs like a carbon tax will have little, if any, beneficial impacts but will create numerous unintended adverse consequences. 

Paraphrasing S.J. Perelman, The News Journal says, "I may not know anything about climate science, but I know what I like." Similarly, Rep. John Kowalko has said, "We don't need a state climatologist, we need a state climate advocate!" In other words, they want to replace science-based policy with advocacy-driven solutions and be told whatever to justify their editorial stances and legislative agendas. 

We must return to true science-based assessments of potential risk and use them to develop appropriate solutions to problems over which we have some control. Delaware cannot afford anything less. 

David R. Legates is a professor of climatology at the University of Delaware and has studied climate change for nearly 30 years.

Warming cycles account for climate change

FULL TEXT

 

The four-part News Journal series on sea level rise around Delaware highlights the need to adapt to the possibility that global warming may continue for a few hundred more years. However, the Delaware state government study on the subject suffers from the faulty assumption that increased carbon dioxide concentration is a major cause of the current warming period. Many letters to the editor have thoroughly debunked that assumption. Taking a long view of the Earth's climate, we have been between major ice ages for about 10,000 years, with over 20 cycles of cooling and warming. The present warm period was preceded by the "Little Ice Age", which preceeded the Medieval Warm Period - warmer than we are now! 

The cooling and warming cycles are likely caused by changes in the output of the sun. The current warming trend could reverse at any time and bring a new "Little Ice Age", or even the next major ice age over the long term. 

The Delaware state government has already done more than enough work on adapting to the warming period. We need a leaner less expensive government.

State braces itself for climate change's rising waters 

Goggin, Brenna . The News Journal ; Wilmington, Del. [Wilmington, Del]27 Sep 2012.

ABSTRACT

  

[...]97 percent to 99 percent of Delaware's tidal coastal wetlands could potentially disappear entirely under each scenario. 



LINKS

FULL TEXT

 

The DuPont Environmental Education Center and the Russell W. Peterson Urban Wildlife Refuge, on the Wilmington Riverfront, marks the place where the city, river and marsh meet. The 212-acre Refuge is home to a diverse range of frogs, birds, fish and native plants that help tell the story of an urban wildlife landscape. The area is also poised to showcase how sea-level rise will impact the future of the Delaware Bay Estuary and surrounding areas. 

The sea level along Delaware's 281 miles of coastal shoreline is expected to rise as a result of climate change, putting lucrative coastal real estate at risk. 

Local forecasts by the Delaware Estuary Program predict that sea level will rise between 0.5 meters and 1.5 meters in Delaware Bay over the next 100 years. 

This will present huge challenges for Delaware residents and businesses, as well as for the state's natural areas, such as the Peterson Urban Wildlife Refuge. Fortunately, the State of Delaware is preparing for and adapting to the impacts of climate change. 

They have convened representatives from numerous state departments ranging from the Delaware Economic Development Office to the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control, as well as from local governments, and business and citizen advocacy organizations, to form the Sea Level Advisory Committee. 

The Advisory Committee has conducted an exhaustive analysis of the vulnerabilities that Delaware residents and natural resources face from sea-level rise. The report released this week assesses the societal, economic, natural resource and public safety/infrastructure impacts of three sea-level rise scenarios: 0.5 meters, 1 meter and 1.5 meters by 2100. 

The report shows that tidal wetlands, like those at the Peterson Wildlife Refuge, as well as freshwater tidal wetlands, coastal impoundments and conservation lands are at high risk. 

In fact, 97 percent to 99 percent of Delaware's tidal coastal wetlands could potentially disappear entirely under each scenario. The results of the vulnerability assessment will help the State develop strategies to reduce the risk of sea level rise for our residents and natural resources. 

But Delaware cannot address these impacts on its own. That's why the newly created National Ocean Policy is such welcome news. 

It puts together a National Ocean Council of federal agencies that will work together with states and tribes to address a wide range of ocean issues, including picking up trash on our beaches, improving marine wildlife management, and preparing for sea-level rise. 

It will encourage all levels of government to share information regarding these issues and work together to plan a coordinated adaptation strategy. 

This means Delaware will get assistance to address this issue across state boundaries from its neighbors grappling with similar issues, and from federal agencies that are looking at them nationwide. 

Climate change is likely to cause the border between the city, river and coastal tidal marsh to change. 

Fortunately, the state's sea level planning effort and the new National Ocean Policy will help Delaware protect the Russell W. Peterson Urban Wildlife Refuge, our coastal communities, and other critical coastal habitats and development, in the face of rising seas. 

Brenna Goggin is the Environmental Advocate at the Delaware Nature Society and is a member of the Delaware Sea Level Advisory Committee.

Wilmington broke ground Thursday on a $36 million renewable energy biosolids facility that will significantly reduce the amount of sludge produced by the city's Hay Road Wastewater Treatment Plant. 

City officials have described the project as a large part of Mayor James M. Baker's greening plan for Wilmington. The facility will burn landfill and sewage sludge gas to produce electricity to power the plant, while excess heat from electricity generation will dry leftover sewage sludge. 

In June, the Wilmington City Council agreed to issue up to $39 million in bonds to finance the project undertaken by Honeywell International. The decision came with some controversy, as the project materialized as a no-bid extension of a 2008 energy savings agreement between Wilmington and Honeywell. 

Council members pointed to the jobs the project will bring, as well as Honeywell's guarantee for $16.7 million in savings over two decades.

Nation already feeling backlash of unchecked climate change

ABSTRACT

  

Without large reductions in global emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gas - mainly pollutants from burning fossil fuel - effects will steadily worsen, with sea levels rising for centuries, heat waves and extreme weather worsening, the report said.

FULL TEXT

 

The News Journal 

A new national report flatly declared Friday that global climate change "is already affecting the American people" - making seasons hotter and drier, whipping up more furious storms and floods and threatening global ecosystems and every aspect of human activity. 

"Evidence for climate change abounds, from the top of the atmosphere to the depths of the oceans," said the draft National Climate Assessment, which is issued every four years. 

In an opening to the 1,146-page document, described as "A letter to the American People," the report's lead officials said: "Climate change, once considered an issue for a distant future, has moved firmly into the present," with evidence to be found in hotter seasons, increased wildfires, and retreating sea ice. 

"Americans are noticing changes all around them," the report said. "Summers are longer and hotter, and periods of extreme heat last longer than any living American has ever experienced. Winters are generally shorter and warmer. Rain comes in heavier downpours, though in many regions there are longer dry spells in between." 

Some areas initially could benefit from warmer temperatures or climate alterations, they conceded. 

"But many more have already proven to be detrimental, largely because society and its infrastructure were designed for the climate of the past, not for the rapidly changing climate of the present or the future." 

Without large reductions in global emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gas - mainly pollutants from burning fossil fuel - effects will steadily worsen, with sea levels rising for centuries, heat waves and extreme weather worsening, the report said. 

Burdens could fall most heavily on those least able to manage, including "the elderly, children, the poor and the sick," the report said. 

Those living along coastal areas will be subject to rising tides and storm surges. People living in already hot and dry regions will see their homes become hotter and drier. 

Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control Secretary Collin P. O'Mara said that the study found severe consequences for the Northeast in particular, if worldwide greenhouse gas emissions remain at high levels. 

"In the Northeast, it's more flooding waterways, more droughts, extreme storms," O'Mara said. "We talk a lot about storms and sea-level rise. But it's not just the big events once a year, it's storms like we had a couple of weeks ago that didn't have a name but caused a lot of problems at Bayview Beach and in South Wilmington. Delaware is a microcosm of what this collection of scientists is seeing nationally." 

'An alarm bell' 

Some 240 scientists and other experts from across the country developed the draft document, which was released for public comment Friday and is expected to become final in 2014. Comments will be taken through April 12. 

The report said changes seen during the past 50 years are "due primarily to human activities" and warned that changes will continue and "accelerate significantly if greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase. 

"There is strong evidence to indicate that human influence on the climate has already roughly doubled the probability of extreme heat events," as seen in 2011 and 2012, the report said. 

In the Northeast, higher temperatures "will add stresses to the region's already burdened environmental, social, and economic systems," with storms, flooding and sea-level rise "compromising" infrastructure, such as roads and bridges. 

The report included a map of the Northeast indicating that Delaware could see 15 additional days a year with 95 degree and higher temperatures. Currently, the state averages 21.2 days 90-degree-plus days per year. 

Jeff Tittel, who directs the Sierra Club New Jersey Chapter, said the Garden State received a vivid reminder of the risks in late October, when Superstorm Sandy trashed the Jersey Shore. 

"This assessment should be an alarm bell, not only for the people of the United States, but more importantly for political leaders who have dragged their feet and held back from working on climate and lowering greenhouse gas emissions," Tittel said. "We're all in this together, and this report shows the alarming impact. Politicians need to get it - and lead." 

Concerns extend to the reliability of water supplies and farming production, although agricultural systems and practices could adapt to help protect food production. 

In another worrisome development, scientists pointed out that natural ecosystems and habitats could be affected too quickly to allow movement or adaptation for some species. 

Warming and rising acidity in the oceans will affect habitats and the distribution of species, potentially making global waters less productive and less able to absorb carbon dioxide. That, in turn, would potentially add to atmospheric buildups of greenhouse gas. 

"Certain coastal ecosystems are already rapidly changing as a result of interactions between climatic and non-climatic factors, and others have already crossed tipping points," the report said. "Eelgrass in the Chesapeake Bay died out almost completely during the record-hot summer of 2005, when temperatures exceeded the species' tolerance threshold of 86 degreesF, and subsequent recovery has been poor." 

If seas rise just 2 feet, the report said, more than 5,790 square miles and $1 trillion of property and structures could be flooded along coastlines. That level could be reached in just 37 years, by 2050, if a worst-case rise of 6.6 feet occurs by the end of the century. 

If seas rise here 5 feet by 2100, Delaware officials predict a loss of 11 percent of the state's land base, along with all tidal wetlands, 20,000 residences and significant percentages of highway, rail lines, industrial properties and other assets. 

Miami, greater New York, New Orleans, Tampa-St. Petersburg and Virginia Beach were ranked as the most vulnerable port areas. But Delaware officials concluded that nearly all of the Port of Wilmington would be flooded with a 5-foot rise, with a loss of nearby areas, including the community of Southbridge.

The News Journal 

In a world of dire scientific warnings about climate change, Delaware on Friday announced that it has hired a nationally recognized expert to help it develop detailed projections for changing conditions along the state's coasts, farms, cities and suburban neighborhoods. 

Katharine Hayhoe, director of the Climate Science Center at Texas Tech University, will fill the knowledge gaps Delaware officials face in planning for rising temperatures, changes in rainfall patterns, extreme weather events and other weather trends during this century. 

She was hired by the state Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment Steering Committee to identify issues that could affect daily life here. 

"Climate change is a global problem, but the reason why we care about climate change is how it's going to affect us in the places where we live," Hayhoe said in an interview with The News Journal on Friday. 

"What's relevant in Delaware is how is climate change going to affect sea levels and the risk of coastal flooding. How is it going to affect the severity of storms and the risk of extreme heat in the summer? What about water resources?" 

Hayhoe's writings as an Evangelical Christian and scientist concerned about climate change late last year earned her the wrath of both Rush Limbaugh and climate skeptics in the Christian Right. Soon afterward, Republican Newt Gingrich abruptly jettisoned a chapter that Hayhoe wrote for a book that he planned as a sequel to his 2007 A Contract with the Earth. 

Friday's announcement of Hayhoe's selection by Delaware came hours before the federal government released a draft of the latest National Climate Assessment, an every-four-year assessment of global warming and its climate consequences for the United States. 

The national report concluded that climate change has become "apparent across the United States in a wide range of observations," and "threatens human health and well-being in many ways." 

Hayhoe's program in Texas is part of the Department of Interior's South-Central Climate Science Center. She said on Friday that her research in Delaware will take into account findings from the new national assessment, as well as models based on a United Nations report due later this year, making state forecasts the most up-to-date possible. 

"We already know it's happening," Hayhoe said. "Our Spring is arriving one to two weeks early over the whole northern hemisphere, compared with 50 years ago. We're breaking heat records right, left and center. We're seeing all of the indicators that tell us this is really here. This is not a future problem." 

She has done similar work in California, Chicago and the Northeast region, adding that Delaware was a "natural" place to continue her work. In October, Hayhoe was one of the scientists named to a four-year, $750,000 National Science Foundation-funded effort to determine how climate change will affect roads and bridges and future infrastructure design requirements. 

Delaware will pay $46,000 for its state-specific work, expected to be complete in draft form by March. The Delaware data will be incorporated into a scientific white paper on Climate Change Vulnerability for the state that is expected to be complete by the end of March. 

Delaware's Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment Steering Committee was formed in August and includes both state officials and scientists from the University of Delaware and Delaware State University. 

"The world's changed since then," said David Small, deputy secretary of the state Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control, referring to the regional impacts from Superstorm Sandy. "That probably suggests even more urgency" in completing Delaware's vulnerability assessment, he said. 

A state Sea Level Advisory Committee has also been meeting to discuss options for the state's low lying and vulnerable coastal areas. 

Morgan Ellis, a climate planner in the state division of energy and climate, said one of the department's difficulties has been coming up with Delaware specific projections. Maryland and Pennsylvania have done projections, as have states in the Northeast and Southeast, but there is little site-specific that covers the unique coastal environment of Delaware, she said. 

While Delawareans are beginning to make connections between climate change and what is occurring on the ground, Small said, the additional data will help answer the questions of citizens and government officials. 

Hayhoe outlined her proposal to committee members Friday morning via a teleconferencing call. 

There is great variability in climate forecasts, Hayhoe said. But if data is examined over 20-year time slots, much of the natural climate variability of cyclical events such as El Nino and La Nina tend to balance out, providing a true picture of a region, she said. 

She recommended that state officials use only worst and best case scenarios in developing its final report to the citizenry, because those would cover the entire spectrum of possibilities. That perspective will help Delawareans decide to do something about climate change - or to ignore the warnings. 

"Only by looking at the impact of climate change do we have any motivation to do something about it," she said. "It's being aware of the consequences before anything happens." 

In Bayville Shores, northwest of Fenwick Island, resident John F. Bacon said Superstorm Sandy heightened concerns on climate change. Hayhoe and other scientists across the country noted that climate change-driven warming of ocean waters likely added to Sandy's power. 

"My sense is, this community was shocked," Bacon said. "Had that storm not turned and gone up and into New Jersey, it would have been tragic here. If it hit us, it would have been over. Water was coming over our piers, our ramps - my house was an island, almost." 

On Thursday, Bacon attended a separate state committee meeting examining sea level rise in Delaware. It wants the public to determine whether property owners selling inside boundaries where scientific models say seas will rise should be forced to disclose that vulnerability to potential buyers. 

That would be a significant step beyond the existing rule of requiring sellers to disclose to buyers that properties reside in designated flood zones, based largely on historic flood and storm surge records. 

Bacon agreed that owners should disclose sea level predictions, explaining that he considered it "a matter of integrity and honor." 

"In the near term, there are probably people here who will sell after Sandy," Bacon said. "I think two or three people told me they're alarmed about it." 

Hayhoe and other researchers have pointed out that climate models, including past estimates by the United Nations, have systematically underestimated rates of change. She cited work by Michael Oppenheimer, who said in an interview with The News Journal last year that the U.N.'s current forecast - calling for about a foot of global sea-level rise by 2100 - will likely be significantly increased as new knowledge about warming and polar ice melt takes hold. 

A draft of the U.N.'s latest forecast, leaked by a climate change skeptic last month, did significantly increase global average sea-level rise predictions. The United States draft report issued Friday indicated that the global increase could be as high as 6.6 feet, with even higher levels along the Mid-Atlantic. 

Hayhoe said that attacks on climate scientists whose findings support climate change warnings are misdirected. 

"It's an unfortunate truth. Any climate scientist who stands up and says climate change is real, it's happening because of human activity, anyone who does that has to be prepared to be attacked," said Hayhoe, who has endured blasts of email attacks on both her science and faith. 

"The reality is that this is an issue about temperature and sea-level rise, intense rainfall events, birds, bugs and trees moving northward," Hayhoe said. "Thermometers are not Democratic or Republican. What should be political is what we want to do with the facts - because there's no perfect solution."

The News Journal 

State economies can benefit as climate change pressures encourage shifts to cleaner and more efficient energy sources, Gov. Jack Markell said in a speech on Friday to a climate conference at Georgetown Law School in Washington, D.C. 

But governments also need to act now to prepare communities for more extreme storms and other emerging consequences of global warming-driven climate change, Markell added. 

"I think people are paying more and more attention to climate impacts than ever before because of many of the things that have happened to many of us," Markell said during a keynote speech that opened the second day of the Georgetown Climate Center workshop. 

The event focused on ways states and federal government can cooperate in developing a future with drastically lower emissions of heat-trapping carbon dioxide and communities better prepared for threats like sea-level rise, longer droughts and changes in agricultural patterns. 

"From hurricanes and tornadoes to wildfires and droughts, we're experiencing exactly what so many of the models predict and suggest that we ought to be experiencing. We ought to just say that the science is settled and the data is overwhelming, and that ought to be the starting point for all of these conversations," Markell told an early morning crowd. 

The center, based at Georgetown Law School, operates as a clearinghouse and analysis center for state and federal issues involving energy, climate and transportation. Some of its work has focused on the evolution of climate change policies since 2009, when the Environmental Protection Agency issued a formal declaration that carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping greenhouse gases have endangered public health and should be controlled. 

Markell has said releases that could raise global average temperatures by 3.5 degrees Fahrenheit or more in the next century work as scientific evidence of climate change and links to carbon dioxide. But he also has emphasized that shifts to new and cleaner energy sources will create opportunities for economic growth and development. 

"I think a lot of governors have seen that we can actually accelerate economic growth in our states by supporting the construction and manufacturing jobs in energy efficiency, clean energy and advanced transportation," Markell said. 

"And I think the fact that the debate is evolving in that direction, where people see that these investments are good for the environment and good for the economy, is a whole different way of looking at things. It's a much better way of looking at things." 

In Delaware, that view has led to state-level support for a range of initiatives, including power plant shifts from coal to natural gas, a fuel cell manufacturer venture and Fisker Automotive's troubled electric car enterprise. 

Earlier in the workshop, Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control Secretary Collin O'Mara said that the nine-state Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative has succeeded in dramatically lowering power plant carbon dioxide emissions without harming ratepayers, utilities or local economies. 

O'Mara chairs the initiative, which recently reduced emissions goals to account for findings from the first years of the program. The group relies on a "cap and trade" process that limited annual power plant carbon dioxide emissions and created a market for plants to buy needed pollution credits and sell excess amounts. 

The group cut its multistate budget for carbon dioxide emissions by 45 percent, to 91 million tons, earlier this month, with levels required to fall by 10 percent by 2019. 

"We have confidence that the numbers are realistic," O'Mara said. 

Markell said Superstorm Sandy and other recent weather calamities have shown that global warming has become an immediate threat that requires a "frank conversation," choices and action. 

"I know that there has been some hesitation on the part of some in the environmental advocacy movement," Markell said. "They've been hesitant over the years to have a robust conversation about adapting, because some saw that as really a surrender. They didn't want to give a false sense that we can adapt our way out of it."

Some people say the costs of addressing climate change are too high, but what about the costs if we fail to act? I am a person of faith, and I have faith in our ability to innovate. I know it can be done because we are doing it. I've worked with congregations to help them become more energy efficient. 

We changed out light bulbs, sealed up cracks in doors and windows and turned off unused lights and appliances. It was not difficult, but it is saving significant money on energy bills each month that can now go to other programs. There is a cost to all of this carbon pollution. We are paying with damaged health and an uncertain future we're leaving for our children. It is time for action. I support promoting energy efficiency, renewable energy and putting standards on polluting power plants.

Dangerous to ignore the facts of climate change 

Publication info: The News Journal ; Wilmington, Del. [Wilmington, Del]07 July 2013.

ABSTRACT

  

The National Geographic Society recently claimed that the babies being born now will probably become 120 years old which will exaggerate the problem. Since population increase is exponential, the next generation will see even greater increases.

FULL TEXT

 

It is an indisputable fact that the Earth's climate has changed continuously over billions of years caused by the immense powers and energies of nature and the universe and will also in the future. All who believe that humanity can influence the climate should look at causes and not only at the effects. It took hundreds of generations to reach a global population of 2 billion. 

During the present generation the global population increased from 2 billion to 7 billion, adding 5 billion who need food, shelter, energy and who pollute. Providing meaningful employment might be the most difficult problem especially in nations where the population doubles every 30 years. 

The National Geographic Society recently claimed that the babies being born now will probably become 120 years old which will exaggerate the problem. Since population increase is exponential, the next generation will see even greater increases. Everything reasonable should be done to keep the air and water clean, but if the exponential increase in population is not slowed down, all efforts will be in vain. 

It is regrettable that religious, civic and political leaders ignore the reality of the problem. Facts can be ignored, but could cause catastrophes of unimaginable proportions and unsolvable problems for future generations.

The News Journal reports that two state business groups, including one described as "conservative," object to the recommendations by the state's Sea Level Rise Advisory Committee because those recommendations could cost money in the near future. Having spent 30 years in business, I'm happy to explain: The idea is to invest something now in order to avoid or reduce eventual catastrophe. 

There is nothing "conservative" in the idea that we should stick our heads in the sand and hope for the best on climate change. The truly "conservative" thing to do is to take action now regarding climate change and sea-level rise so as to conserve as much as possible of our land, homes, environment and economy.

In a recent letter to his constitutents, Chris Coons said Congress should pass the bipartisan Master Limited Partnerships Parity Act, which would drive down the cost of renewable energy, making it cheaper to move to a clean energy economy. And he said Congress can also pass the voluntary, consensus-based policies in the Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act and the bipartisan Weatherization Enhancement and Local Energy Efficiency Investment and Accountability Act. 

More government subsidies to drive down costs? Ask how that worked in Germany (you probably don't know - they are getting out of the solar panel business; ask Spain - they are awash in debt due to failed green energy programs). Private enterprise (CF natural gas abundance) can much more readily resolve the energy supply needs. 

I would have thought someone with a business background like Sen. Chris Coons had in the Gore company, would be more knowledgeable about private enterprise and efficiency.

Reader submitted 

In the topsy-turvey world of Delaware weather - snow two weeks ago and balmy, record-breaking temperatures on the first days of winter - it's no wonder people have trouble connecting long-term weather trends to proof of climate change. 

Turns out, Delawareans aren't alone. 

A new study by the Yale Project on Climate Change posed this question: "Who remembers a hot summer or a cold winter?" to see how experience influences perception of climate change. 

What researchers Peter D. Howe and Anthony Leiserowitz looked at was how people see their local climate and how that matches climate conditions that have been recorded over time: snowfall, heat and cold data, for instance. 

The past two weeks may have cloudied that outlook more. After 13 days of cold temperatures and snow (at least in the northern part of the state), unseasonable record-high temperatures descended on Delaware this weekend. 

It hit 72 in Georgetown Saturday, breaking the record of 65 from 1956, and 76 Sunday, breaking the previous high of 68 set in 1949. The 68 degrees registered in Wilmington Saturday beat the old mark of 65 set in 1895. On Sunday, it reached, 67 there, besting the record of 64 set in 1980 and 1998. 

Records were set across the region as Philadelphia, Allentown, Pa., Mount Pocono, Pa., Atlantic City, Trenton and Reading, Pa., among many other cities, saw new high-temperature marks set. 

This comes as Delaware officials are in the midst of a detailed climate change study that so far points to increased temperatures - about .2 degrees per decade between 1895 and 2012. And new data from the U.S. Geological Survey suggests that each of the three counties in Delaware will see continued increases of more than three degrees by the end of this century. 

But when it comes to the data versus what folks believe, things get very complicated. 

"People come preloaded with a whole set of different attitudes and cultural values," Leiserowitz said. 

And when it comes to evidence that the climate is changing, people are often "influenced by prior beliefs about global warming," he said. 

Howe, with the Department of Environment and Society, Quinney College of Natural Resources at Utah State University, and Leiserowitz, with the School of Forestry and Environmental Studies at Yale University, used national survey data collected in 2011 for their project. 

What they found was that perceptions about weather in the short term coincided with collected weather data. But among people who believe that global warming is not happening, there was less of a tendency to recall above-normal summer temperatures even if the weather had been hotter than normal. 

"These results suggest that the subjective experience of local climate change is dependent not only on external climate conditions, but also on individual beliefs, with perceptions apparently biased by prior beliefs about global warming," Howe and Leiserowitz wrote in their paper. 

"The relationship between personal experience and beliefs about global warming is of considerable interest as changes in local weather and climate conditions continue to be consistent with scientific projections of global warming," they wrote. 

Delaware's climate assessment concluded that nationwide, maximum temperature events were rising in the summer and minimum temperature events were declining in the winter. 

And events like Superstorm Sandy or droughts and heat waves all have an impact on the way people view the interactions between climate and weather. 

In groups that have strong beliefs that global warming is occurring or that it is not, people tend to "cherry pick what backs up what they already believe," Leiserowitz said. 

In a place like Delaware, the weather often doesn't make sense and that can make for a fuzzy big picture when it comes to local impacts of climate change. 

"It's really because of our placement and geography," said state climatologist Daniel Leathers. 

Delaware is in the middle Atlantic and that means, at least in the winter, the meanderings of the jet stream play a huge role. So in early December, the jet stream brought cold, Canadian Arctic air into Delaware and the precipitation, at least in the northern part of the state, fell as snow, he said. 

But weatherwise, it's sometimes like we live in two different states. While northern Delaware was shoveling out and experiencing school shutdowns and delays, in the south - less than 100 miles away - the snow quickly turned to rain. 

That, said Leathers, was caused by the other huge weather driver in Delaware: the Atlantic Ocean. 

The ocean holds heat and as the warmer ocean air blew into Sussex County, the air temperature warmed and snow changed to rain, he said. 

Varying views 

Many longtime Delawareans believe the C&D Canal is the big weather transition line in the state - that it can snow on one side of the canal and rain on the other. 

But, said Leathers, that just isn't true. The canal just isn't a big enough body of water to influence weather, he said. 

Instead, it's the ocean. Lower Kent and Sussex counties get that warming air flow off the ocean and Delaware Bay. 

But for the warmer ocean air to reach New Castle County, it has to flow over New Jersey first, Leathers said. 

As for snow, it tends to come in waves, dictated by where the jet stream sets up, he said. 

If you look at big storms from the past - be they December snow, late-season snow or Superstorm Sandy, the jet stream played a role in all of them. Normally, a late-season storm like Sandy would get caught in the jet stream and head out to sea, he said. 

Or take a late-season storm in March 1958. Middletown got some 27 inches of snow over 24 hours. To the north, in Middletown, Conn., residents saw 50 inches over 24 hours. 

Or consider a winter flood event in 1996. The ground, at least in northern Delaware, had been frozen and snow-covered for weeks and all of a sudden, the snow melted and it started to rain. Flooding was bad in Delaware but worse to the north in Pennsylvania. 

"Everybody has a different storm they remember," he said. 

The take-home message about Delaware weather is "it's so variable," Leathers said. 

As for winter weather memories, many Delawareans remember more snow and more days below freezing - when it was cold enough to ice skate. 

Cindy Small, in a Facebook post to Delawareonline, noted: "[I] Grew up at Red Mill Pond. Seems like the pond froze every winter. Lots of kids skated behind Brent and Mark Moore's house in Red Mill Acres. [I] remember doing crack the whip." 

Anne Maull recalled the bitterly cold winters of the late 1970s. 

"[I] remember walking my daughter out on the frozen Delaware Bay off the point of Cape Henlopen in winter of '78 &'79. My dad took pictures." 

Jane Nickle remembers "ice skating on the canal on the other side of the old Reedy Point Bridge. That's how cold the winters were back then." 

And Sarah Dougherty sent along two pictures of two big snow storms up near Pike Creek Valley and these winter memories: 

"I have many fond childhood memories of snowy winter days in the 1970s &1980s. When I think back, I remember there being a lot more snow in those days, with long stretches of freezing temperatures that seemed to keep snow on the ground from December right into February. 

"I grew up in a suburb of Wilmington. I remember 'the older boys' [my brothers and neighborhood boys] building igloos out of the huge mounds of snow that snow plows created. They used them as forts during snowball fights, and there was always a stack of snowballs inside ready for use. 'The girls' [neighborhood friends and myself] would occupy these snow forts when the boys were done, making them into homes for our dolls and stuffed toys. 

"I can remember getting ready to go out in the snow, and the layers of clothing that I would have to wear including double socks. The outer layer was always snow pants and a down jacket accessorized with wool scarves, knit mittens &a knit hat. 

"I remember long, long treks through the woods pulling wooden sleds and plastic snow discs. Our destination was the back side of Delcastle golf course where the greatest sledding hill ever [or as far as I knew] was. Such fun times we had sledding down that hill, then trudging back up with our sleds." 

Why are our weather memories important? Well, Leiserowitz said, climate change "has become a deeply political issue, a litmus test issue" in the world of politics. So rather than making decisions based on science, ideology comes into play, he said. 

On either end of the debate there are climate deniers and climate alarmists - the folks who are deeply committed to their view of global warming, he said. 

For the alarmists, any extreme weather event can be a call to action - even some that have no known scientific connection to climate change, such as tornadoes in the Midwest, Leiserowitz said. 

Among the deniers, there is the deeply held believe that any action on climate change will signal a huge expansion of government, higher taxes and because it is a global issue, more U.S. interaction with the United Nations. Some in this group believe that climate change is just a conspiracy theory, he said. 

"It triggers some of their biggest fears," he said. "That's the underlying issue." 

Then, there are the people in the middle, the people who may shift back and forth on the issue or are waiting for more details to make up their mind. 

But in this latest research, Howe and Leiserowitz saw something else. Across the country, many people had been impacted by an extreme weather event. 

In fact, 8 out of 10 Americans have personal experience with a weather disaster, he said. And one-third of these people were harmed in some way by the extreme weather events. 

"They are having huge impacts," Leiserowitz said. These days, 65 percent of people in the United States say climate change is affecting them, the study found. 

"They are beginning to connect the dots," he said. "People are experiencing it and we're beginning to actually talk about it."

How smoking tobacco is like burning fossil fuels 

Publication info: The News Journal ; Wilmington, Del. [Wilmington, Del]17 Jan 2014: 12.

ProQuest document link 



 





ABSTRACT

  

[...]we have had a number of reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a statement from the U.S. National Academies of Science along with those of the other major industrial countries, and statements by many leading scientific societies, including the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Chemical Society, the American Geophysical Union, the American Institute of Physics, the Geological Society of America, and the American Meteorological Society - all supporting the scientific consensus that earth's climate is changing, that human activities - especially the burning of fossil fuels - are largely responsible, and that if action is not taken soon to change business-as-usual emissions, the consequences will become very serious for both humans and other forms of life.

FULL TEXT

 

The News Journal recently published an essay by Dr. Robert Laskowski, president of the Christiana Care Health System, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the U.S. Surgeon General's 1964 report on the health risks associated with smoking. It was very important in bringing public attention to the risks involved to smokers themselves, to those breathing second-hand smoke, and even to babies in the womb. There are a number of similarities between smoking tobacco and burning fossil fuels - coal, oil and natural gas. 

Both produce toxic gases and particulates, along with carbon dioxide. Both are harmful to human health and welfare; the number of people who die yearly from each worldwide is estimated to be 5 million or more. Both are addictive and hard to give up; President Bush said, "Americans are addicted to oil," in his 2006 State of the Union address. Both have been promoted and defended by powerful interests that have a great deal to lose once people know the truth about the risks they are taking - not only for themselves but for generations as yet unborn. 

In the case of climate change caused by the burning of fossil fuels, widespread public attention to its dangers came in 1988, more than 25 years ago, with the testimony of NASA's Dr. James Hansen in U.S. Senate hearings conducted by Tennessee Sen. Al Gore. Hansen told reporters, "It's time to stop waffling so much and say that the evidence is pretty strong that the greenhouse effect is here." Since then we have had a number of reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a statement from the U.S. National Academies of Science along with those of the other major industrial countries, and statements by many leading scientific societies, including the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Chemical Society, the American Geophysical Union, the American Institute of Physics, the Geological Society of America, and the American Meteorological Society - all supporting the scientific consensus that earth's climate is changing, that human activities - especially the burning of fossil fuels - are largely responsible, and that if action is not taken soon to change business-as-usual emissions, the consequences will become very serious for both humans and other forms of life. 

Smoking in this country has been greatly reduced by public information and warnings, by prohibiting smoking in many public places, and by a heavy tax on tobacco products. Many economists and policymakers agree fossil fuel burning will need to be reduced rapidly (in a matter of decades) - if we are to avoid the most serious consequences - by putting an increasing price on carbon - either through a cap-and-trade system such as that used by the northeastern Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative states, including Delaware, or through a direct tax on carbon at its source. 

So after more than 25 years, why have we made so little progress in addressing the dangers of climate change? One reason is that wealthy individuals and corporations (like the Koch Brothers and Exxon-Mobil), with a lot invested in fossil fuels, have been waging a very effective public relations campaign attacking the integrity of climate scientists and denying that burning fossil fuels causes climate change. Recently environmental sociologist Dr. Robert Brulle of Drexel University published a study on the organizations and funding behind the powerful climate change the denial effort. 

Here in Delaware we have the Caesar Rodney Institute, which does everything it can to oppose efforts to reduce the burning of fossil fuels - most recently in the form of a legal challenge to DNREC's authority under RGGI to reduce Delaware's carbon emissions from power plants. Who funds it? I would like to know. Wouldn't you?

Climate change's effects are too critical to ignore

ABSTRACT

  

Standing in line at a coffee shop during the recent wave of brutally cold weather I heard someone say, "This weather sure puts a nail in the whole global warming hoax." 



LINKS

FULL TEXT

 

In the months after 9/11, Vice President Dick Cheney repeatedly invoked the principle that if there's even a 1 percent chance of a terrorist attack, we must prepare as if it were a certainty. 

Standing in line at a coffee shop during the recent wave of brutally cold weather I heard someone say, "This weather sure puts a nail in the whole global warming hoax." And I immediately thought of what became known as "the 1 percent doctrine." 

Let me connect the dots. It is tough trying to convince people like the guy I was in line with that climate change is real and the odds are very good that it is caused by human activity. Somehow, for many people on both sides, climate change has become an ideological issue. In past columns, I have cited the fact that every major national and international scientific organization has passed resolutions saying its membership believes that global warming is a reality. Over and over again, polls of recognized climate scientists show that 95 percent or more of them say the same thing. 

Yet over and over again other polls of all Americans show there has been little or no change in the percentages of those who accept or deny climate change. It seems people have made up their minds, one way or the other. 

So I don't intend in this column to try to change anyone's mind. I'll even grant that there are reputable scientists who are skeptical of or even deny aspects of climate change. Instead I'd like to argue that we should apply the Cheney doctrine to climate change. 

Can a rational human being who doesn't believe in climate change at least agree there is a remote possibility that 95 percent of climate scientists are right? Maybe a 1 percent chance? 

If so, shouldn't we prudently prepare "as if it were a certainty?" 

Now let me invoke another principle, this one from the world of probability analysis and statistics. In those fields, they use something called "expected value" to make decisions about allocating or not allocating limited funds based on two factors - probability and the potential payoff. 

You may think the probability of climate change being real is very low, but you would have to admit that if it is a reality, the potential payoff -the expected value - of taking action and spending money to ameliorate its effects is enormous. Said differently, even if there is only a 1 percent chance that the more alarming predictions about climate change are correct, the payoff of doing nothing could be catastrophic. 

Back to that guy in the coffee shop line. I have to admit I had to hold back telling him, buddy, I don't care how cold it is. No climate scientist has ever claimed that global warming means the end of cold weather. 

Along with a lot of media pundits and talk show hosts, he was confusing anecdotes about weather with long-term climate science. He had probably listened to one of them saying there was no Polar Vortex, that it was a hoax invented by global warming alarmists to make the cold weather conform to their theories. 

Huh? Even a cursory review of the scientific literature shows that the polar vortex concept has been around for a long time. Check the August 1950 issue of the Tellus Journal of Geophysics. 

Climate change in no way suggests there won't be extremely cold weather spells in Delaware for years to come. What scientists do say is that the long-term trends, measured in decades not in days, is for an alarming increase in average temperatures over the next 50 years. 

How about this for anecdotal weather news? At the same time we were experiencing a couple of days of polar vortex weather, Australia was in the throes of an unprecedented heat wave -setting records for the hottest Australian day on record, the hottest four-day period and the hottest 14-day period. 

I don't claim that proves global warming, although it probably persuaded a lot of Australians. I do want to point out that drawing conclusions from local weather misses the big picture. Our cold spell did nothing to alleviate the inexorable rise in sea levels that are scheduled to wipe out a few Pacific islands in the next ten years. 

Not believing in global warming isn't going to stop it. And even those who persist in denying it ought to think hard about applying Dick Cheney's 1 percent doctrine. We are running out of time.

Delaware wants action on climate change and jobs

ABSTRACT

  

Collin P. O'Mara, secretary of Delaware's Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control Delawareans say President Barack Obama should do more to create jobs and confront the threat of climate change, issues that are on the minds of many in a state that has seen slow economic growth and an increasing threat from rising seas. [...]he wants a public education campaign on the consequences of "business as usual" national energy policies and reliance on fossil fuels.

"The things the president has focused on with climate change are also the things that have the potential to strengthen the economy and create new jobs." 

Collin P. O'Mara, secretary of Delaware's Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control 

Delawareans say President Barack Obama should do more to create jobs and confront the threat of climate change, issues that are on the minds of many in a state that has seen slow economic growth and an increasing threat from rising seas. 

"Do I think government as a whole has done a great job in economic recovery and jobs on main street? Absolutely not," Paul Calistro, executive director of the Wilmington community center West End Neighborhood House, said Tuesday."We can do better. I see so many people falling out of the middle class. We see so many people struggling to make ends meet." 

Thomas M. Powers, the University of Delaware's Center for Science, Ethics and Public Policy's director, had seemingly modest hopes for progress on Obama's promised climate change initiatives. 

He wants a more specific plan to move the nation away from reliance on carbon-heavy energy sources, particularly coal. And he wants a public education campaign on the consequences of "business as usual" national energy policies and reliance on fossil fuels. 

"When we have a colder than normal winter, like we're experiencing now, people assume climate change models must be wrong. That's just a matter of our own scientific ignorance," said Powers, who added that a public education push could prove "controversial." 

Obama touched on job creation and climate change in his State of the Union speech Tuesday, two issues Delaware is struggling to address. 

On the economy, Delawareans at either end of the political spectrum agree not enough is being done to promote economic growth. 

The state needs a boost to its manufacturing sector, to put those without a college degree to work, and improve its housing market to help the economy, Calistro said. 

Federal tax credits and low-cost financing that promotes manufacturing and new home purchases could go a long way toward stimulating economic progress. 

"That's where our focus should be," said Calistro, adding it's not totally up to government to invest in communities. 

"The private sector also has a responsibility," he said. "They have benefited hugely from cheap capital in the financial markets and the stock market. They need to reinvest that into the common people and create jobs." 

Ezra Temko, the Delaware organizer for Americans for Democratic Action, praised news that Obama would sign an executive order to raise the minimum hourly wage to $10.10 for new federal contract workers. That came on the same day that a committee of the Delaware House of Representatives gave support to a proposal to raise the state's minimum wage $1 to $8.25 by June 2015. 

"It's great that he's taking a step forward that's within his power to make our economy better and make lives better for low-wage workers," Temko said. 

Temko said the president should use his executive power more broadly to get around an obstructive Congress, suggesting he take action to slow deportation while Congress continues to avoid legislation to comprehensively remake immigration policy. 

Sher Valenzuela, an owner of the Milford manufacturer First State Manufacturing, a federal contractor, panned Obama's minimum wage plan, saying it's another example of government meddling in a way that is detrimental to economic growth. 

"We pay above average wages because we want to retain good people," said Valenzuela, a former Republican candidate for lieutenant governor. "But only 17 years ago we were in a garage starting out our business and the first people we employed we paid minimum wage. These kinds of artificial adjustments to free enterprise do not help customers, do not help stimulate the economy." 

Obama should focus instead on improving an education system that does too little to prepare students to work, and on reducing government regulations that prevent business investment, she said. 

"We've got regulatory and permitting issues that are coming down from the national level on the local level that are overly burdensome," Valenzuela said. 

Anything Obama is likely to propose on climate change will be controversial, and expectations from Delawareans closely watching for initiatives were not high. 

Obama broadly declared his intent to require cuts in emissions of heat-trapping pollutants in last year's State of the Union address, with or without Congressional support. The proposed "climate action plan" has focused heavily on power plant emissions standards, with draft regulations for existing plants unlikely before June and questions rising over the administration's move to regulate existing plants ahead of new. 

"One of the things that I think, unfortunately, we have to hear is a highlighting of the authority that he has to act without Congress," said Brenna Goggin, environmental advocate for the Delaware Nature Society. It's not clear what his plans are to go forward using executive authority in the absence of Congressional approvals, Goggin said. 

Keeping the issue at the top of Obama's agenda are increasingly sober warnings of global disruptions, and potential catastrophe, if fossil-fuel burning and emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases continue at current levels. 

The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is finalizing its 5th assessment of the threat, with draft versions warning that global temperatures are likely to rise by 3.8 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100 even with prompt global action. Temperatures have an even chance of jumping by more than 7 degrees, the IPCC concluded, if emissions growth continues unchecked. 

The toll for exceeding even the lower temperature rise could become increasingly apparent after 2050. Predicted consequences include increases in severe droughts, heat waves, storms, and extreme weather, as well as rising seas, acidification of oceans, disruptions in food production and a widening range for some diseases. 

Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control Secretary Collin P. O'Mara said the administration's power plant initiatives are important, as are market-based control efforts similar to the cap-and-trade type Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative for power plants that already includes Delaware. 

"The things the president has focused on with climate change are also the things that have the potential to strengthen the economy and create new jobs," O'Mara said. "We're hopeful that there will be a big focus on efficiency and continuing to invest in reducing energy consumption. Because we know that's one of the best ways to put the construction trades to work."

Politicians just want to tax and regulate

ABSTRACT

  

The United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has admitted its catastrophic temperature forecasts have been greatly overstated. 



LINKS

FULL TEXT

 

"The heat is on for climate action," said a Jan. 25 headline. It's only because President Barack Obama and the liberal politicians want to tax and regulate U.S citizens. European nations' and Australia's politicians have backed off carbon reduction programs because their citizens have had it with the self-inflicted damage that results. China, the world's biggest producer of CO2 from fossil fuels, isn't restricting carbon use. Nor is India,which should soon overtake the U.S. for second place. They want to create jobs for their citizens. 

Wanting to impose higher fuel prices and reduce our global competitiveness is just plain insane. Global temperatures have not risen for more than 16 years, despite a steady increase in atmospheric CO2. How can that be? "Warmer" scientists say the heat is now being transported to the deep ocean. If you buy that one, next they'll offer to sell you beachfront property in Arizona. They want us to believe that Mother Nature woke up one day saying, "I think I will quit warming the globe for a while and send the heat to the deep ocean." 

The United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has admitted its catastrophic temperature forecasts have been greatly overstated. Knowing that the predictions of doom are not real, why would Obama and the liberals want "climate action?"

Climate change reality is a certifiable given 

Publication info: The News Journal ; Wilmington, Del. [Wilmington, Del]08 Feb 2014.

ProQuest document link 



 





ABSTRACT

  

U.S. Sen. John McCain agreed in 2007 when he said, "The world is already feeling the powerful effects of global warming, and far more dire consequences are predicted if we let the growing deluge of greenhouse gas emissions continue, and wreak havoc with God's creation."

FULL TEXT

 

A recent letter writer cited the United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to support his assertion that climate change doom predictions are not real. It's encouraging to see the writer knows of the IPCC and respects its authority. I hope he carefully reads the entire 2013 "Summary for Policy Makers." This most recent report clearly sets out the scientific consensus regarding climate change. It states "warming of the climate system is unequivocal and, since the 1950s, many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia." It further explains "it is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century." 

Former President George W. Bush understood this problem in 2001 when he stated, "By increasing conservation and energy efficiency and aggressively using these clean energy technologies, we can reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by significant amounts in the coming years. We can make great progress in reducing emissions, and we will." U.S. Sen. John McCain agreed in 2007 when he said, "The world is already feeling the powerful effects of global warming, and far more dire consequences are predicted if we let the growing deluge of greenhouse gas emissions continue, and wreak havoc with God's creation." 

The DuPont company states on its website: "We believe the global scientific understanding of climate change is sufficient to compel prompt, effective actions to limit emissions of greenhouse gases." What to do to avoid adverse climate change is a fair subject for debate. The reality of climate change is not.

Kerry lashes out at climate change deniers

ABSTRACT

  

Beijing and Washington launched a climate change discussion last year, promising progress in five areas: reducing vehicle emissions; advanced electric power grids; capturing and storing carbon emissions; gathering greenhouse gas data; and building efficiency.\n

"We simply don't have time to let a few loud interest groups hijack the climate conversation." 

John Kerry, U.S. Secretary of State 

JAKARTA, Indonesia -- U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Sunday called climate change perhaps the world's "most fearsome" destructive weapon and mocked those who deny its existence or question its causes, comparing them to people who insist the Earth is flat. 

In a speech to Indonesian students, civic leaders and government officials, Kerry tore into climate change skeptics. He accused them of using shoddy science and scientists to delay steps needed to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases at the risk of imperiling the planet. 

A day earlier, the U.S. and China announced an agreement to cooperate more closely on combating climate change. 

American officials hope that will help encourage others, including developing countries like Indonesia and India, to follow suit. 

China and the United States are the biggest sources of emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases that cause the atmosphere to trap solar heat and alter the climate. Scientists say such changes are leading to drought, wildfires, rising sea levels, melting polar ice, plant and animal extinctions and other extreme conditions. 

Also in the Jakarta speech, Kerry said everyone and every country must take responsibility for the problem and act immediately. 

"We simply don't have time to let a few loud interest groups hijack the climate conversation," he said, referring to what he called "big companies" that "don't want to change and spend a lot of money" to act to reduce the risks. 

Kerry later singled out major oil and coal concerns as the primary offenders. 

"We should not allow a tiny minority of shoddy scientists and science and extreme ideologues to compete with scientific facts," Kerry told the audience at a U.S. Embassy-run American Center in a shopping mall. 

"Nor should we allow any room for those who think that the costs associated with doing the right thing outweigh the benefits." 

"The science is unequivocal, and those who refuse to believe it are simply burying their heads in the sand," Kerry said. "We don't have time for a meeting anywhere of the Flat Earth Society," 

Kerry said the cost of inaction will far outweigh the significant expense of reducing greenhouse gas emissions that trap solar heat in the atmosphere and contribute to the Earth's rising temperatures. 

He outlined a litany of recent weather disasters, particularly flooding and typhoons in Asia, and their impact on commerce, agriculture, fishing and daily living conditions for billions of people. 

"This city, this country, this region, is really on the front lines of climate change," Kerry said. "It's not an exaggeration to say that your entire way of life here is at risk." 

He added: "In a sense, climate change can now be considered the world's largest weapon of mass destruction, perhaps even, the world's most fearsome weapon of mass destruction." 

The solution, Kerry said, is a new global energy policy that shifts reliance from fossil fuels to cleaner technologies. He noted the President Barack Obama is championing such a shift and encouraged others to appeal to their leaders to join. 

The U.S.-China statement issued just after Kerry left Beijing on Saturday said the two countries agreed on steps to carry out commitments to curb greenhouse gases, including reducing vehicle emissions, improving energy efficiency of buildings and other measures. 

Beijing and Washington launched a climate change discussion last year, promising progress in five areas: reducing vehicle emissions; advanced electric power grids; capturing and storing carbon emissions; gathering greenhouse gas data; and building efficiency. 

Kerry was in Indonesia on the last leg of a three-nation tour of Asia that started in South Korea. After leaving Indonesia on Monday, he planned to visit Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates. 

Before the climate change speech, Kerry toured Jakarta's Istiqlal Mosque, one of the largest in the world, to pay his respects to Indonesia's Muslim majority population. 

"We simply don't have time to let a few loud interest groups hijack the climate conversation."

Some countries foolishly holding back truth on climate change 

Publication info: The News Journal ; Wilmington, Del. [Wilmington, Del]19 Apr 2014: 7.

ProQuest document link 



 





ABSTRACT

  

President Obama's push for tougher automobile fuel economy standards is helping, but the decrease is largely due to two factors beyond government's control: the Great Recession, followed by an unusually slow recovery; and a shift by power plants and other industries from coal to natural gas, which emits less carbon when burned - and which is cheap and abundant because of the drilling technique known as fracking.

FULL TEXT

 

The world's predicament on climate change reminds me of an old saying: "The hurrier I go, the behinder I get." 

Despite mounting evidence that global warming is an urgent crisis, emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases grew faster between 2000 and 2010 than over the previous three decades, according to an authoritative new report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. 

Some governments have instituted policies to try to hold down emissions of carbon dioxide - by far the biggest contributor to climate change - but these measures do not go nearly far enough. We're doing a Michael Jackson moonwalk, appearing to move ahead while actually sliding backward - toward what scientists fear is an abyss. 

Between 1970 and 2000, according to the new report, worldwide greenhouse gas emissions rose at an average rate of 1.3 percent a year. But between 2000 and 2010 - a period when no one could claim ignorance of the problem - emissions rose at 2.2 percent annually. 

Given the fossil fuels we have already burned - the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has been increased by an incredible 40 percent since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution - some further warming is inevitable. Most climate scientists believe humankind can avoid calamity if we limit the temperature rise to about 4 degrees by 2100. But at present, according to the new report, we are on track for an increase of up to 8 degrees. 

Wave bye-bye to low-lying island nations and coastal cities. Say so long to what we think of as "normal" weather patterns and growing seasons. Get ready to welcome tropical pathogens as they migrate into formerly temperate zones. 

"There is a clear message from science," said Ottmar Edenhofer, a German climatologist who is co-chair of the working group that produced the new report. "To avoid dangerous interference with the climate system, we need to move away from business as usual." 

And there you have the problem. 

As Edenhofer noted in a statement released with the report, climate change is a problem affecting the "global commons." But for leaders around the world, "business as usual" means acting in national self-interest. 

Someday, perhaps, the effects of climate change will be so overwhelming that governments see the need for shared sacrifice. It's time to acknowledge, however, that we're not there yet. 

In Germany, for example, Chancellor Angela Merkel has an ambitious plan to fill more than 40 percent of the nation's energy needs from renewable sources, such as solar and wind, by 2025. But Merkel has had to temper her policies because of the fear that industries would migrate to countries where energy produced from fossil fuels is less expensive. Indeed, BMW recently announced a new $1 billion investment that will make its South Carolina plant the carmaker's biggest factory in the world. 

The United States has reduced its carbon emissions by roughly 10 percent since 2005. President Obama's push for tougher automobile fuel economy standards is helping, but the decrease is largely due to two factors beyond government's control: the Great Recession, followed by an unusually slow recovery; and a shift by power plants and other industries from coal to natural gas, which emits less carbon when burned - and which is cheap and abundant because of the drilling technique known as fracking. 

Other countries where fracking can reach previously inaccessible deposits of gas and oil will surely follow suit. To the extent that global industry shifts from coal to gas, the planet will benefit. But burning natural gas, too, sends heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere - just not as much as other sources. 

And in any event, progress here and in Europe to limit greenhouse gases is overwhelmed by the increase in emissions by rapidly industrializing countries. China is the world's biggest carbon emitter by far, and if officials continue to fuel the Chinese economy by burning coal, incremental progress by the rest of the world hardly matters. 

Ironically, the choking smog that darkens the skies over Beijing, Shanghai and China's other big cities may be the world's best hope. 

In a generation, hundreds of millions of people have left rural poverty in China for jobs in the big cities. These migrants quickly develop middle-class expectations of a healthy environment in which to raise their children. Popular anger over pollution is so widespread, and so deep, that I believe the government will have to respond. 

If China's autocratic leaders come to see renewable energy as being in their national - and personal - self-interest, the world has a chance.

ABSTRACT

  

The panel's findings are "yet another wake-up call to the global community that we must act together swiftly and aggressively in order to stem climate change and avoid its worst impacts," said John Holdren, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.

FULL TEXT

 

Warning of "irreversible and dangerous impacts," some of the world's top scientists on Sunday released the most comprehensive assessment yet of climate change. 

The newest finding in the stark United Nations report is the level of certainty -- 95% -- that humans and greenhouse gas emissions are largely to blame. 

"The atmosphere and ocean have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, and sea level has risen," says the report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. 

The panel includes hundreds of scientists from 80 countries meeting in Copenhagen for its final report. The assessment comes as the Earth is headed toward its hottest year ever recorded, along with its highest level of atmospheric carbon dioxide in at least 800,000 years. 

The report will be a key document used at the Paris climate summit next year, when world leaders try to broker their first major deal on emissions in decades. 

The panel's findings are "yet another wake-up call to the global community that we must act together swiftly and aggressively in order to stem climate change and avoid its worst impacts," said John Holdren, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. 

Secretary of State John Kerry agreed and put it more bluntly: "Those who choose to ignore or dispute the science so clearly laid out in this report do so at great risk for all of us and for our kids and grandkids." 

A NASA website, Global Climate Change, says 97% of climate scientists agree that warming trends over the past century are very likely due to human activities. 

The public is a bit more skeptical. A year-old survey by Pew Research showed 67% of Americans believed global warming is occurring, and 44% said the Earth is warming mostly because of human activity.

ExxonMobil investigated for climate change statements 

McCoy, Kevin . The News Journal ; Wilmington, Del. [Wilmington, Del]06 Nov 2015: 4.

ProQuest document link 



 





ABSTRACT

  

The broad investigation by Schneiderman's office focuses on whether ExxonMobil made timely and accurate disclosures about how its climate-change research, the impact of long-term environmental shifts and any movement away from usage of fossil fuels could have on the company's financial fortunes.

ExxonMobil is under investigation by New York's top law enforcement officer about whether it lied to investors and the public about the risks and financial impact of climate change. 

New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman subpoenaed the firm Wednesday, seeking financial records, statements and other climate-change-related material dating to 1977, according to a government official with direct knowledge of the matter. The official discussed the issue on condition of anonymity because the subpoena and other details of the investigation remain secret. 

"Exxon Mobil has included information about the business risk of climate change for many years in our 10-K, Corporate Citizenship Report and in other reports to shareholders," ExxonMobil said in response to questions about the subpoena. 

The company's 10-K annual report for the 2014 fiscal year stated many countries are considering regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions "due to concern over the risk of climate change." 

"These requirements could make our products more expensive, lengthen project implementation times and reduce demand for hydrocarbons, as well as shift hydrocarbon demand toward relatively lower-carbon sources such as natural gas" it warned, adding that new rules "may also increase our compliance costs." 

The broad investigation by Schneiderman's office focuses on whether ExxonMobil made timely and accurate disclosures about how its climate-change research, the impact of long-term environmental shifts and any movement away from usage of fossil fuels could have on the company's financial fortunes. 

New York's Martin Act gives the state's attorney general broad authority to investigate suspected financial wrongdoing and how it could affect investors. 

Material sought by the subpoena includes research reports showing potential causes of climate change and documents detailing how the company made business decisions and financial projections based on environmental projections, according to the official. Additionally, the subpoena seeks information about ExxonMobil's funding of organizations involved in climate-change research, including those that challenged climate science findings. Schneiderman's office also sought the firm's disclosures in Securities and Exchange Commission filings and other statements to investors. 

Investigators plan to examine whether ExxonMobil's internal research and findings square with what the company told investors and the public. 

The energy giant is the second major company under investigation by Schneiderman over climate-change statements. Peabody Energy the world's largest private-sector coal producer, turned over documents in response to a 2013 request, and disclosed the issue the following year, the official said. 

"Peabody continues to work with the New York Attorney General's office regarding our disclosures, which have evolved over the years," spokesman Vic Svecsaid in a statement the firm issued Thursday.

ABSTRACT

  

State officials still have work to do in implementation of two of their key planning documents that address sea level rise and a state framework to address climate change impacts by state agencies, the report found. 



LINKS

FULL TEXT

 

During a recent coastal storm, some folks in Oak Orchard near Millsboro were stuck in their homes for four straight days. The streets were impassable because of high water. 

Del 1. along the coast was flooded, too, forcing people to travel 40 miles inland and then backtrack 10 miles between Bethany and Dewey beaches. 

Delaware, it turns out, has done a good job planning and predicting when these low-lying places will flood, according "States at Risk: America's Preparedness Report Card" issued by Wednesday by the groups Climate Central and ICF International. 

State officials still have work to do in implementation of two of their key planning documents that address sea level rise and a state framework to address climate change impacts by state agencies, the report found. In addition, they have more work to address impacts from extreme heat days. 

The report praised state efforts to plan for climate risks, especially coastal flooding. The state received a B-plus on the report card, which considered flood, heat and other threats and looked at how well communities are prepared. 

Susan E. Love, climate and sustainability section lead in the state division of Energy and Climate, said that it was good to be recognized for the planning efforts. 

But, she said, "We haven't put together a specific implementation plan" for the 55 recommendation in the state's Sea Level Rise Adaptation Plan or the 166 action items in a climate framework that outlines key issues facing state agencies. 

Still, Love said, "It is nice to have verification that we are moving in the right direction." 

Meanwhile, she said, state agencies are working to incorporate the framework recommendations into projects and plans. 

"We have made a lot of progress," she said. 

The findings were released as the National Climatic Data Center issued global temperature data for October and reported that combined average temperature over both land and sea surfaces was the highest recorded for an October in 136 years of record-keeping. October was the sixth consecutive month when global land and sea surface temperatures broke global temperature records. 

A strong El Nino in the equatorial Pacific is expected to continue impacting climate and weather globally. The national long-range forecast for winter suggests slightly warmer temperatures and slightly higher precipitation in the Mid-Atlantic. New England is expected to be warmer than normal. 

In the United States, October was also a warmer than normal month nationally but in Delaware and neighboring states, both temperature and rainfall were about average for the month. 

One of the big weather events in October in Delaware was a coastal storm that brought heavy rain, beach erosion and flooding to coastal areas. 

The States at Risk report found that Delaware faces three key threats from climate change: more extreme heat days -- which are expected to more that quadruple and rise from 15 to more that 50 by 2050; more inland flooding and increased coastal flooding. 

The report found "a greater proportion of Delaware's area is at risk of coastal flooding than any state except Florida and Louisiana. Approximately 5.4 percent, or 100 square miles, of Delaware's land is currently within the 100-year coastal floodplain; by 2050, this is projected to increase to 7.1 percent or 130 square miles" as sea level rises. 

The report found that Alaska, California, Massachusetts, Maryland, New York and Pennsylvania where the only states that has assessed future climate vulnerabilities and designed and implemented plans to deal with them.

Website to focus on Arctic climate change

ABSTRACT

  

In March 2014, she told me that her second site would be Arctic Deeply, focusing on the melting polar ice caps and set to debut that summer. Providing that original content will be Managing Editor Hannah Hoag, who has written about climate change for a variety of publications for more than a decade.

I guess Lara Setrakian was serious. 

Setrakian is the poet laureate of the deeply immersive, single-topic website perhaps best illustrated by her acclaimed Syria Deeply, which she launched three years ago. In March 2014, she told me that her second site would be Arctic Deeply, focusing on the melting polar ice caps and set to debut that summer. 

Then the Ebola crisis erupted, followed by the California drought, and they became the topics for Deeplies No. 2 and No. 3. 

Now, at last, Arctic Deeply will debut Dec. 8, and Setrakian says she is "extremely excited." The venture is a partnership with the Centre for International Governance Innovation, a Canadian think-tank. 

"The Arctic has been a huge priority for us for quite a while," says Setrakian, a former correspondent for ABC News and Bloomberg TV. 

The timing seems right: The United States chairs the Arctic Council, and the temperature in the Arctic is rising at twice the rate as in the rest of the world. 

The Deeplies are designed to address an all-too-familiar phenomenon in the news business. When a story explodes, there is saturation coverage. Then something else explodes, and the parade moves on, and the aftermath of Explosion No. 1 is too often ignored. That's what inspired Setrakian, a former Middle East correspondent, to create Syria Deeply, which was widely applauded from the start. 

On its first day, Fast Company proclaimed, "SYRIA DEEPLY OUTSMARTS THE NEWS, REDEFINES CONFLICT COVERAGE." 

Setrakian says there are many other subjects that have a "Syria problem." 

Setrakian looks for topics that are "generally underreported and extremely consequential for our time." 

Setrakian says the episodic approach "is how our industry is built. You can't cover everything at the same time." That said, "there are people who want to know what happens on Day Four. We're here to fill in the gaps." 

Arctic Deeply will follow the model of its three predecessors. It will offer a mix of original content, links to top-flight coverage from other news outlets, news summaries, maps, op-eds, backgrounders, timelines, data visualization, you name it. All on the Arctic. 

Providing that original content will be Managing Editor Hannah Hoag, who has written about climate change for a variety of publications for more than a decade. Setrakian describes Hoag's role as "hyperactive beat reporter." 

For Hoag, the mission is personal. 

She has visited the Arctic, and she has witnessed the impact of climate change on the population, the rising sea levels and "villages falling into the ocean." 

"I've seen the changes firsthand," Hoag says. 

Though she will be based in Toronto, Hoag plans to make frequent trips to the Arctic. 

Hoag says she was attracted to Arctic Deeply because "it checked a lot of boxes for me." 

She sees the new gig as an opportunity to take her climate change reporting to a, yes, deeper level. 

"I want to talk to the people affected by climate change," Hoag says. "It's a chance to focus on a niche issue that's really important now and in the future." 

Setrakian says that, three years in, she's more convinced than ever that her approach works. "We have fantastic engagement metrics," she says. "There has been a lot of validation of the single-topic model." 

Though News Deeply has gotten some grants, it supports itself in part by building platforms for other companies. 

It has eight full-time employees devoted to all of the sites, including copy editors and digital staffers, and eight for specific projects. 

Though traffic spikes at times of crisis, Setrakian says, the sites maintain a devoted cadre of regular visitors. "For the diehards, there is a home," she says. 

Should we look for more Deeplies in the future? 

Setrakian says, "Refugees Deeply is definitely on the agenda."

5 things to know about the Paris Climate talks 

Kim Hjelmgaard . The News Journal ; Wilmington, Del. [Wilmington, Del]28 Nov 2015: B.2.

ProQuest document link 



 





ABSTRACT

  

Over the past 20 years, weather-related disasters led to 606,000 deaths (30,000 per year) and 4.1. billion injuries, the U.N.'s officer for disaster risk reduction calculates. [...]some 90% of major disasters have been caused by 6,457 floods, storms, heatwaves, droughts and other extreme weather events at an annual cost of $250 billion to $300 billion, the U.N. estimates. 5WILL THERE BE A DEAL? 



LINKS

FULL TEXT

 

High-level negotiations on an international agreement to fight global warming open outside Paris in Le Bourget on Monday and are scheduled to conclude Dec. 11. 

The event is formally known as the 21st Conference 

of the Parties (COP21) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC). 

CLIMATE CHANGE SUMMIT 

Here's what you need to know: 

1WHAT'S AT STAKE? 

Nothing less than the future of our planet. The participants hope to produce a legally binding plan to keep global temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) from pre-industrial levels. Without this minimum step, the planet will face worsening droughts, storms and floods, according to a consensus among climate scientists. 

2WHO'S GOING TO BE THERE? 

Representatives from 196 nations, including dozens of world leaders such as President Obama and China's President Xi Jinping (whose two countries are the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases blamed for the warming trend). Thousands of delegates, politicians, business leaders, scientists, environmental activists and journalists will be at the summit. Public climate change demonstrations in Paris and in cities around France have been called off in the wake of the terrorist attacks in the French capital two weeks ago. 

3WHAT IS SPECIFICALLY BEING DISCUSSED? 

The conference will review the reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases (carbon, methane) that each country has pledged to achieve by 2020. The United States and China, which emit these gases from burning coal, oil and gas, have promised to shift their industries to green, low-carbon fuels. In 2009, climate talks in Copenhagen stalled over disagreements between developed and developing countries over how the burden of cuts should be distributed. 

4HOW DOES ALL THIS AFFECT ME? 

The human cost of climate change is considerable. Over the past 20 years, weather-related disasters led to 606,000 deaths (30,000 per year) and 4.1. billion injuries, the U.N.'s officer for disaster risk reduction calculates. Moreover, some 90% of major disasters have been caused by 6,457 floods, storms, heatwaves, droughts and other extreme weather events at an annual cost of $250 billion to $300 billion, the U.N. estimates. 

5WILL THERE BE A DEAL? 

It's looking like a definite maybe. Experts have expressed optimism that enough preparation has been done in advance of the talks to make a binding action plan possible. Of the 196 countries participating, 178 have submitted so-called Intended Nationally Determined Contributions, or INDCs -- essentially public pledges that illustrate how much they will reduce emissions and what form that would take.

Obama says climate change is a threat military can't fix

ABSTRACT

  

Donald Trump, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, called one of the president's comments "one of the dumbest statements I've ever heard in politics." 



LINKS

FULL TEXT

 

"The only people who are still disputing (climate change) are either some Republicans in Congress or folks on the campaign trail." 

President Obama 

President Obama is sticking with his view climate change is a global threat on the order of terrorism, in part because groups such as the Islamic State will be defeated in traditional ways. 

"But if you start seeing the oceans rise by 5, 6, 7 feet" and if weather patterns change to where "bread baskets to the world suddenly can no longer grow food, then you're seeing the kind of crisis that we can't deal with through the deployment of the Marines," Obama said in an interview on CBS This Morning. 

"We can't deal with it through pouring money at it," Obama added. 

As for terrorism, Obama -- who is seeking a global climate change agreement -- said "we're gonna get" the Islamic State. 

"They will be defeated," Obama said. "There will be ongoing efforts to disrupt the world order from terrorists, from rogue states, from cyber attacks. There's always some bad people out there trying to do bad things. And we have to be vigilant in going after them." 

Obama's critics have mocked his efforts to equate climate change and terrorism. Donald Trump, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, called one of the president's comments "one of the dumbest statements I've ever heard in politics." 

Asked about Trump's criticism, Obama said: "Mr. Trump should run back a tape or quote on some of the stuff he's said." 

Said Obama: Nearly all of the world's scientists and most of its political parties see climate change as "a really urgent problem." 

"The only people who are still disputing (climate change) are either some Republicans in Congress or folks on the campaign trail."

As world leaders wrap up historic climate negotiations in Paris this week, many of us eagerly await its results to determine whether the international community is prepared to meet the challenge of climate change head on. Still, regardless of the outcome of the negotiations, the conference serves as a valuable opportunity to reexamine our own efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and develop new clean energy sources, recognizing that we are all impacted by the challenges of climate change and all have a responsibility to focus on solutions. 

As the lowest-lying state in the U.S., Delaware is particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Rising temperatures and more extreme weather caused by a warming climate harm our tourism and agriculture industries, as well as delicate ecosystems. Furthermore, with more than 380 miles of exposed shoreline statewide, rising sea levels threaten the health and safety of Delawareans. 

The good news is our state has shown a strong commitment to addressing the causes and responding to the consequences of climate change. Transforming our power plants to operate more cleanly helped us reduce greenhouse gas emissions more than any other state. We've also implemented more than $100 million in energy efficiency projects to reduce energy consumption in state buildings. 

In addition to making our existing energy consumption cleaner and more efficient, Delaware is also focused on developing new clean energy solutions. We've increased our solar-generating capacity by over 6,000 percent, including 1,600 solar energy systems installed on government buildings, businesses, schools, and homes. 

As leaders around the world seek climate solutions on a global scale, it's imperative to recognize achieving these public goals is possible only in partnership with the private sector. 

Consider Allen Harim Foods, which recently broke ground on a 1.57-megawatt solar array near a poultry processing plant in Harbeson. The new facility is expected to supply about 11 percent of the energy used by the plant and save the company 16 percent in energy costs during its first year of operation. 

Other examples include Newark's Bloom Energy, which makes solid oxide fuel cells, or Baltimore Aircoil in Milford, which builds high-efficiency cooling systems. New Castle's White Optics manufactures more efficient lighting materials, and energy storage manufacturer Johnson Controls employs hundreds in Middletown. These businesses prove it is possible to create jobs and spur economic growth while reducing dirty emissions. 

Still, Delaware has much more to do, whether it's finding more ways to increase our use of alternative fuels and cleaner energy sources, developing new energy efficient technologies, or supporting public transportation to cut vehicle emissions. 

The "Climate Framework for Delaware" focuses on three goals: mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, adapting to a changing climate, and avoiding current and future flood risk by building on our investments from dikes in New Castle to beach preservation projects throughout eastern Sussex. 

Congress must also do its part to help states transition to a clean energy economy. That means increasing incentives for companies to develop new technologies and doubling down on federal investments in R&D to encourage the creation and commercialization of new materials and processes that are less harmful to the environment. 

In addition, federal lawmakers must reinforce the Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Power Plan, which aims to reduce dirty emissions from power plants by 30 percent nationwide by providing states flexibility to design local programs, much as we have done with Delaware power plants. 

The plan also encourages partnerships like the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, through which Delaware and our neighbors have invested nearly a billion dollars in energy efficiency and market-based clean energy efforts that reduced emissions regionally by more than 40 percent since 2005. 

The Paris conference marks the first international climate gathering that includes greenhouse gas emission reduction commitments from developing nations, including high emitters like China, India, and Brazil. Delaware, U.S., and world leaders have the opportunity to recognize the full extent of climate change as not only an environmental necessity, but also as an economic and moral imperative.

ABSTRACT

  

After he attended the Paris climate change summit, Arnold Schwarzenegger very publicly said last week that if people want to save the planet they should "eat less meat." Protecting the planet, the oceans, Delaware coastal tourist towns and Delaware's economy can all start at the grocery store, and everyone can help by choosing less animal products when they shop.

It was great to see Rep. Carney discussing the impact of climate change on Delaware, in the local Delaware papers. Climate change is a real and dangerous threat, not just to Delaware, but to the entire planet. Not only will the sea levels rise, but changes to the climate will have a devastating and widespread impact. 

The delicate reefs and shellfish of the ocean are already being destroyed from the changes. Even just a small change in ocean temperature can have a devastating impact on the coral reefs. A prime example of this is the Great Barrier Reef, which has seen drastic coral destruction over time from the '60s until now. Due to milder winters and extensive droughts, trees are weaker and more prone to tree-killing insect infestation. These insects typically would not be around in normally cold winter months. 

These are just a few of the devastating effects of climate change, and it's great to see Rep. Carney working in Congress to pass legislation to encourage alternatives to fossil fuels and other energy resources, however, there is something everyone can do right now on their own to help curb climate change; reduce or eliminate our consumption of meat. After he attended the Paris climate change summit, Arnold Schwarzenegger very publicly said last week that if people want to save the planet they should "eat less meat." 

Animal agriculture is the leading cause of all greenhouse gas emissions. Various studies and research have shown that animal agriculture contributes more to greenhouse gases than all transportation methods combined. The methane produced by livestock has over an 80 percent more warming potential than CO2. 

Cutting out or eliminating meat is crucial to the survival of the planet. Today it's easier than ever to do so. There are companies out there that are consistently releasing delicious, amazing plant-based foods. There are alternatives and replacements for just about everything nowadays, or you can just keep it simple with fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts, legumes and seeds. A national movement called "meatless Monday" has spread to schools, colleges and some businesses. All three counties in Delaware have plant-based organizations (VegRehoboth, VegDover and VegWilmington) that are available to people who may wish to look into a plant-based diet. Protecting the planet, the oceans, Delaware coastal tourist towns and Delaware's economy can all start at the grocery store, and everyone can help by choosing less animal products when they shop.

Financial collapse 

What happened in Italy? Apparently an Italian citizen committed suicide after an insolvent bank expropriated all his savings. A couple of years ago I wrote to the editors of this paper that this could happen in the United States. This is the "Cyprus-style" confiscation of the bank accounts of ordinary people authorized by Dodd-Frank. It can happen here. We are currently experiencing a collapse of the junk bond segment of the market. Many experts have been warning for a long time that a collapse of the financial system worse than 2008 is a probability. This newspaper has a moral obligation to report this news to the public. And this can explain the undeclared war against Russia that we are waging in the Middle East and northern Africa as we plot and encourage so-called revolutions and regime change, and send planes to Syria where we face the possibility of a mistake with a Russian plane that could trigger World War III. 

Shall we choose life, or death?

Dow/DuPont merger concerns 

I am retired from the DuPont Co. Like all of my friends, I am deeply concerned about the impact of the Dow/Dupont merger on employees, retirees and the communities where DuPont facilities are located. DuPont has already announced its intention to layoff several thousand employees. 

For well over a hundred years we have had laws requiring that mergers must not result in restraint of trade or stifle competition. Mergers such as Dow/DuPont will be subject to FTC and Justice Department review to ensure compliance with those laws. 

I believe we are at a time when mergers should also be subject to a social responsibility review, which would include impact on communities, employees and retirees and what steps would be taken to minimize adverse impact. 

I've never heard of any such legislation being proposed. I know it's too late to impact the Dow/DuPont merger, but I really do think this makes a lot of sense and is something long overdue in a civilized society.

Raise fines for cellphone use 

This sums up what is wrong with Delawares. There should be no texting and cellphone use while driving. Any accident, especially like this one in Bear, should be treated same as a DUI. The fines for texting and driving should be a very high price. Everywhere I go every other car is using their phones. This has become a nightmare. I almost got hit head-on by someone texting. Treat it as you would a drunken driver. This is every bit as serious. Bottom line, up the ante on fines and sentencing if an accident occurs.

Climate change hurts Vietnamese farmers 

Maresca, Thomas . The News Journal ; Wilmington, Del. [Wilmington, Del]24 Apr 2016: B.4.

ProQuest document link 



 





ABSTRACT

  

"The biggest impact is the trapping of silt," said Richard Cronin, director of the Southeast Asia program at the Stimson Center, a think tank in Washington, D.C. He said the silt is needed to replenish nutrients that wash away during monsoon season in the delta and southern Cambodia, as well as to sustain the delta against rising sea levels.

can tho, vietnam -- Huynh Van Loi, 50, a farmer who spent most his life in the same small Mekong Delta district, has experienced good weather and bad, droughts and floods. But this year brought something he'd never seen. 

"The water is salty," he said. "I've been living here since my childhood but this is the first time we've had salty water. All my crops were destroyed." 

The worst drought in 90 years, rising sea levels and rampant development are causing a crisis in the Mekong Delta, known as Vietnam's rice bowl. The delta is home to 20 million people and accounts for more than half of Vietnam's rice and fruit production, 90% of its rice exports and 60% of fishery exports. 

But this year, paddy rice fields resemble parched desertscapes as farmers wait for a rainy season that is late to arrive. Small farmers such as Loi, who grows watermelons and orange trees about 40 miles from the South China Sea, have seen crop-ruining salinity intrude farther inland than ever before. 

The drought, caused by El Nino weather patterns, is hitting the entire region from Thailand to Cambodia to Vietnam's central highlands. The impact is most acute here in the Mekong Delta, where the Mekong River ends its 2,700-mile journey from the Tibetan plateau through six Asian countries. 

A United Nations report released in March about the drought estimated that 393,000 acres of rice in Vietnam was already lost, with an additional 1.2 million acres likely to be damaged. Almost 1 million people lack water for daily consumption. 

The figures are alarming but could grow worse if weather extremes become more common in years to come. 

"This year is not a special case," said Duong Van Ni, an environmental management professor at Can Tho University. "It will happen more in the future." 

Ni said the rapid agricultural development that turned postwar Vietnam from a famine-stricken country into one of the world's leading rice exporters has exacerbated the effects of climate change. 

"A long time ago, there were also typhoons, also saltwater intrusion, also drought," Ni said. "But the impact was not as severe as now, because at that time the ecosystem wasn't changed by humans. Now the system is already damaged: by canals, by dikes, by water management, by land use." 

Then there are the dams. China has built seven hydropower dams on the upper Mekong, known locally as the Lancang, and plans to add 21 more. Laos and Cambodia intend to build 11 hydropower dams on the lower Mekong, with two in Laos already under construction. 

China's existing dams already hurt the Mekong, affecting water levels, water temperature and fish migration patterns. They also trap as much as 80% of the sediment that reaches them. The sediment is needed to fertilize downstream floodplains and protect against coastal erosion. 

"The biggest impact is the trapping of silt," said Richard Cronin, director of the Southeast Asia program at the Stimson Center, a think tank in Washington, D.C. He said the silt is needed to replenish nutrients that wash away during monsoon season in the delta and southern Cambodia, as well as to sustain the delta against rising sea levels. 

Without the sediment, the low-lying delta is eroding and actually sinking. Vietnam's Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment estimated that a 1-meter rise in the sea level would submerge nearly 40% of the Mekong Delta and more than 20% of Ho Chi Minh City, a metropolis of 10 million people. 

Vietnam is introducing salt-resistant rice and increasing autumn and winter rice crop quotas to make up for this year's shortfall. The Ministry of Agriculture and Development is seeking $4.5billion from the government to build an irrigation system, and work is underway on a decades-long plan to construct sea walls and dikes along the coast. 

"I find it difficult to be optimistic," said Dan Spencer, associate professor of environmental studies at the University of Montana. "Like many poor nations, Vietnam generates very little of the climate change problem but suffers from the brunt of many of the effects." 

Ni called the problem alarming. "I wonder if the situation of the Mekong basin, especially the Mekong River, should be upgraded as a global issue, as soon as possible," he said. "It's not isolated to six countries in Asia." 

On a recent day, farmer Nguyen Tran Ngoc was digging a canal to try to irrigate some new crops: watermelon, flowers, squash, pumpkin and cabbage. He stopped growing rice because of the lack of water. He doesn't know how much longer he can make a living from farming. 

"Worry or don't worry, it's all the same," he said. "Change is coming and we can't control it."

A Trump vote defies climate change gains 

Publication info: The News Journal ; Wilmington, Del. [Wilmington, Del]20 Sep 2016: A.8.

ProQuest document link 



 





ABSTRACT

  

According to NOAA, average sea level is rising by about 1.2 inches per decade.

FULL TEXT

 

July and August were the hottest months for the planet since record keeping began. Scientists are confident that 2016 will be the hottest year. Rising sea levels have made flooding commonplace in several major U.S. cities. And meanwhile, one of our leading presidential candidates says climate change is some kind of Chinese hoax. 

Elections have consequences, and this is one of the most fateful: Anyone who takes climate change seriously had better do everything possible to keep Donald Trump out of the White House. 

Believe it or not, there are issues more important than Trump's latest offensive outburst or Hillary Clinton's score on the likability scale. Clinton accepts the scientific consensus on climate change, which is increasingly supported by what we see and feel every day. She would build upon President Barack Obama's efforts to address the issue, which include the historic Paris agreement, seen by many experts as our last best hope to prevent catastrophe. 

Trump, by contrast, is a bald-faced denier. "Obama's talking about all of this with the global warming and ... a lot of it's a hoax," he said at a December rally in South Carolina. "It's a hoax. I mean, it's a moneymaking industry, OK? It's a hoax, a lot of it." 

He tweeted in 2012 that "the concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing noncompetitive." He later said this was a joke, but during the campaign he has again said he does not believe in climate change and claimed that action to limit carbon emissions "is done for the benefit of China." 

The Paris pact represents the first time the world's two biggest emitters, China and the United States, have formally agreed to hold down the amount of heat-trapping carbon they spew into the atmosphere. Trump would renounce the agreement -- and also scrap Obama administration rules limiting emissions from coal-fired power plants. He has promised greater fossil-fuel production and scoffed at alternative energy sources such as wind power. 

Clinton recognizes the potential economic benefits of developing the technology to lead the world toward a clean-energy economy. Trump would rather let China, Germany and other nations compete for that prize. 

According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 15 of the warmest 16 years on record have come since the turn of the century. By examining air bubbles preserved for centuries in polar ice, scientists know the concentration of heat-trapping carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased by 40 percent since the Industrial Revolution, when large-scale burning of fossil fuels began. 

Global warming is affecting weather patterns worldwide. Deniers point out that it is not possible to conclusively blame any given storm or localized heat wave on climate change - and that, yes, it still gets cold in the winter. But the phenomenon is clearly visible in melting glaciers and ice caps, the opening of ice-free sea lanes through the Arctic and, most urgently, sea-level rise. The oceans are rising because warmer water occupies a greater volume than cooler water and because so much land ice is melting. According to NOAA, average sea level is rising by about 1.2 inches per decade. That may not sound like much, but it has already been enough to at least triple the amount of "nuisance" flooding that coastal cities have to cope with when onshore winds coincide with high tide. 

Last November, in Time magazine, Clinton wrote that "I won't let anyone take us backward, deny our economy the benefits of harnessing a clean energy future, or force our children to endure the catastrophe that would result from unchecked climate change." 

Neither her policies nor Trump's will reverse the climate effects we're already seeing. But it is possible, and necessary, to keep the impacts from becoming completely unmanageable. Obama leaves behind a framework for coordinated international action, more than two decades in the making, that still could fail - but that might, just might, succeed. Trump boasts that he can't wait to tear it all down. 

The choice is ours.

Trump &Co. need to realize climate change is a threat 

Publication info: The News Journal ; Wilmington, Del. [Wilmington, Del]25 Sep 2016: A.31.

ProQuest document link 



 





ABSTRACT

  

Of special and immediate concern is the stated intent of the current Republican Party platform and presidential nominee Donald Trump to promote the extraction and use of the most carbon-intensive fossil fuels, to withdraw the United States from the Paris agreement and to rescind President Barack Obama's executive actions designed to reduce climate risk. 



LINKS

FULL TEXT

 

The climate is changing in dangerous ways, and we are responsible for most of these changes. This is not a matter of conjecture or political opinion - it is the conclusion of the overwhelming majority of climate scientists, based on solid evidence that mounts each year. Rising sea levels, extreme heat, increased incidence of floods and drought, ocean acidification and expansion of tropical diseases pose an unacceptable level of risk to our descendants. So do many other climate-related threats. 

Business, scientific and technical leaders are responding to these threats by finding ways to adapt to climate change, increase our energy efficiency, and develop carbon-free energy sources. Political leaders here and abroad are creating policies that promote these advances. At the Paris climate conference in December, 195 countries adopted an historic climate agreement, whose main goal is to prevent the world's mean temperature from rising more than 2 degrees centigrade above its pre-industrial level. This agreement was the culmination of many years of efforts by governments and citizens. The negotiators of the agreement came together despite differences in forms of government, in responsibility for past emissions of greenhouse gases and in susceptibility to future climate change. 

But these efforts to reduce the risk to future generations are now being imperiled by a small yet vocal group that denies the validity of the evidence and of scientific expertise in general. Of special and immediate concern is the stated intent of the current Republican Party platform and presidential nominee Donald Trump to promote the extraction and use of the most carbon-intensive fossil fuels, to withdraw the United States from the Paris agreement and to rescind President Barack Obama's executive actions designed to reduce climate risk. We are deeply concerned about the serious long-term damage to our world that would result if the climate and energy policy goals of Trump and the Republican Party were to become our national policies, reversing decades of progress on energy, climate, clean air and clean water. These consequences would be borne by billions of current and future citizens of this planet. 

To address this concern, we - together with 373 other members of the National Academy of Sciences - have published an open letter Sept. 21 drawing attention to the serious risks of climate change. We state that "the problem of human-caused climate change is real, serious, and immediate, and that this problem poses significant risks: to our ability to thrive and build a better future, to national security, to human health and food production, and to the interconnected web of living systems." The letter also highlights the urgent need to reduce heat-trapping emissions as part of the Paris agreement. 

For the United States to withdraw now from the Paris agreement would undermine the world's ability to deal with climate change, diminish U.S. credibility internationally, and hobble U.S. economic competitiveness in developing and marketing clean energy sources. But where there is risk, there is also opportunity for creative problem solving. As the letter notes, "Nations that find innovative ways of decarbonizing energy systems and sequestering CO2 will be the economic leaders of the 21st century." 

We should not turn the clock back by regarding scientific ignorance as a virtue, or by embracing business-as-usual energy policies. It's time to unleash the renewable and limitless power of the mind, and to accelerate efforts to develop and implement clean energy sources. This is the leadership we need, and this is the only kind of leadership that will reduce the worst climate change risks to our children while presenting them with new and exciting economic opportunities. 

Kerry Emanuel and Ben Santer are climate scientists who belong to the National Academy of Sciences.

Poor water quality plagues Inland Bays

Delaware's Inland Bays have gotten better, especially in open waters, over the last five years but a growing population, impacts from climate change and continued stress from runoff pollution continue to impact water quality, according to the 2016 State of the Inland Bays Report released this week. 

One of the unexpected surprises in the report is the improvements in Little Assawoman Bay. Nitrogen and phosphorous levels at almost all sampling stations meet water quality standards there, and levels of oxygen in the water met or exceeded the standards everywhere except Dirickson Creek during summer sampling. 

The big question for the staff of the Center for the Inland Bays, the nonprofit that produces the report every five years, is what is working in the Little Assawoman that could be applied to Rehoboth and Indian River bays. 

"We have definitely seen encouraging progress in some of our environmental indicators such as inputs of nutrients from point sources and water quality improvements in Little Assawoman Bay," said Marianne Walch, the center's science coordinator. "But lack of progress in some areas, such as nonpoint nitrogen inputs and negative trends in others, such as climate change indicators, suggest the bays will have many water quality and habitat challenges ahead." 

The report used 35 environmental indicators to assess the ecological conditions in the bays. This work compared 2011 findings to changes over the last five years. 

What researchers found is that Rehoboth and Indian River bays are in better shape in the center of each waterway. The likely reason: better water exchange because of the influence of Indian River Inlet. But the tributaries continue to be nutrient-rich and have poor water quality and low oxygen levels. 

Local, state and federal officials have intensely studied the Inland Bays for more than 40 years. Over that time, thousands of septic systems have been removed from the drainage basin, state-of-the-art sewer systems have replaced them and farmers have adopted plans to control runoff from their land. 

Yet, nutrient pollution from nitrogen and phosphorous continue to be a significant problem in the watershed, and much of it likely comes from runoff from the land and from parking lots, roof tops and other impervious surfaces, according to the report. 

These nutrients cause algae growth, cloudy water and large shifts in oxygen levels. These rapid shifts can cause fish kills. 

Walsh pointed to significant population growth - the year-round population doubled in the region between 1990 and 2000 - as well as the increase in paved surfaces and significant changes in land use as significant changes in the estuary. 

Scientists believe that once impervious surface reaches 10 percent, water quality degrades. In the Inland Bays, the percentage of impervious surface is at 10.4 percent and is much higher in some urbanized areas, she said. 

Another major concern is the impact of climate change from more frequent and stronger storms to shoreline erosion and inundation, she said. 

In Dewey Beach, municipal officials are already coping with increase flooding along the streets that front Rehoboth Bay. 

"We cannot pump and pave our way out of this situation," said Mike Dunmyer, a Dewey Beach commissioner. 

"We know that we need to be more resilient (to the impacts of sea level rise)," said David Small, secretary of the state Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control. 

Finding new and innovative ways to stabilize shorelines will be a key component as the region copes with climate change, he said. 

"We know this area is going to continue to grow," he said. 

Small said Sussex County's efforts to replace septic systems with central sewer have played a major role in reducing nitrogen and phosphorous pollution and new stormwater regulations should help reduce both nutrients and sediment entering the bays and the tributaries. 

As center officials look toward possible solutions, Executive Director Chris Bason said reaching out to landowners and seeking more grant money could encourage the planting of cover crops to reduce pollution runoff from farms. 

About 8,000 acres of farmland in the watershed are planted with winter cover crops, he said. In the Maryland Coastal Bays watershed, thousands more acres are planted with cover crops that uptake excess nitrogen and phosphorous from the land. 

"We can do a lot better," he said. "The real area that we need to focus on is agriculture." 

Among the issues center scientists would like to explore next are why other estuaries like the Maryland Coastal Bays and the shallow coastal bays in New Jersey can support underwater grasses, but Delaware's do not. There are almost no eelgrass beds in Delaware's Inland Bays, but they used to be common here. 

They are also curious why water clarity, even in shallow waters near shore, is so poor during the summer. 

And they would like to know what has worked in Little Assawoman Bay to make conditions there significantly better than they were five years ago. 

"The State of the Bays reporting provides a time to ask ourselves ... how we are doing in meeting our goals to restore and protect Delaware's Inland Bays," Walch said. 

"Here we are five years later," Bason said. "How are the Inland Bays doing? It's not simple. Science never is."

"Rarely have we seen the Arctic show a clearer, stronger or more pronounced signal of persistent warming and its cascading effects on the environment than this year." 

Jeremy Mathis director of NOAA's Arctic Research Program 

In her recent piece, "It's time to chill about global warming," national columnistSusan Stamper Brown accuses global warming activists of being obsessed with polar bears; making vicious predators into our "poster child." She selectively reports contradictory observations to support her suggestion that, whether the planet is warming or cooling, it's really not our fault. We just need to trust in God, "who causes occasional warming to help his animals survive." 

In fact, she reveals a shallow interpretation of the motivations of those concerned about climate change, a distorted understanding of the science and a dismissive attitude about the magnitude of the problem and our central role in creating it. 

Do we care about polar bears? Sure we do, as one magnificent species that is representative of every creature, every ecosystem, every human being whose welfare is threatened by a warming planet. 

On the day Ms. Brown's piece was published, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration released their Arctic Report Card. Jeremy Mathis, director of NOAA's Arctic Research Program stated, "Rarely have we seen the Arctic show a clearer, stronger or more pronounced signal of persistent warming and its cascading effects on the environment than this year." 

We've heard the message repeated: There is agreement among more than 97 percent of (peer-reviewed) climate scientists that climate warming is occurring, due largely to human activity, with emissions of greenhouse gases at their highest levels in recorded history. Indeed, most of the leading scientific organizations worldwide have issued public statements endorsing this position. 

We witness the impacts, as every day the media brings new images of melting ice caps, retreating shorelines, devastating weather events, bleaching of coral reefs, species extinction, uncontrolled spread of disease. We can see it right here in Delaware. According to a recent EPA report, higher water levels are already eroding beaches, submerging lowlands, damaging farmland, worsening coastal flooding and increasing salt levels in critical estuaries and aquifers. Our growing season is being affected, as are migratory patterns of the birds and waterfowl that we take so much delight in, which attract tourists from around the world. 

Climate change activists are not just talking about the future of polar bears. We're talking about the kind of world we want to live in, the world we want to leave our children and the all too real suffering that the all too real impacts are causing now. 

The board of directors, faith leaders and members of Delaware Interfaith Power and Light believe climate change is a defining moral challenge of our times. 

One of 40 state affiliates, with 18,000 member congregations throughout the country, our shared mission is to serve as a religious response to climate change. We believe we have a moral responsibility to care for Creation, to protect those most vulnerable, to scientifically inform and spiritually deepen our understanding of our relationship with each other and the natural world. 

We do not believe that God will intervene to save us from our ill-informed and reckless mistakes. We have a long and dismal history of spoiling our nests, of desecrating this beautiful, wondrous, miraculous Creation that sustains us. And we have paid a high price in human suffering. 

The immensity of this challenge calls on all of us to be part of the solution. Our collective congregations - each in their own way, inspired by their own faith - are finding practical ways to be the change we want to see in the world. We participate in preach-ins, form Earth care teams, become learning centers, secure energy audits, upgrade energy systems, install solar panels, plant, community gardens, explore eco-systems and advocate for a safer, healthier, more equitable future for the generations to come. 

We cannot afford to live in a state of denial. Nor can our policy makers. We need a reality check for ourselves and we need to hold our leaders accountable. Then, together, we need to believe that we can pull back from the brink of our own destructiveness. It will require inquiring minds, open hearts, helping hands and a certain leap of faith to deliver this precious and all too fragile cargo, including the polar bears, to our children's children. They are counting on us. 

Lisa Locke is the Executive Director of Delaware Interfaith Power &Light.

ABSTRACT

  

Tillerson's commitment at his confirmation hearing to participate in climate negotiations only for the purpose of safeguarding American competitiveness was in keeping with a career in the senior leadership and as CEO of a company that has actively worked for decades to forestall global action to address climate change. The fossil fuel industry, of which Tillerson was a chieftain, has spent vast sums of money lobbying against climate change legislation and financing a decades-long misinformation campaign to create public confusion as to the reality of climate change and the threat it poses to humanity.

FULL TEXT

 

The first task of a newly elected president, with the advice and consent of the Senate, is to select a Cabinet. Presidents deserve latitude in choosing the team they believe will best help them carry out their vision for the country. As the old saying goes, "Elections have consequences." 

On perhaps no nomination, however, is the advice and consent of the Senate more important than that of the secretary of state. The president's authority over foreign policy is not unilateral. The Constitution vests the Senate with significant authority, requiring, for example, that the president secure the support of two-thirds of the Senate before entering into treaties with foreign powers. The founders were suspicious of partisan agendas, and the tradition in the United States is that partisanship ought to end at the water's edge. The secretary of state is the representative, not of any party, but of one nation, indivisible. 

In Rex Tillerson, Donald Trump has nominated a man who shares his transactional nature. Throughout his confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Tillerson made it clear that no higher consideration guided him as chief executive officer of ExxonMobil and no higher consideration would guide him as the nation's chief diplomat than the art of the deal. Asked if there was any country he would not have done legal business with as an oil man, based on that country's record of human rights abuses, Tillerson answered there was none. Asked about climate change, Tillerson advocated taking "a seat at the table" in negotiations, not to exercise leadership, but to ensure that whatever happens American competitiveness is not compromised. Invited repeatedly to speak out against human rights abuses on the part of dictatorial regimes around the world, Tillerson consistently refused to do so. Not only did he seem to view taking up the cause of human rights as counterproductive from the standpoint of getting the best possible deals from dictators, at times he seemed genuinely and unnervingly unmoved by the plight of victims of oppression. Responding to a question about the murder of political dissidents in Russia, Tillerson responded, "Well, people who speak up for freedom in regimes that are oppressive are often at threat, and these things happen to them." 

America at its best has been more than merely a transactional world power. President John F. Kennedy, at the height of the Cold War, committed the United States to "do our part to build a world of peace where the weak are safe and the strong are just." He expressed the optimism that throughout our history has characterized our country at its best. "Our problems," he observed, "are man-made; therefore they can be solved by man. And man can be as big as he wants. No problem of human destiny is beyond human beings." Kennedy stressed that the key to human progress was a recognition of our common humanity: "For in the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet. We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our children's future. And we are all mortal." 

It is hard to imagine a nomination for secretary of state less in keeping in the 21st century with Kennedy's vision of American leadership for the global common good than Rex Tillerson. In Kennedy's time, the manmade problem that threatened humanity with self-inflicted destruction was nuclear war. In our time, it is the destruction of the climate of our shared "small planet" through the uncontrolled burning of fossil fuels. In Kennedy's time, the solution was negotiated disarmament. In our time, it is a negotiated agreement to move to a common reliance on sustainable sources of energy. Tillerson's commitment at his confirmation hearing to participate in climate negotiations only for the purpose of safeguarding American competitiveness was in keeping with a career in the senior leadership and as CEO of a company that has actively worked for decades to forestall global action to address climate change. The fossil fuel industry, of which Tillerson was a chieftain, has spent vast sums of money lobbying against climate change legislation and financing a decades-long misinformation campaign to create public confusion as to the reality of climate change and the threat it poses to humanity. No company has been more aggressive, or irresponsible, in this regard than ExxonMobil. 

America stands for better and America can do better. The Senate should refuse to give its consent to Tillerson's nomination. It should advise Donald Trump to go back, draw from the deep well of American diplomatic talent and select a nominee who will inspire confidence in American leadership at home and abroad, amongst the persecuted as well as the powerful; a nominee who will affirm Kennedy's belief in the potential of American leadership to achieve a future better for the United States and for all humanity.

Report: Climate change can take toll on mental health 

Naqvi, Jia . The News Journal ; Wilmington, Del. [Wilmington, Del]06 Apr 2017: E.3.

ProQuest document link

FULL TEXT

Climate change is not only harmful to our physical health, it can be debilitating for our mental health as well, according to a report published Wednesday.

 

Severe weather events and natural disasters linked to climate change have the most dramatic impact on mental health, according to the report by the American Psychological Association and ecoAmerica. Natural disasters cause intense negative emotions in people who are exposed to them, primarily fear and grief. Anxiety, depression and unhealthy behavior are also common responses. Some people, particularly those who experience tragic events, such as the loss of a loved one or repeated exposure to extreme weather, develop post-traumatic stress disorder.

 

As one example of how disasters made more likely by climate change can impact mental health, the report cites statistics from people who survived Hurricane Katrina. Their rates of suicide and incidence of suicidal thoughts more than doubled; one in six people met the diagnostic criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder; and nearly half of the people living in an affected area developed an anxiety or mood disorder such as depression.

 

"I found this topic really interesting because this wasn't something I was hearing people talk about and this wasn't well acknowledged as an effect of climate change," said Susan Clayton, the lead author of the report and a professor of psychology at The College of Wooster in Ohio.

 

Some things protect people from the worst psychological effects of climate change-induced natural disasters, such as having social support. In contrast, those who live in communities where livelihood is directly tied to the environment, such as agriculture, tourism or fishing, are more vulnerable to negative mental health impacts. People in indigenous communities are particularly vulnerable because climate change can threaten environmental aspects of their cultural heritage.

 

Climate change can be a cause of stress, which is often caused by a sense of a loss of control or an inability to adapt to a new situation. Increased stress levels can increase the likelihood of problems such as substance abuse, anxiety disorders or depression, according to the report.

 

Problems exacerbated by climate change have carryover effects on a person's physical health, the economy and the community. Changes in weather patterns can affect agriculture and infrastructure, which may force some people to migrate.

 

Displacement because of natural disasters can lead to a variety of negative consequences, such as a loss of social support, strains on personal relationships, absences from work and higher medical costs, according to the report.

 

The weather people experience also influences their mental health, the report says. Prolonged exposure to warmer weather makes people more aggressive and diminishes cognitive functions, according to earlier studies.

 

The authors of the report suggest several strategies people can use to cope with or mitigate the negative mental impacts of climate change. The most important thing is to encourage social connections, Clayton said, to make people feel more secure and give them greater access to information. Preparedness is another important factor in mitigating mental health effects caused or aggravated by climate change.

 

"The fact that most of us ignore climate change paradoxically makes the effects worse because we don't really know what to expect and it seems scary and unknown," Clayton said, "but if we inform ourselves that that's what is likely to happen in our area, we would be more prepared and in control of the situation."
