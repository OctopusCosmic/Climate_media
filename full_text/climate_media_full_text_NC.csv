Editor: Is setting limits on carbon emissions necessary environmental policy? Remember air quality before Congress passed the 1970 Clean Air Act? I do.
\
Driving into the industrial Northeast along the New Jersey Turnpike in the 1960s you had to roll up the windows of your non-air-conditioned car in order not to breathe the polluted air and smell the stench that went with it.
\
After I graduated from college, I was driving around Atlanta looking for an apartment. I noticed my eyes burning and wondered what was going on, and then I realized that air pollution was causing it.
\
After I moved to North Carolina, I often traveled to the mountains to view the beautiful scenery. Today when you travel through the mountains the scenes are still beautiful, but in too many places you see the effects of acid rain. Many evergreen trees are denuded and instead of the sea of forest green, you see large areas of brown where the effects of drifting air pollutants from industries in the Ohio River Valley are clearly evident. These pollutants were carried by prevailing winds and fell to earth in rainfall on the North Carolina mountains. They caused considerable damage to our environment, until acid rain legislation was approved.
\
The improvements in our environment starting in the 1970s that resulted directly from congressional action by Democrats and Republicans on the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act, and from EPA enforcement, can be continued with similar actions today. And despite those acts, the economy still continued to grow.
\
Today, climate change is the issue. The growing impact of human-induced carbon emissions is already felt in rising temperatures and rising sea levels. In order to preserve our planet, we must act to reduce these greenhouse gas emissions. The most effective way is through cap and trade, first introduced by President George H.W. Bush.
\
Cap and trade, simply put, is setting limits on emissions of pollutants into the air by industry. Those that can meet the limits get credits that they can then sell to industries that can't meet those limits. These non-attainment industries can continue to operate by buying the credits and paying for the cost of their pollution while the cleaner industries sell some of the benefits of their clean technology. The law becomes an incentive to all industries to operate in a cleaner manner, and the result is a healthier environment for all of us, a reduction in carbon emissions and a slowing of global warming.
\
This is about more than the air you and I breathe. It's about the planet that we want to leave to our children and their children. What will that planet be like? Will it be one with a continuing rise in temperatures, disappearing flora and fauna, melting glaciers and polar ice caps, and rising sea levels? Or, will we do what's right and be able to leave a planet to our children's children at least as healthy as the one we inherited?

1,"ASHEVILLE -- In Western North Carolina, where thousands of acres of land are protected national and state forestland and outdoors activities are keys to residents' quality of life and tourist draws, U.S. Rep. Charles Taylor and challenger Patsy Keever are making their pitch on the environment.\Longtime Republican John Edwards of Cashiers said for him, the environment isn't the only issue, but it's an important one in this election.\""It's not the only thing, but it tilts the scale for me. I live in the mountains. I love the mountains. I love the trees and the wildlife,"" Edwards, a self-described environmentalist said. ""This is our great asset.""\Gibbs Knotts, assistant professor in the department of political science and public affairs at Western Carolina University, said the economy and national security remain top issues for voters.\But the environment could be a factor in WNC, he said. Taylor and Keever are vying for the region's seat in the U.S. House.\""This is a changing area, and there are a lot of people moving to this area because they want to retire here ... I can only expect these environmental concerns are going to increase in the future,"" he said.\Air quality\Earlier this year, the Environmental Protection Agency named the Great Smoky Mountains National Park a non-attainment area. That means the place where millions of people go to hike and camp isn't meeting federal air quality standards for ground-level ozone.\The harmful pollutant can aggravate asthma, which has become, according to some environmental groups, the number one cause of school absenteeism in public schools.\Taylor and Keever disagree about the best way to improve air quality in the Smokies and the region.\Taylor, a Brevard Republican, supports President Bush's Clear Skies plan. That legislation, according to Taylor, would reduce mercury as well as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide. The sulfur emissions contribute to haze and nitrogen oxide is a key ingredient in ozone.\Clear Skies uses a ""cap and trade"" system that allows power plants to obtain credits from other plants that reduce emissions below the required levels.\""Utilities would have an incentive to install emissions reduction technologies early to prepare for gradual emissions reductions over time,"" Taylor said in written responses to questions from the Citizen-Times.\Keever, a Democrat, maintains the Clear Skies would lower air quality standards. She wants to strengthen the Clean Air Act.\As a Buncombe County commissioner, Keever supported a resolution backing North Carolina's Clean Smokestacks Act, which state lawmakers passed in 2002. That legislation requires North Carolina's coal-fired power plants to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions within the next decade by more than 70 percent.\""I support strengthening the Clean Air Act by working to hold neighboring states accountable when harmful pollution crosses state lines and threatens our air and will introduce federal legislation modeled after the Clean Smokestacks Act that strengthens our air quality standards,"" Keever said in her written remarks.\North Shore Road\The two candidates also differ on the North Shore Road, a controversial proposal involving the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.\The road debate goes back six decades. A highway was promised to Swain County to replace another highway flooded by construction of Fontana Dam. Part of the road was built, but it was never finished because of environmental and financial concerns.\Families seeking better access to family cemeteries inside the park have continued to push for the road. But a number of groups have concerns about the environmental effects of building a road through a remote section of the national park.\Keever said at a recent news conference she supports a $52 million cash settlement for Swain County instead of building the road.\""I do understand that there are strong emotions surrounding the issue. I respect those individuals who want access to the gravesites inside of the park and will ensure access through other means of transportation,"" Keever said.\With some estimates putting the cost of the road in the hundreds of millions, Keever said she would press for a $52 million settlement the county could invest and use to fund schools and infrastructure.\Taylor, meanwhile, has steadfastly supported building the road.\Taylor helped get $16 million in funding for the project in 2000. The National Park Service is in the process of studying the road and alternatives, including the cash settlement.\In his comments about the road, Taylor says he remains a strong supporter of the project.\""I believe that these families should have access to their ancestral cemeteries and home sites now located inside the Great Smoky Mountains National Park,"" Taylor said. ""Such a road could accomplish this, while being combined with historically re-created homes or structures that tell the tale of the park's creation and the history of the county.""\Park Service funding\Another issue affecting the Great Smoky Mountains National Park and other parks is funding.\This year the Smokies dealt with an $800,000 budget shortfall, brought on in part by having to absorb a portion of the pay increase for federal workers approved by Congress and other budget changes.\The park also has an estimated $174 million in maintenance needs. Of that, about $117 million is needed in road projects. The maintenance backlog at the Blue Ridge Parkway is estimated at about $200 million.\Taylor is the chairman of the powerful House appropriations subcommittee that controls funding for the country's national parks and forests.\Asked about addressing the backlog of needs, Taylor said, ""First, we must stop once and for all the mindset that the federal government can continue to purchase hundreds of millions of dollars in new land acquisitions every year without taking care of the lands we already own.""\The appropriations subcommittee is working to provide $471 million for the backlog in national parks this year, according to Taylor.\Taylor said the fee demonstration program, which allows park and forest managers to charge fees should be used ""only on special use activities, and not on general recreation and enjoyment of our national forests and parks.""\Keever counters that Taylor, in his role as chairman of the appropriations subcommittee, has failed to provide parks with the funding they need.\""In order to improve conditions, our park superintendents and rangers need the funding to do their jobs,"" Keever said. ""My opponent, in his capacity as the chairman of the appropriations subcommittee that controls these funds, has failed this task.""\""I understand the impact that our parks and forests have on our tourist industry, which brings in billions of dollars each year and will work to protect these public lands to ensure the livelihood of our economy and our quality of life,"" she said.\Contact Ball at 232-5851 or JBall@CITIZEN-TIMES.com.\ON THE NET: www.keeverforcongress.comwww.taylorforcongress.com"

It's too bad that Theodore Roosevelt is not alive today to witness the grotesque policies of the Republican Party toward the environment and the sloganeering of GOP pin-up girl Sarah Palin in howling ""Drill, baby, drill!""
\
The conservationist and environmentalist Roosevelt would be comforted that he eventually ditched the greedy and corporatist Republican Party to run for president as the candidate of the progressive Bull Moose Party.
\
Once again, Republicans in Congress are attempting to open up pristine Arctic wilderness areas in Alaska, as well as Florida coastal marine areas of the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico, to the environmental destroyers of Big Oil and Gas.
\
And if Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., has his way, he will compromise with Republicans like Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and John McCain of Arizona on offshore drilling in order to see a carbon cap-and-trade bill passed. It appears that Kerry waffles on the environment as much as he does on U.S. military engagements overseas.
\
Rather than adopt a policy of steering the world's energy demands away from carbon fuels like oil and coal, the Republicans, aided and abetted by wafflers like Kerry and conservative ""Blue Dog"" Democrats, will erect offshore drilling platforms off our nation's most environmentally sensitive coasts to produce perhaps enough oil to supply the United States for a half-year at most.
\
Even if the United States drills all the remaining oil and natural gas from within its economic zone, that represents a mere 3 percent of the world's known reserves. The United States, which hoggishly drinks up one-fourth of the world's oil output, would continue to rely on oil imports from Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Nigeria, Russia and its new virtual colony, Iraq.
\
After the oil and gas supplies are depleted, America's coastlines will look like the aftermath of an invasion by Star Trek's Borg: ravaged coastlines and marine ecosystems with seascapes marred by huge corroding metallic skeletons sitting atop dry wells.
\
When people are addicted, they must be weaned away from the addictive substance. The American people, rather than be sated with a finite amount of oil and natural gas for a few months in exchange for environmental damage to our nation's coastlines, must be weaned away from their gas-guzzling SUVs and pickup trucks.
\
While small-minded propagandists harp over leaked e-mails from Britain's University of East Anglia's Climate Research Unit and suggest that the e-mails -- some from 10 years ago -- prove a global climate change conspiracy of scientists, records from NASA and the U.S. National Climate Data Center prove that rising temperatures are contributing to global glacier retreat, the disappearance of permanent Arctic sea ice and the rise of the world's oceans.
\
The supporters of unrestricted offshore oil and gas drilling want to avoid the uncomfortable, massive evidence of global environmental collapse by clinging to cheap bumper sticker slogans such as ""Drill, baby, drill!"" It's time for the Obama administration and Congress to put politics aside and stand steadfast on environmental principle like Teddy Roosevelt's Bull Moose.

4,"When you watch a baby being born, after a difficult pregnancy, it is so painful the mother it is always hard to tell the truth and say, ""Gosh, that baby is really ugly."" But that's how I feel about the energy legislation passed (and not passed) by the Senate.\The whole Senate energy effort only reinforced my feelings that we're in a green bubble - a festival of hot air by the news media, corporate America and presidential candidates about green this and green that, but, when it comes to actually doing something hard to bring about a green revolution at scale - and if you don't have scale on this you have nothing - we wimp out.\Climate change is not a hoax. The hoax is that we are really doing something about it.\No question, it's great news that the Democrat-led Senate finally stood up to the automakers, and to the Michigan senators, and said, ""No more - no more assisted suicide of the U.S. auto industry by the U.S. Congress. We're passing the first bill since 1975 that mandates an increase in fuel economy.""\If the Senate bill, which now has to go through the House, becomes law, automakers will have to boost the average mileage of new cars and light trucks to 35 miles per gallon by 2020, compared with about 25 mpg today.\But before you celebrate, pay attention to some fine print.\If the Transportation Department determines that the fuel economy goal for any given year is not ""cost-effective"" - that is, too expensive for the car companies - it can ease the standard.\But even this new mileage standard is not exactly world leading. The European Union is today where we want to be in 2020, around 35 mpg, and it is committed to going well over 40 mpg by 2012. Ditto Japan.\There are other things that make the Senate energy effort ugly. Senate Republicans killed a proposed national renewable electricity mandate that would have required utilities to produce 15 percent of their power from wind, solar, biomass and other clean-energy sources by 2020.\Twenty-three states already have such mandates. No matter. Making it national was too much for the Republicans.\And the Senate, thanks again to the Republicans, squashed a Democratic proposal to boost taxes on oil and gas companies that would raise some $32 billion for alternative fuel projects.\Despite all the new research on climate change, the Senate didn't even touch the idea of either a cap-and-trade system or a carbon tax to limit carbon dioxide emissions. An effort by Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota to legislate a national reporting (""carbon counter"") system to simply measure all sources of greenhouse gas emissions, which would enable a cap-and-trade system to work if we ever passed one, also got killed by Republicans.\We can't cap and trade something we can't measure.\Here is the truth: The core of our energy crisis is in Washington. We have all the technology we need right now to make huge inroads in becoming more energy efficient and energy independent, with drastically lower emissions. We have all the capital we need as well. But because of the unique nature of the energy and climate-change issues - which require incentives and regulations to build alternatives to dirty, but cheap, fossil fuels - you need public policy to connect the energy and capital the right way. That is what has been missing.\""We have to work to ensure that the House will at least toughen the provisions that the Senate passed,"" said Dan Becker, director of the Sierra Club's Global Warming Program.\The public wants it. But energy policy gets shaped in the halls of Congress - where wily lobbyists, legacy industries and politicians greedy for campaign contributions regularly sell out the country's interests for their own. Only when the public really rises up - as it has finally done against the auto companies - do we even get moderate change.\Don't look to the Bush team to lead the revolution.\""We are the only major country in the world where no one even knows the name of the environment minister - the head of our Environmental Protection Agency,"" said Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass. ""Whoever it is - and most people don't even know if it is a he or a she - has been in a six-year witness protection program.""\Folks, we're home alone.

Hendersonville businessman Jeff Miller, Republican challenger for the U.S. House of Representatives (N.C.

\
Would you vote to repeal the Health Care Reform law?
\
I would vote to repeal it. I don't believe the president will sign a repeal, so we would have to work toward that by defunding it.
\
I think we would have to start from scratch. I don't want to work with it. It is a 2,500-page monster. I agree with insurance for children, for sure, and keeping the 26-year-olds on their parents' insurance. I'm OK with that, especially now with so many kids not being able to get work.
\
And the pre-existing conditions (section of the law that keeps people with pre-existing conditions from being denied health insurance coverage), that needs to stay. I don't think anyone should go bankrupt because of medical expenses, and that is something we would need to address. But we can do it with a lot less government control and less bureaucracy.
\
How would you approach health care issues in this country?
\
Number 1, I would make it a bipartisan effort. The only bipartisan effort was that 32 Democrats voted against it (health care reform bill), including Heath Shuler, who does not want to repeal it. Number 2, we go and address the fraud. There is a huge amount of fraud with Medicare and Medicaid between $70 and $120 billion is the number I've heard tossed around in terms of fraud. Let's go back to competition.
\
We need to encourage states to manage tort reform and ways of handling malpractice through tort reform. You still protect the patients' rights, but you remove the huge expensive medical burden that we are all hit with because so many doctors are having to practice defensive medicine right now.
\
Personal health savings accounts (pre-tax savings where a person pays for health care and they write it off), we need to make this more available to everyone. Let people use pre-tax dollars for their medical expenses. The bottom line is, let's apply the free market to this.
\
What is your stance on Social Security?
\
Those that are soon to draw it, and are now drawing it, that's a promise that should be upheld. I have never, ever said that I thought that the government should put our Social Security funds in the stock market. As far as those down the road, I don't know what the changes are, and I don't have the solutions, but I know we are going to have to cut in other areas.
\
What would you do to bring down unemployment and bring jobs to Western North Carolina?
\
That's the most important thing we can get done right now. I believe it has to start at the top. We have to bring down the national debt. It is the number 1 threat to the country, according to the polls around the country.
\
In order to do that, we have to reduce spending. We are going to have to look at every department in the government. A simple way of doing that is to freeze hiring and freeze any raises. First, I would like to exclude Defense and Veterans Affairs (departments) from the hiring freeze. It is important that our veterans' needs are being met. Government jobs are paying much higher than the private sector. They (government) haven't lost any jobs. I would like to freeze hiring and freeze raises.

A very interesting concept is that for every two people who leave, or retire, or move on to another job, just replace with one. To me, that's not going in there and firing thousands of people, but we have a very deliberate way of doing it.
\
In doing so, we would start reducing the budget across the board. If you look at non-defense discretionary spending, it's gone up 83 percent in the last two years. If you go back to the 2008 budget, you would save about $100 billion by doing this. If we operated from the numbers off the 2008 budget, we would save $100 billion per year.
\
It all comes back to the uncertainty that is hanging over everyone's head right now. With the health care law, people don't know what to expect.
\
You look at cap and trade, we don't know if that is going to come back. (Emissions trading, also known as cap and trade, is a market-based approach used to control pollution by providing economic incentives for achieving reductions in the emissions of pollutants. Firms are required to hold a number of permits (or carbon credits) equivalent to their emissions. The total number of permits cannot exceed the cap, limiting total emissions to that level. Firms that need to increase their emission permits must buy permits from those who require fewer permits. The transfer of permits is referred to as a trade. In effect, the buyer is paying a charge for polluting, while the seller is being rewarded for having reduced emissions.)
\
Card check that's a horrible deterrent for Western North Carolina and the rest of the country because it's just wrong. (Employee Free Choice, also known as the ""card check"" bill, eliminates the secret ballot for unions.) Instead of letting people vote secretly as to whether or not they want to form a union, they would have to sign a card. The whole concept of not letting it be done by secret ballot is wrong.
\
How important is it for Congress to make a decision on the Bush tax cuts? How would you vote on this?
\
Congress left without passing or denying the Bush tax cuts. As business owners we don't know what to expect, so there is more uncertainty. All this uncertainty is, in some cases, worse than bad news because you truly don't know how to react to it, so you are just left waiting for decisions.
\
It's critical. Congress needs to make a decision whether it's part of them or all of them I believe it should be all. But you have to cut spending in order to do that. I believe that goes hand in hand. You can't cut taxes and not reduce spending. I would vote to extend all of them.
\
Cap and trade could cost Western North Carolina 3,200 jobs. What are your thoughts on this?
\
As I've said, I am totally opposed to cap and trade. As for those who have said this is an environmental bill, I am totally for the environment, and we can protect the environment. We all have a moral obligation to protect it. They can give tax credits and incentives to businesses, but we do not need the government to handle selling credits for carbon emissions. I think it's horrible. This is a job buster for WNC and we are in one of the most affected areas.

Mitt Romney certainly has his weaknesses as a candidate, but his biggest challenge in attracting independent swing voters will be overcoming a well-earned reputation for saying whatever the Republican base wants to hear.
\
Having watched him in the primaries, you have to wonder whether there is any issue in which he would turn to the far-right in his party and say: ""I'm sorry, you have this wrong. Here's the hard truth. ...""
\
One place he could start to change that perception is with the issues of energy, conservation and the environment. In recent years, the GOP base has fallen into a knee-jerk ""Drill, baby, drill"" attitude that clean energy is for sissies and protecting the environment only hurts jobs, therefore, conservatism and conservation can't mix. Romney recently traveled to a remote coal-mining town, Craig, Colo., where hetrashed President Barack Obama's green jobs record, while addressing workers wearing caps that said ""Coal=Jobs.""Yes, it does, for lung doctors.
\
This obsession with coal and oil strikes me as wrongheaded for three reasons. First, there is a more intelligent conservative energy strategy: a campaign to develop an energy mix that is ""American, diverse and clean."" Put the GOP behind whatever fuel sources or technologies the marketplace produces be they natural gas, wind, wave, solar, nuclear, efficiency, biofuels or sequestered coal provided they're produced in America, give us diversity of supply and steadily move us to cleaner air.
\
Second, this slavish devotion to coal and oil, and sneering at environmentalism, contradicts the GOP's long tradition of environmental stewardship that some Republicans are still proud of. Teddy Roosevelt bequeathed us national parks, Richard Nixon the Clean Air Act and the Environmental Protection Agency, Ronald Reagan the Montreal Protocol to protect the ozone layer, and George H.W. Bush cap-and-trade that reduced acid rain. Does the GOP really think it will attract the idealism of next-generation voters with mottos like ""Coal=Jobs""?
\
And, finally, the tea party has grown more hostile than ever toward conservation just when some big conservation groups have redefined their missions from protecting nature for its own sake, a noble goal, to also protecting our ""natural infrastructure"" that provides jobs, food and security.
\
The Nature Conservancy has broadened its emphasis from buying up natural land and locking it away so it can never be despoiledto building lasting economic partnerships between those who control ""natural infrastructure"" and those who benefit from it so bothwill have the interest and means to preserve it.
\
For instance, the conservancy is working with cities in South Americato organize large groups of water users bottling plants, hydroelectric dams and water utilities to finance the protection and restoration of watersheds upstream from their facilities. Planting trees that hold water like a sponge or protecting forests and natural vegetation that keep pollutants out of the water and prevent runoff is a much cheaper and more effective way to conserve water than building more reservoirs or treatment plants. And paying those upstream to protect this natural infrastructure gives them a sustainable means to do so.
\
Meanwhile, Conservation International (my wife is on the board) was founded 25 years ago to preserve biodiversity in the world's greatest ecosystems. But some three years ago, explained co-founder Peter Seligmann, ""We realized that despite our intensive efforts to protect biodiversity, extinction rates were accelerating, fisheries were collapsing, and the climate was changing. ... We officially changed our mission from protecting biodiversity alone to supporting human well-being by restoring and maintaining ecosystems that provide services to humanity.""
\
Once you show what healthy ecosystems provide for people, ""conservation"" takes on a whole new meaning. Healthy farms depend on pollinators, healthy rivers depend on the forests that filter the water and prevent soil erosion, healthy fishing grounds depend on preserving the coral reefs where fish spawn, healthy coastal areas depend on the reefs and mangroves that blunt storm surges, and healthy hydroelectric power depends on water from cloud forests.
\
Conservatives can run away from a proud legacy of environmental stewardship by defining ""conservative"" as aligning the GOP with the cheapest dirty fuels and dying industries and do whatever their lobbyists dictate.
\
Or they can define ""conservative"" as protecting our natural infrastructure to promote clean growth in the spirit of Teddy Roosevelt and press for the cleanest fuel mix U.S. technology can produce. Over to you, Mr. Romney.

Editor: Is setting limits on carbon emissions necessary environmental policy? Remember air quality before Congress passed the 1970 Clean Air Act? I do.
\
Driving into the industrial Northeast along the New Jersey Turnpike in the 1960s you had to roll up the windows of your non-air-conditioned car in order not to breathe the polluted air and smell the stench that went with it. There was smog everywhere in northern New Jersey and metro New York then, but it's mostly gone today because of the Clean Air Act.
\
After I moved to North Carolina, I often traveled to the mountains to view the beautiful scenery. Today when you travel through the mountains the scenes are still beautiful, but in too many places you see the effects of acid rain. Instead of the sea of forest green, you see large areas of brown where the effects of drifting air pollutants from industries in the Ohio River Valley are clearly evident. These pollutants were carried by prevailing winds and fell to earth in rainfall on the North Carolina mountains. They caused considerable damage to our environment, until acid rain legislation was approved.
\
The improvements in our environment starting in the 1970s that resulted directly from congressional action by Democrats and Republicans on the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act, and from EPA enforcement, can be continued with similar actions today. Despite those acts, the economy still continued to grow. And folks, it's past time to get crazy politics and greed out of the way.
\
Today, climate change is the issue. The growing impact of human-induced carbon emissions is already felt in rising temperatures and sea levels. To preserve our planet we must act to reduce these greenhouse gas emissions. One of the most effective ways is through cap and trade, first introduced by President George H.W. Bush and advocated by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.
\
Cap and trade, simply put, is setting limits on emissions of pollutants into the air by industry. Those that can meet the limits receive credits that they can then sell to industries that can't meet those limits. These non-attainment industries can continue to operate by buying the credits and paying for the cost of their pollution, while the cleaner industries sell some of the benefits of their clean technology. The law becomes an incentive to all industries to operate in a cleaner manner, and the result is a reduction in carbon emissions, a healthier environment for all of us and a slowing of global warming.
\
This is about more than the air you and I breathe. It's about the planet we want to leave to our children and their children. What will that planet be like? Will it be one with a continuing rise in temperatures, disappearing flora and fauna, melting glaciers and polar ice caps, and rising sea levels? Or, will we do what's right and be able to leave a planet to our children's children at least as healthy as the one we inherited?

8,"To the Editor:\I was dismayed to see President Obama's plans to simultaneously rebuild America's struggling economy and find solutions to global warming - through the introduction of clean, renewable energy and a cap and trade system - come under attack recently. It was no surprise, however, to see the harshest criticism came from the big oil and coal companies - organizations invested in keeping our nation dependent on fossil fuels despite the cost to our wallets, the environment, and our health.\Here in Wilmington, NC, my friends and I have seen the effects of global warming firsthand. While we recycle and drive less in an effort to do our part and lessen our impact on the environment, we know that real difference must come from above, and now it's time for our leaders to step up and pass legislation to protect our interests - the economy and the environment - over the interests of big oil and coal companies.\As a voter and resident in the 7th district, I urge Congressman Mike McIntyre to vote to pass cap and trade legislation. This is an unprecedented opportunity to release our nation from the grasp of oil and coal dependency, and I ask that Rep. McIntyre do everything in his power to make sure it passes.\Sincerely,\David Pinsky\David Pinsky Wrightsville Beach, NC"

In the 1970s and early '80s, having seized control of the U.N. apparatus (by power of numbers), Third World countries decided to cash in. OPEC was pulling off the greatest wealth transfer from rich to poor in history. Why not them?
\
So, in grand U.N. declarations and conferences, they began calling for a ""New International Economic Order."" The NIEO's essential demand was simple: to transfer fantastic chunks of wealth from the industrialized West to the Third World.
\
On what grounds? In the name of equality -- wealth redistribution via global socialism -- with a dose of post-colonial reparations thrown in.
\
The idea of essentially taxing hardworking citizens of the democracies in order to fill the treasuries of Third World kleptocracies went nowhere, thanks mainly to Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher (and the debt crisis of the early '80s). They put a stake through the enterprise.
\
But such dreams never die. The raid on the Western treasuries is on again, but today with a new rationale to fit current ideological fashion. With socialism dead, the gigantic heist is now proposed as a sacred service of the newest religion: environmentalism.
\
One of the major goals of the Copenhagen climate summit is another NIEO shakedown: the transfer of hundreds of billions from the industrial West to the Third World to save the planet by, for example, planting green industries in the tristes tropiques.
\
Politically it's an idea of genius, engaging at once every left-wing erogenous zone: rich man's guilt, post-colonial guilt, environmental guilt. But the idea of shaking down the industrial democracies in the name of the environment thrives not just in the refined internationalist precincts of Copenhagen. It thrives on the national scale, too.
\
On the day Copenhagen opened, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency claimed jurisdiction over the regulation of carbon emissions by declaring them an ""endangerment"" to human health.
\
Since we operate an overwhelmingly carbon-based economy, the EPA will be regulating practically everything. No institution that emits more than 250 tons of CO2 a year will fall outside EPA control. This means more than a million building complexes, hospitals, plants, schools, businesses and similar enterprises. (The EPA proposes regulating emissions only above 25,000 tons, but it has no such authority.) Not since the creation of the Internal Revenue Service has a federal agency been given more intrusive power over every aspect of economic life.
\
This naked assertion of vast executive power in the name of the environment is the perfect fulfillment of the prediction of Czech President (and economist) Vaclav Klaus that environmentalism is becoming the new socialism, i.e., the totemic ideal in the name of which government seizes the commanding heights of the economy and society.
\
Socialism having failed so spectacularly, the left was adrift until it struck upon a brilliant gambit: metamorphosis from red to green.
\
The cultural elites went straight from the memorial service for socialism to the altar of the environment. The objective is the same: highly centralized power given to the best and the brightest, the new class of experts, managers and technocrats.
\
Not everyone is pleased with the coming New Carbon-Free International Order. When the Obama administration signaled (in a gesture to Copenhagen) a U.S. commitment to major cuts in carbon emissions, Democratic Sen. Jim Webb wrote the president protesting that he lacks the authority to do so unilaterally. That requires congressional concurrence by legislation or treaty.
\
With the Senate blocking President Obama's cap-and-trade carbon legislation, the EPA coup d'etat served as the administration's loud response to Webb: The hell we can't.
\
Forget for a moment the economic effects of severe carbon chastity. There's the matter of constitutional decency. If you want to revolutionize society, you do it through Congress reflecting popular will. Not by administrative fiat of EPA bureaucrats.
\
Congress should not just resist this executive overreaching but trump it: Amend existing clean air laws and restore their original intent by excluding CO2 from EPA control and reserving that power for Congress and future legislation.
\
Do it now. Do it soon. Because Big Brother isn't lurking in CIA cloak. He's knocking on your door, smiling under an EPA cap.

Political and economic realities threaten the Obama administration and the European Union's mutual quest to combat global warming. Temperatures aren't helping much, either. Globally the warming trend effectively ended more than a decade ago.
\
These inconvenient facts don't bode well for December's climate summit in Copenhagen, Denmark, where campaigners against global warming had hoped to arrive at a worldwide pact for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions.
\
In addition to sizable political and economic conflicts stalling European and U.S. efforts, developing nations also are gumming up plans for a worldwide solution to the presumed threat.
\
China, India and other developing nations insist on receiving subsidies or even outright payments from developed nations like the United States, either as compensation for alleged harm suffered from the more prosperous nations' greenhouse-gas emissions, or to pay for reducing their own emissions. African nations last week said they need $65 billion to cope with global warming's effects, essentially making an argument for reparations.
\
The fervent quest to curb greenhouse-gas emissions is worrisome enough, considering that the science allegedly proving the threat is increasingly shown to be faulty or even fraudulent. But, as is also increasingly obvious to those expected to foot the bill, proposed Draconian ""solutions"" to this likely nonexistent problem will do more harm than good.
\
Government curbs on greenhouse gases certainly will retard economic growth, while promising only unproven environmental gains. As India and China demonstrate, developing nations know curbing emissions means curbing economic well-being, a price they are unwilling to pay without at least being compensated.
\
The reality is that undeveloped nations are more polluted nations. Cleaning up the environment is not a top priority where people don't have enough to eat. For such nations, definite economic growth trumps reducing possible global warming of a degree or two. If this is abundantly clear to developing nations, it's becoming increasingly clear to those already developed.
\
Europe's cap-and-trade scheme was undermined recently by a Court of First Instance ruling that annulled the EU's attempt to lower Estonia and Poland's carbon emissions. ""The court said setting carbon limits is a matter for member states rather than the EU,"" reported EurActiv network.
\
The EU, unable to bring its own member nations in line, also is frustrated with the lack of progress in the U.S. The Obama administration is meeting staunch resistance in Congress to imposing similar restrictions on American industry, undermining the Copenhagen mission.
\
While these developments bode ill for worldwide Draconian regulations, they are good news for those who know prosperity is the best route to cleaner environment, irrespective of a degree or two increase or decline in temperature over the next century.

11,"The outcome of a trial under way in U.S. District Court in Asheville takes on added significance for Western North Carolina air quality in the wake of a federal appeals court decision a week ago that strikes down the Bush administration's ""cap-and-trade"" air pollution control policy.\The trial will determine the outcome of a suit filed against the Tennessee Valley Authority two years ago by North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper.\The suit claims the country's largest public utility hasn't done enough to cut down pollution that blows across the mountains from 11 coal-fired power plants in three neighboring states.\During the past week, experts called on by the attorney general's office have tallied the harm to human health, the environment, visibility and the economy resulting from the sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury and soot carried by prevailing west-to-east winds from TVA plants into North Carolina.\Caps on emissions\The suit seeks caps on TVA pollution similar to those imposed on power plants in North Carolina by the Clean Smokestacks Act approved by state lawmakers in 2002.\That act, one of the strongest state air pollution laws in the country, formed the basis of another suit filed by Cooper -- the one that brought the unanimous ruling by three federal appeals court judges last Friday striking down the cornerstone of the Bush administration's approach to controlling air pollution.\Duke Energy and some other utility companies were also plaintiffs in the suit, challenging the way the EPA allocated credits among companies.\The Clean Air Interstate Rule would have covered 28 Eastern states and would have required 70 percent reductions in such major pollutants as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide beginning in 2015.

WASHINGTON - In the fall of 1997, when the Clinton administration was forming its position for the Kyoto climate treaty talks, Lawrence H. Summers argued that the United States would risk damaging the domestic economy if it set overly ambitious goals for reducing carbon emissions.
\
Summers, then the deputy Treasury secretary, said at the time that there was a compelling scientific case for action on global warming but that a too-rapid move against emissions of greenhouse gases risked dire and unknowable economic consequences.
\
His view prevailed over those of officials arguing for tougher standards, among them Carol M. Browner, then the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and her mentor, Al Gore, then the vice president.
\
Today, as the climate-change debate once again heats up, Summers leads the economic team of the incoming administration, and Browner has been designated its White House coordinator of energy and climate policy. And Gore is hovering as an informal adviser to President-elect Barack Obama.
\
As Obama seeks to find the right balance between his environmental goals and his plans to revive the economy, he may have to resolve conflicting views among some of his top advisers.
\
While Summers' thinking on climate change has evolved over the last decade, his views on the potential risks to the economy of an aggressive effort to limit carbon emissions have not. But he now works for a president-elect who has set ambitious goals for addressing global warming through a government-run cap-and-trade system.
\
It may once again prove to be Summers' role to inject a rigorous economist's reality check into the debate over the scope and speed of an attack on global warming.
\
According to a transition official familiar with Summers' thinking, he is wary of moving very quickly on a carbon cap, because doing so could raise energy costs, kill jobs and deepen the current recession. He foresees a phase-in of several years for any carbon restraint regime, particularly if the economy continues to be sluggish, a slower timetable than many lawmakers and environmentalists are pressing.
\
Summers and Peter R. Orszag, the economist whom Obama has designated director of the White House budget office, have both argued that a tax on carbon emissions from burning gasoline, coal and other fuels might be a more economically efficient means of regulating pollutants than a cap-and-trade system, under which an absolute ceiling on emissions is set and polluters are allowed to buy and sell permits to meet it.
\
But Obama and Browner have ruled out a straight carbon tax, perhaps mindful of the stinging political defeat the Clinton administration suffered in 1993 when, prodded by Gore, it proposed one.
\
Obama was asked in a television interview last month whether he would consider imposing a stiff tax on gasoline, whose price has now fallen to below $2 a gallon after cresting above $4 a gallon last summer.
\
He replied that while American families were getting some relief at the pump, they were hurting in other ways, through rising unemployment and falling home values. ""So putting additional burdens on American families right now, I think, is a mistake,"" he said.
\
At least for the present, then, the idea of a carbon tax has been shelved, and Obama's economic and environmental advisers are working, along with Congress, to devise a cap-and-trade system.
\
But difficult debates lie ahead within the White House, between the White House and Congress, and within the Democratic Party, whose deep divisions on climate change break down along ideological and geographical lines. The fight in November between two Democrats, Rep. John D. Dingell of Michigan and Henry A. Waxman of California, for the chairmanship of the House Energy and Commerce Committee was a preview. It pitted lawmakers from auto- and coal-producing states against liberal lawmakers from California and the East Coast, Blue Dog fiscal conservatives against environmentalists, pro-business moderates against regulatory activists. Waxman, with the tacit support of the Obama camp and Speaker Nancy Pelosi, won, but narrowly.
\
That was just a taste of the broader and potentially more bitter fight over global warming and energy legislation, which will have profound implications for the U.S. economy, the environment and foreign policy.
\
Both sides - those seeking strict enforcement of emissions limits and those concerned about higher energy costs and potential job losses - will find receptive ears in the new White House, Obama aides and outside analysts said.
\
""There is a diversity of opinion among Democrats over the best way to contain costs associated with a climate change plan,"" said Scott Segal, a utility lobbyist in Washington, who cited rival approaches pushed by Sen. Barbara Boxer of California, chairwoman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, and Sen. Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee.
\
""I think there is room within the current range of administration advisers to accommodate all those points of view,"" Segal said.
\
The Obama transition team did not make Browner or Summers available for on-the-record interviews. A spokesman, Nick Shapiro, said that Obama had appointed advisers with differing views but that ultimately he would set policy.
\
""At the end of the day,"" Shapiro said in an e-mail statement, ""the advisers will be charged with implementing President-elect Obama's strong targets that set us on a course to reduce emissions to their 1990 levels by 2020 and reduce them an additional 80 percent by 2050. However, the president-elect appointed a Cabinet with diverse views and looks forward to strong debate within the Cabinet on how best to achieve those outcomes.""
\
Emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases by the United States in 2007 were about 15 percent above 1990s level, according to the Department of Energy.
\
In past public statements and writings, Browner and Summers have wrestled with the difficult choices posed by global warming and at times have come to different conclusions on how to minimize the impact on the economy.
\
Browner has been a forceful advocate for strict carbon limits for years and has said that a comprehensive cap-and-trade system is the best way to achieve swift and certain reductions in emissions. She has said that the plan could include flexibility for carbon-emitting businesses by allowing them to bank and borrow permits, but she has not supported setting a maximum price or ""safety valve"" cost in case permits become prohibitively expensive, as Summers and Orszag have.
\
Browner has urged Congress to take up the issue quickly in the new year. In September, in testimony before the House Ways and Means Committee, she pointedly noted that the Supreme Court had given the EPA authority to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. She implied that if Obama was elected, the new administration might unilaterally seek to curb carbon emissions should Congress not act.
\
""Given the magnitude of the problem, and the scale of the solution required,"" she said, ""I believe it is important that Congress provide national leadership on this issue.""
\
Summers believes a cap-and-trade program can be a workable solution, provided it includes some sort of escape clause if prices rise too quickly, according to several articles he has written in the past two years. He has also expressed a belief that developing nations must also adhere to carbon limits, or manufacturing jobs will migrate to countries without them.
\
In a forum at the Brookings Institution a year ago, Summers said the current moment on climate change was analogous to that on health care in 1992: Everyone agreed that the current system was unsustainable, but there was less agreement on how to address the complexities and costs. There was a general expectation that with the inauguration of a new Democratic president, something would be done.
\
""In the end,"" Summers said, ""what everyone agreed needed to happen didn't happen in 1993.""

All parents must find transportation and provide a lunch. Transportation is not easy for working parents either.\Needy families usually receive food stamps. This should enable them to pack a lunch. Traditional public schools have the right to enforce discipline and expel when needed.\Instead of lamenting over the charter schools test scores, visit their campus and learn from their teaching and discipline methods. The parents of these children pay taxes, and I am grateful it can be used for supporting charter schools.\At a recent awards program at a Columbus County middle school the size of the sports trophies were huge compared to the academic awards. This lets students know sports are valued more.\At this school a child I know has been exposed to inappropriate Internet games, foul language, and sexual comments.\If traditional public schools provided a good education and environment, then parents would not feel the need to find transportation to a charter school. I'm glad there is an alternative.\Melanie Howell, Clarkton\Clean up the current messes first\It appears that those who believe that our federal government is getting a bad rap for their inability to manage programs, i.e., the proposed health care program, are missing the one important issue - that is, the ability to be accountable for money spent.\Medicare and Medicaid are two good examples. While it appears all is well with these programs, the government losses millions of dollars each year through fraud and funds mismanagement. In the private sector people would be fired from such gross mismanagement.\While I don't mind the government overseeing such programs, they must be accountable for all funds coming in and going out.\Congress must be realistic with any and all programs and set up a nonpolitical oversight group that is not part of the band of bandits that are running our country today. They don't care about you or me, only what they can get in benefits for themselves.\Let's clean up the current mess we have with gross mismanagement before Congress enacts new laws and programs like health care.\R.D.

And Americans seem more interested in Michael Jackson's death than the slow death of our country.\Do you think that a government that nationalizes large parts of the auto and banking industries at our expense has our best interest in mind? Or is it just trying to gain control over that part of your life? Do you want a nationalized health care program that will ration care and cost trillions that we can't afford without taxing ourselves into ruin?\... The most dangerous event is the recent passage of the ""cap and trade"" energy bill by the House. This was 1,300 pages of legislation that no one read and will be the largest tax bill in history! Any government mandate that cost me money is a ""de facto"" tax.\This bill will kill industry and increase energy costs. ... We need to let our elected officials know that we have had enough!

15,"Crime can be goal for youths\I disagree with UNCW Sociology and Criminology chair Cook's blanket statement that ""People don't grow up desiring to be criminals."" I had a 13-year-old in my juvenile court office last week professing just that, and have had plenty of juveniles assigned to me over the years with the same intention.\Granted, most of these juveniles came from families, neighborhoods or life experiences that assisted in their decision to pursue this life choice. But choose they did, and many of the delinquents I have known have turned up years later in the Police Blotter as they followed up on their earlier decision.\By the way, poverty was never a factor that I could ever detect as being the sole reason for making the choice to continually break the law. In fact, quite often these delinquents' characteristics included being quite spoiled in a financial, as well as a supervision, sense.\One major factor for criminal lifestyle choices are those components of our entertainment culture that espouse negative lifestyles and target teens. They compete with those institutions that try to instill positive choice making for children, and sometimes these influences come to dominate children's lives.\I believe the view that people are swept into choosing crime solely as a result of ""desperation"" or ""frustration"" carries the risk of instituting inaccurate, ineffective and wasteful policies ...\Robin Joseph Boucher, Wilmington\Diversity in schools essential\I was the big loser in the recent New Hanover County school board election, and I accept that my ideas were not popular.\Still, like a canary in a mine shaft that lets miners know toxic gas levels, I feel compelled to share my concerns: Children neglected grow up to become dependent on the state; children ignored will gain attention, often in unsocial ways; children isolated by race and economics will languish and many will drop out and add another layer of dysfunction to our struggling human infrastructure.\A tipping point will be reached when crime levels become everyone's problem and the clean, green businesses we desperately need won't come here because of our backward-thinking ways.\I suppose the current board majority feel they know what they are doing, yet to ignore the research on the importance of diversity in preparing our students for the new global work environment suggests they don't. Our common goal must be to help all children gain the social and academic skills they need to grow into productive workers, responsible citizens, healthy parents and satisfied, functioning adults.\I beg the board to bring all children to the table, to re-examine their current policy where select neighborhoods have access to a healthy educational diet while others are left in want. As a cancer survivor I know the danger of ignoring a malignancy.\Wm. Clancy Thompson, Wilmington\Editor's note: The writer, former executive director of the Child Advocacy Commission, ran unsuccessfully for the school board this year.\Gore's conflict of interest\While Al Gore was receiving his Nobel Prize for his position on climate change and giving speeches on the subject in Copenhagen, the news services neglected to mention that he had a substantial financial interest in having energy cap and trade legislation enacted.\A Chicago Climate Exchange was set up in 2000 to take advantage of the possible trillion-dollar ""cap and trade"" market for greenhouse gases. Al Gore and Richard Sandor, who developed the concept of the exchange, were major stock holders in the exchange company.\With the assistance of Democratic Reps. Henry Waxman of California and Ed Markey of Massachusetts an attempt was made to make cap-and-trade law. Even though it passed in the House, there were not enough votes in the Senate to pass the legislation.\After the Republicans won control of the House in the November 2010 elections, the exchange was closed and ex-Vice President Gore and his associate Sandor sold their interest in the exchange company. According to Fox News, sales records indicate that Sandor cleared $90 million for his 16 percent interest ... It is not known how much Al Gore cleared.\With so much money involved, one can only wonder just how much of Al Gore's climate change agenda was self-serving and how much of it was real.\James W.

To the editor: This letter is to advise the community of Hendersonville and surrounding area of the acquisition of Shaws Creek AME Zion Church and Cemetery by the descendants of the Logan family and members of the community of Henderson County. This church will reopen its doors under a new name: Logan Chapel.
\
Logan Chapel will operate as a nondenominational church of Christian believers. Logan Chapel was the original name prior to the name change in 1929. The first pastor of the church was the Rev. John Wesley Logan, who served for 18 years until his death in 1929. The family feels it's only fitting to reinstate the original name.
\
We continuously seek your support and prayers as we prepare for its rededication as a place of worship.
\
As for the church cemetery, it's rumored that several individuals have prepaid for burial plots. As of this day, no record has been provided by the previous owners of AME Zion Church of America. We are seeking the assistance of those individuals who have purchased plots to submit documentation. Please contact me at 704-309-5423.

To the editor: Raleigh is at it again. The March 7 Times-News headline ""NC Tweaks Standardized Tests"" actually proclaimed a lowering of reading proficiency standards for third-graders across the state.
\
Apparently, as many as 12,000 students will no longer have to attend remedial reading camp. Not said, but presumably the reason, is the lowered standards save money.
\
Have you ever noticed that Raleigh's savings seem to be ""earned"" on the backs of our children and the environment? And of course, Duke Energy gets a pass on the environment because they are ""job creators.""
\
But Duke Energy is not a job creator. Duke's purchase of Progress Energy was all about increasing revenue while eliminating overlapping personnel functions.
\
Job creators indeed!
\
Raleigh can continue with its policies, uninterrupted, because individual county power structures throughout the state remain silent. Silence means assent.
\
So let's ask our elites to speak up. Ask why our commissioners, City Council and Chamber of Commerce haven't spoken out against the education cuts and continuing environmental degradation.
\
Could it be that they are simply content that we are better off than Florida? The alternative is that our children and the environment are no longer their priorities.

To the editor: I don't know when or why Mr. Benson left Canada to live in Hendersonville. If he has told us, I missed it. However, I'm wondering if it was because he did not like the way the game of politics was played up there. Now he's down here, and he is finding out that the game is played the same the world over.
\
He seemed taken aback by the idea that Mr. Pope would contribute some of his money to help elect Republicans. One wonders whether Mr. Benson has read in the news recently about Tom Steyer, who has pledged $100 million ($50 million of his own) if the Democrats will pass a cap-and-trade or a carbon tax bill, or any other measure that would raise energy prices. (That was the reason for the Senate all-nighter this past week.)
\
Then there's union money -- that usually flows only in one direction. I could go on, but I think I've made my point. The Democrats had control of this state for well over 100 years. That point in and of itself is reason enough to contribute to the other party and hope for some changes.

17,"
Barack Obama's considerable political capital, earned on Election Day 2008, is spent. Well spent, mind you, on the enactment of a highly ideological agenda of Obamacare, financial reform and a near trillion-dollar stimulus that will significantly transform the country. But spent nonetheless.
\
There's nothing left with which to complete his social-democratic ambitions. This would have to await the renewed mandate that would come with a second inaugural.
\
That's why, as I suggested last Sunday, nothing of major legislative consequence is likely to occur for the next 2 years. Except, as columnist Irwin Stelzer points out, for one constitutional loophole: a lame-duck Congress called back into session between the elections this November and the swearing-in of the 112th Congress next January.
\
Leading Democrats are already considering this as a way to achieve even more liberal measures that many of their members dare not even talk about, let alone enact, on the eve of an election in which they face a widespread popular backlash to the already enacted elements of the Obama-Pelosi-Reid agenda. That backlash will express itself on Election Day and result, as most Democrats and Republicans currently expect, in major Democratic losses.
\
Assuming the elections go as currently projected, Obama's follow-up reforms are dead. Except for the fact that a lame-duck session, freezing in place the lopsided Democratic majorities of November 2008, would be populated by dozens of Democratic members who had lost re-election (in addition to those retiring). They could then vote for anything because they would have nothing to lose. They would be unemployed. And playing along with Obama might even brighten the prospects for, say, an ambassadorship to a sunny Caribbean isle.
\
As John Fund reports in The Wall Street Journal, Sens. Jay Rockefeller, Kent Conrad and Tom Harkin are already looking forward to what they might get passed in a lame-duck session. Among the major items being considered are card check, budget-balancing through major tax hikes, and climate change legislation involving heavy carbon taxes and regulation.
\
Card check, which effectively abolishes the secret ballot in the workplace, is the fondest wish of a union movement to which Obama is highly beholden. Major tax hikes, possibly including a value-added tax, will undoubtedly be included in the recommendations of the president's debt commission. And carbon taxes would be the newest version of the cap-and-trade legislation that has repeatedly failed to pass the current Congress but enough dead men walking in a lame-duck session might switch and vote to put it over the top.
\
It's a target-rich environment. The only thing holding the Democrats back would be shame, a Washington commodity in chronically short supply. To pass in a lame-duck session major legislation so unpopular that Democrats had no chance of passing it in regular session after major Democratic losses signifying a withdrawal of the mandate implicitly granted in 2008 would be an egregious violation of elementary democratic norms.
\
Perhaps shame will constrain the Democrats. But that is not to be counted on. It didn't stop them from pushing through health care reform the public didn't want by means of ""reconciliation"" maneuvers and without a single Republican vote in either chamber something unprecedented in American history for a reform of such scope and magnitude.
\
How then to prevent a runaway lame-duck Congress? Bring the issue up now applying the check-and-balance of the people's will before it disappears the morning after Election Day. Every current member should be publicly asked: In the event you lose in November a remote and deeply deplorable eventuality but still not inconceivable do you pledge to adhere to the will of the electorate and, in any lame-duck session of Congress, refuse to approve anything but the most routine legislation required to keep the government functioning?
\
The Democrats could, of course, make the pledge today and break it tomorrow. Call me naive, but I can't believe anyone would be that dishonorable.

RALEIGH -- Electricity customers in North Carolina are beginning to see the costs of efforts to improve the environment reflected in their monthly bills.
\
For example, the Jones-Onslow Electrical Membership Corp. recently sent a letter out to its members announcing an increase in monthly bills reflecting costs associated with purchasing cleaner electricity. Duke Energy has also applied for an average 12.6 percent increase in monthly bills to help it recoup its costs for making improvements, primarily to coal-powered plants.
\
Those rate increases could just be the beginning, as Congress begins working on what's commonly called the Waxman-Markey Renewable Energy Bill. The N.C. Association of Electric Cooperatives estimates that the upcoming mandates fromWashington could add 40 percent to the average monthly electricity bill, said Jane Pritchard, a spokeswoman for the organization.
\
Duke Energy suggests that the current form of the bill would result in a much lower increase.
\
Margaret Hartzell, global warming advocate for Environment North Carolina, doesn't think it will cost that much either.
\
""That figure is inflated,"" Hartzell said. ""We don't have an estimate of what it will be."" Most agree that the federal legislation will impact future electricity bills.
\
""It will affect everyone in some fashion,"" said Tom Williams, a spokesman for Duke Energy.
\
""Sometime during this, federal legislation will be put up to be passed that could have a great impact on their electricity rates,"" said Steve Goodson, of the Jones-Onslow EMC.
\
There are two reasons for these anticipated increases. One is that renewable energy resources that are increasingly being required by the state and federal governments are currently more expensive than traditional sources of energy. Those costs are passed on to the customers. A second potential reason is that some versions of the Waxman-Markey bill have included a ""cap-and-trade"" provision which would require electricity companies to, in the words of environmentalists, pay to pollute.
\
""Wind power and solar power are simply more expensive to purchase than the forms of energy that we purchase now,"" Goodson said.
\
Cap-and-trade is a method in which the federal government would auction off allowances or credits to emit a specified amount of carbon in the air. Electricity companies would bid on them and purchase them. Companies that are polluting less than their allowable credits could then sell those credits to other companies at a market rate.
\
The current version of the Waxman-Markey bill would allocate 85 percent of the allowances to electricity companies for free, Williams said, saving electricity companies -- and therefore consumers -- the cost of paying for those credits.
\
""Now rates would go up, but not nearly what they would go up before,"" Williams said.
\
Some environmental groups would like to require electricity companies to bid on the allowances.
\
Hartzell said that they should ""pay to pollute,"" creating revenue for the federal government.
\
""That revenue can go back into investing in energy efficiency, investing in renewable energy,"" Hartzell said. ""That revenue can go back to consumers and assist in (paying for) the increasing electricity costs"" for low- and moderate-income consumers.
\
""We have a huge clean energy opportunity before us,"" Hartzell said. ""We have the ability to really move forward on a clean energy future."" The electricity companies say they agree that carbon emissionsneedtobereduced. But they're arguing for a plan that balances environmental improvements and costs to consumers.
\
""We don't oppose environmental improvements to mitigate climate change,"" Pritchard said. ""We think it's a good thing. We don't want them to forget the cost to consumers."" Elizabeth Ouzts, state director of Environment North Carolina, said that some of the increased costs could be offset by increased efficiencies. For example, she said, energy-efficient appliances could replace older, less-efficient appliances. CFL light bulbs could replace incandescent bulbs.

"
21,"Two pieces of important environmental/energy legislation are in play this week, one in the U.S. Congress and the other in the North Carolina General Assembly.\Both are forward-thinking, innovative bills, and both deserve passage.\In Congress\In Washington, the U.S. House of Representatives may vote on the American Clean Energy and Security Act (ACES) as early as tomorrow.\The ACES measure has a feature referred to as cap-and-trade, which would put emissions of heat-trapping emissions 17 percent lower than the amount produced in 2005 by the year 2020. Down the road, greenhouse emissions would be slashed 83 percent by 2050. Many details remain to be hammered out on cap-and-trade, such as how many pollution credits would be distributed to which industries, and whether/how much of the revenue raised from the credits would be rolled back to consumers. The measure is the center of a fierce ideological fight, not to mention a lobbying onslaught from the oil and gas industry. Flush with cash from recent years of record profits, the industry poured nearly $45 million into influencing politicians and federal officials in the first quarter of 2009 alone. That's in addition to making their case in the media.\In a nutshell, the case against cap-and-trade is made by painting a dire picture where rising energy costs crush cash-strapped average Americans.\We're not sure how that's different from the present, where rising energy costs are crushing cash-strapped average Americans. Here in the mountains the most common plea for assistance to the United Way is for help to pay energy bills.\Cap-and-trade may have a hazy future, but regarding ACES we can say this with certainty: It represents the ground floor of a new energy future by focusing on renewable energy and green jobs. Its calls for greater efficiency in the generation and transmission of electricity, increased efficiency in the appliances and homes using that energy represents nothing revolutionary. It's garden variety common sense, and it will help us on the path to a future where we're no longer held hostage by foreign energy producers.\It's also a path to a better economic future. The U.S. is beginning to lag dangerously behind in the clean energy arms race, as only a half-dozen of the world's top 30 firms dealing in the solar power, wind power and advanced battery fields are American. China is pumping $12 million an hour into clean energy research and industry. And while many critics of ACES are bandying around rhetoric regarding costs to consumers, it's worth nothing the Union of Concerned Scientists has pegged savings from the energy efficiency standards alone in ACES at $750 per household by 2020 and nearly $4,000 a year by 2030.\In North Carolina\In Raleigh, HB 1050, NC SAVE$ ENERGY, also goes after the low-hanging fruit of efficiency and conservation. Backed by dozens of social, environmental and consumer advocacy groups, the measure would create jobs, help struggling households and lead to a cleaner environment. It would also lift North Carolina from scraping the bottom of the 50-state rankings regarding mandated public utility spending on efficiency and conservation.\The program would be via an independent non-profit through a surcharge to residential customers of $.0017 per kilowatt-hour of electricity usage and 2 cents per therm for residential natural gas consumers. Administrative costs of the program would be capped at no more than 10 percent of the program's funds. It's worth noting that the program would be an ongoing venture what would be able to continue after current federal stimulus dollars for conservation and efficiency runs out.\The benefits could be huge; a report from two years ago showed more than 3 million homes in the state need energy efficiency upgrades. And the bottom line is that things like properly weatherizing a home are far easier on a homeowner's utility bill than the cost of building a new nuclear plant.\NC SAVE$ could be a huge boon to the state's unemployment problem and a godsend to lower-income families and older North Carolinians living on a fixed income.\This legislation, along with ACES, could yield huge benefits. Both may have problems to iron out. But there's an old saying: ""The perfect is the enemy of the good."" Opponents of these measures may try to talk them to death because they're not perfect. That would be a mistake.\We've got to take the first step to the future sometime.\Now is that time."

U.S. can attain a quality health care system for all I have a good job and good health insurance. Recently, I became ill with a condition that took almost two years to overcome. I risked being too sick to keep my job and would have then been unable to afford my health insurance. I have always realized that I, and most Americans with health insurance, am only one illness or layoff away from having no health insurance. I ask each citizen to contemplate their own risk. What will happen to you, or your family, if you become too sick to work or if you lose your livelihood, be it as an employee or employer?
\
I believe health care should be administered in the same manner as is done for our roadways, fire and police departments, public parks and other enterprises which benefit all, but which are too great of an undertaking to be managed by each of us independently. But how does it get paid for?
\
According to the World Health Organization, The United States spends approximately 17 percent of its Gross Domestic Product on health care.
\
The nations with the next highest percentage of health care expenditures are the highly industrialized nations that have universal health care. They spend less than 10 percent of their GDP on health care.
\
The United States health care system was rated 37th (have you ever had to wait for hours in an emergency room?) among other nations in the overall quality of its system.
\
By adopting the best practices of these other nations, the U.S. should be able to attain a health care system of the same quality as the best countries while spending less than we spend today. We can then apply the difference between the 17 percent we now spend and the 10 percent we should spend to either improve the system even more or return the savings to the taxpayer.
\
We can afford health care for all citizens just by what we spend on health care now. We can also maintain and even improve the quality of health care. That is why we support the president's health care plan.
\
RON OSBORNE Graham The letter was co-signed by Elizabeth Osborne.
\
President's 'wonderful' health care plan is anything but The president is a liar. A small statement made larger by the fact it was used by a member of Congress during a national sales pitch for the newest attempt to further erode Americans personal rights. To be fair, he referred to his critics as liars first, and evidently Rep. Joe Wilson, R-S.C., took that personally and returned the favor.
\
That Obama is a liar is not a new bit of knowledge, but rather a trend gaining momentum. He lied about past associations with anarchists, radical preachers, criminals, and Marxist teachers previous to the election, he lied with promises he made during the election, and he lied when he promised his plans would prevent unemployment from rising above 8 percent. Obama promised transparency in government, an end to earmarks in bills, no taxes on lower income families, and a new era in politics by changing the old status quo. Instead, what he gave us was a historically huge stimulus bill that was rushed through the Congress before anyone could read it, full of earmarks, that looks to be an abysmal failure. He has allowed Pelosi and cohorts to try to run the same game with a cap-and-trade bill that has many of the same attributes, in addition to raising prices on gasoline, electricity, and natural gas. The result will have negative effect on the environment, impose huge taxes on individuals, result in economic losses in every household, and cause massive GDP losses for the next 20-plus years, and knock out about 850,000 more jobs by 2014.
\
Now he is telling us about a wonderful plan he has, but doesn't; to insure millions, it won't; with no cost, except for the $900 billion that he's going to find somewhere, that doesn't exist. The stimulus bill, cap-and-trade bill, and the health care bill are about nothing more than increasing the federal government's power and transferring wealth to same and that is the status quo. Open your eyes;
\
the emperor isn't wearing any clothes.
\
LANCE KEY Graham Health care reform needed so that all pay their fair share The debate over health care legislation continues to amaze me. One issue in particular seems to be either forgotten or ignored, that is, emergency room care. If you enter any hospital in America, the most expensive care that any ""admit"" receives is in the Emergency Room. Generally, adults and children that are seen most frequently are undocumented and/ or those without health insurance because they do not have or are required to have a primary care physician. Hospitals cannot turn any of these citizens or noncitizens away and if the condition is life-threatening, these uninsured persons are admitted -- free! Who is paying for their health care -- me and every other American who is paying for health care through an insurance company. As a state employee, my monthly premium for my college-age son and myself went up in cost.
\
Why wouldn't every American want legislation that mandates some form of insurance for every American so that everyone pays a fair share of hospital costs? Why wouldn't every American want legislation that prohibits insurance companies from limiting care options for pre-existing illness and limiting the use of the most effective treatments? Why wouldn't every American want the insurance industry monitored for excessive premiums resulting in excessive profits? Why wouldn't every American want legislation that provides more equitable prescription payments and options for obtaining prescription medication? Mr. Melvin King of Mebane (whose letter was published in the Open Forum on Sept. 14): if the government doesn't get involved in health care soon, the only people getting quality care will be the undocumented, and those not insured -- they are admitted into any emergency room in America, no questions asked, no payment required!

COLLEEN MACKLIN Graham Health care proposal offers pie-in-the-sky ideas As I watch the pros (professionals) and cons (conspirators) debate the various proposals for health care along with the public input, it appears many believe all health care should be free to everyone. This would be wonderful if it were possible. Sadly, it is not possible.
\
There are no ""free lunches."" Any government strong enough to give you everything you want is also strong enough to take everything you have. No government ever had a dime it did not take from some hard-pressed taxpayer. What about the government printing presses and all of the ""free"" money they are turning out? Yes, this ""money"" is just as free as the water a dishonest dairy puts in your milk; but take a look at what it does to the milk.
\
In a nine-month period, the Federal Reserve has more than doubled the monetary base of the United States; but the available goods and services have not doubled, they have actually been reduced. This means there is now twice as much money chasing less than the original amount of goods. The prices have to go up. Your money is now worth less than half of what it was originally.
\
You have been taxed through inflation to the amount of more than half your savings.
\
Your next Cadillac will probably be an ""Obamanation"" ""Made in China"" and the good doctor you used to know, who took care of your health needs, probably will have left for Mexico. The foreign market for U.S. Treasury bonds has dried up and these previous creditors are now trying to dispose of what they have, even at a discount. Do you really think the government can support free health care for everyone? The Veterans Administration is currently performing at its worst in history in respect to service incurred disabilities of our war veterans. Currently, it takes six months to process a claim and get to a veterans hospital.
\
The next time you get a knock at the door and someone tells you ""I'm from the government and I'm here to help you"" slam the door real fast and don't forget to lock it.
\
FRANK B. TURBERVILLE JR. Milton Government's history of success a signal health care can work The great prophet of profit, Ronald Reagan, said ""The most terrifying words in the English language are, 'I'm from the government and I'm here to help you.'"" Now it seems that those who subscribe to Reagan's ideas believe that, ""The only thing we have to fear is government itself."" We don't need to fear epidemics of diseases that would ravage us without government efforts to control them or monopolies that dictate prices we will pay or Goldman Sachs picking our pockets and crashing our economy or companies that pollute our groundwater with toxins, most of which should be controlled by government regulation. The blind faith of the Reaganites continues to affirm that these are private industries and as such, they're the 'good guys' we can trust.
\
The federal government built our interstate highway system, the Internet, spearheaded the effort that organized private industry in the successful effort that won World War II, built the Tennessee Valley Authority for western North Carolina and Tennessee where private industry feared to go, invests in medical research bringing us cures for diseases, regulates the food distribution system to keep our food safe from those who would maximize profit at the expense of making it unsafe, delivers mail to areas that private companies won't touch and distributes Social Security money efficiently in spite of politicians raiding the Social Security trust fund.
\
Let's face it. Without government involvement in health care reform there will be no meaningful reform that will help people. Private industry, as always, will only be looking for ways to make a profit.
\
Hating government is accepted as unquestioned wisdom in many quarters and those who do will manufacture arguments to refute this. Most of the arguments they'll use will be real whoppers based on distortions, not facts.
\
Yes, government has many flaws: but so do private initiatives.
\
There will be no perfect health-care system. If we insist on a health-care system without flaws, we'll have none. If we adopt a decent system, there will be glitches, things may work poorly in the beginning, and many will become disenchanted. We'll correct the errors as we always do and we, like every other advanced country has done before us, will be better off for taking the challenge. The present system is killing us health wise and economically. There is no alternative.

To The Editor: Rep. Heath Shuler's defense of his vote in favor of Cap and Trade showed me he does not have our best interest at heart.
\
The point of this bill is to hike up the price of electricity and fuel so that we are forced to use less. This will also drive up the price of every product we buy. Less spending leads to fewer jobs because of production cuts. Some companies will move overseas where there are less restrictions.
\
Unemployment is the highest it has been in 26 years. House Republicans offered (three) amendments to suspend the program if: gas hit $5; electricity prices rose more than 10 percent; unemployment rates hit 15 percent. All were defeated by the Democrats.
\
As for the environment, there are many who say the cost will outweigh the slight benefit gained. This bill has the potential to be the highest tax hike in American history. In my opinion, Heath Shuler sold us out and proved he is just another Washington politician.

After all, we'll all be socialists in heaven where one little fatal flaw called human nature is changed. Until then, it seems that capitalism, with all its ugly defects, is the best among our planet's limited socioeconomic alternatives.

He voted for it when people were not watching every move the House and Senate made and therefore is a true gauge of how he has and will represent us if re-elected. The fact that he will not commit to repeal the Obama health care program forced on all Americans is also an eye opener. Who does he care more about us or Nancy Pelosi?

To The Editor: ""Kids and Disease,"" (Times-News, Sept. 21) should read ""Americans and Diseases."" That's because the bowel disorders, colitis and Crohn's, that are now epidemic to children are also digestive problems suffered by most adults. The Times-News article quotes experts who say our ""too-clean"" environment is the cause not allowing children to fight off bugs that could have strengthened their immune system.
\
Most health research points instead to the American diet as the enemy. White flour, refined grains, animal foods and sugar have no fiber. Their consumption leads to inflammation, poor nutrient absorption and a long, slow movement of undigested thick ""goo,"" barely passing along the 30-foot small and large intestine (colon).
\
The final passage of food (finally) from the colon exposes the whole digestive tract to toxins leaking (leaky gut) into the bloodstream. Crohn's and colitis are not the only problems with the American diet. Add pain, constipation, diverticulitis, irritable bowel and eventually American's major diseases caused by our diet and inflammation, reducing your chance for a long, healthy lifespan.
\
Foods essential for health and disease prevention include diets high in complex carbohydrates, whole fresh plant foods and omega-3 oils. Hamburgers, fries and cokes are not essential.

As near as I can tell, North Carolinians have been jumping up and down and screaming about their taxes for 200 years.\Our roads, bridges and sewer systems are falling apart and many of our schools are subpar. But, for heaven's sake, we cry, ""don't tax us!""\The recent brouhaha over the city council's trip to Washington was idiotic. For about 22 cents per citizen, they went to a conference to learn how to govern more effectively. But from the media reaction you'd think they caught the mayor robbing the poor box.\When will this area grow up and start taking responsibility for running a civilized city and state? Any politician who promises not to raise our taxes or to lower them should be ridden out of town on a rail as a pathological liar.\I don't like paying taxes either, but they are necessary. Waste and corruption are evil, but there has never been a large bureaucracy without them. By all means work to minimize waste and corruption, but let us not use that as an excuse not to pay our taxes.\James D.

The county is intent on bringing in Titan. And the city? How dare the city council members dine out on the public's dime at an expensive steak house when most people are having a hard time buying groceries.\When I worked for the city, a few members of a department were sent to conferences, not the entire department, let alone any spouses. ...\Some members flew, others were paid 55 cents per mile to drive their own cars according to the Star-News. If they all had to go why couldn't they drive city-owned vehicles instead of getting paid for their own cars?\It's absolutely no wonder the residents of Monkey Junction don't want to be annexed. Why would they want to be when this is the kind of money mismanagement they can expect. They obviously do not care about the additional hardship they are going to cause some families. I wish no hardship on any of them, but if some of them were out of a job, maybe they would see things differently. ...\Thomas Toby\Wilmington\Pork or steak?\EDITOR: With the ongoing debate regarding the pork in the stimulus package, how do you determine what is pork and what is filet mignon?\What projects are shovel-ready and what jobs make the shovels?\Projects that seem foolish to some could stimulate the local economy where jobs are scarce.\If cleaning a hog waste pool could provide a cleaner and healthier environment and that waste resulted in organic fertilizer for parks and farms, that seems like work to me.\Government waste will always exist, but $20,000 for a toilet on a battleship smells of pork to me.\Dennis Benjamin\Wilmington\Shameful\EDITOR: I sent in a letter to you before about reintroducing shame into our system.

While we recycle and drive less in an effort to do our part and lessen our impact on the environment, we know that real difference must come from above, and now it's time for our leaders to step up and pass legislation to protect our interests - the economy and the environment - over the interests of big oil and coal companies.\...This is an unprecedented opportunity to release our nation from the grasp of oil and coal dependency, and I ask that Rep.

The economic illiterates in Washington are so impressed with the ""success"" of Cash for Clunkers that they're readying Cash for Clunker Appliances. The ludicrous ""stimulus"" bill gave $300 million to the Department of Energy to provide rebates for 10 types of appliances that have been rated energy efficient.
\
Before government extends Cash for Clunkers to more products, it might be a good idea to examine the original. The fact that Washington and the buyers who took advantage of Cash for Clunkers are gaga is hardly evidence that it was in the public interest.
\
It wasn't. As usual, the program has been judged only by its first and most visible consequences, violating Henry Hazlitt's teaching in his classic, ""Economics in One Lesson."" ""The art of economics consists in looking not merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act or policy; it consists in tracing the consequences of that policy not merely for one group but for all groups."" If you only look at the immediate effects, Cash for Clunkers appears pretty good. People traded in gasguzzlers for more fuel-efficient new cars. The program cut carbon emissions slightly and gave the auto industry a boost.
\
""Manufacturing plants have added shifts and recalled workers. Moribund showrooms were brought back to life, and consumers bought fuel-efficient cars that will save them money and improve the environment,"" Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood bragged. ""American consumers and workers were the clear winners thanks to the Cash for Clunkers program."" But wait. Shouldn't that be some consumers and some workers? And only in the short run?
\
Let's start at the beginning. The government paid car owners to trade in their old cars, which will be destroyed. But the government is running a deficit.
\
So it doesn't have $3 billion to hand out. It must borrow the money, which reduces the amount of money for other investments. Moreover, the government must raise taxes in the future to pay back the principal and interest -- or the Federal Reserve will monetize the debt through inflation. Either way, we pay.
\
That isn't all. Those car buyers were either going to trade in their used cars soon or they weren't.
\
If they were, Cash for Clunkers simply moved up the schedule. The stimulation of the auto industry occurred earlier. Big deal. But if buyers planned to keep their cars longer, the program imposed costs that are less visible. Without the government incentive to buy cars, consumers would have bought other things -- computers, washing machines, televisions. The manufacturers and sellers of those products didn't get to make those sales. Why should the auto industry get privileges at the expense of others?
\
Then there are the mechanics who would have serviced those used cars. They've lost business.
\
Some will be laid off. Nor should we forget low-income people who depend on the used-car market for their transportation. The cheap cars they would have bought were destroyed.
\
What about the alleged environmental benefits? Assuming that cutting carbon emissions is worthwhile, was Cash for Clunkers helpful? It's hard to see why.
\
People who traded in inefficient cars for efficient ones will likely drive more and therefore use more gasoline.
\
Even if carbon emissions are cut by a lot, economist Christopher Knittel says the program will cost more than $365 per ton of carbon saved.
\
Economist Bruce Yandle points out what a lousy deal that is: ""The much celebrated Waxman-Markey cap-and-trade carbon-emission control legislation estimates the cost of reducing a ton of carbon to be $28 when done across U.S.
\
industries. Yes, we are getting carbon-emission reductions by way of clunker reduction, but we are paying a pretty penny for it."" Finally, there is something revolting about the government subsidizing the destruction of useful things. It reminds me of the New Deal policy of killing piglets and pouring milk down sewers to keep food prices from falling.

Thursday marks the 40th anniversary of Earth Day, an event that has attracted millions to environmental causes. But winning passage of meaningful legislation on climate change requires more than slogans and green talk -- it demands intense, determined political action.
\
Earth Day 1970, for which I served as national coordinator, was huge. Twenty million Americans took part. Millions of Americans who didn't know what ""the environment"" was in 1969 discovered in 1970 that they were environmentalists.
\
Moreover, Earth Day was bipartisan. Although there was some antagonism toward President Richard Nixon among the organizers, the campaign was co-chaired by Democratic Sen. Gaylord Nelson and Republican Congressman Pete McCloskey. The 1 million-person event in New York City was chaired by the progressive Republican mayor, John Lindsay.
\
Over the next three years, Congress passed the most far-reaching cluster of legislation since the New Deal -- the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Endangered Species Act and myriad other laws that have fundamentally changed the nation.
\
Trillions of dollars have been spent differently than they would have but for this new regulatory framework.
\
The conclusion the environmental movement drew from this was that it should try to grow as large as possible and to be bipartisan. In recent decades, this hasn't been turning out too well.
\
Although both parties once included important mixtures of left and right, they have become increasingly polarized. In fact, the Republican leadership is now so robustly anti-environmental that the League of Conservation Voters uses affirmative action in evaluating its scorecards. A Democrat with a 60 percent voting record is seen as awful, while a Republican with 60 percent is seen as exceptional. In this context, striving for bipartisan support produces legislation that is at best inadequate and at worst designed to fail to achieve its purpose.
\
Today, the world faces a crisis that only a handful of experts were even vaguely aware of in 1970: climate disruption. Now, after subsequent decades of careful, worldwide, scientific study, the results are clear: We are cooking the planet.
\
Humanity must swiftly abandon dirty power and switch to safe, clean, decentralized, renewable energy sources like solar, wind and geothermal. America has been trailing in these fields for the past 30 years. But America, with its superb universities, entrepreneurial culture and venturesome capital, should lead the way.
\
Leading the way requires a long-term vision, programs with explicit goals and targets, and consistency of purpose. Making this transition will not be cheap, and it may involve some painful dislocations.
\
This won't happen as a result of congressional brilliance and courage. Although Congress has some brilliant, courageous individual members, as an institution it is dumb and cowardly. The only way that Congress will act intelligently and boldly on this issue is if we give it no choice.
\
A large block of Americans must make the climate disruption issue an initial voting screen. If a candidate is OK on climate, then we will look at the rest of his or her record. To move this issue forward, our voices must be as loud as those hollering for the right to carry a Colt into Starbucks or for saving Granny from death panels.
\
This year, Earth Day organizers are demanding a fair, comprehensive and effective climate solution. Regional, state, local and individual policies and actions are already under way.
\
But a sweeping federal law is needed to show the world that America is serious. Such a law is needed to show the coal, oil and electric-utility industries that America is serious.
\
Most experts I know agree, in private, that the Cantwell-Collins bill in the Senate is the best climate legislation that has yet been proposed. In fact, it is the only option under consideration that would make a meaningful dent in greenhouse gas emissions in the near term. It places an absolute cap on carbon where it enters the economy, auctions 100 percent of carbon permits and returns the revenues to the public on a pro rata basis. Moreover, it's just 40 pages long, while the competing bills contain another thousand pages of loopholes, special interest exceptions and bad baggage.
\
The environmental movement has spent more than a billion dollars trying to pass a cap-and-trade bill, and it is feeling some desperation. The people who contributed all that money expect some results. The pressure to pass something -- almost anything -- that arguably puts some sort of cap on carbon is intense.
\
Yet every draft of the climate bill is weaker than its predecessor. Every draft does a poorer job of putting a reasonable price on carbon. Every draft is larded with more taxpayer dollars for socialized, centralized nuclear power and for ""clean coal."" Every draft carries more sweeteners for the utility industry, the automobile industry, the coal and oil industries and the industrial farmers and foresters.
\
Instead of weakening the bill, we need to change the politics. Politicians who try to ignore climate disruption -- and that's a whole lot of them -- need to start losing their jobs in November.
\
We will not win a climate bill that is worthy of the name, a bill that will deal honestly with the full enormity of the threat we are facing, until there exists an intense environmental voting bloc that will subordinate all other issues to climate. That block needs to construct a successful campaign to return some congressional villains to private life -- perhaps even a couple of dozen.
\
We must make it crystal clear to politicians everywhere that we are serious. This issue is too vital and too urgent to do any less.
"
28,"
Rep. Heath Shuler on Wednesday defended his vote on the American Clean Energy and Security Act.
\
Often called the climate change bill, the act seeks to reduce carbon emissions in the United States by 17 percent in 2020 and 83 percent in 2050. It implements a cap-and-trade system, where businesses must buy credits if they pollute above a certain amount.
\
It's estimated the price of a permit to emit carbon dioxide will cost $13 per ton when the program starts in 2012, according to the New York Times.
\
The bill also contains provisions to increase green energy production and provides funding for investments in alternative energy.
\
The vote in the House was close.
\
Shuler joined his fellow Democrats and eight Republicans in the 219-212 vote Friday. Forty-four Democrats opposed the bill, including many of Shuler's colleagues who are members of the conservative Blue Dog coalition.
\
Shuler said he had concerns about the bill when it came out of committee, but provisions were added to make him side with the majority. In particular, he supported an amendment that allowed nuclear power to be considered green energy. He also supported provisions that exempted steel and other high energy-consuming industries.
\
""The offsets were not significant and (the bill) actually allowed Duke Energy to make money,"" Shuler said.
\
Duke Energy, which produces some nuclear power, could sell cap-and-trade credits to other companies that go over their pollution limit.
\
The country has a responsibility to start reducing carbon emissions and pollution and not pass the problem on to the next generation, he said. The bill moves the country forward and starts addressing the problem.
\
""This is the time to stand up and take responsibility,"" Shuler said.
\
Energy companies will pass on the increased cost of producing energy to consumers. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill, which now moves to the Senate, will cost an average household $175 a year. The cost in North Carolina will be $91.25 per household, Shuler said.
\
""It would not take place until 2012,"" he said. ""You are right there with inflation. You are not talking about that much.""
\
Shuler said provisions were added to reduce the burden on lower-income families and tax credits will help pay for household improvements such as weather-proofing houses that will bring down costs. Most homeowners will just need to change light bulbs to energy efficient bulbs and weatherize houses to reduce energy consumption and not see an increased energy bill.
\
""The lower-income people are taken out of the equation,"" Shuler said.
\
The bill could help the economy in Western North Carolina, he said. The area houses the National Climatic Data Center, which monitors climate change, and has several companies that provide energy-reducing services.
\
""It lowers our energy consumption. That lessens our dependence on the Middle East,"" Shuler said.
\
Republicans have pounced on his vote. They believe his recent votes show he has moved to the left and is not sticking to his conservative roots.
\
""It is very clear that Mr. Shuler has said he was a fiscal conservative and a Blue Dog Democrat,"" Henderson County Republican Party Chairman Robert Danos said. ""He threw that out the window. ... I think he has decided to side with the liberal wing of the Democratic Party.""
\
Shuler said he has not abandoned his fiscal conservative beliefs and faith-based values. The legislation, he said, will reduce the deficit, and people of faith should protect the earth and the environment.
\
""Our faith is to be good to the land,"" Shuler said.
\
Danos did not believe the national debt argument, and said the costs of the legislation will be pushed onto consumers.
\
""Of all of the justifications for this job-killing, massive new tax, I have seen not one serious person or business journal suggest that this in any way shape or form can be considered a 'debt reducer,'"" Danos said.""That is absurd. The Wall Street Journal calls it 'the biggest tax in American history.' Can Mr. Shuler explain how that can be a debt reducer?""
\
Shuler said the majority of Democrats who opposed the legislation were those in the left wing of the Democratic Party who wanted stricter legislation. The bill that passed was supported by environmentalists, oil companies and large corporations.
\
Twenty-nine of the 44 Democrats who voted against the bill were members of the conservative Blue Dog Caucus. There are 52 Blue Dogs in Congress.

29,"The news is not good if you are a North Carolina resident striving to stay in the middle class.\Your wages are stagnant. ... Your children's educational opportunities are being compromised. Air and water regulations have been scrapped. Public health safety networks have been riddled with holes. And vital industries, like film, may have been destroyed. In short, living in North Carolina has become a high-risk environment for the middle class.\Right-wing leadership has changed the playing field. Now, instead of government helping people advance economically with good education and aggressive incentives, leadership subscribes to the ""money makes money"" model - which leaves the middle class out. Those with money do well. The problem: North Carolina's current leaders are in the pocket of the rich, and they leverage their influence to make the rich richer at the expense of the average family.\The good news is that this can change.

It is a super PAC - funded by wealthy companies and individuals - and is located in Washington. Its ""adviser"" is Karl Rove, a man who has failed as the Republican's chief strategist.\It advocates against cap-and-trade legislation because it might cost those who use and sell energy a lot of money. Simply put, cap and trade means that energy uses - the carbon footprint by all companies - would be assessed now, and the allowed use would be gradually reduced over time.\Any company that produces a carbon footprint would be required to have permits at least equal to their usage; but usage can be ""traded"" (bought) between companies so that each company can remain in compliance with the law. Over time, we will achieve what we must do, and that is to reduce carbon emissions and try to keep our world a livable place.\Hagan supports this legislation, as she should. For obvious reasons, Crossroads and the Republican Party do not. So, when you read your mail and when you vote, keep in mind that these people aren't interested in us. They have their own political agenda.\Laird F. Miller, Southport\Please keep in mind when you get to vote that there are politicians from North Carolina who want to return to Washington to continue to vote on bills without reading them first.\The good people of North Carolina don't need a rubber stamp for the current administration.

Remember this on Election Day.\Edward Kleinpeter, Wilmington\In ""Democrats hail chariot to insolvency,"" the letter writer's education budget numbers are correct - $10.8 billion for 2010-2011 and $11.8 billion for 2014-15. What the writer chose to ignore was the continuation budget, which is ... that portion of the recommended budget that maintains existing levels of recurring services in agencies for a biennium and covers the level of inflation, increased cost of service required.\For the 2013-15 budget, the state budget office proposed a continuation budget of $23.6 billion for those years to maintain the status quo across K-12 and higher education. The budget state lawmakers passed came to about $23.1 billion. In total, lawmakers allocated $500 million less than the continuation budget suggested, hence the $500 million referred to by Kay Hagan.\This underfunding of the continuation budget eliminates about 5,200 teachers, 3,800 teacher assistants, and about $115 million for textbooks and instructional supplies, and other services. Teacher salaries and per-student spending rank near the bottom nationally, with per student spending at $3,000 less than the national average.\So, is the $500 million a budget cut in education?

Recently the current occupant of the nation's oval office took time to hype the government takeover of healthcare.

In his most recent attempt to increase the national debt another trillion dollars, Obama pitched a plan ""mirroring the Senate bill"" to an American majority who oppose it. In order to push this legislation through he is willing to abandon his past principles, and use political strong-arm tactics on his own party to force the ""holy grail"" of Democrats through the Congress.
\
The impending bill which raises taxes, cuts Medicare, and raises insurance prices, will be forced on the public by an individual mandate complete with monetary penalties, and allows the federal government and all its agencies intrusion into the most personal aspects of your life. According to the Huffington Post, a liberal bastion which opposes the bill, it will force you to pay up 8 percent of your income to private insurance with a 2 percent penalty for not buying, force poor quality unusable insurance on many, tax middle class insurance plans, grant monopolies to drug companies, result in higher costs for the elderly, and still fail to curb rising medical costs.
\
Ed Rollins, of CNN, reports the 2,074-page debacle will add 31 million people to the system resulting in trillions of dollars to taxpayers. Many who can't afford insurance will be subsidized with entitlement programs, which will end as usual in expenses far exceeding estimates.
\
Both sides of the aisle agree to reform, but the use of reconciliation to force a bill onto an unsupportive public and largely divided Congress should be scrapped before it degrades our rights even more. To paraphrase the Post article, the bill is a sinkhole and once people understand the con job being foisted on them they agree.
\
I don't wish for the president's success in this, I hope with all my heart he fails. I support the president, not his mission.

Going green is a wise move
\
I just returned from an inspiring weekend in Nashville with the global leaders of Al Gore's The Climate Project. Whether you are a Republican or a Democrat, evangelical or atheist, global warming denier or a tree hugger, the fact is human consumption and growth is taxing our environment and has put our civilization on a path that is not sustainable. We as humans are optimistic by nature and we want to hear that everything is OK. So when we have record snow in our backyard it is easy to dismiss claims of global warming. For every snowstorm here, there are record droughts on the opposite side of the globe.
\
Forget ""climategate"" e-mails ... the fact is pollution is worsening, global water shortages have caused military skirmishes and fuel consumed from unstable regions has put American lives in danger. Climate change has been identified by our own military as a national security threat as our generals explore scenarios that involve environmental refugees and water shortage wars.
\
Going ""green"" is economically smart -- individually and as a community. Energy efficiency and renewable energy can save money. As we rebuild our ailing economy, the ""green collar"" jobs market is one of the only bright spots in terms of job creation in new manufacturing and service sectors.
\
If China and India follow the same consumption patterns we have, our world is in trouble and our quality of life will quickly diminish. We have to be a better global role model.
\
Realize that whether you believe our global temperature is rising or not that we are polluting our world. Don't believe it when people tell you cap-and-trade legislation is a socialist tax that will be passed along to consumers. In fact, cap-and-trade is a capitalistic structure that allows the market to set the price for polluting.
\
In a recent Op-Ed piece, Al Gore quotes Winston Churchill as having said, ""Sometimes doing your best is not good enough. Sometimes, you must do what is required.""

31,"not consistent with other stands\Consistency in what an elected official says and does is essential to keeping the public trust. On Friday, June 26, Rep. Heath Shuler voted in favor of the ""cap and trade"" bill, probably without reading it. Back when he voted ""no"" to a previous bill, his reasoning was that he could not vote for a bill he had not read. That was a good stand. I myself am not taking a stand on the merits of the ""cap and trade"" bill because I have not read the bill, either. I would, however, be skeptical of a 300-page amendment being added just prior to the bill being put up for a vote.\I voted for Shuler because he stood behind the values that he proclaimed to us three years ago, but now in only three years he has sold us out. Why? There must be a sign at the Capitol building that reads ""Please leave your integrity at the door when you cast your vote in the House of Representatives.""\Next election he will probably win, as most of the voters will forget about his vote and keep their heads in the sand. I only hope that he runs under his true colors.\Michael Graham, Waynesville\Appreciates Shuler's vote for\a better future for our children\I'd like to offer a public ""thank you"" to Congressman Heath Shuler for voting ""yes"" on the ""American Clean Energy and Security Act"" recently. I thank him for his support of the most significant legislation ever passed by Congress to deal with our country's energy and environmental future.\This is the first-ever effort to cut the amount of greenhouse gas emissions, the heat-trapping gases scientists have linked to climate change around the world. The House legislation puts a cap on greenhouse gas emissions and calls for a 17 percent reduction below 2005 levels by 2020. In addition, this legislation will help break our dependence on foreign oil, promote new clean-energy technology, and create millions of new clean-energy jobs.\On behalf of his kids and mine -- I thank him for his commitment to our environment, our economy and our future.\Chuck Dickson, Waynesville\Those 'primitive' health care\systems sure get better results\In the letter, ""Sees socialized medicine differently than recent writers,"" (AC-T, June 20), a retired M.D. who has been to Europe, Canada and England (no longer in Europe?), claims that their hospitals are ""primitive."" Are they using rattles or tiger glands or ""bleeding"" patients? How does this equate with the fact that, while costing half of our own medical expenses, they finish miles ahead in such vital criteria as longevity and childhood mortality? And what of the development of DNA by British Neanderthals?\By saying that they can handle ""minor health problems"" (removing splinters, perhaps?), he implies that ophthalmology or oncology are beyond them -- a lovely touch. The bottom line is that when questioned, residents of these countries are adamantly opposed to trading their system for ours.\And what of our ""socialized medicine"" -- Medicare, Medicaid and what Congress gets? Unsatisfactory?\The common claim that a third party -- the government -- would come between a patient and doctor is bogus. There's also a third party there -- insurance companies working assiduously to cancel or water down coverage.\Joseph Haley, Hendersonville\Recent letters on health care\reform caught reader's eye\A comment on two of the letters in the paper on Saturday, June 27: The letter, ""Primitive or not, those other countries deliver the results"" had it right. The government-run system in Canada beats the U.S. system hands-down, and everyone in Canada -- everyone -- is covered.\On the other hand, the author of ""Has seen socialized medicine up close and did not like it"" doesn't know what she is talking about. I grew up in Canada, too. Canada has never had a socialist government. Canada does have one of the one of the highest-rated health care systems in the world and Canadians are healthier, in many categories, than many other countries, including the U.S. There are no ""waits"" for life-threatening conditions, only waits for things like knee replacements and other elective surgeries.\Canadians love their health care system, which is a universal coverage single-payer system. Hopefully, we will see a government-managed health care option here in the U.S. before the year is out, in spite of the inaccuracies being stated by some of our conservative neighbors and Republican politicians.\Hal Davis, Asheville\The hope and change don't\seem to be for the better\Barack Obama, during his campaign for the presidency of these United States, promised that if elected he would bring ""change"" to America. Sadly, no one asked what kind of ""change"" he was talking about.\It would appear that our current president and administration are bent on destroying the capitalist system that has served our nation so well for 233 years, and replacing it with a socialist system, which has proven disastrous to every nation that has adopted it.\George Ingle, Asheville\Abortion not quite such\a black-and-white issue\The author of the letter, ""History will judge US for allowing abortion on its soil,"" (AC-T, June 26), vilifies all who support late-term abortion. His letter implies that this type of abortion is a selective procedure ""even more evil than early ones."" His pontification ignores a lot of important facts regarding this procedure. Let's examine them.\In 2003, former President Bush signed into law a bill preventing the performance of late-term abortion. This bill has one exception; the procedure may be used to protect the life of the mother. Consequently, the procedures performed by Dr. Tiller were not elective birth control. Rather, they were medical procedures necessary to protect life and they represent less than two tenths of 1 percent of all abortions (2 in 1,000).\In his letter he states, ""I am pro-life; all life is important."" I would assume that ""all life"" would include the life of the mother, but he makes no provision for it. I suggest that the letter writer has an option if he is opposed to abortion. He can work toward the prevention of unwanted pregnancies by supporting sex education and contraception methods. Labeling doctors who perform procedures to save lives as ""wicked"" will only foment more hate and less understanding.\Wes Davis, Brevard"
32,"Air pollution needs to be \a front-burner issue again \In the wake of the devastating events of Sept. 11, it was appropriate for the Bush administration to put environmental concerns on the back burner while other matters more urgently related to our survival took precedence. \But the ongoing war on terrorism cannot indefinitely distract the nation from confronting the problem of air pollution, a wholly domestic threat whereby we are poisoning the element most critical to our survival. \Air pollution is causing people to become sick and some to die and it is causing an enormous amount of damage to the natural environment. \In November, hearings were held on a bill sponsored by Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., that would require power plants to cut emissions of four major pollutants, nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, mercury and carbon dioxide, by 75 percent to 90 percent by 2007. It would also remove exemptions for old coal-fired power plants that were grandfathered under the Clean Air Act. Since November, no action has been taken on the Jeffords bill, though work appears to be going on in the background. \Meanwhile, the Bush administration is working on a bill of its own, but Dave Ryan, a spokesman for the Environmental Protection Agency, said he doesn't know when the bill will be ready. \According to the Nov. 1 testimony of EPA assistant administrator Jeff Holmstead before Jeffords' committee, the Bush administration wants to use a market-based trading system to encourage utilities to reduce and cap emissions of nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide and mercury from power generation. \The trading system would be based on the acid rain cap and trade program included in the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments signed into law by the first President Bush. \Holmstead told the committee the acid rain program is achieving its emission reduction goal at a fraction of the estimated costs because it allows and encourages innovative thinking and long range planning. \An emissions credit trading program may be a workable idea if limits are established on the amount of credits any single plant could buy. It won't matter to people living in a specific community or area if the overall reduction goals are achieved, but their community continues to suffer because it's downwind of a dirty plant that continues to operate by buying lots of credits. \Holmstead told Jeffords' committee the acid rain program has not resulted in such ""hot spots,"" but safeguards should be written into the law. \Of paramount importance will be the emission reduction goals themselves. \Jeffords should not compromise with the administration on the amount of reduction that must be achieved, nor should he compromise on the reduction of the greenhouse gas, carbon monoxide. \Carbon dioxide, included in Jeffords' bill, was noticeably missing from Holmstead's list of pollutants. \The Bush administration is right to look for ways to achieve reductions in the most effective and cost-efficient manner, but no matter the system adopted, there will be a cost for cleaner air and we will all have to help pay it. \The alternative -- continuing to have our health and environment compromised by air pollution -- is unacceptable. \This bill will be a major test of the President. Some of his most generous supporters would love to see this issue go away. \Will his administration really work with Congress to craft a bill that achieves the needed reductions or will there be gridlock on this as there was the stimulus package?

35,"Editor's note: Today we present the second of two sets of candidate views in local high-profile primary contests. Today, Republican and Democratic candidates for the US House seat in the 11th Congressional District offer their views.\GOP CANDIDATES Dr. Dan Eichenbaum\In the tradition of our founding fathers I am standing up for election from the 11th district of N.C. The people's government has become controlled by a gang of interchangeable thieves and liars who sacrifice principle for political expediency and run for office for personal gain. As a citizen of this great country I feel that if we are to pull ourselves back from the brink of financial catastrophe and create prosperity then we must purge our system of immoral and irresponsible politicians. We must instead hire statesmen who will go to Washington to do the limited work of the people.\Our nation faces a severe deficit in moral leadership. Incumbent politicians have become so corrupt and out of touch that they actually boast, unapologetically, about legislation they propose or votes they cast that contain absurd earmarks and special interest favors.\As a Vietnam-era veteran, a 34-year practicing physician, a small business owner, and a proud husband and father, I feel that I am uniquely qualified to tackle the tough challenges facing our nation today. I plan to go to Washington, not as a career move, but to continue serving my country and the people of Western North Carolina honorably.\When in Congress, the U.S. Constitution will guide every vote I cast. I will never waver from the principles of limited government, individual liberty, fiscal restraint, personal responsibility, and free market economics. I will restore transparency and accountability back to the citizens' congressional seat in Western North Carolina. My plan includes doing away with taxes that punish achievement, leaving health care decisions up to doctors and patients, respecting individuals, and getting government out of the way of job creation.\I am a man who makes promises and keeps them. In the uniform, I swore an oath to defend my country. As a doctor, I've sworn to the Hippocratic oath to protect and defend life. As a candidate, I have signed a bonded pledge to serve only three terms. My legislative service will resemble my entire professional career; diagnosing problems and prescribing meaningful solutions.\Dr. Dan Eichenbaum\Residence: Murphy\Occupation: Ophthalmologist\Web site: http://drdan4\congress.com\Caption: Dr. Dan Eichenbaum\James ""Jake"" Howard\I can be pithy, but most of all straightforward. Not one of the five congressional other candidates have ""any"" political or party experience; except myself. This race is all about Republican voters wanting to win back their District 11 seat. There are two choices the voters have. They can vote for any of the five candidates who have the ""desire,"" but no experience; or voters can cast their ""victory vote"" for the only candidate with experience (and desire) who can defeat Heath Shuler in November. That candidate is James ""Jake"" Howard.\I have been at all levels of Republican politics working side-by-side with our 40th President, Ronald Reagan, while Executive Director of the Republican Party. In 1992 I defeated an eight-year Republican sheriff by gaining 54% of total votes. My website was designed so voters could follow my ""Republican Career"" over 35 years.\In closing I ask you view my website and sites of the other five candidates. If anyone has the experience to defeat Heath Shuler, that's where you and the voters will find it! Ronald Reagan once told me he ""never met a Republican who did not have common sense."" I agreed. And I predict that experience will win back our seat.\James ""Jake"" Howard\Residence: Franklin\Occupation: Retired commercial helicopter pilot and sheriff's deputy\Web site: jameshowardfor\congress.com\Caption: James ""Jake"" Howard\Ed Krause\All of the six Republican congressional candidates are solid conservatives and there is not much differences in our philosophies. However, I am the most qualified to serve in Congress because of my life experiences.\For the past 35 years I have operated a business in Asheville that has met a payroll every month and dealt with the pressure of many different deadlines at one time. As a lawyer, I come into contact with people who have been laid off, disabled, underemployed or have lost their homes. My law practice has helped thousands of clients with a wide variety of circumstances throughout the District. Our federal representative must be a problem solver.\I am the only candidate to serve two terms on a local elective board (1991-1996, Madison County School Board). This is crucial training for Congress.\Presently my wife and I live in McDowell County with our 17-year-old adopted son. I have five other children ranging in ages from 29-40.\My military service was with the NC National Guard 211 MP Co. in Asheville. I have been involved in community organizations such as Boy Scouts in the Daniel Boone Council, Asheville Lions Club, Madison County Rotary Club and Habitat for Humanity. I have authored three novels about small town living.\My top priority would be to revive our economy by reducing taxes so that individuals and corporations can have more capital to spend and invest to increase jobs. There needs to be immediate meaningful tax reform to make it business friendly (Investment Tax Credits and repeal of Capital Gains Tax). The national debt must be dealt with by controlling federal spending. (Eliminate the Federal Reserve, IRS with the Fair Tax, and the Departments of Education and Energy.\I would also strive for energy independence from foreign sources. This is a matter of national security. Offshore drilling, nuclear energy, and conservation efforts must be expanded. Rail service is the most energy efficient means of transportation.\Ed Krause\Residence: Marion\Occupation: Attorney\Web site: edkrausefor\congress.com\Caption: Ed Krause\Greg Newman\I am a native of Henderson County and graduated from A.C. Reynolds High School and UNC Asheville. After law school, I served as a prosecutor and then returned to Hendersonville. I am an attorney with Blanchard Newman & Blackwell. My wife, Kim, and I have been married for 25 years and we have three children: Ryan, a sophomore at Clemson, Alexis, a sophomore at Hendersonville High School, and Parker, a third grader at Mountain Community Charter School. My family and I attend First Baptist Hendersonville, where I serve as a deacon. I have consistently supported the rights of the unborn, traditional marriage, and the Second Amendment.\In 2005 I was elected as the first Republican Mayor of Hendersonville. As a former prosecutor and Mayor, I have a proven conservative record of fighting crime, cutting spending, and opposing tax increases. Last year I became increasingly fed up with Washington and decided to run for Congress.\Just like President Ronald Reagan I will work for the elimination of the Cabinet departments of Education and Energy and in addition Homeland Security. Along with fundamentally reforming entitlement spending and taxes similar to a proposal by Congressman Paul Ryan, we can meet our obligations to our seniors as well as maintaining the world's strongest military to defend our freedom. By cutting spending, encouraging innovation, and entrepreneurship, America will once again lead the world in creating good paying jobs, especially by making our manufacturing sector globally competitive.\America cannot continue to afford to send individuals to Washington who refuse to make the tough decisions. My Republican opponents, as well as Congressman Shuler, have yet to develop a plan to control spending. Shuler's best effort has been some vague, poll-tested talking points from the Blue Dog Coalition. Western North Carolina deserves better.\Greg\Newman\Residence: Hendersonville\Occupation: Attorney, former Hendersonville mayor\Web site: gregnewmanfor\congress.com\Caption: Greg Newman\Jeff Miller\The reason I am running for Congress is that I want to bring common sense back to Washington. As a small businessman I have shared the pain that so many people have felt during this recession. I believe we need to bring back fiscal restraint. Washington has become out of touch with what main street Americans, like ourselves, are experiencing. As a small businessmen I know what it takes to make a budget and live by it -- something I feel Washington can no longer do.\I want to fight to protect our jobs and help create new ones. I want to make it easier for small businesses to keep employees and hire new ones. To start I will cut taxes on small businesses starting with salary tax, income tax and corporate tax. I believe if we give the money back to small businesses they can use that to hire more employees and help get people back to work.\I am not a career politician but I do believe in service to others. As your congressman I will have some of the best constituents' services and I will never hide from the people of my district.\I have proven record of leadership. I helped found the local Boys and Girls Club in Hendersonville, helped found the Heritage Museum, served on the board of Pardee Hospital, but my greatest passion was founding HonorAir and co-founding the Honor Flight Network, a non-profit organization that has flown over 40,000 World War II Veterans to Washington DC, free of cost, to see their memorial.

People do not mind working for what they receive, but they need jobs! I believe with the policies and the bills coming out of Washington the people realize that our government is out of control. This is why I'm running.\I believe we need to put God and character back in this great nation. We have disregarded him long enough. We need men and women of character that know the difference between right and wrong. We need to lower taxes on all businesses -- payroll, capital gains and corporate. We need to trust in free market principles that have served this nation throughout its creation. This government spending is out of control. The government does not create jobs, the private sector does.\We all have watched our government take control of different sectors of this economy. While people are being laid off in the private sector government jobs are growing. This must stop! This Congress is passing bills that are killing job growth throughout WNC. The health ""control"" bill will cause greater job loss. The Cap and Trade bill that Rep. Shuler voted yes on will send our energy bills through the roof. Washington needs to let us have Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of happiness, which is in our Declaration of Independence.\I believe our nation will survive because we have stared adversity down so many times, but it was due to our faith in God realizing he created this ""one nation under God.""

As a leader of the fiscally responsible and influential Blue Dog Coalition, I am committed to balancing our budget and reducing the national debt.\I was proud that in the 111th Congress we were successful in reinstituting Pay-As-You-Go budgeting rules that mandate Congress to balance its budget like families and small businesses. I am committed to protecting and conserving God's creation.

To lead these sectors, we should provide our schools more resources at all levels. Additionally, small businesses are vital in this region and we must support them in every way feasible.\I oppose deforestation, mountaintop mining, or heavy industrial manufacturing that degrades our natural environment.\I would have voted for the Health Insurance Reform bill. Moving forward, we must contain costs with measures like interstate competition, electronic medical records, tort reform, standardized coding, and billing and promotion of wellness.\I reject intolerance in any form and I would have voted for the Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes bill.\The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq must end.

36,"On TV, in print ads, and with utility bills, our residents are being bombarded with advertisements trying to scare citizens in a variety of ways.\Seniors are being told they will lose up to 50% of their health care benefits. This is FALSE. The only change to seniors on Medicare concerns their Medicare Advantage plans. These plans are a bonus to private insurers and are unnecessary since regular Medicare provides proper health insurance. We don't have to enrich the pockets of health insurers with Medicare dollars.\Your utility, like BEMC, is trying to scare you into believing your utility bill will rise sharply because of the Cap and Trade bill approved by Congress. Though there may be very small increases in your bills, the purpose of this legislation is to stop environmental pollution which is contributing to global warming. Yes, each person may have to contribute a small amount to make this happen, but it is for the common good and for future generations.\The Chamber of Commerce (CC) ads are particularly misleading. Small businesses can't afford today's health care costs, and the reforms in Congress will help these businesses. But the CC is representing their big Health Insurance members who are fighting reform with dollars better spent on health care.\This is our chance to say NO to the special interests and YES to the Health Reform and protecting our environment which most Americans need and want.

38,"
Rep. Heath Shuler defended his vote today on the American Clean Energy and Security Act.
\
Often called the climate change bill, the act seeks to reduce carbon emissions in the United States by 17 percent in 2020 and 83 percent in 2050. The legislation implements a cap and trade system, where businesses must buy credits if they pollute above a certain amount. It is estimated that the price of a permit to emit carbon dioxide will cost $13 per ton when the program starts in 2012, according to the New York Times.
\
The bill also contains provisions to increase green energy production and provides funding for investments in alternative energy.
\
The vote in the House was close.
\
Shuler joined his fellow Democrats and eight Republicans voting for passage in a 219-212 vote on Friday. Forty-four Democrats opposed the bill including many of Shuler's colleagues who are members of the conservative Blue Dog coalition.
\
Shuler said he had concerns about the bill when it came out of committee, but provisions were added to make him side with the majority. In particular, he supported an amendment that allowed nuclear power to be considered green energy. He also supported provisions that exempted steel and other high-energy consuming industries.
\
""The offsets were not significant and (the bill) actually allowed Duke Energy to make money,"" Shuler said.
\
The country has a responsibility to start reducing carbon emissions and pollution and not pass the problem on to the next generation, he said. The bill moves the country forward and starts addressing the problem, he said.
\
""This is the time to stand up and take responsibility,"" Shuler said.
\
The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill, which now moves to the Senate, will cost an average household $175 a year. The cost in North Carolina will be $91.25 per household, Shuler said.
\
""It would not take place until 2012,"" Shuler said. ""You are right there with inflation. You are not talking about that much.""
\
Shuler said provisions were added to reduce the burden on lower income families and tax credits will help pay for the household improvements. Most homeowners will just need to change light bulbs to energy efficient bulbs and weatherize houses to reduce energy consumption and not see an increased energy bill.
\
""The lower income people are taken out of the equation,"" Shuler said.
\
The bill could help the economy in Western North Carolina, Shuler said. The area houses the National Climatic Data Center, which monitors climate change, and has several companies that provide energy-reducing services.
\
""It lowers our energy consumption. ... That lessens our dependence on the Middle East,"" Shuler said.
\
Republicans have pounced on Shuler's vote. They believe Shuler's recent votes show he has moved to the left and is not sticking to his conservative roots.
\
""It is very clear that Mr. Shuler has said he was a fiscal conservative and a Blue Dog Democrat,"" Henderson County Republican Party Chairman Robert Danos said of the conservative Democratic caucus. ""He threw that out the window. ... I think he has decided to side with the liberal wing of the Democratic Party.""
\
Shuler said he has not abandoned his fiscal conservative beliefs and faith-based values. The legislation, he said, will reduce the deficit, and people of faith should protect the earth and the environment.
\
""Our faith is to be good to the land,"" Shuler said.

The 55-year-old business owner touched on classic GOP themes regarding terrorism, the environment and health care -- criticizing the federal cap and trade pollution control program and the use of civilian trials for alleged terrorists and promoting limits on medical malpractice lawsuits.\But he also struck a bipartisan chord, saying blame for problems is not Democrats' alone.

Kay Hagan's Asheville office on Tuesday, calling on the Democratic senator to pass health care reform legislation.\Along with a petition signed by thousands of members of the group, moveon presented a member of Hagan's staff with results of an online survey conducted by the organization that said 72 percent of moveon members won't support Democratic members of Congress who vote against health care reform. The group also sought a meeting with the senator, who is in Washington, when she comes to Asheville."
40,"in health care debate\Recently we have been bombarded with demonstrations of certain people acting unruly during health care meetings. As Americans, we have every right to express our opinions, especially pertaining to important topics such as the current health care debate.\However, yelling and shouting will not accomplish anything of a meaningful nature. We are currently emphasizing people's dubious actions, rather than working toward worthwhile solutions.\In relation to this type of behavior, I spent the last nine years of my teaching career at a high school for at-risk (i.e. dropout) students.\Unfortunately, many of them acted in a very unruly manner, e.g. yelling, shouting, etc. Our task as teachers was to teach them alternative methods of behavior. Hopefully, they learned that their methods of behavior were simply harmful to them.\In conclusion, I would hope that as mature, competent citizens, we can set an example and demonstrate that calm, open discussions will inevitably result in solutions which are best for everyone in our society. Disrespectful behavior should never be tolerated; we can act better than this. Let's move on and set a good example of how things should be done.\Dr. Charles F. Gorgoglione, Franklin\CATO Institute to sponsor\local program on liberty\The Constitution needs your support. If you believe in individual rights, as stated in the Constitution, are you under attack?

Heath Shuler voted for ""Cap and Trade,"" saying it is for the environment and our kids. That is not true. It is about government control.

To say that the Christian street preachers were ""angry sounding"" depends on the receiver's understanding.\The writer will find in his Bible that even Jesus not only sounded angry, He sometimes was (see John 2:13-16). Nonetheless, Jesus, John the Baptist, the disciples and preachers to follow preach compassion, forgiveness and love. But preachers also often shout the message because of the urgency of the matter; that the penalty of our own sin (anything that is contrary to God's Holiness as described throughout the Bible) will result in our eternity in hell.\If a person was helplessly and noisily sinking in quicksand and someone shouted to them, ""Take my hand and I will rescue you,"" that person can believe they will be rescued if they grab the rescuer's hand or perish, perhaps saying to themselves ""oh, there has to be another way to safety...I can save myself.""\Jesus said the message of salvation must be preached Matthew 24:14 and 28:19 because He loves us. We will all face Jesus someday, either as our Savior or Judge.\Stan Taylor, Asheville"
41,"It's time for responsible citizens to force our unwilling government to reduce deadly mercury pollution\Recently I came across an ad in USA Today that proclaimed in bold letters: ""Your children are being poisoned..."" I assumed the rest of this sentence would conclude with the words ""by drugs.""\However I was shocked when the final words of this statement were ""by deadly mercury."" As a teenager, I am constantly bombarded by anti-drug propaganda: at school, on the computer and especially on television.\Although I seldom watch TV, every time I do, I see yet another government anti-drug commercial. One of my favorites ran a couple of years ago and showed eggs frying and then compared this to ""your brain on drugs.""\Many of these commercials encourage kids to use former first lady Nancy Reagan's famous statement when offered drugs: ""Just say NO!"" Now when I see these commercials, I am perplexed about the government's stance on brain damage.\To me, it seems that the government says it's not OK to voluntarily cause your own brain damage by doing drugs (and mind you, I'm not disagreeing with this), but it is fine for major industrial polluters to weave their way around laws and release mercury into the water and air, causing neurological damage in thousands of children who have not, unlike drug users, voluntarily chosen to ingest this poisonous element.\Once again, the government, the laws, big corporations and the politicians seem to be contradicting themselves.\The dangers caused by mercury are not a new discovery; the effect of mercury has been known since the 19th century. The effect of mercury on child development is devastating.\The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that one in eight women have mercury concentrations in their bodies that are higher than the safety levels. Furthermore, they calculate that each year 630,000 children in the United States -- 1,800 children in North Carolina -- are born at risk due to unsafe maternal mercury blood levels.\These affected children will experience the symptoms of irreversible brain damage: a decline in motor skills, learning capacity and memory. The danger of mercury has prompted the Food and Drug Administration to warn all women of childbearing age to limit the amount of fish they eat to minimize the risks associated with mercury poisoning.\Coal-burning power plants are the nation's largest unregulated source of mercury air emissions, discharging close to 48 tons of it per year. Despite knowing that mercury emissions can and should be reduced by 90 percent (about 43 tons annually) by 2008, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently unveiled a plan that will weaken the Clean Air Act.\At best, this plan will reduce mercury emissions by only about half by 2018. EPA models suggest that the 70 percent goal many not be reached until 2025, if ever.\Although the President Bush proposal could potentially cut mercury emissions by 70 percent, it may increase the concentration of mercury emissions at particular facilities by allowing industrial polluters to buy and sell ""emission credits"" among themselves, beginning in 2010.\Mercury, a heavy element, will remain close to the site of emission, creating high levels of concentration near power plants. The EPA's own Children's Health Protection Committee says the ""cap and trade"" plan does not go as far as it can to reduce mercury emissions and thus does not sufficient protect our nation's children.\At the end of February the EPA had three national hearings, one of which was held in Raleigh. As a result of the comments heard at the hearings, the EPA decided to extend the period for comments on the proposed mercury rule to April 30.\As responsible citizens of this country, we must ask the EPA to uphold the stipulations laid out in the Clean Air Act and to aim for a 90 percent reduction of mercury by 2008. The comments during the first period were effective; let's make sure the comments during the second period are, too.\I implore the people of this country to ""just say no"" to brain damaging substances like mercury because, your children, like everyone else's, deserve to breathe clean air and grow up in a healthy environment.\Sarah Heath Olesiuk is a senior at Asheville High and an intern with Appalachian Voices.

42,"
Intelligent people agree that, absent immediate radical action regarding global warming, the human race is sunk. That is a tautology because those who do not agree are, definitionally, unintelligent.
\
Britain's intelligent Prime Minister Gordon Brown gives scary precision to the word ""immediate."" By his reckoning, humanity now has about 30 days to save itself. He says that unless a decisive agreement is reached at the 192-nation summit on climate change that opens Dec. 7 in Copenhagen, all is lost.
\
So, all is lost. The chances of a comprehensive and binding treaty are approximately nil.
\
The fourth of five parlays preparing for Copenhagen occurred in Bangkok from Sept. 28 through Oct. 9, with delegates from about 180 nations participating. Remember diplomat George Kennan's axiom that the unlikelihood of reaching an agreement is the square of the number of parties at the table? The meeting adjourned with, as usual, essentially no progress toward an agreement on reduced emissions by developed nations or on the money such nations should pay to finance developing nations' efforts against global warming.
\
The New York Times reports that ""the United Nations Adaptation Fund, which officially began operating in 2008 to help poor countries finance projects to blunt the effects of global warming, remains an empty shell, largely because rich nations have failed to come through with the donations they promised."" The fund has a risible $18 million, which might not cover the cost of the Copenhagen conference.
\
There they will experience more futility because of, among other things, two stubborn facts the two most populous nations.
\
On Oct. 21, China, the world's leading emitter of greenhouse gases, and India, which ranks fourth together they account for 26 percent of emissions jointly agreed: They, with their combined one-third of the world's population, will not play in what increasingly resembles a global game of climate-change charades.
\
Neither nation is interested in jeopardizing its economic growth with emission caps of a sort that never impeded the growth of the developed nations that now praise them.
\
But do not really embrace them. Recently, the U.S. House of Representatives took time out from fending off the world and exempted large cattle, dairy and hog producing operations from an Environmental Protection Agency requirement for reporting greenhouse gas emissions. And 13 Great Lakes cargo ships were exempted from a proposed mandate requiring the use of low-sulfur fuel.
\
When constituents' interests conflict with global grandstanding, Congress' rule is ""act locally, think globally tomorrow, maybe.""
\
In their new book, ""SuperFreakonomics,"" Steven D. Levitt, a University of Chicago economist, and Stephen J. Dubner, a journalist, worry about global warming but revive some inconvenient memories of 30 years ago. Then intelligent people agreed (see the aforementioned) that global cooling threatened human survival.
\
It had, Newsweek reported, ""taken the planet about a sixth of the way toward the Ice Age average.""
\
Some scientists proposed radical measures to cause global warming for example, covering the arctic ice cap with black soot that would absorb heat and cause melting.
\
Levitt and Dubner also spoil some of the fun of the sort of the ""think globally, act locally"" gestures that are liturgically important in the church of climate change.
\
For example, they say the ""locavore"" movement people eating locally grown foods from small farms actually increases greenhouse gas emissions.
\
They cite research showing that only 11 percent of such emissions associated with food are in the transportation of it; 80 percent are in the production phase and, regarding emissions, big farms are much more efficient.
\
Although the political and media drum beat of alarm is incessant, a Pew poll shows that only 57 percent of Americans think there is solid evidence of global warming, down 20 points in three years.
\
Gallup shows that only 1 percent of Americans rank the environment as their biggest worry. Two reasons are:
\
They are worried about their wages, which will not be improved by clobbering a weak economy with the costs of a cap-and-trade carbon-reduction regime. And climate Cassandras are learning the wages of crying ""Wolf!""
\
In 2005, global warming worriers warned, as they tend to do after all adverse or anomalous environmental events, that Hurricane Katrina was caused by global warming and foreshadowed an increase in the number and destructiveness of hurricanes. As this year's Atlantic hurricane season ends, only three hurricanes have formed half the average of the past 50 years and none have hit the United States.

43,"
Our water supply is now safer thanks to coal ash legislation passed during the waning hours of this summer's session of the North Carolina General Assembly.
\
Despite its flaws, and despite Gov. Pat McCrory's concerns over how to execute the legislation, the Coal Ash Management Act of 2014 guarantees something meaningful will be done to dispose of the mountains of coal ash, produced by coal-fired power plants, currently held in 33 unlined dumps across the state. Environmentalists should draw at least three lessons from the bill:
\
First, the best time to enact meaningful environmental legislation is immediately following a disaster.
\
The dumping of millions of tons of coal ash residue by Duke Energy over the last several decades was never a mystery. It took February's 39,000-ton coal ash spill in Eden, however, for us to take the ever-expanding environmental problem seriously.
\
If state lawmakers had not passed a bill this session, the coal ash problem would have likely been ignored indefinitely. A long and sad history demonstrates the decline of political will as environmental tragedies become distant memories.
\
Hurricane Katrina may have been the costliest storm in U.S. history, but the stream of financial resources for reconstructing levees outside New Orleans dried up with each passing year. The levees are done now, though engineering experts agree they will not withstand another Katrina. Hurricane Sandy likewise turned heads for several weeks. It just wasn't long enough for us to restore the New Jersey wetlands that would have protected homeowners against the storm's onslaught.
\
Environmentalists should strike hard while the iron is hot.
\
Second, the Coal Ash Management Act teaches that even Republicans can get behind environmental legislation.
\
Democrats may have a better reputation of championing environmental causes such as reducing greenhouse gases and harmful algal blooms, but it was Republicans who pushed through the coal ash bill. In contrast many Democrats dragged their feet, and a few even voted against the bill.
\
To be fair, some Democratic dissenters felt the legislation did not go far enough to protect the environment. It is also probably true that some Republican lawmakers simply responded to prevailing public opinion during an election year and were not motivated by environmental concerns.
\
Nevertheless, this year taught us that even diehard conservatives can rally behind environmental causes. In fact, Republicans historically have designed many wonderful environmental solutions. They invented national parks. They also reduced acid rain dramatically through an innovative market-based cap-and-trade system that regulates sulfur and nitrogen emissions. Clearly conservatives can coexist with conservation.
\
Finally, addressing tough environmental problems requires tough choices.
\
The root of the coal ash dilemma, after all, is not an environmental issue. It's an economic issue. We consumers want affordable power. Right now burning coal is the cheapest way to get it. Environmentalists who assume solar and wind could easily substitute for coal need to more seriously consider alternative points of view. I love solar and wind, but they are not as cheap or as convenient as burning coal . . . at least not yet.
\
Republicans were correct to grant Duke Energy the chance of passing on to its customers some of its cleanup costs - currently estimated to be about $10 billion, or about $1,000 per resident of North Carolina. Some liberals have demanded cleanup costs be assimilated entirely by Duke Energy and its shareholders. I am skeptical, however, that such a massive sum of money could be squeezed from Duke and its shareholders.
\
Furthermore, when power companies pass on environmental cleanup costs to customers, it sends an important and powerful message - that consumers must pay all the costs associated with the electricity they want.
\
If generating electricity results in the production of arsenic-infested coal ash, why should consumers not have to pay for its proper disposal? In a capitalist society, we simply cannot have our cake and eat it, too.
\
So here is my toast to the first meaningful government legislation ever to address the coal ash disposal problem.

44,"COLUMNIST\Michael Mann was trying to reconstruct the past climate from tree rings, coral reefs, ice cores and other data when he discovered a disturbing pattern. The temperatures have gone in a plateau for the past 1,000 years, but have shot up considerably in the past few decades.\That graph looked a lot like a hockey stick.\Little did Mann know that that graphic would become a icon in the climate debate that has heated up our politics.\Mann would feel like a hockey player himself, suddenly beset by NHL enforcers bashing him into the boards. Unfortunately, there have been no penalties called in what's become a no-holds-barred brawl.\Mann landed Monday at Asheville Regional Airport and was picked up by Dave and Marjorie McGuirk, who held up a welcome sign on a hockey stick.\""At first, I thought it was a protester out to get me. Then I noticed the ribbons and the festive air of the sign and knew it was a friend coming to get me,"" Mann said.\Mann, a leading climatologist at Pennsylvania State University, was in town last week at UNC Asheville, Warren Wilson College and the National Climatic Data Center, discussing how climatology became so controversial in this country's political discourse.\Many Republican politicians and voters have rejected the idea that the Earth is warming in large part because of fossil fuels burned into the atmosphere. Even the vast majority of scientists see no debate.\But Mann's hockey stick graph has held up over the past decade, along with lots of other data. In fact, there's a whole hockey league of graphs joining Mann's research, showing that the world's climate is heating up at an unprecedented rate for millennia.\Mann said that climate critics have borrowed the tactics of the tobacco industry in the '50s, '60s, and '70s to slow down any regulation of their product, arguing that the science was ""unsettled"" that smoking is a leading cause of cancer.\""Rather than a good-faith debate, they chose to obscure the facts, and that old tactic has been applied to climate change,"" Mann said.\Mann is no martyr, but he's been the point of attack by plenty of politicians and others. Rep. Joe Barton, the Texas Republican who actually apologized to BP in the wake of the Gulf oil spill, subpoenaed Mann for all his emails, until other Republicans put the nix on such a scientific witch hunt.\The climate controversy has done us no favors, poisoning our political discourse and undermining that common ground of scientific inquiry that all reasonable people should be able to meet upon.\What's at stake is the economic climate of Asheville. With the NCDC in our downtown, the repository of the world's weather and climate records and the brainpower of our resident scientists, Asheville is an epicenter for research into just how the climate is changing.\But without an agreed national policy and political foot-dragging, we're not seeing the growth in the research and technical jobs needed to tackle the challenge.\The debate isn't whether the Earth is warming. You have to cherry-pick through all the numbers to ignore the overall trend of an Earth a whole degree hotter than a century ago, or the potential for a planet that's on average 5 or more degrees warmer in the next few decades.\The debate should be: What's our best approach to deal with hotter summers, more drought and wildfire, or even more extreme weather events?\There are real differences to be resolved and solutions that should be advanced from both conservative and liberal perspectives. Should we go nuclear, which has no greenhouse gases? Or is that too hazardous after Fukushima? Can we save money and create local jobs by going more solar, at least to heat water? What about electric cars? Does cap-and-trade (originally proposed by Republicans) or a carbon tax really make sense in a shaky recovery from our worst economic downturn in generations?\If simple physics dictates that the more fossil fuels we burn into the atmosphere will raise temperatures, melt ice caps and potentially flood coastlines worldwide, there's also common sense that developing alternative energy sources could mean new jobs.\""Our economy is so entwined with the energy we use,"" said Robin Cape, a former City Council member who led Asheville's efforts to reduce its carbon footprint. ""I don't understand why there's an argument when there's a real opportunity here to develop new forms of energy.""\Mann agreed. ""Even if you don't think about the degradation of our environment, you can worry about the competitiveness of the U.S. We're not investing in alternative technology the way the rest of the world is.""\In the end, climate isn't a political debate, but an ethical one, Mann believes. You can argue with the data points and there are still missing pieces to the puzzle, but the larger picture is clear.\""If we continue along the pathway of business as usual, we will be laving our children and our grandchildren a very different planet,"" he said.\Contact Neal at 232-5970, dneal@citizen-times.com, www.facebook.com/nealACT or @dale_neal on Twitter.\ID_Code: B0-304080020"
45,"President Bush said it best: America is addicted to oil. We currently spend more than $1 trillion a year on our fossil fuel addiction, and if we are to believe the rhetoric of Big Oil, the answer to kicking the habit is to drill for more.\But if you're trying to quit smoking, you don't ask the Marlboro Man for help, and if you're serious about quitting your oil addiction, you don't ask Big Oil for help, either.\What America really needs are better energy choices. We deserve energy that is cheaper and cleaner than fossil fuels. The good news is, we can and will end our addiction and create better energy choices.\An unlikely source\Many examples exist of how to accomplish this goal of developing cleaner energy. One example comes from an unlikely source - animal waste. Fibrowatt LLC plans to build a plant that will generate energy from poultry litter in Surrey County. The plant will produce up to 40 megawatts (MW) of renewable energy without introducing new greenhouse gases into the environment. At 40 MW, the plant would annually generate enough energy to power about 30,000 homes.\Imagine a world where everyone can plug a car into the same outlet they use to charge their cell phones; imagine if we could heat and cool our houses not with expensive gas or oil, but with geothermal energy piped in from beneath our backyards; imagine flipping on the television and knowing the big game was being brought to you by cheap, clean electricity generated from solar panels on the roof and not from dirty coal. That's the near future, if we want it.\All these alternative energy technologies are available now. And all of them are part of the solution that will free us from our addiction to fossil fuels, reduce our energy bills, recharge America's economy, create good-paying jobs and solve the climate crisis.\National policy needed\We're not there yet because we lack a national energy policy that requires more and better choices. That's why this nation still runs on 1950s-era fossil fuel power. That and because Big Oil largely has been running the show and dictating our ""choices."" The strategy has paid off nicely - last year, the five biggest oil companies made $123 billion in profits. All while our energy prices just kept going up.\We now stand at a crossroads in this country - we can continue to drill ourselves deeper into a hole or we can demand better choices.\The technology exists today for renewable wind, solar, biomass and geothermal resources to provide large-scale energy generation. And the technology solutions that help families reduce their forced dependency on fossil fuels are the same technologies that will solve the climate crisis, clean the air and help protect America's wildlife habitats and natural resources for our children's future.\With a few incentives that Congress has the ability to create now, large increases in renewable energy production could be brought online in the very near future, giving Americans real energy choices.\Bold leadership needed\Congress should help lead a clean energy revolution and develop ""Made-in-America"" solutions.\Instead of handing billions of dollars in subsidies to the oil and gas industries over the next 10 years, Congress should use that money to promote clean, renewable energy and extend clean energy tax credits to the wind, biomass, geothermal and solar industries. These tax credits would help build an industry that in 2006 generated 8.5 million jobs and nearly $970 billion in revenue in America.\In addition, a major green jobs report, released Aug. 9 from the Center for American Progress and the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, concludes that investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy could create 62,000 new jobs in North Carolina and 2 million nationally in a two-year period.\Most importantly, Congress must pass comprehensive, cap-and-trade-based climate change legislation. The Climate Security Act, which gained 54 supporters in the Senate this past spring, would reduce our oil imports four times more than we could by drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, off our beaches and in the Rocky Mountains combined.\And it would save Americans $180 billion through the year 2030 on foreign oil expenditures alone, according to the Department of Energy.\Instead of chasing the last barrel of oil, we need to be chasing a new energy economy that reduces dependency on expensive fossil fuels. American families deserve a consumer-friendly, clean energy policy that invests in renewable energy and energy conservation and protects the wild places in this country. The choice is really quite simple.\G. Richard Mode serves as the North Carolina Wildlife Federation (NCWF) Affiliate Representative to the National Wildlife Federation (NWF). He is also the National Wildlife Federation Outreach Coordinator in North Carolina for Climate Change. He lives in Morganton."

Those responsible talk well, very well. But do not perform. Why are they still there?\We spent billions of taxpayer dollars on the auto industry and billions to create jobs. Neither expenditure did anything but sell cars cheaper and create work projects, not jobs. Also, no one told the recipients of ""cash for clunkers"" that come April 15 they must pay taxes on the rebate. It is not a ""tax credit"" but a ""rebate,"" and taxes are due.\I see an administration that speaks often and loudly but delivers little. I see incompetence, and we deserve better.\The time has long passed for rhetoric and promises. I expect delivery on time; that is what we pay for. Those folks work for us. No one fires politicians.\Ron Cerra, Wilmington\Physician speaks out on health reform\I wonder why so many people are acting like a bunch of lemmings, willingly racing toward that great abyss where Obama and congressional Democrats want to take us. But if what they're doing is so wonderful, why are they keeping it so secret?\Many Americans seem too willing to give up many of their freedoms and blindly believe their propaganda that our health care system is so broken that we can't exist without their fixing it immediately. But then again, why will their fixes only affect us, not them. The politicians will keep their current ""Cadillac"" health plans unchanged, as will their union friends and of course, the trial attorneys won't give up a thing.\As a physician, I can speak with some authority. Our health care system is the best in the world, without exception. With some minor adjustments, it could be made more efficient, but the current political meddling will put Washington bureaucrats in charge of your health care system and your health care decisions.\Is this what you really want? I don't.\Bohdan Malyk, Wilmington\We need a war against the deficit\The latest thing in money, and the debt it conceives, is trillion. \Trillion is big-big, almost incomprehensible. \And trillion is scary not only because of its size and the difficulty in understanding what it really is. Its usage has grown so common it tends to be ignored, or at least disregarded, not only by the masses but also by Congress and other pliant politicians.\The United States has a gargantuan problem trying to resolve this ever-increasing debt, and to do it without dissolving ourselves. It ought to be prioritized.\Hackneyed appeals won't cure this threat, and no monetary stimulus will do more than bleed the patient. But stimulus of another kind is needed. We had it during World War II, and briefly after 9/11. Its return is imperative, and though many recognize this foremost threat to our nation, I fear there are too many who don't give a damn.\Walter Frost, Leland\What the ocean says about Titan\My husband and I had a spontaneous sunset picnic on Wrightsville Beach. Sitting watching the waves roll in we couldn't help but recognize how fortunate we all are to have this resource right in our own back yard, something my father and grandparents also enjoyed.\Our shoreline is our history and also our future. I can remember my dad asking me if I thought the waters would be this beautiful when I have grandchildren. The answer is, ""yes,"" but the new question is ""for how long?""\Currently we are witnessing a critical challenge as Titan Cement seeks to establish a huge plant here, one that will spew hundreds of tons of toxic pollutants into our environment. It is unimaginable that for a short term gain we could sacrifice the future health and lifestyle of our entire region. An exaggeration? I don't think so. We are already advised to limit our fish consumption due to mercury contamination.\After Titan arrives, will we have to limit the time we spend in the surf or breathing the coastal air?\Susan Thompson, Wilmington\Don't believe the hype on rising seas\It has become an ""in"" thing to blame changes in sea levels on global warming and glacier melt; an ex-vice president and many Hollywood celebrities have jumped on this bandwagon.\Shanghai, New Orleans, Cairo and many other cities have been identified as being impacted by potential changes in sea levels. All of these cities were built on flood plains that were created by soil erosion as water traveled downstream to the oceans.\Every year thousands of tons of soil are deposited into the oceans, displacing much more water than what is being added to the oceans from ice melt. \A world-wide solution limiting the amount of soil being deposited into the oceans would be difficult and costly to implement. It is much easier for politicians to blame global warming and implement draconian penalties such as Congress' cap-and-trade legislation.\This legislation would have a severe negative impact on America's standard of living and do nothing about rivers such as the Yangtze, which deposits tons of soil into the oceans each day.\James W. Currin, Wilmington"
47,"By Joel Burgess\JBURGESS@CITIZEN-TIMES.com\Web extra\Visit CITIZEN-TIMES.com to view a photo gallery.\ASHEVILLE -- Democrats wanting to take on Republican U.S. Sen. Richard Burr gathered in Asheville on Saturday where they talked about their top priorities and answered questions about health care reform and climate change.\The possible challengers came with other Democrats to the Grove Park Inn for the 49th annual Vance-Aycock dinner, one of the state's oldest gatherings of party faithful. About 500 tickets were sold to the $100-a-plate event. Last year, the dinner raised around $80,000 and drew a surprise visit by then-presidential nominee Barrack Obama.\This year's event included guests Gov. Bev Perdue and U.S. Rep. Heath Shuler and featured keynote speaker U.S. Sen. Jean Carnahan, of Missouri. It also featured a buzz about the three possible contenders for Senate: former state senator Cal Cunningham, Chapel Hill attorney Kenneth Lewis and N.C. Secretary of State Elaine Marshall.\Marshall and Lewis have declared their candidacies. Cunningham said he is still exploring a run. U.S. Rep. Bob Etheridge of Lillington, who is also considering a campaign, did not come to the dinner.\Cracking down on unfair trade practices, reducing the use of foreign oil and increasing access to education were among the reasons the three said they were eyeing the Senate.\Marshall, 63, is the most familiar face to voters. She's making her second try for the Senate and has been secretary of state since 1996, when she became the first woman elected as a top official in the executive branch. Still, her post is an under-the-radar one, with few opportunities for prominence.\She said that jobs were her top priority and the government could help secure employment for more Americans by negotiating with and possibly penalizing countries that have poor safety and environmental rules.\""We can't have our industries hurt because they are at a competitive disadvantage with workers on machines that don't have any protective gear and their environment is being trashed in the process of manufacturing,"" she said.\That could mean trade sanctions, if negotiations don't work, she said.\As for health care reform, Marshall said she supported a public option. That is one aspect senators will have to work out between two competing bills. The government-run public health insurance option would increase access, she said. ""If we don't have affordability and we don't have access, we don't have health care reform,"" she said.\With climate change, Marshall said she didn't know enough to comment about the bill introduced by Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., to cut carbon emissions by 20 percent by 2050.\Climate change was something to which the government should pay attention, but it might be too early to take large steps, she said.\The other hopefuls took stiffer stances. Lewis said he supported the cap-and-trade system that would require companies who pollute over a certain allowance to buy emission credits from other companies.\""It uses private markets which I like but it also places a cost on carbon emissions that will provide an incentive to reduce emissions and for utility companies to look for alternative energy sources,"" he said.\Cunningham, meanwhile, said he supported the Senate bill so much that he went to Washington to meet with Kerry on Wednesday when it was filed.\Cunningham, 36, a lawyer and one-term legislator, stepped down after his district's boundaries were redrawn. As a U.S. Army Reserves captain from Lexington, he served as a military prosecutor in Iraq. That is why he said it is important to rely less on foreign oil and more on clean, alternative fuels.\""I just spent a year of my life in a part of the world that wouldn't be important to our country's foreign policy except that there is oil under the sand,"" he said.\On health care, he said he wasn't ready to make a statement about the public option, but said costs needed to be reduced and insurance providers should not be able to turn people down for pre-existing conditions.\Finally, he said, the government needed to make sure it could pay for any reform.\Lewis said a public option might not be necessary, but he doubted it.\""I like the idea of building off our current system...but I have a concern about whether private health insurance will provide for three main things: broad access, reducing costs and affordability,"" he said.\Lewis, 47, has been active in politics as an organizer and fundraiser to the Obama campaign but has no elected experience. He said he's telling Democrats about his civic work and his professional career as an attorney to businesses and community development groups.\He said his top priorities would include increasing Americans access to education and affordable housing."
48,"
More than 50 years ago, Dick Armey began his rise to the top of the American political landscape from atop a power pole.
\
Only months out of high school, the 18-year-old was working 30 feet up in 30-below weather in his native North Dakota as he spied a neighboring college town. From his icy perch, the thought of former classmates now in college snug in warm beds crystallized the value of more education.
\
Armey eventually earned a PhD, became a professor at a Texas university and was elected to Congress, where he served from 1985 to 2003.
\
The Republican spent the last eight years of his legislative career as House Majority Leader, the second-highest ranking position in that body. Along with former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Armey was one of the chief architects of the Republican Revolution and the Contract with America in the mid-1990s.
\
Over the years, Armey's outspoken, bare-knuckles approach rubbed some the wrong way in the halls of power, but his combination of smarts, toughness and vision generally served him well.
\
On Friday, Armey brought his plain-spoken conservative message to the Ramada Inn in Burlington. Now the chairman of the FreedomWorks Foundation, a grassroots organization that pushes for lower taxes, smaller government and more individual liberty, Armey received a standing ovation after his remarks from the crowd of more than 50 who gathered.
\
FreedomWorks is nonpartisan and dedicated to the Constitution, which calls for limited government and power vested in the people, Armey said.
\
Duke University academics have twisted the simple, easy-to-understand language of the Constitution, he said. ""If you want to know what America is about, read the Constitution. If you can't understand it, we'll buy you a dictionary. This ain't no thinking thing. It's a believing thing.""
\
Among other things, FreedomWorks is fighting hard against the health care reforms in Congress and those pitched by President Barack Obama, whom Armey called ""the first worst bitter disappointment we have seen since who knows when.""
\
Government's first duty is to protect liberty, Armey said.
\
Although the federal government should help Americans in need of health care assistance, ""you don't write a 100 percent takeover of the health care of every citizen in this country to resolve the problems of the 15 or 20 percent having difficulties.""
\
As part of their efforts to push through governmentrun health care, the president and other Democrats, among other things, are trying to make private insurance ""more dysfunctional"" to drive Americans to the government alternative.
\
Such a takeover amounts to ""tyranny,"" Armey said.
\
Armey also took issue with cap and trade legislation, which he said is a power grab to manage ""the affairs of the economy and a greater ability to redistribute income"" masked as a love for the environment.
\
""And after that they'll be back with forced unionization in the South.""
\
Washington politicians are ""so crazy"" when it comes to what constitutes a dialogue with constituents and ""baffled by"" his group, he said.
\
""These people, they're so full of themselves that they forget where is their duty.""
\
On the contrary, Freedom-Works members, which he said number in the hundreds of thousands, love liberty and ""have an abiding, deep admiration and respect"" for America.
\
""We just want to keep America as America has been,"" Armey continued ""... a nation of people happy and free and prosperous in their own lives, and a blessing in the lives of others.""
\
FreedomWorks members have been among those who have spoken out at congressional town hall meetings and marched Sept. 12 in Washington, D.C., to advocate for more effective government.
\
Some at those events have shouted down some representatives and senators and called President Obama a Nazi, a communist and carried signs with unflattering depictions of the president, such as him with a Hitlerstyle mustache.
\
Despite characterizations that FreedomWorks members are ""disruptors"" and ""rabble-rousers,"" Armey said the group advocates ""good public policy and we abuse bad politicians"" by mobilizing voters ""to show up at their next election time.
\
""We are not rude, we are not inconsiderate, we are not loud, we are not profane,"" he continued. ""These things are not only ill-mannered, but they are ineffective.""
\
After a question-and-answer session, Armey greeted attendees, which included county GOP Chairman Robert Simpson, and school board chairman and former GOP commissioner candidate Tom Manning.
\
""I think every comment he made was right on the mark,"" said Steve Carter, a Burlington banker who has made bids to fill a vacant seat in the state House and another on the board of county commissioners. The problems that Armey detailed are taking place in Raleigh, and in county government, with ""government trying to take away our rights and come up with new ways to create taxes for us,"" Carter said.
\
In an interview with the Times-News, Armey predicted that Congress will pass some type of watered-down ""place marker"" health care reform bill that includes ""two or three building blocks for a future government takeover bill"" and pseudo-reform to make private-sector insurance ""less efficient and effective.""
\
H.R. 3200, the ""pure federal government takeover"" bill the House considered before its August recess is ""dead,"" Armey said.
\
Armey's prescription for health care reform? Tort reform that would curtail the practice of defensive medicine and save $100 billion; giving Americans the option to cross state lines to buy insurance; more emphasis on health care savings accounts; not allowing insurance companies to drop someone who ""maintained their policy in good stead"" for 10 years or so ""simply because they acquire an illness.""

49,"President Bush said it best: America is addicted to oil. We currently spend more than $1 trillion a year on our fossil fuel addiction, and if we are to believe the rhetoric of Big Oil, the answer to kicking the habit is to drill for more.\But if you're trying to quit smoking, you don't ask the Marlboro Man for help, and if you're serious about quitting your oil addiction, you don't ask Big Oil for help, either.\What America really needs are better energy choices. We deserve energy that is cheaper and cleaner than fossil fuels. The good news is, we can and will end our addiction and create better energy choices.\An unlikely source\Many examples exist of how to accomplish this goal of developing cleaner energy. One example comes from an unlikely source -- animal waste. Fibrowatt LLC plans to build a plant that will generate energy from poultry litter in Surrey County. The plant will produce up to 40 megawatts (MW) of renewable energy without introducing new greenhouse gases into the environment. At 40 MW, the plant would annually generate enough energy to power about 30,000 homes.\Imagine a world where everyone can plug a car into the same outlet they use to charge their cell phones; imagine if we could heat and cool our houses not with expensive gas or oil, but with geothermal energy piped in from beneath our backyards; imagine flipping on the television and knowing the big game was being brought to you by cheap, clean electricity generated from solar panels on the roof and not from dirty coal. That's the near future, if we want it.\All these alternative energy technologies are available now. And all of them are part of the solution that will free us from our addiction to fossil fuels, reduce our energy bills, recharge America's economy, create good-paying jobs and solve the climate crisis.\National policy needed\We're not there yet because we lack a national energy policy that requires more and better choices. That's why this nation still runs on 1950s-era fossil fuel power. That and because Big Oil largely has been running the show and dictating our ""choices."" The strategy has paid off nicely -- last year, the five biggest oil companies made $123 billion in profits. All while our energy prices just kept going up.\We now stand at a crossroads in this country -- we can continue to drill ourselves deeper into a hole or we can demand better choices.\The technology exists today for renewable wind, solar, biomass and geothermal resources to provide large-scale energy generation. And the technology solutions that help families reduce their forced dependency on fossil fuels are the same technologies that will solve the climate crisis, clean the air and help protect America's wildlife habitats and natural resources for our children's future.\With a few incentives that Congress has the ability to create now, large increases in renewable energy production could be brought online in the very near future, giving Americans real energy choices.\Bold leadership needed\Congress should help lead a clean energy revolution and develop ""Made-in-America"" solutions.\Instead of handing billions of dollars in subsidies to the oil and gas industries over the next 10 years, Congress should use that money to promote clean, renewable energy and extend clean energy tax credits to the wind, biomass, geothermal and solar industries. These tax credits would help build an industry that in 2006 generated 8.5 million jobs and nearly $970 billion in revenue in America.\In addition, a major green jobs report, released Aug. 9 from the Center for American Progress and the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, concludes that investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy could create 62,000 new jobs in North Carolina and 2 million nationally in a two-year period.\Most importantly, Congress must pass comprehensive, cap-and-trade-based climate change legislation. The Climate Security Act, which gained 54 supporters in the Senate this past spring, would reduce our oil imports four times more than we could by drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, off our beaches and in the Rocky Mountains combined.\And it would save Americans $180 billion through the year 2030 on foreign oil expenditures alone, according to the Department of Energy.\Instead of chasing the last barrel of oil, we need to be chasing a new energy economy that reduces dependency on expensive fossil fuels. American families deserve a consumer-friendly, clean energy policy that invests in renewable energy and energy conservation and protects the wild places in this country. The choice is really quite simple.\G. Richard Mode serves as the North Carolina Wildlife Federation (NCWF) Affiliate Representative to the National Wildlife Federation (NWF). He is also the National Wildlife Federation Outreach Coordinator in North Carolina for Climate Change. He lives in Morganton."
50,"Michael Mann was trying to reconstruct the past climate from tree rings, coral reefs, ice cores and other data when he discovered a disturbing pattern. The temperatures have gone in a plateau for the past 1,000 years, but have shot up considerably in the past few decades.\That graph looked a lot like a hockey stick.\Little did Mann know that that graphic would become a icon in the climate debate that has heated up our politics.\Mann would feel like a hockey player himself, suddenly beset by NHL enforcers bashing him into the boards. Unfortunately, there have been no penalties called in what's become a no-holds-barred brawl.\Mann landed Monday at Asheville Regional Airport and was picked up by Dave and Marjorie McGuirk, who held up a welcome sign on a hockey stick.\""At first, I thought it was a protester out to get me. Then I noticed the ribbons and the festive air of the sign and knew it was a friend coming to get me,"" Mann said.\Mann, a leading climatologist at Pennsylvania State University, was in town last week at UNC Asheville, Warren Wilson College and the National Climatic Data Center, discussing how climatology became so controversial in this country's political discourse.\Many Republican politicians and voters have rejected the idea that the Earth is warming in large part because of fossil fuels burned into the atmosphere. Even the vast majority of scientists see no debate.\But Mann's hockey stick graph has held up over the past decade, along with lots of other data. In fact, there's a whole hockey league of graphs joining Mann's research, showing that the world's climate is heating up at an unprecedented rate for millennia.\Mann said that climate critics have borrowed the tactics of the tobacco industry in the '50s, '60s, and '70s to slow down any regulation of their product, arguing that the science was ""unsettled"" that smoking is a leading cause of cancer.\""Rather than a good-faith debate, they chose to obscure the facts, and that old tactic has been applied to climate change,"" Mann said.\Mann is no martyr, but he's been the point of attack by plenty of politicians and others. Rep. Joe Barton, the Texas Republican who actually apologized to BP in the wake of the Gulf oil spill, subpoenaed Mann for all his emails, until other Republicans put the nix on such a scientific witch hunt.\The climate controversy has done us no favors, poisoning our political discourse and undermining that common ground of scientific inquiry that all reasonable people should be able to meet upon.\What's at stake is the economic climate of Asheville. With the NCDC in our downtown, the repository of the world's weather and climate records and the brainpower of our resident scientists, Asheville is an epicenter for research into just how the climate is changing.\But without an agreed national policy and political foot-dragging, we're not seeing the growth in the research and technical jobs needed to tackle the challenge.\The debate isn't whether the Earth is warming. You have to cherry-pick through all the numbers to ignore the overall trend of an Earth a whole degree hotter than a century ago, or the potential for a planet that's on average 5 or more degrees warmer in the next few decades.\The debate should be: What's our best approach to deal with hotter summers, more drought and wildfire, or even more extreme weather events?\There are real differences to be resolved and solutions that should be advanced from both conservative and liberal perspectives. Should we go nuclear, which has no greenhouse gases? Or is that too hazardous after Fukushima? Can we save money and create local jobs by going more solar, at least to heat water? What about electric cars? Does cap-and-trade (originally proposed by Republicans) or a carbon tax really make sense in a shaky recovery from our worst economic downturn in generations?\If simple physics dictates that the more fossil fuels we burn into the atmosphere will raise temperatures, melt ice caps and potentially flood coastlines worldwide, there's also common sense that developing alternative energy sources could mean new jobs.\""Our economy is so entwined with the energy we use,"" said Robin Cape, a former City Council member who led Asheville's efforts to reduce its carbon footprint. ""I don't understand why there's an argument when there's a real opportunity here to develop new forms of energy.""\Mann agreed. ""Even if you don't think about the degradation of our environment, you can worry about the competitiveness of the U.S. We're not investing in alternative technology the way the rest of the world is.""\In the end, climate isn't a political debate, but an ethical one, Mann believes. You can argue with the data points and there are still missing pieces to the puzzle, but the larger picture is clear.\""If we continue along the pathway of business as usual, we will be laving our children and our grandchildren a very different planet,"" he said.\Contact Neal at 232-5970, dneal@citizen-times.com, www.facebook.com/nealACT or @dale_neal on Twitter.\Dale\Neal\COLUMNIST"
51,"In the last few weeks, an eccentric debate has been dividing Democratic Party polls and commentators in Washington: In 2011, should President Obama strive to be more like Harry Truman in 1947 or Bill Clinton in 1995?\Apparently, they have given up on FDR or Abe Lincoln as plausible role models for the president. They should be careful. The way the economy seems to be going, a year from now, they could be down to deciding between Carter and Hoover as role models.\The point of this debate is that in 1947, Truman, after a crushing midterm election against the Democrats in 1946, was defiant, moved to his left and nonetheless won an unlikely re-election in 1948. (Truman opposed Republican tax cuts and removal of price controls, he vetoed the union-weakening Taft-Hartley Act and was overridden, he proposed national health insurance and moved aggressively on civil rights.)\Bill Clinton, of course, is famous for triangulating between the Republicans and the Democrats, moving to the center/right, signing the Republican welfare reform bill (which he had twice vetoed before the election of 1994, when the GOP thumpingly took back the House and Senate), agreed to the Republican-proposed balanced budget (which he steadfastly opposed before the election), proclaimed that the era of big government was over and, in his nomination acceptance speech at the Democratic Convention in Chicago, bragged about signing into law 14 items that had been in the Republican ""Contract with America.""\But 2011 is not 1947 or 1995. The primary challenge for the president (and the Congress) today is not to be seen to get one up on the other party -- nor is it to be seen to support their base at the ideological barricades. It is to restore the immediate economy to reasonable health, bring down unemployment rates below 7 percent (preferably below 5 percent), see the housing market begin to recover and induce business to voluntarily start investing some of its $2-3 trillion it is fearful to invest in the current market.\If none or little of that happens in the next two years, the voters may unleash their justified wrath at both parties' politicians -- from the president and the speaker on down.\So, from the president's perspective, he should have a high value in getting his policy right and implementing as much as he can by pressuring the GOP to pass it. But what is his economic policy?\Recently, the word has been floating around Washington that the president secretly would like to see the full Bush tax cut extended because he thinks raising taxes in a recession may be counterproductive. From a free marketer's point of view, that is a good development. But what good will keeping taxes lower do if the administration otherwise is hostile to business and free markets?\For instance, the president just announced a seven-year ban on offshore drilling -- thus killing hundreds of thousands of jobs and multibillions of new salaries and profits. It also forces us to spend yet more money in the Middle East instead of here in America. Is that supposed to encourage business to up its investment during the current administration's government?\The White House has let it be known -- since the election -- that what they can't pass of cap and trade through Congress, they would consider trying to bring online through their EPA's regulatory process. Does the threat of higher taxes on energy coming into being in the dark of the regulatory night (without even a chance for a business to protect itself by gaining the support of the elected House or Senate), does that let loose the animal spirits of business to start investing in jobs and economic activity?\Does the president's stout rhetorical argument these last weeks that anyone making over $250,000 is rich and can easily absorb a big tax increase encourage an investor to believe the president has any idea what economic reality is like?\I have the feeling that even if the Bush tax cuts are allowed to extend for two years, if the economy does not come bouncing back, this White House will ask, ""What more do the businessmen want? We gave them their darn Bush tax break; they owe us their big investment.""\Tax cuts -- or in this instance, no tax increases -- are vitally useful in creating an economic environment in which investors, and big- and small-businesspeople feel safe to invest again. But low taxes are not sufficient. When they come at the same time that the White House continues to trumpet threatening class warfare sounds, I fear this dreary economy will continue to flounder.\The president needs to think very hard. If he believes the best bet for the economy (and his re-election) is a full Reaganite embrace of free markets and low taxes, then he should switch comprehensively to such policies and rhetoric. He will get GOP support and such policies will become law.\If he still believes in his liberal class war policies, then he might as well do what his left wants him to: attack, attack, attack the GOP and hope the economy gets better by intervention of providence or some other miraculous method.\Tony Blankley is executive vice president of Edelman public relations in Washington.

52,"As a public servant, Rep. Heath Shuler has proved to be a strong advocate for issues related to the improvement of children's health and wellness. His record reflects a commitment to reducing our childhood obesity epidemic and improving our school health initiatives. Shuler clearly understands both the moral imperative as well as the economic benefits of raising strong, healthy children, who will someday be the leadership and labor force of our country.\I applaud his critical leadership for the important regional initiative, WNC Healthy Kids, which works to prevent and reduce childhood obesity. He was also a co-sponsor of the National Farm-to-School Act, which would facilitate locally produced, healthy foods in school cafeterias and improve student nutrition. As a congressman and a parent, Shuler cares deeply about the future well-being of our youth and has the track record to prove it. We need to keep that vital voice representing WNC children in Washington. I urge you to vote for Heath Shuler in the upcoming election.\Holly Jones, Asheville\Jones is a Buncombe County commissioner.\Shuler plays 'dirty politics' against honorable man\Jeff Miller is a man whose impeccable character has been demonstrated through his family business, his community service and his love for our veterans. So when he decided to enter the cesspool of politics, I thought, ""Well, dirty politics can't touch him."" Wrong. Shuler decided to use dirty politics anyway by misrepresenting Miller's positions and by attacking Miller's ""so-called"" supporters. One can only imagine the character of the person who approves the misleading ads that Shuler approves. Shuler and Washington still don't get it. America does not want campaigns of baseless attacks. We don't want Washington business as usual. We want to know how our congressman will solve the problems facing America. We'd like him to be brave enough to hold some town meetings to face the people of his district. We'd like him to explain his positions before he votes -- not after he's told how to vote. Shuler claims that the votes he's cast will help our district. However, he voted for ""cap and trade"" (passing thanks to his vote) -- a devastating decision for the economy of Western Carolina. When Pelosi needed his vote, she got it. And that says it all.\Susan Marker, Hendersonville\Keever will work with delegation for good of WNC\Patsy Keever knows Buncombe County better than most. As a former schoolteacher and longtime county commissioner, Patsy has been active in our community for years. She could have chosen a political path that to wealth, but instead followed her heart for service. She could have chosen to kick back, enjoy retirement and play golf, but Patsy wouldn't be Patsy if that's all she did. She is not done serving. I believe she can best represent the needs of all the people in her district. Keever will work effectively with the rest of Buncombe's delegation in Raleigh to preserve our mountains, rebuild our local economy and bring good-paying jobs back to Western North Carolina.\Suzannah Allen, Asheville\Fisher champions education and the arts in Raleigh\Rep. Susan Fisher serves in key leadership positions in the N.C. House that enable her to have a significant impact in two critical areas: education and the arts. As a former Asheville City school board chair, her commitment to education is well-known. In the legislature, as chair of the education subcommittee she helped save teacher jobs and prevent classroom overcrowding. As chair of the Appropriations Committee on General Government, Rep. Fisher helped preserve funding for the N.C. Arts Council and Grass Roots Arts grants funding. While other states have cut their arts budgets, North Carolina's has been fully funded for the past two years, thanks in large part to Fisher, who recognizes that arts are not a luxury, but vital to our quality of life and our economy. Statewide the ""creative industry"" creates and sustains nearly 300,000 jobs in North Carolina, and the market value of goods and services produced and sustained is more than $41.4 billion. In WNC there are more than 8,500 people employed in the arts and crafts industries alone. I will be voting for Rep. Susan Fisher, and I encourage you to do the same if you care about education and the arts.\Phil Atwood, Barnardsville\Time for a conversation about transportation\There's a key issue in our community that relates to our economy, our health and our environment, but we've not been hearing much about it from the candidates seeking election this fall.\The issue is transportation. How you get to and from work, school, social events and home matters. How our transportation choices can bolster or impede our economy matters. We don't get to talk about it as often as we should, but that changes this month. A local nonpartisan group is offering a forum on this topic on Oct. 27.Get There Asheville is hosting its third candidate forum, which is open to state and federal candidates and will also include an update from local elected officials.

53,"In the president's speech June 15, he said BP should pay for their recklessness. That is true. In a recent graduation speech, he told the graduates not to point fingers at others. I guess he forgot his own advice. The president needs to pay for his reckless spending. He did not care that the American people did not want and cannot afford the ridiculous health care bill. He and our egotistical Congress critters passed it. He used his speech the other night to push for the reckless cap-and-trade boondoggle, which, if possible, will damage this country more than the health care bill.\Then there is his disrespect for the national anthem and the American flag, not to mention his penchant for apologizing to the world for everything. Mr. Obama has lived most of his privileged, charmed life in a protected environment surrounded by others with wacky ideas like his. Up until last year he had no power to implement his crazy ideas and see their consequences. Now that he has the power, his ego will not allow him to admit how wrong he is. Please don't tell him what comes after a trillion.\Ralph Weber, Fairview\Republicans are apologizing to the wrong people\U.S. Rep. Joe Barton, the top Republican on the committee overseeing the oil spill and its aftermath, delivered a personal apology to BP, saying the $20 billion fund that President Obama directed BP to establish to provide relief to the victims of the oil disaster was a ""tragedy in the first proportion."" Other Republicans are echoing his call. Rep. Michele Bachmann said that BP shouldn't agree to be ""fleeced."" The Republican Study Committee, with its 114 members in the House, called it a ""shakedown."" Barton and Republicans like him don't understand that the real tragedy is what's happening to the people in the Gulf Coast. They're the ones who deserve his apology -- not BP.\Jerry Edwards, Asheville\Americans need to wake up to protect freedom\The American people have been asleep at the wheel, believing that our Constitution protected our rights. We are to be active in our constitutional republic. We are supposed to protect our Constitution by our vigilance; we have failed to do so. Over the years, we have allowed our elected officials to chip away at our freedoms. We are much like the frog in the pot of water. When first placed in the cold water, we sit quietly; as the heat is slowly turned up, we become accustomed to the new reality. Our freedoms are being ""boiled away"" while we sit idly by, believing that we can do nothing.\This year must be different, The freedom for us and future generations depends on you; think before you vote. Take the time, as you would before buying a car and find the best ""product"" (candidate) for your money -- because it is your money. Your country is counting on you. November is coming. Meet other like-minded patriots every Saturday, 9-11 a.m., at Nico's Cafe in Waynesville for pancakes with a side of liberty, sponsored by the 9-12 Project -- your tea party connection for Haywood County.\Beverly Elliot, Clyde\California's woes can be traced back to Reagan\In ""Double-dip recession should be a big worry"" (ACT, June 20) staff columnist Jim Buchanan wrote ""OK, he (Arnold Schwarzenneger) did kill California's economy, but I digress.""\I beg to differ. Schwarzenneger didn't kill California's economy. That task was initiated by the anti-government, anti-tax , free-spending policies of two-term Gov. Ronald Reagan back in 1966-74. It should come as no surprise that the California economy is further along the road to ruin than that of our United States. The Californians made the mistake of putting Ronnie in charge long before we did.\Palmer O. Hanson Jr., Brevard\Obama facing unfounded criticism over Gulf oil spill\The pundits on TV and many Americans are blaming President Obama for the oil crisis in the gulf. He took office in January 2009 and inherited a regulatory agency that was in bed (maybe even literally) with the oil companies. The Bush family was oil company-friendly. Regulation and oversight was spotty or nonexistent. It takes time to sort out and determine which regulators need to be fired. Perhaps Congress also needed to enact stricter regulations. But Republicans clamored ""Drill, baby, drill"" and wanted less government intervention.\After the disaster occurred, Obama acted immediately with his advisers to determine which actions were needed. Historically, it was accepted that the oil companies had the expertise to handle such a crisis. Hindsight is wonderful. We now know that BP was not acting responsibly. We were not informed of the extent of the spill. President Obama, realizing the limitations of what BP has done, is now issuing orders to speed up cleanup operations and to hold BP fiscally responsible. He placed a moratorium on new drilling until rigs are inspected and regulations improved. There are complaints about this even though permits had been issued in previous administrations with sloppy oversight.\Ruth Tornick, Asheville"

WASHINGTON (AP) When Bill Clinton took office in 1993, global warming was a slow-moving environmental problem that was easy to ignore. Now it is a ticking time bomb that President-elect Barack Obama can't avoid.
\
Since Clinton's inauguration, summer Arctic sea ice has lost the equivalent of Alaska, California and Texas. The 10 hottest years on record have occurred since Clinton's second inauguration. Global warming is accelerating. Time is close to running out, and Obama knows it.
\
""The time for delay is over; the time for denial is over,"" he said on Tuesday after meeting with former Vice President Al Gore, who won a Nobel Peace Prize for his work on global warming. ""We all believe what the scientists have been telling us for years now that this is a matter of urgency and national security and it has to be dealt with in a serious way.""
\
But there are powerful political and economic realities that must be quickly overcome for Obama to succeed. Despite the urgency he expresses, it's not at all clear that he and Congress will agree on an approach during a worldwide financial crisis in time to meet some of the more crucial deadlines.
\
Obama is pushing changes in the way Americans use energy, and produce greenhouse gases, as part of what will be a massive economic stimulus. He called it an opportunity ""to re-power America.""
\
After years of inaction on global warming, 2009 might be different. Obama replaces a president who opposed mandatory cuts of greenhouse gas pollution and it appears he will have a willing Congress. Also, next year, diplomats will try to agree on a major new international treaty to curb the gases that promote global warming.
\
""We need to start in January making significant changes,"" Gore said in a recent telephone interview with The Associated Press. ""This year coming up is the most important opportunity the world has ever had to make progress in really solving the climate crisis.""
\
Scientists are increasingly anxious, talking more often and more urgently about exceeding ""tipping points.""
\
""We're out of time,"" Stanford University biologist Terry Root said. ""Things are going extinct.""
\
U.S. emissions have increased by 20 percent since 1992. China has more than doubled its carbon dioxide pollution in that time. World carbon dioxide emissions have grown faster than scientists' worst-case scenarios. Methane, the next most potent greenhouse gas, suddenly is on the rise again and scientists fear that vast amounts of the trapped gas will escape from thawing Arctic permafrost.
\
The amount of carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere has already pushed past what some scientists say is the safe level.
\
In the early 1990s, many scientists figured that the world was about a century away from a truly dangerous amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, said Mike MacCracken, who was a top climate scientist in the Clinton administration. But as they studied the greenhouse effect further, scientists realized that harmful changes kick in at far lower levels of carbon dioxide than they thought. Now some scientists, but not all, say the safe carbon dioxide level for Earth is about 10 percent below what it is now.
\
Gore called the situation ""the equivalent of a five-alarm fire that has to be addressed immediately.""
\
Scientists fear that what's happening with Arctic ice melt will be amplified so that ominous sea level rise will occur sooner than they expected. They predict Arctic waters could be ice-free in summers, perhaps by 2013, decades earlier than they thought only a few years ago.
\
In December 2009, diplomats are charged with forging a new treaty replacing the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which set limits on greenhouse gases, and which the United States didn't ratify. This time European officials have high expectations for the U.S. to take the lead. But many experts don't see Congress passing a climate bill in time because of pressing economic and war issues.
\
""The reality is, it may take more than the first year to get it all done,"" Senate Energy Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., said recently.
\
Complicating everything is the worldwide financial meltdown. Frank Maisano, a Washington energy specialist and spokesman who represents coal-fired utilities and refineries, sees the poor economy as ""a huge factor"" that could stop everything. That's because global warming efforts are aimed at restricting coal power, which is cheap. That would likely mean higher utility bills and more damage to ailing economies that depend on coal production, he said.
\
Obama is stacking his Cabinet and inner circle with advocates who have pushed for deep mandatory cuts in greenhouse gas pollution and even with government officials who have achieved results at the local level.
\
The President-elect has said that one of the first things he will do when he gets to Washington is grant California and other states permission to control car tailpipe emissions, something the Bush administration denied.
\
And though congressional action may take time, the incoming Congress will be more inclined to act on global warming. In the House, liberal California Democrat Henry Waxman's unseating of Michigan Rep. John Dingell a staunch defender of Detroit automakers as head of the House Energy and Commerce Committee was a sign that global warming will be on the fast track.
\
Senate Environment and Public Works Chairman Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., vowed to push two global warming bills starting in January: one to promote energy efficiency as an economic stimulus and the other to create a cap-and-trade system to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from utilities. ""The time is now,"" she wrote in a Dec. 8 letter to Obama.
\
Mother Nature, of course, is oblivious to the federal government's machinations. Ironically, 2008 is on pace to be a slightly cooler year in a steadily rising temperature trend line. Experts say it's thanks to a La Nina weather variation. While skeptics are already using it as evidence of some kind of cooling trend, it actually illustrates how fast the world is warming.
\
The average global temperature in 2008 is likely to wind up slightly under 57.9 degrees Fahrenheit, about a tenth of a degree cooler than last year. When Clinton was inaugurated, 57.9 easily would have been the warmest year on record. Now, that temperature would qualify as the ninth warmest year.

I have a foreign client who is searching for a location in the Southeast to establish a very large manufacturing operation.\North Carolina was one of the four potential locations. Taxes were already significantly higher in N.C. than competing states, and with the expectation that N.C. will significantly raise taxes, this company has decided to locate elsewhere.\More importantly, with the Washington administration now intent on regulating every aspect of a business, I question what manufacturing company will want to establish or expand an operation anywhere in the U.S. Potential regulations such as ""cap and trade"" may sound like good environmental policy, but energy intensive industry understands its primary intent is to help pay for the huge stimulus bill recently passed.

The two issues -- taxation of repatriated profits and the use of tax havens -- are intertwined and the focus of President Obama's initiatives to close corporate tax loopholes.\Myers uses fear tactics in his speculations of the dire consequences to our economy if his boardroom buddies are not allowed to continue to enrich themselves at the expense of Americans who do pay their taxes.\The IRS estimates that over 10 years, $1 trillion in revenue has been lost because of the use of tax havens. Our federal government has to make up most of this shortfall. The Public Interest Research Group reports state governments have to make up the rest, amounting to $100 billion. North Carolina's share of this bill is $2.7 billion.\As for the aforementioned fear tactics used by Myers, be wary of any economic pronouncement from the country-club, supply-sider bunch, especially when they wave the specter of lost jobs if we don't kowtow to their superior wisdom, for they care about only one thing, and it's not your job.\Gene Zimbalkin, Asheville\Most of the founding fathers\were indeed Christians\The author of the letter, ""Founders knew better than to create a 'Christian nation'"" (AC-T, July 6), claimed separation of church and state was not created by Christians, but by 18th century secularists like Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Tom Paine and James Madison The writer should check his facts before making such claims. The only individual in his list that might be considered a ""secularist"" might be Thomas Paine, the other individuals listed were all Protestant.\There is debate today about Thomas Jefferson and his ""deists"" writings. Jefferson considered himself a deist; but he also considered himself a follower of Jesus.

58,"
WASHINGTON (AP) Standing before the nation on a ""day of reckoning,"" President Barack Obama summoned politicians and public alike Tuesday night to forge a path out of the worst economic disaster in a quarter-century by embracing shared sacrifice and costly new endeavors to improve health care, schools and the environment.
\
""The time to take charge of our future is here,"" Obama declared in his first address to a joint session of Congress, watched by millions of worried Americans on television and the Internet.
\
Adding words of reassurance, he said, ""Tonight I want every American to know this: We will rebuild, we will recover, and the United States of America will emerge stronger than before.""
\
Obama had to wade his way into a chamber packed with lawmakers eager to welcome the nation's first black president into a Capitol built by slaves. The House gallery included a special section hosted by first lady Michelle Obama, where guests served as living symbols of the president's goals. Cramming the floor was virtually the entire leadership of the federal government, including Supreme Court justices, led by Ruth Bader Ginsberg, back on the bench only this week after cancer surgery, and all but one Cabinet member, held away in case disaster struck. Obama's 52-minute speech was interrupted 61 times by applause.
\
To deal with the current economic crisis, deepening each day, the president said more money would be needed to rescue troubled banks beyond the $700 billion already committed last year. He said he knows that bailout billions for banks are unpopular ""I promise you, I get it,"" he said but he also insisted it was the only way to get credit moving again to households and businesses, the lifeblood of the American economy.
\
Along with aid for banks, he also called on Congress to move quickly on legislation to overhaul regulations on the nation's financial markets.
\
""I ask this Congress to join me in doing whatever proves necessary,"" Obama said. ""Because we cannot consign our nation to an open-ended recession.""
\
With U.S. automakers struggling for survival, Obama also said he would allow neither their demise nor ""their own bad practices"" to be rewarded. ""I believe the nation that invented the automobile cannot walk away from it,"" he said.
\
Thinking longer-term, Obama said in a speech lacking many specifics that both political parties must give up favored programs while uniting behind his campaign promises to help the millions without health insurance, build better schools and move the nation to more-efficient fuel use. He skipped the traditional litany of new programs common in such speeches but spoke on broad generalities about goals and themes that formed the backbone of his presidential campaign.
\
Just five weeks after his inauguration, Obama addressed an ebullient Democratic congressional majority and an embattled but reinvigorated GOP minority as well as anxious viewers at home. Despite the nation's economic worries and the failure so far of his effort to draw support for his plans from more than a handful of Republican lawmakers, Obama enjoys strong approval ratings across the nation.
\
Bobby Jindal, Louisiana's young, charismatic governor who is considered a potential 2012 presidential candidate, was chosen to deliver the televised GOP response. He exhorted fellow Republicans to be Obama's ""strongest partners"" when they agree with him. But he signaled that won't happen much, calling the $787 billion stimulus package ""irresponsible.""
\
""The way to lead is not to raise taxes and put more money and power in hands of Washington politicians,"" Jindal said. ""Who among us would ask our children for a loan, so we could spend money we do not have, on things we do not need?""
\
Still, mindful of the public's optimism about Obama's leadership, Jindal, as well as other Republicans, took care to focus criticism primarily on Congress' Democratic leaders, not on the president.
\
Pre-speech, Wall Street was in a better mood than it had been in for days: Stocks were up after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said the recession might end this year.
\
But Obama spoke as bad economic news continued to pile up, felt all too keenly in U.S. homes and businesses. Some 3.6 million jobs have disappeared in the recession that ranks as the biggest job destroyer in the post-World War II period. Americans have lost trillions of dollars in retirement, college and savings accounts, with the stock market falling nearly half from its peak of 16 months ago.
\
New polls some with Obama's public support rising and others with it dropping show that the political climate can be as precarious as the economic one. So Obama reached for both candor and can-do, blending the kind of grim honesty that has become his trademark since taking office with a greater emphasis on optimism.
\
""The weight of this crisis will not determine the destiny of this nation,"" he said.
\
The central argument of his speech was that his still-unfolding economic revival plan has room for even demands a broader agenda. This is the big chore of his young presidency, and Obama's hope was that he can begin to persuade the country that the longer-term items on his presidential agenda are as important to the nation's economic well-being as unchoking credit and turning around unemployment numbers.
\
""The only way this century will be another American century is if we confront at last the price of our dependence on oil and the high cost of health care, the schools that aren't preparing our children and the mountain of debt they stand to inherit,"" Obama said.
\
He urged lawmakers to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases that cause climate change by creating a cap-and-trade system of limits and pollution allowances. And he said the budget he is sending to Congress on Thursday will call for $15 billion a year in federal spending to spur development of environmentally friendly but so far cost-ineffective energy sources such as wind and solar, biofuels, clean coal and more fuel-efficient vehicles.
\
He said his budget request also will create new incentives for teacher performance and support for innovative education programs. He asked every American to commit to completing a year or more of higher education or career training.
\
In contrast to many State of the Union addresses by George W. Bush, Obama did not emphasize foreign policy. He touched on his intention to chart new strategies in Iraq and Afghanistan and to forge a new image for the U.S. around the world even as he keeps up the fight against terrorism.
\
With the economy dominant, Obama said the mess was one he inherited. ""We have lived through an era where too often, short-term gains were prized over long-term prosperity, where we failed to look beyond the next payment, the next quarter or the next election,"" he said.
\
Nonetheless, he aimed to show he is tackling the situation with both urgency and strict oversight for how the staggering sums are being spent. The massive stimulus plan, an overhaul of the financial sector bailout, and a $275 billion rescue for struggling homeowners are already in place, and more is likely on the way, Obama said.
\
Even as Washington pours money into the economic recovery, Obama said the budget deficit, at $1.3 trillion and ballooning, must be brought under control.
\
He promised he would slash it by half by the end of his term in 2013, mostly by ending U.S. combat in Iraq and eliminating some of Bush's tax cuts for the wealthy. He said his budget officials have identified a total of $2 trillion in savings over the next 10 years, also including ending education programs ""that don't work"" and payments to large agribusinesses ""that don't need them,"" eliminating wasteful no-bid contracts in Iraq and spending on weapons systems no longer needed in the post-Cold War era, and rooting out waste in Medicare.
\
""Everyone in this chamber, Democrats and Republicans, will have to sacrifice some worthy priorities for which there are no dollars,"" he said. ""And that includes me.""
\
He touted his decision to end the practice of leaving Iraq and Afghanistan war spending out of the main budget. ""For seven years, we have been a nation at war. No longer will we hide its price,"" Obama said.

NEWBERRY, Fla. In retrospect, even Charlie Crist admits that ""the optics"" of The Hug are not great.
\
It was in the glow of a new day in politics last February when Mr. Crist, this state's popular Republican governor, took the stage with President Obama and declared that Republicans and Democrats had to rise above partisanship in support of an economic stimulus. And Mr. Obama embraced him.
\
Now, as a season of tea parties and fractious town hall meetings has energized the right wing, that embrace has endangered what once seemed like Mr. Crist's surefire bid for a Senate seat and put Florida at the center of a debate about the future of the Republican Party.
\
Republican pragmatists argue that to take back its majority, the party has to appeal to a broader range of voters, even if it means running candidates who might stray from the party orthodoxy.
\
Conservatives counter that Republicans have become Democrats' enablers in bigger deficits and bigger government, and that the way to win is to sharpen the distinctions between the parties.
\
A raft of conservative groups, commentators and politicians are supporting a primary challenge to Mr. Crist by Marco Rubio, a telegenic former speaker of the Florida House christened a Reaganite's answer to Mr. Obama by The National Review.
\
Mr. Crist, who has been endorsed by the National Republican Senatorial Committee, is seen by these conservatives as too moderate even liberal in his judicial appointments and his support of policies like cap and trade for emissions that contribute to global warming and restoring voting rights to ex-felons.
\
""Florida is a hill to die on for conservatives,"" said Erick Erickson, editor of the conservative blog RedState.com, which leads a daily drumbeat against Mr. Crist. ""This is the clearest example we have of these two competing concepts.""
\
Similar fights are playing out in primary races in other states. In a California Senate primary that promises to be just as intense as this one, conservatives are championing Chuck DeVore, a state assemblyman, over Carly Fiorina, the former chief executive of Hewlett-Packard whose candidacy has the support of prominent Republican senators and the party's 2008 presidential nominee, John McCain.
\
""Some of the Republicans who've been around a long time, they're the big spenders, they're the big government people,"" said Senator Jim DeMint, Republican of South Carolina, who as chairman of the Senate Conservatives Fund, a political action committee, has become a kingmaker for conservative challengers, and has endorsed Mr. Rubio.
\
""What's going to happen, the voters are going to weed out these Republicans who no longer share the core principles that make our country great,"" Mr. DeMint said.
\
It may be a principled debate, but it is not shaping up as a polite one.
\
As Mr. Crist was introduced at the Ronald Reagan Black Tie and Blue Jeans Barbeque at an open-air rodeo in this Central Florida town this month, hecklers with Rubio bumper stickers on their backs called out, ""Go Hug Obama!""
\
People posting on FreeRepublic.com mock Mr. Crist as Charlie Loafers. ""Charlie Crist Delenda Est,"" declared a RedState headline: ""Charlie Crist must be destroyed.""
\
Conservative and moderate Republicans take very different lessons from this month's special Congressional election in upstate New York, in which a third-party conservative challenged the moderate Republican candidate. In the end, a Democrat won the seat in the historically Republican district after the Republican dropped out under pressure from the right and then endorsed the Democrat.
\
Republicans took it as evidence that candidates from the far right cannot win. But conservatives say their candidate would have prevailed if the establishment had been smart enough to put its money behind him, rather than a Republican they argue was a Democrat in thin disguise.
\
Before polls closed on Election Day, Mr. Erickson and Mr. DeMint convened a conference call to identify the next conservative battlegrounds, urging thousands of followers to direct the energy and money they had spent in the New York race toward a Rubio victory. The Club for Growth is now backing Mr. Rubio, and produced an anti-Crist ad featuring the hug.
\
Endorsements from conservative leaders like Mike Huckabee and Dick Armey and glowing coverage from George F. Will and National Review have made Mr. Rubio, 38, the sudden standard bearer for a more conservative Republican Party. In the past few months, he has begun pulling closer to Mr. Crist in polls and fund-raising, collecting nearly $1 million in the last cycle.
\
Mr. Crist, endlessly tanned, endlessly sunny, is known as a gifted campaigner with savvy for symbolism.
\
Hoping to emphasize his record as tough on crime when he ran for governor, he had the host of ""America's Most Wanted"" deliver his papers to elections officials. He came into office promising to cut property taxes, and promoting consensus on issues like the environment and stem cell research. And if they sometimes say he is trying too hard to please everyone, voters, Democrat as well as Republican, have rewarded him with high ratings.
\
The National Republican Senatorial Committee backed Mr. Crist as soon as he announced he was running in May, thinking it would save trouble. He is as avid a fund-raiser as he is a campaigner, and helped deliver the state, and effectively the Republican presidential nomination, to Mr. McCain so the party could save money in Florida to spend elsewhere.
\
""I think pragmatism is not a bad thing,"" said the committee's chairman, Senator John Cornyn of Texas.
\
But, hounded by conservative bloggers, Mr. Cornyn announced this month that he did not plan to spend any money in the primary. The committee does not usually spend in primaries; the need for such a statement spoke to the heat of the race, 10 months before primary day.
\
Mr. Rubio, the son of Cuban exiles and a protg of former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, is known as an eloquent speaker and is quick with a quip. (""Charlie Crist supported the stimulus, and I've got the pictures to prove it."")
\
He argues for small government and reduced spending, but mostly, he talks about the need to stop what he calls the Obama agenda. ""The bottom line is that if you're a Republican, the Republican Party should be an alternative, not a facsimile,"" he said in an interview. ""And I think I offer that.""
\
He has been trouncing Mr. Crist in party straw polls across Florida. In Palm Beach County, the party held off a censure of Mr. Crist with a 65-65 tie. Sid Dinerstein, the party chairman there, said most of those voting against censure had done so only because they thought it should be used to condemn moral failings, not political ones.
\
In an interview, Mr. Crist, 53, called himself a ""pragmatic Reaganite conservative."" He is against abortion and same-sex marriage, and supports gun rights and the death penalty.
\
He sees how the hug could make him seem too cozy with Democrats. ""I understand the optics,"" he said. ""I also know where the polls are, still.""
\
A Quinnipiac University poll late last month showed Mr. Crist beating Mr. Rubio, 50 percent to 35 percent, and the presumed Democratic candidate, Representative Kendrick B. Meek, 51 to 31 percent. The poll also showed Mr. Meek beating Mr. Rubio, 36 to 33 percent.
\
But Mr. Crist's lead over Mr. Rubio had shrunk to 15 points from 29 points in August. And Rubio supporters point to an Rasmussen Reports poll in October that showed him doing better than Mr. Crist in a Meek matchup.
\
In part, Mr. Crist's troubles are local: the Obama embrace reinforced a sense that the governor shifts with the political winds.
\
""He hugged Obama when it was convenient, and now he's trying to distance himself,"" said Johanne Artman, 68. ""I don't trust him.""
\
Ms. Artman was corralling people to collect Rubio literature at the Reagan barbeque. ""I've never been so excited about anyone as I am about Marco Rubio,"" she said. ""Everything as a conservative I believe in, he stands for.""
\
But the complaints about the hug also reflect anger about the stimulus as Roger Pennington, a 56-year-old pharmacist, called it, ""bad money after bad.""
\
That anger has fueled the broader anti-establishment furor expressed in the tea parties directed as much at Republicans as Democrats, and especially at those like Mr. Crist who can be associated with Mr. Obama.
\
""He'll never be able to get over that photo,"" Mr. Pennington said, declining the opportunity to shake hands with Mr. Crist and his new wife, Carole, as they campaigned at the barbeque.
\
Mr. Crist does not apologize for appearing on stage with Mr. Obama, saying it was the polite thing to do when a president visits your state for the first time. ""He's the president of the United States,"" he said. ""I campaigned for the other guy. The bona fides on where I was are very clear.""
\
His supporters argue that the voices that are loudest now are not the voice of the majority.
\
""The majority of our country is not on either end of the spectrum, but somewhere in the middle,"" said Jason Rosenberg, 41, a plastic surgeon in Gainesville.
\
""I think the governor has crossed party lines well,"" he said. And, he said, ""I want someone who's going to win.""
"
60,"
Without a party affiliation next to their names, the two men vying for the 11th Congressional District seat might seem quite similar to an outsider.
\
Both Cashiers Realtor Mark Meadows, 52, and state Wildlife Commissioner Hayden Rogers, 41, have run their own small businesses. Both are pro-gun, pro-life and strong in their Christian faith. Both say they're favor reducing federal regulations that stifle economic growth, and both oppose gay marriage.
\
The fact that Rogers is the former chief of staff for current Congressman Heath Shuler, a Blue Dog Democrat, helps explain the parallels. But while the two men agree in principle on many goals of the office, they have markedly disparate views on how to get there. And their backgrounds and philosophies about government are very different.
\
A fiscal conservative and tea party favorite, Republican nominee Meadows wants to slash the size of the federal government, lower taxes across-the-board, promote free trade and increase resource extraction on public lands. If elected, he pledges to repeal Obamacare, reform Medicare and eschew earmarks.
\
Rogers, a ""conservative Democrat,"" casts himself in the independent-minded bent of his former boss. He sees education, job-training and new infrastructure as the keys to America's success in the global economy, and he's an ardent foe of free trade treaties that hurt manufacturers. If chosen, he promises to work across party lines to find common solutions.
\
The role of government
\
Meadows puts his faith in the free market and believes the federal government's role should be mainly limited to national defense, interstate highways and ""making sure there are safety nets"" to protect children, the poor and the elderly in times of need.
\
""As long as there's a purpose for it, and it moves us forward economically, that's where we need to be,"" he said. ""But every time we create a new federal program, like the Department of Energy has, it's been an abysmal failure. Yet we continue to fund these things.""
\
He's taken heat from Rogers for saying during a tea party debate last June that he wouldn't accept any federal grants for the district. Clarifying that position this week, Meadows said he would accept federal funds ""that support our first responders, law enforcement, the health, safety and welfare of our citizens.""
\
However, Meadows is staunchly opposed to federal earmarks, which is largely how former Rep. Taylor and Shuler have brought home the bacon for WNC. ""If something is going to be appropriated, it needs to be for the country as a whole,"" he said.
\
While agreeing that spending needs to be reined in, Rogers said the world's most successful nations ""find a way to incorporate private-public and nonprofit partnerships that empower people and create an environment that allows businesses to thrive and prosper.""
\
Without federal grants, Rogers said, many rural communities in WNC wouldn't have hospitals, fire departments, roads, sewage treatment plants and a wide range of infrastructure necessary to lure industries and create jobs. Had the federal government not helped fund rural electrification in the 1930s, he said, ""Western North Carolina would have struggled a lot longer.""
\
""Requiring people to continue paying their tax dollars, but not getting the benefit of it, this is an absurd notion,"" he said. ""Eliminating all federal grants, without thinking about how that affects our communities, is really troubling to me. Our focus should be on making sure those dollars are delivered and used as efficiently as possible.""
\
Debt and deficits
\
Both men call for balancing the federal budget. Meadows wants to start by amending the Constitution to require a balanced budget and through spending cuts. But that ""really won't make a dent,"" he said. ""So we've got to grow our economy by 4 to 5 percent annually to start to tick away at the deficit.""
\
He said by leasing oil and natural gas rights on public lands, including untapped reserves in Colorado, Ohio and Pennsylvania, the royalties alone could produce $16 trillion, enough to eliminate the debt. Raising taxes of any kind would only plunge the country back into recession, he said.
\
Rogers agreed that the country cannot keep borrowing money and must tamp down deficit spending by reducing regulatory redundancies and cutting government waste. Though he supports increasing domestic oil and gas exploration, eliminating the debt will take more than oil and gas royalties, he said.
\
The problem can't be approached by ""looking at things piecemeal,"" Rogers said. ""It really is going to take a bigger way of thinking that includes not only the revenue side, but the discretionary domestic spending side as well.""
\
No one party has the solution to the economic crisis, Rogers said, and both parties must work together. He said he's proven he can work across party lines, while ""Mark is so ill-suited to be part of that solution. He's going to be one of those guys who's not willing to compromise or be part of the give-and-take.""
\
Meadows said, ""I think we need to quit blaming others and start to come up with a plan. Regardless of whose fault (the deficit) is, step one is to stop the bleeding. And that requires making real cuts on a national level.""
\
Medicare
\
Meadows has voiced concerns that Medicare will go bankrupt by 2024 unless Congress steps in with major reform. He favors fixing the system by phasing in a premium-support model championed by Rep. Paul Ryan, which would affect those younger than 55 only. It would give seniors a set amount of money to purchase either traditional Medicare coverage or private health insurance.
\
Rogers said he ""absolutely opposes any effort to voucher-ize or privatize Medicare."" He said nonpartisan analyses have found that dismantling the current Medicare system and replacing it with ""vouchers"" would cost seniors thousands each year. There are bipartisan ways of cutting the costs of Medicare without hurting beneficiaries, he said, including allowing Medicare to negotiate with drug companies to set prices and eliminating fraud.
\
Education
\
Meadows said he'd like to eliminate the U.S. Department of Education and break up its $69 billion budget into state block grants, which could be awarded to each locality as a per-pupil allocation. The parents of those students could then decide whether to spend that money on public, private or charter schools.
\
""If you truly make school choice a viable alternative, it makes every school compete for those dollars, and they all reach for higher academic excellence,"" he said. ""Do I ever see the competition being so great that public schools go away? No, I don't even see it coming close to that. Really, if they're getting a better education, wherever that is, that's what we need to encourage.""
\
Meadows and Rogers agree that the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 is seriously flawed. Both men said its intentions were good, but it lacks flexibility and puts too much emphasis on standardized testing. Meadows said he'd vote to eliminate the law ""if it's not actually helping with higher standards.""
\
Rogers, who won the endorsement of the N.C. Association of Educators this month, said he is an ""unwavering proponent of a public education system. I think it's the bedrock to future success and it's truly the key to equal opportunity for all.""
\
Even though he favors bringing more power down to the local level, Rogers said forcing taxpayers to subsidize private or charter schools at the expense of public ones is wrong. He also believes there must be some federal standards for public schools, including colleges.
\
""Job opportunities are not limited to state lines,"" he said. ""We're competing with folks from all over the country and all over the world, and you have to have that ability to know there are minimum standards met.""
\
Meadows said he favors putting accountability in the hands of local school superintendents, not Washington bureaucrats.
\
Free trade
\
""I was not a big NAFTA fan,"" Meadows said, because it creates ""barriers"" for entry on a number of things. But he supports free trade in general because he feels ""we have the most productive and efficient work force in the world. The problem is, we're not competing on a level playing field.""
\
He favors reducing corporate taxes so American companies are not disadvantaged, and eliminating regulations such as overzealous mining safety laws and FDA inspections of pharmaceutical manufacturers that hamper trade. Meadows also opposes tariffs.
\
Rogers said Meadows has supported free trade agreements that have led to American jobs being shipped overseas. As part of Shuler's team, he said, ""we voted against every free trade agreement and pushed numerous pieces of legislation to help the manufacturing industry.""
\
""Mark has said that the federal government plays little or no role in job creation,"" Rogers said. ""This is actually a place where you need government to level the playing field. In the global economy, there has to be someone making sure that we are not being taken advantage of. That's not a role the private sector can fill.""
\
City mouse, country mouse
\
The two candidates had very different upbringings, one very urban, one very rural.
\
Meadows grew up near Tampa, Fla., even then a prosperous city of a million residents, got a bachelor's in Business Management from the University of South Florida and worked for a local utility, Tampa Electric.
\
About 28 years ago, he and his wife, Debbie, moved to Highlands, where they started a small restaurant with a $25,000 line of credit.
\
They eventually sold that business and Meadows went into high-end real estate. He built up Meadows Mountain Realty, sold it in 2006 and spent three years developing the Burlingame golf community in Sapphire.
\
Then he and partner Kyle McKim founded a new brokerage company, Highlands Properties, selling millions in luxury homes and land.
\
The people skills he developed in real estate sales came in handy in politics, too. Meadows became active with Republican Party, and eventually became Macon County chairman. He also served as a church elder at Community Bible Church and worked with Gilliam's Promise, a youth anti-drug program.
\
The son of two public school teachers, Rogers grew up in Robbinsville, a town of less than 700 residents and one of the state's poorest. But his academic and athletic prowess earned him a spot on Princeton University's football team.
\
His senior thesis at Princeton was a profile of Sen. Jesse Helms, though his emerging politics were closer to those of Sen. Sam Ervin, a fiercely independent Democrat.
\
After graduating, Rogers returned to Western North Carolina and ran several small businesses, including a construction company, a landscaping outfit and a retail garden center. He married his high school sweetheart, Donna Tipton, now the president of Tri-County Community College.
\
The couple live with their two daughters in Brasstown, where the family attends Little Brasstown Baptist Church.
\
In 2005, Heath Shuler tapped Rogers to lead his first congressional race, which unseated eight-term incumbent Charles Taylor. Rogers joined Shuler as his chief of staff, working closely with leaders in both parties to craft legislation aimed at tax relief, cutting the deficit and creating cap-and-trade policies to curb pollution.

Democrat Tom Hill is challenging Congressman Mark Meadows (R-Cashiers) for the District 11 seat in the U.S. House of Representatives.
\
Hill, a native of East Flat Rock who lives in Zirconia, attended Wake Forest College, majoring in physics and mathematics, and earned a Ph.D. in physics from UNC-Chapel Hill. He was employed by the Department of Defense and worked at the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Air Force Eastern Test Range, Space Detection and Tracking System Center, HQ USAFE in Germany and the Air Force Special Weapons Center. He completed his career in the aerospace industry and retired in 1997. He moved back to North Carolina in 1986. His campaign website can be found at www.tomhillforcongress.com.
\
Meadows worked as a small-business owner for 27 years. He was born in Verdun, France and raised in Brandon, Fla. He attended the University of South Florida, where he studied business management. He has served as the Macon County Republican Party chairman, on the Republican Party Executive Committee and as a delegate to both the North Carolina and National Republican Conventions. He serves on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and is the vice chair of the House Oversight and Government Reform's Subcommittee on Government Operations. His website can be found at http://meadows.house.gov/.
\
The candidates recently answered questions from the Times-News. Here are there responses.
\
You have both endorsed reforming American immigration policy, but the issue has been clouded recently by a surge of migrant children at the U.S./Mexican border. How can we balance the need of local farmers for migrant labor while securing our borders?
\
Hill: Congressman Meadows does not support immigration reform. John Boehner announced last March that he expected to pass immigration reform this year. But after meeting with Mark and other Republicans, Boehner announced that he couldn't do it. Mark has not kept his immigration reform promise to farmers because he's a captive of the tea party, which adamantly opposes reform. I support giving identification numbers to all gainfully employed undocumented workers who have no felony convictions. They should pay federal taxes like everyone else.
\
I support securing our southern border to stop the flow of illegal drugs. The border children are fleeing from gang violence and poverty. Most are being sponsored by family members in the U.S. who have sent the money needed to travel from Central America and are ready to provide homes for the children. There are undoubtedly some bad apples in the lot, just as in affluent U.S. neighborhoods, but the majority are simply looking for a better life. There were about 57,000 such children as of August this year. The number causes a border problem but is not overwhelming for a population of millions of people and thousands of square miles of empty space in the Southwest.
\
Meadows: The crisis of migrant children attempting to cross into the U.S. is a tragedy. They are at risk of exploitation, assault and death. The influx results from the president's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy, which incentivizes children to make the journey without fear of deportation. We must secure our border - not only for the U.S.' security, but to stem the tide of illegal entry by children. I've adopted the U.S. Farm Bureau's 7-point plan for immigration reform which opposes amnesty, supports a guest worker program and protects American jobs -- particularly in agriculture.
\
We're a nation of immigrants, a heritage I'm proud of. Legal immigrants have blessed the U.S. with talent, diversity and economic contributions. An effective legal immigration system is essential in maintaining industrial capacity, technological edge and global competitiveness. North Carolina's agricultural needs highlight the positive impact legal immigration can have. However, illegal immigration strains resources, displaces workers, poses a threat to national security, and makes a mockery of our laws. We must secure our border and enforce immigration laws. We must reform DACA and reform our system to make legal immigration more fluid. We're a nation of immigrants, but first and foremost are a nation of laws.
\
Should the United States limit carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants? Please explain why or why not.
\
Hill: We must do more than just limit carbon emissions from coal-fired plants. We need to pursue an aggressive approach to eliminate them. It was coal ash from a power plant that polluted the Dan River for about 80 miles. We have no viable plan for handling the ash, except for storing it in ponds and waiting for some catastrophe to occur. There are literally millions of tons of this stuff with no place to go. The only reasonable disposal approach is to bury it deep in the Earth in reservoirs similar to salt mines. Even then, there is some danger that poisons such as arsenic may make their way into the aquifers above them.
\
Coal is the dirtiest of the fossil fuels, with tar sands oil close behind. One of the Canadian provinces has recently closed all of its coal-fired power plants by replacing them with natural gas, hydroelectric, solar and nuclear plants. Our nation needs to get on the same page. Limiting coal emissions into the atmosphere will help, but speculators will turn the cap-and-trade approach into a cash cow for trading, as was done with ethanol. I would favor only a limited version of this approach.
\
Meadows: American individuals and business should not be forced to burden the extra costs of government mandated emissions regulations. I support renewable energy alternatives but oppose overly-burdensome government regulations. Coal-fired power plants have been subjected to emissions regulations for years. If the suggestion is to increase existing greenhouse gas caps on coal-fired plants well beyond existing levels, that could put a tremendous strain on the industry and provide a competitive advantage for countries that use those kinds of fuels -- particularly China. Rather than making more and more government regulations without the consent of Congress, I believe the Obama Administration should be empowering domestic energy production which will lower costs, create jobs, and reduce our dependence on Middle East oil.
\
Is the Affordable Care Act broken and what, if anything, should be done to fix it?
\
Hill: The only program we needed to rectify the health insurance crisis was a simple public option. It works like this: If you have an insurance policy you like AND it meets minimum federal requirements, such as not allowing cancellation if you get sick, you can keep it. If not, the Social Security Administration will sign you up for a minimal policy which works like Medicare, and the monthly premiums will be taken from your pay, just like Social Security but with the premiums depending on your age. If you want supplemental insurance, you can purchase it. In 2009 the Democrats watered down the ACA with unnecessary language and provisions in an attempt to appease the Republicans. But in the end, not one Republican voted for it or offered a constructive amendment. That Democratic approach was clearly a mistake.
\
Meadows: The Affordable Care Act -- commonly referred to as Obamacare -- is one of the most costly pieces of legislation in history and was rammed through Congress without a single Republican vote. Is the President's healthcare law a success? You cannot keep your existing plan. You likely cannot keep your existing doctor, and now Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is dictating what care elderly individuals will receive. By any measure, this law is a failure. Further, healthcare costs are expected to as much as double in 2015.
\
If there is any silver lining in Obamacare, it's that those with preexisting conditions cannot be denied coverage. I believe we can all agree that any health law should include this provision.
\
I support fully repealing the ACA and replacing it with patient-centered reform that will actually help lower the cost of healthcare and protect the important relationship between patient and doctor. I support affordable health coverage for all, but there is a better way than the ACA and the American people deserve a better option.
\
We should be allowing individuals and businesses to purchase health insurance across state lines to promote competition within the health insurance market. I also support medical malpractice reform that protects healthcare providers from frivolous lawsuit while also protecting patient safety.
\
The president's law does nothing to drive down costs -- in fact, rates are expected to rise in 2015. The affordable care act promotes more bureaucracy, more regulations, more and higher taxes, and less consumer choice.
\
While North Carolina's employment picture has improved since the recession, western counties in the 11th District still lag behind the rest of the state in job growth. What, if anything, can Congress do to boost job creation in WNC?
\
Hill: We create jobs in the U.S. by repealing offshore and other tax avoidance loopholes used by unpatriotic corporations, and using that tax money to rebuild the nation's infrastructure and to fund other public works projects, especially in the Appalachian Mountains.
\
Spending $45 billion per year on these projects amounts to less than one-third of the per-year amount spent on the War in Iraq at the height of that conflict, and would create more than one million jobs. The claim that cutting taxes for mega-rich corporations creates jobs is a lie, plain and simple. Corporations use the tax cuts to build corporation wealth, buy jet aircraft, buy back their own stock, and pay outrageous salaries and bonuses to their executive officers.
\
The cure for the offshore loophole is to assess income taxes on the basis of where profits are made rather than where the home office is located. When Dwight Eisenhower was President, corporations paid 23 percent of the U.S. tax bill. Today they pay only slightly more than 6 percent of the bill. We cannot cure the problem because the corporations buy off our legislators with huge contributions to their re-election campaigns. This form of legal bribery must be outlawed.
\
Meadows: Getting Western North Carolinians back to work is my top priority in Congress. Since being elected in 2012, I have co-sponsored numerous pro-growth pieces of legislation. Even though we added more than 6,000 jobs last year in WNC, we had been losing jobs by the hundreds and are only now gaining them back by the tens. The federal role in creating jobs should be focused on trying to make sure that we have the basic infrastructure to transport goods and services. As a member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, I've been working diligently to make sure that we have a good transportation system.
\
I've also focused my attention on ensuring high-speed broadband is available to individuals throughout our district to provide a good foundation for businesses wanting to locate in the region. New job creation will continue to come about through cutting red tape and regulations, lowering taxes, and creating an environment conducive to economic growth.
\
I will continue to work hard and focus on advancing legislation that empowers small business owners, reforms our tax code, pays down our national debt, and removes burdensome regulations.

62,"
Ten candidates for the 11th Congressional District seat held by U.S. Rep. Heath Shuler tackled questions important to the agricultural community Thursday in a forum sponsored by the Buncombe, Haywood and Henderson County Farm Bureaus.
\
Participants in the event at the WNC Agricultural Center were Democrats Cecil Bothwell, Tom Hill and Hayden Rogers and Republicans Spence Campbell, Jeff Hunt, Mark Meadows, Vance Patterson, Chris Petrella, Kenny West and Ethan Wingfield.
\
Candidates were limited to two-minute responses for each of the three questions. The following are portions of their responses:
\
1. Labor
\
Mandating E-Verify for agricultural employers without providing a solution to the issues of agricultural labor shortages in the U.S. would have significant negative consequences. Would you support an effort to provide farmers access to a usable worker program that responds to agriculture's unique needs and deals responsibly with our existing workforce?
\
Democrats
\
Bothwell: I think mandating E-Verify for a farmer is unworkable. We need immigrant workers and we need a better system for green cards and a better guest worker program. The biggest problem is the black market we've created due to the poor worker program. The problem is not at the farm level, but at the immigration-law level.
\
Hill: The official Republican policy is to send them all back to Mexico. The Hispanics that are here do a job that most of us won't do. I advocate giving them a work permit and use that to withhold Social Security benefits.
\
Rogers: North Carolina has more (migrant) workers than any other state in the country. It must be overhauled. We need to address our farm worker programs. Farmers need to have access to a legal workforce.
\
Republicans
\
Campbell: It is necessary before we answer that question to remember this country is in big trouble. Those in agriculture aren't different than any other labor force that needs workers. The population has increased and I don't know how many fold, but it's beginning to be a real issue.
\
Hunt: It's got to be scrapped and you've got to start over from the beginning, but you can't talk about E-Verfiy or farm labor unless you're going to talk about the things that we need to do for immigration, and that is no amnesty, get control of the border, start a verifiable guest worker program - and then we can talk about E-Verify.
\
Meadows: The Farm Bureau has a seven-point plan that really modifies in terms of a guest-worker program. It doesn't lead to amnesty; what it does is it allows on a short-term basis, first 12 months, that can be modified to add another 12 months for that guest-worker program. It works through state and local agencies and it identifies those that are here illegally, but it also provides a sustainable workforce. This is going to be critical in light of what the Department of Labor is going to do to say that kids that are 18 years or younger can't work on a farm. We need to say enough is enough.
\
Patterson: As a manufacturer, I support E-Verify, but I don't like it ... We've got a guest worker program which is dysfunctional. We've got work that needs to be done and workers that want to do the work, and yet we can't put the two together ... I will stand with you in Washington to change that process and to get workers in the field.
\
Petrella: The E-Verify program doesn't work. If I was congressman I would push for a better guest worker program.
\
West: Because of regulations that the federal government has put on many of the farmers, it's causing them to have to go to cheap labor right now ... I believe that what we have to do is put this country on the fast track to allow the illegal immigrants to go back and get (legal) status, but at the same time lower regulations on the farmers, because if we don't, it doesn't matter what we do with illegal immigrants, the farmers cannot survive in this country if the government keeps their hands in their business.
\
Wingfield: I think the state of immigration in this country currently is incoherent and it's broken, and we've got a bunch of businesses dependent on migrant workers, and the current system isn't helping ... We need a comprehensive immigration reform, and part of that reform needs to include a guest-worker program. I like the program that the Farm Bureau supports ... you've got to have strict enforcement, but you've got to have immigration policies that allow the workers to come here and migrate and to do seasonal work.
\
2. Energy
\
Recent energy prices are a strain on farm profits and there is growing concern over who we rely on for a large percentage of our imported oil. What should our federal energy policy be in order to provide sustainable energy prices and supply?
\
Democrats
\
Bothwell: The obvious solution is what you are already doing - cutting back on use. I know it doesn't translate into farm use, but your tractors can be more efficient. We've been cutting our gas use and we are exporting oil so we don't need to drill more. Conservation is the key.
\
Hill: The problem is twofold. It's increased demand by developing countries and speculation. We also need to hold companies responsible. Fracking is responsible, but we need to hold the companies accountable when it is done incorrectly.
\
Rogers: We need a comprehensive energy plan. It takes a combination approach. Oil is traded globally and we can supplement that with some other fuels that are more energy efficient.
\
Republicans
\
Campbell: I'd like to suggest we are not using the right frame of reference. Nickel-and-diming us to death isn't going to work. We are going to have an economic crisis and part of that is the immigration issue. Gas prices don't matter when we will have to give up of what we have to accommodate 150 million immigrants.
\
Hunt: This administration has an announced policy to get us to $9 a gallon gas and that's what a big piece of the problem is, it's not speculation ... We're stuck with fossil fuels for the next 30 or 40 years, so we'd better get used to that. You've heard all of us talk about drilling, you've heard all of us talking about the resources that we have both here and in Canada, and that is sufficient for our needs. The biggest problem that we're running into is it's been 38 years or so since this federal government has allowed the construction of a new refinery. So we're producing fossil fuels but we're shipping them to other countries because we can't refine them here.
\
Meadows: For over 35 years we've talked about coming up with an energy policy and we've done nothing about it. We've created the Department of Energy to do that and we're sitting here over 35 years later dealing with over $4 a gallon. We need to come up with a sound energy policy. Part of our four-point plan is really about energy. What we need to do is drill, and we need to make sure we use nuclear power. One of the reasons we don't build nuclear power plants is because of the regulations.
\
Patterson: People need to realize there's a difference between diesel, which is used on the farm, and other fuels. There's a pressure for diesel around the world. The rest of the world is realizing you get more power out of diesel than you do gasoline, so the demand for gasoline is down and the demand for diesel is up ... you need to be represented on this by someone who knows, who's grown up around farms. I will stand with you in Washington to make sure you're represented in diesel and keep the taxes out of it. They're going to come after you with taxes, because this government needs more.
\
Petrella: My question is what is your congressman going to do for your district, and as farmers, the issue is the farm diesel. The first thing I think that farms should be exempt from is cap and trade, because that's the reason why diesel gas has gotten so expensive. The second thing is, there are alternatives to run equipment on.
\
West: When I hear people say that we can't get gas production or that consumer production has gone down or consumer spending for gas is not as much as it was the last two years, there's a reason for it, because the unemployment has been caused by this government right now in the last two or three years. The problem is the regulatory process; people sometimes do not associate the regulatory process with the taxes we have. Every regulatory process that we have in this country causes businesses uncertainty -- every single one of them ... If we start removing regulations for new refineries, you will see this country take off.
\
Wingfield: I believe a big part of sustainable energy is domestic production. We've got so many energy resources right here at home, and it's a shame that we're not exploiting them. I think a big reason we're not exploiting them is we've got an overactive EPA up in Washington that thinks it knows better about how to do regulations and they're preventing the exploitation of so many natural resources that we have right here. If we can really increase this domestic production, we can have secure, reliable access to fossil fuels, to natural gas and oil, and I think we also need to expand nuclear production here.
\
3. Regulatory reform
\
Federal regulations are increasingly costly and cumbersome for U.S. farmers and rural communities. What legislative efforts would update, streamline and modernize the federal regulatory process that is having a large economic impact?
\
Democrats
\
Bothwell: I think regulations are necessary. Anyone can find fault with rules. If they go too far, we can correct them. Yes, Congress messes up, but it's gotten better over the years. We have cleaner water and we are not crushing business.
\
Hill: There is a place in our country for proper regulation. If we had proper regulation, the BP oil spill wouldn't have happened. What we are trying to stop are silly regulations. There are a lot of little regulations we need to get rid of. We need a review panel in Congress to make a list of counterproductive regulations.
\
Rogers: Unnecessary federal regulations are holding up the economy here and across the country. We need to improve transparency, base it on sound science and apply common sense. We can find a common ground to have you producing and with the safety we want.
\
Republicans
\
Campbell: I don't think regulations are the issue. Congress is the issue, and both parties are to blame. It's done on purpose and most of it is about money and votes. The only way to fix it is with leadership. We have to find a common-sense approach.
\
Hunt: The problem is that our Congress over the years has unconstitutionally delegated its authority to make law to the executive branch and to bureaucrats who pass regulations, which have the effect of law, and the outcomes are absurd because that was never intended by the Constitution, so we've got to get control of that; we've got to roll back these unreasonable regulations like Reagan did during his eight years, and if we don't get a Republican in the White House, the Congress can start that process of rolling these back.
\
Meadows: Part of our four-point plan is to reduce regulations by 20 percent, put a moratorium on any new regulatory law until each agency has met that. Also, any regulatory law that has an impact of over $250 million, you put a five-year sunset provision on that ... We're competing in a global market, and yet the standards that we have to do here in America are not what they have abroad, and that is not free or fair trade. And so by reducing regulations, what we will do is create jobs. For each 5 percent reduction in regulations we create 1.2 million jobs.
\
Patterson: As a manufacturer, I know the stupidity of a lot of regulations ... and I'm sure there are a lot of things that happen on the farm where you are required to do things like that. They are coming after you. (With regard to child labor laws), I know the culture of kids working on a farm, the work ethic they develop, and nobody takes care of their kids better than farmers, watching them, helping them grow up and learn how they grew up ... We need to protect that culture.
\
Petrella: Regulatory reform has gotten out of hand, and what we need to do is we need to put together consortiums of industry -- I'm not talking about lobbysists, I'm talking about people like you who are working on the farms ... We need to streamline the regulatory process and we need to put people involved in the regulatory process who know what they're talking about.
\
West: Our Congress is the fireball to (government). Why? Because they answer directly to us, the people. That's what the Congress is supposed to do. I don't think that there is a regulation that should be put forth that should not come before the Congress of the United States, because ultimately it's going to affect the people in their district. This country is too precious to worry about a president that has executive powers who tries to do it through a dictator-type process, and we don't have the gumption to stop it.
\
Wingfield: The regulatory environment in this country is completely out of hand, and I think the fundamental problem with it is we've got bureaucrats up in Washington who are not elected officials who have been put in place, who are completely detached from the values and the way of life that we experience on a day to day basis ... What I would like to do is go up there and reduce the regulatory authority that these unelected bureaucrats have and put that regulatory authority in the hands of state officials who understand what's going on in the state, and provide a regulatory apparatus that makes sense for the businesses and the people and the values of our community.

"
63," The attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, a recession, two wars and four tax cuts have sent the U.S. treasury from surpluses to record deficits. The Nov. 2 presidential election will take place against that backdrop, with sharp differences between President Bush and Sen. John Kerry on national security, the economy and health care. The Concord Coalition, a fiscal watchdog, says both candidates propose about $1.3 trillion in new initiatives and would add to the deficit. Here are some of their key positions.\ Iraq\ Mr. Bush and Mr. Kerry agree the United States cannot leave Iraq until it is stable. Mr. Bush argues Mr. Kerry has shifted positions on Iraq and that his criticisms would undermine the war there and the global war on terrorism. Mr. Bush says Iraq is part of the larger war on terrorism and that democracy there would transform the Middle East. Mr. Bush says the coalition - with Britain and 27 other countries - shows the United States is working with international partners. He does not offer a timetable for withdrawal. Mr. Bush does not seek to add troops to the active duty military but says he would support Pentagon requests.\ Mr. Kerry voted to give Mr. Bush authority to invade Iraq, but accuses Mr. Bush of misleading the public and rushing to war without enough allies or a postwar plan. Mr. Kerry says that under his plan, U.S. troops could start heading home in six months. The plan leans heavily on luring other countries to contribute troops and resources. He wants to speed training and equipping of Iraqi military and police. Mr. Kerry says the Iraq war was a diversion from bigger threats, including Osama bin Laden, and that it siphoned resources from Afghanistan. He says the military is employing a ""backdoor draft"" of members of the National Guard and Reserves. He proposes increasing active troop strength by 40,000 and doubling the number of special forces.\ Nuclear weapons\ Mr. Bush says the breakup of a Pakistani arms market selling to countries like Libya, which has since renounced its nuclear program, shows he is stopping the spread of nuclear weapons. He has refused to negotiate directly with North Korea, insisting that neighbors in Asia sit at the table as well. Mr. Bush says it would be a mistake to talk directly to North Korea, which broke a previous arms deal with the United States, because it would ease pressure to comply with international demands. Mr. Bush also is deploying a missile defense system designed to shoot down nuclear missiles. Critics say the system doesn't work and is too expensive.\ Mr. Kerry is against the missile defense system. He opposes administration efforts to develop new low-yield nuclear weapons intended to penetrate subsurface bunkers. Mr. Kerry says he would talk to North Korea and that doing so would not relieve pressure on North Korea from other countries. He contends the United States has done too little to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. Mr. Kerry says he would urge the International Atomic Energy Agency to seek United Nations action if Iran refuses to stop processing nuclear fuel and allow inspections. He says he would complete the process of securing nuclear weapon stockpiles in Russia in four years.\ Homeland security\ Security at ports and airports has increased and hundreds of millions of dollars has gone to states for security improvements since Mr. Bush established the Department of Homeland Security. Much of Mr. Bush's security strategy, however, lies overseas. He argues terrorists must be confronted abroad to prevent them from striking again in America. He says freedom in oppressive countries is an antidote to terrorism. Mr. Bush is involved in congressional efforts to reform intelligence agencies but does not support all recommendations from the 9-11 commission. He wants to expand the USA Patriot Act, a broad law that Congress passed soon after Sept. 11, 2001, that gave authorities more powers.\ Mr. Kerry says he would keep most of the Patriot Act but would restrict secret searches and inspection of previously private records, such as library records. Like Mr. Bush, Mr. Kerry says it is critical to strike terrorists abroad, but he emphasizes the need to justify attacks to the world. Mr. Kerry says Mr. Bush has resisted intelligence reforms and that he would carry out all recommendations from the 9-11 commission. He says he would boost inspections of cargo on ships and airplanes, although he has not been specific.\ Energy\ Mr. Bush would open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and other public lands to drilling. He would ease construction of nuclear power plants, oil refineries and liquefied natural gas terminals while expanding offshore drilling, although not off the Florida coast. He proposes $4 billion in tax incentives to promote conservation technologies, $1.4 billion over 10 years to make homes more energy-efficient and a $4,000 tax credit for hybrid gasoline- electric and other fuel efficient vehicles. However, he has helped keep down fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks compared to some proposals. Mr. Bush says he would require 5 billion gallons of ethanol or biodiesel in motor fuels by 2012 and continue a $1.7 billion initiative to develop hydrogen technologies.\ Mr. Kerry would boost alternative fuels and continue drilling in areas already being developed, such as the central Gulf of Mexico and the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska. Mr. Kerry opposes opening ANWR or waters off of the Florida coast to drilling. Mr. Kerry would increase imports from non-OPEC countries, such as Russia and Canada. He would boost renewable energy sources to 20 percent of electricity generation by expanding tax credits to more types of fuels and increasing incentives for clean and renewable energy.\ Environment\ Mr. Bush favors incentives over mandates to cut pollution. Mr. Bush has rolled back or altered several environmental rules since he took office. He pledges to cut power plant emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and mercury by 70 percent with a market- based cap-and-trade program that he says includes needed flexibility. Environmental groups say it will worsen pollution. He has proposed to relax rules that require power plants to add pollution technologies when they modernize or expand. Mr. Bush pulled out of the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement to reduce greenhouse gases.\ Mr. Kerry vows to reverse environmental decisions by Mr. Bush on air, water and logging on federal lands. He would reinstate a tax on businesses that pays for environmental cleanup under the Superfund program, which expired in 1995. Mr. Kerry would dedicate more oil and gas revenues to preserving and restoring habitats. He wants power plants to cut hazardous air emissions. He would offer incentives to family farmers to reduce pollution runoff but would crack down on large factory farms. He says the Kyoto Protocol is flawed but has suggested it could be renegotiated.\ Education\ Mr. Bush says education funding is up more than 30 percent since 2001, but Democrats complain funding for the No Child Left Behind Act, a landmark school reform law, falls short of promises. Mr. Bush supports private school vouchers and wants new achievement tests in public schools. He would spend an additional $200 million to help high school students who struggle with reading and the same amount to develop plans to track the progress of students entering high school. He proposes $269 million for teachers to help high school students do better in math. Mr. Bush would increase maximum college Pell grants by $1,000, to $5,050, and would raise the student loan limit for first-year students. Mr. Bush would spend $125 million for community college programs offering credit to high school students.\ Mr. Kerry would create a $200 billion education trust fund to pay for reforms and would allow schools to contest annual evaluations under No Child Left Behind, which Bush says would weaken reforms. Mr. Kerry opposes private school vouchers. He would allow the government to issue $24.8 billion in bonds to build and renovate schools. In exchange for youths working full time in national service jobs for two years, he would pay the equivalent of four years of state college tuition. He would raise aid to students who work part-time teaching and tutoring younger students. Families could take a tax credit on the first $4,000 of college tuition over four years. Mr. Kerry says he would find $13 billion over 10 years for his initiatives by cracking down on profit margins of banks for making student loans.\ Social Security\ Mr. Bush continues to press for Social Security reforms that would allow younger workers to invest part of their retirement savings in private accounts. Mr. Bush says benefits for current and near retirees would not be affected. Many plans along these lines, however, include cutting benefits and raising the retirement age at some point. Estimates put the price tag in the first 10 years between $1 trillion and $2 trillion.\ Mr. Kerry opposes private accounts and benefit cuts. He doesn't advocate specific changes to Social Security, which in 2018 is expected to begin paying out more than it takes in. The fund will only cover 73 percent of benefits by 2042, but Mr. Kerry argues growing the economy and controlling spending would strengthen Social Security.\ Health care\ Mr. Bush signed a Medicare reform law with the first prescription drug benefit for seniors at a cost of at least $400 billion over 10 years, although that figure has since been disputed as too low. The measure included tax-free health savings accounts for high- deductible insurance plans, which Mr. Bush wants to expand. He proposes grants for low-income people and tax credits for individuals and businesses to help the uninsured buy coverage. Mr. Bush says he's studying the safety of allowing seniors to import drugs from Canada, where drugs cost less. Mr. Bush would cap malpractice damages, saying frivolous lawsuits drive up health care costs. He says the government would partner with states and private groups in a billion-dollar campaign to sign up eligible children for health services.\ Mr. Kerry would allow people between 55 and 64 to join the federal employee health care plan. Under Mr. Kerry's plan, which he estimates would cost $653 billion over 10 years, the government would help pay catastrophic claims for employers and health plans that lower premiums. He wants the federal government to pay to insure 20 million low-income children in the state-federal Medicaid program for the poor, in exchange for states expanding coverage of low-income adults. Mr. Kerry voted for the Medicare prescription drug law but says it falls short. He would allow consumers to import U.S.-made drugs from Canada. He would allow Medicare to negotiate lower prices with drug companies, which Mr. Bush opposes. He would hold lawyers to legitimacy tests when filing suits but opposes limiting the right to sue.\ Jobs & economy\ Mr. Bush's plan to strengthen the economy and create jobs involves stimulation from tax cuts and domestic energy production as well as education improvements, expanded job training and more money for research and development. Expanded international trade is another major ingredient. He argues trade opens opportunities for U.S. goods and adds domestic jobs. Some Democrats and Republicans say cheap labor and lax environmental rules in competing countries puts the United States at a disadvantage, but Mr. Bush promises to negotiate fair deals and to enforce them. He vows to eliminate or loosen rules that he says put a burden on small businesses. He has resisted raising the minimum wage.\ Mr. Kerry would dissuade companies from sending jobs overseas by closing tax breaks that encourage it. He says new tax breaks to spur domestic manufacturing would increase U.S. jobs. Like Mr. Bush, Mr. Kerry proposes to add jobs with more domestic energy production, lower health care costs, more money for research and development, and changes to education intended to better prepare workers. He contends existing trade agreements are not being enforced, which he would change. He pledges to crack down on China, which he says cheats in the global marketplace. He would increase the minimum wage from $5.15 an hour to $7 by 2007.\ Taxes & spending\ Mr. Bush proposed, and Congress passed, tax cuts for individuals and corporations. Many are temporary, including a new 10 percent tax bracket, a reduction in the marriage penalty and a phase-out of the estate tax. Congress extended some cuts this year. Mr. Bush, who says tax cuts shortened the recession, wants to make them permanent. He says restraining spending would help halve the deficit in five years.\ Mr. Kerry proposes to roll back Mr. Bush's tax cuts for people making more than $200,000 a year, which he says would help halve the deficit in four years while paying for new initiatives. He would restore capital gains and dividend rates for families making more than $200,000 on income earned above that amount. He plans to close corporate tax loopholes and restore congressional caps on discretionary spending. Mr. Kerry would keep the estate tax on the largest estates. He pledged not to raise taxes on people making less than $200,000. He supports eliminating the marriage penalty and boosting the child tax credit.\ Veterans\ Mr. Bush has battled veterans wanting more health care money, even though his 2005 budget for the Department of Veterans Affairs would provide $20 billion more than in 2001. He opposes making increases for VA health care automatic rather than up to Congress, calling it too expensive. The VA has cut waiting times at hospitals and clinics but accomplished that by excluding higher-income veterans without service-connected disabilities. Mr. Bush proposes higher co-payments and fees for some vets in VA health care and ending certain co-payments for low-income vets. He signed legislation that phases in an allowance for certain vets to collect retirement and disability pay at the same time if they are at least 50 percent disabled, an issue known as concurrent receipt, but he says it would be too expensive to extend that to all disabled, retired veterans.\ Mr. Kerry supports mandatory funding for VA health care. Legislation he cosponsored would have a net increased cost to the government of $473 billion from 2005 through 2013, according to the Congressional Budget Office. That does not take into account his support to reopen VA care to the excluded group of vets - numbering more than 500,000 next year. He supports full concurrent receipt, which was estimated last year to cost $58 billion over 10 years compared to the limited allowance signed into law at a cost of $16.3 billion. He has criticized an ongoing plan to reorient health care facilities, requiring some to close so that others may open where greater numbers of vets now live.\ Gay marriage\ Mr. Bush has supported a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage, arguing ""activist judges"" undermine marriage as a union between a man and a woman. Mr. Bush has maintained a ban on gays openly serving in the military.\ Mr. Kerry opposes gay marriage but supports civil unions. He opposes a constitutional ban on gay marriage and would leave the definition of marriage to states. He would lift the so-called ""Don't ask, don't tell"" policy on gays in the military. He would expand hate crimes protection to gays.\ Abortion\ Mr. Bush opposes abortion and signed into law a ban, which has been blocked in court, on the so-called ""partial-birth abortion"" procedure. Mr. Bush also opposes allowing taxpayer money to be spent on abortions or abortion counseling. Mr. Bush says he would not apply an abortion test to nominations for the U.S. Supreme Court. He prohibited federal funding to be used on embryonic stem cell research except on stem cell lines already in existence at the time of his order in 2001 because human embryos must be destroyed to harvest the cells.\ Mr. Kerry supports federal funding for new embryonic stem cell research, which many scientists believe could lead to treatments for serious diseases. He supports abortion rights, voted against the partial-birth abortion ban and has said his Supreme Court nominees would uphold Roe v. Wade. He has voted to ban partial-birth abortion with exemptions for saving the life of the mother, but he opposed the version that Mr. Bush signed into law because it lacked that exception."
64,"Republican state Sen. Tom Apodaca wants to continue the work of stilling the Democratic voice in North Carolina. This is a divide and conquer strategy. The GOP has been very successful statewide, and nationwide, in marginalizing opposition. It would appear that they are following a well-thought out national extreme conservative playbook to grab power. Gerrymandering has become a favored method to still opposition. If Apodaca can create City Council districts by fording it on us with the help of the extremist Republican mob in Raleigh, then it becomes just a matter of gerrymandering the districts, like they have the rest of the state, to carve out predominantly Republican precincts. Then to their conservative delight they can get rid of this Cesspool of Sin. This is clearly not Mr. Apodaca's lone effort - this is a well-thought out Republican plan to still opposing voices. This is un-American - and if people don't get involved with fighting these efforts - Apodaca and the regressive Republicans will be successful and can continue with their anti-education, anti-Medicare, anti-Social Security, anti-worker rights, anti-immigration and anti-right to vote effort. Mr. Apodaca is furthering the disassembly of democracy in this nation . . . plain and simple.\Jeff Baker, Asheville\So Sen. Apodaca, who does not live in Asheville or even Buncombe County, wants to ram a bill through the General Assembly forcing Asheville City Council members to run in districts. Oh yeah, that's right, he is a member of the party that proclaims it stands for less government interference in people's lives.\Roger Miller, Asheville\State Sen. Tom Apodaca has decided that the way Asheville selects commissioners needs to be ""reformed."" And he insists that if the city doesn't do what he wishes, then he and the state will force Asheville to do it. He wants commissioners elected by districts, he says, because that is more fair. But on the subject of fair elections, Mr. Apodaca cannot be believed. He cares nothing about electoral fairness and his actions in the past prove it. He and his right-wing cronies drew districts across the state that guaranteed permanent Republican dominance in Raleigh. Having gerrymandered the state, Apodaca thinks it's time to gerrymander the city of Asheville.\Michael Carlebach, Asheville\Put a 'user fee', not\tax, on carbon\House Republicans recently once again passed a non-binding resolution opposing a carbon tax. While I'm truly alarmed about human caused climate change, I agree with the resolution, at least in part. The ""straw man"" carbon tax their resolution describes is a bad idea.\Instead we need a ""user fee"" to fight climate change. We are ""using up"" a shared resource that we must protect - the atmosphere. More specifically, burning fossil fuels ""uses up"" the atmosphere's ability to absorb much more carbon before truly disastrous warming. Climate scientists warn us not to exceed this ""carbon budget"".\Charging a carbon user fee is just common sense, and it's fair. Opponents claim that a carbon fee will hurt the poor. But recent studies show that the rich regularly use much more of our carbon budget than do the poor. Do the rich own the atmosphere? No, it's something we share. So they should pay more if they use more. If the fee revenue is returned equally to households, then the poor come out ahead. And we all win because this is the most efficient way to reduce harmful carbon emissions.\Read more about the ""Carbon Fee and Dividend"" proposal at www.citizensclimatelobby.org.\Brad Rouse, Asheville\Rouse is energy policy consultant, congressional liaison with Citizens Climate Lobby\Johnson and Weld offer alternative to Clinton, Trump\If you are as turned off by Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump as I am, you need to look into a third party choice. Look into the Libertarian Party with Gary Johnson and his running mate, Bill Weld. Good information can be found on their website, https://garyjohnson2016.com.\See where they stand on issues such as taxes, term limits, jobs, foreign policy and national defense, immigration, environment, education, abortion and the right to life, and other issues.\Hopefully, the Libertarian Party candidates will be included in this year's presidential debates. One has to wonder why our two major political parties don't want third party candidates included in debates. Could it be that they are afraid to let you know where other candidates stand on the issues?\Let your family and friends know that we have other choices besides Democrat and Republican candidates for president. Do your homework before the November election. Perhaps this can be the year that voters send a clear message to the Washington, DC establishment that there are alternatives.\Drew Thomson, Asheville\Why is the snake an\exception to the rule?\In Roger Aiken's column ""A nation distracted,"" he says he never wants to see an animal harmed, ""unless it's a snake, you can always kill a snake in my opinion.""\Why is the snake an exception to the rule? Is it because it's creepy looking and moves by slithering? Or maybe he feels this way due to a fictional book which has made the snake out to be evil.\Either way, like most of nature's creatures, the snake minds its own business unless threatened.\By advocating to kill one particular animal, Mr. Aiken is setting a cruel example for impressionable readers to follow.\Kevin Miller, Asheville"
65,"When you watch a baby being born, after a difficult pregnancy, it is so painful the mother it is always hard to tell the truth and say, ""Gosh, that baby is really ugly."" But that's how I feel about the energy legislation passed (and not passed) by the Senate.\The whole Senate energy effort only reinforced my feelings that we're in a green bubble - a festival of hot air by the news media, corporate America and presidential candidates about green this and green that, but, when it comes to actually doing something hard to bring about a green revolution at scale - and if you don't have scale on this you have nothing - we wimp out.\Climate change is not a hoax. The hoax is that we are really doing something about it.\No question, it's great news that the Democrat-led Senate finally stood up to the automakers, and to the Michigan senators, and said, ""No more - no more assisted suicide of the U.S. auto industry by the U.S. Congress. We're passing the first bill since 1975 that mandates an increase in fuel economy.""\If the Senate bill, which now has to go through the House, becomes law, automakers will have to boost the average mileage of new cars and light trucks to 35 miles per gallon by 2020, compared with about 25 mpg today.\But before you celebrate, pay attention to some fine print.\If the Transportation Department determines that the fuel economy goal for any given year is not ""cost-effective"" - that is, too expensive for the car companies - it can ease the standard.\But even this new mileage standard is not exactly world leading. The European Union is today where we want to be in 2020, around 35 mpg, and it is committed to going well over 40 mpg by 2012. Ditto Japan.\There are other things that make the Senate energy effort ugly. Senate Republicans killed a proposed national renewable electricity mandate that would have required utilities to produce 15 percent of their power from wind, solar, biomass and other clean-energy sources by 2020.\Twenty-three states already have such mandates. No matter. Making it national was too much for the Republicans.\And the Senate, thanks again to the Republicans, squashed a Democratic proposal to boost taxes on oil and gas companies that would raise some $32 billion for alternative fuel projects.\Despite all the new research on climate change, the Senate didn't even touch the idea of either a cap-and-trade system or a carbon tax to limit carbon dioxide emissions. An effort by Sen.

We have all the technology we need right now to make huge inroads in becoming more energy efficient and energy independent, with drastically lower emissions. We have all the capital we need as well. But because of the unique nature of the energy and climate-change issues - which require incentives and regulations to build alternatives to dirty, but cheap, fossil fuels - you need public policy to connect the energy and capital the right way. That is what has been missing.\""We have to work to ensure that the House will at least toughen the provisions that the Senate passed,"" said Dan Becker, director of the Sierra Club's Global Warming Program.\The public wants it. But energy policy gets shaped in the halls of Congress - where wily lobbyists, legacy industries and politicians greedy for campaign contributions regularly sell out the country's interests for their own. Only when the public really rises up - as it has finally done against the auto companies - do we even get moderate change.\Don't look to the Bush team to lead the revolution.\""We are the only major country in the world where no one even knows the name of the environment minister - the head of our Environmental Protection Agency,"" said Rep.

To the editor: This letter is to advise the community of Hendersonville and surrounding area of the acquisition of Shaws Creek AME Zion Church and Cemetery by the descendants of the Logan family and members of the community of Henderson County. This church will reopen its doors under a new name: Logan Chapel.
\
Logan Chapel will operate as a nondenominational church of Christian believers. Logan Chapel was the original name prior to the name change in 1929. The first pastor of the church was the Rev. John Wesley Logan, who served for 18 years until his death in 1929. The family feels it's only fitting to reinstate the original name.
\
We continuously seek your support and prayers as we prepare for its rededication as a place of worship.
\
As for the church cemetery, it's rumored that several individuals have prepaid for burial plots. As of this day, no record has been provided by the previous owners of AME Zion Church of America. We are seeking the assistance of those individuals who have purchased plots to submit documentation. Please contact me at 704-309-5423.

To the editor: Raleigh is at it again. The March 7 Times-News headline ""NC Tweaks Standardized Tests"" actually proclaimed a lowering of reading proficiency standards for third-graders across the state.
\
Apparently, as many as 12,000 students will no longer have to attend remedial reading camp. Not said, but presumably the reason, is the lowered standards save money.
\
Have you ever noticed that Raleigh's savings seem to be ""earned"" on the backs of our children and the environment? And of course, Duke Energy gets a pass on the environment because they are ""job creators.""
\
But Duke Energy is not a job creator. Duke's purchase of Progress Energy was all about increasing revenue while eliminating overlapping personnel functions.
\
Job creators indeed!
\
Raleigh can continue with its policies, uninterrupted, because individual county power structures throughout the state remain silent. Silence means assent.
\
So let's ask our elites to speak up. Ask why our commissioners, City Council and Chamber of Commerce haven't spoken out against the education cuts and continuing environmental degradation.
\
Could it be that they are simply content that we are better off than Florida? The alternative is that our children and the environment are no longer their priorities.

To the editor: I don't know when or why Mr. Benson left Canada to live in Hendersonville. If he has told us, I missed it. However, I'm wondering if it was because he did not like the way the game of politics was played up there. Now he's down here, and he is finding out that the game is played the same the world over.
\
He seemed taken aback by the idea that Mr. Pope would contribute some of his money to help elect Republicans. One wonders whether Mr. Benson has read in the news recently about Tom Steyer, who has pledged $100 million ($50 million of his own) if the Democrats will pass a cap-and-trade or a carbon tax bill, or any other measure that would raise energy prices. (That was the reason for the Senate all-nighter this past week.)
\
Then there's union money -- that usually flows only in one direction. I could go on, but I think I've made my point. The Democrats had control of this state for well over 100 years. That point in and of itself is reason enough to contribute to the other party and hope for some changes.

67,"
WASHINGTON - In the fall of 1997, when the Clinton administration was forming its position for the Kyoto climate treaty talks, Lawrence H. Summers argued that the United States would risk damaging the domestic economy if it set overly ambitious goals for reducing carbon emissions.
\
Summers, then the deputy Treasury secretary, said at the time that there was a compelling scientific case for action on global warming but that a too-rapid move against emissions of greenhouse gases risked dire and unknowable economic consequences.
\
His view prevailed over those of officials arguing for tougher standards, among them Carol M. Browner, then the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and her mentor, Al Gore, then the vice president.
\
Today, as the climate-change debate once again heats up, Summers leads the economic team of the incoming administration, and Browner has been designated its White House coordinator of energy and climate policy. And Gore is hovering as an informal adviser to President-elect Barack Obama.
\
As Obama seeks to find the right balance between his environmental goals and his plans to revive the economy, he may have to resolve conflicting views among some of his top advisers.
\
While Summers' thinking on climate change has evolved over the last decade, his views on the potential risks to the economy of an aggressive effort to limit carbon emissions have not. But he now works for a president-elect who has set ambitious goals for addressing global warming through a government-run cap-and-trade system.
\
It may once again prove to be Summers' role to inject a rigorous economist's reality check into the debate over the scope and speed of an attack on global warming.
\
According to a transition official familiar with Summers' thinking, he is wary of moving very quickly on a carbon cap, because doing so could raise energy costs, kill jobs and deepen the current recession. He foresees a phase-in of several years for any carbon restraint regime, particularly if the economy continues to be sluggish, a slower timetable than many lawmakers and environmentalists are pressing.
\
Summers and Peter R. Orszag, the economist whom Obama has designated director of the White House budget office, have both argued that a tax on carbon emissions from burning gasoline, coal and other fuels might be a more economically efficient means of regulating pollutants than a cap-and-trade system, under which an absolute ceiling on emissions is set and polluters are allowed to buy and sell permits to meet it.
\
But Obama and Browner have ruled out a straight carbon tax, perhaps mindful of the stinging political defeat the Clinton administration suffered in 1993 when, prodded by Gore, it proposed one.
\
Obama was asked in a television interview last month whether he would consider imposing a stiff tax on gasoline, whose price has now fallen to below $2 a gallon after cresting above $4 a gallon last summer.
\
He replied that while American families were getting some relief at the pump, they were hurting in other ways, through rising unemployment and falling home values. ""So putting additional burdens on American families right now, I think, is a mistake,"" he said.
\
At least for the present, then, the idea of a carbon tax has been shelved, and Obama's economic and environmental advisers are working, along with Congress, to devise a cap-and-trade system.
\
But difficult debates lie ahead within the White House, between the White House and Congress, and within the Democratic Party, whose deep divisions on climate change break down along ideological and geographical lines. The fight in November between two Democrats, Rep. John D. Dingell of Michigan and Henry A. Waxman of California, for the chairmanship of the House Energy and Commerce Committee was a preview. It pitted lawmakers from auto- and coal-producing states against liberal lawmakers from California and the East Coast, Blue Dog fiscal conservatives against environmentalists, pro-business moderates against regulatory activists. Waxman, with the tacit support of the Obama camp and Speaker Nancy Pelosi, won, but narrowly.
\
That was just a taste of the broader and potentially more bitter fight over global warming and energy legislation, which will have profound implications for the U.S. economy, the environment and foreign policy.
\
Both sides - those seeking strict enforcement of emissions limits and those concerned about higher energy costs and potential job losses - will find receptive ears in the new White House, Obama aides and outside analysts said.
\
""There is a diversity of opinion among Democrats over the best way to contain costs associated with a climate change plan,"" said Scott Segal, a utility lobbyist in Washington, who cited rival approaches pushed by Sen. Barbara Boxer of California, chairwoman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, and Sen. Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee.
\
""I think there is room within the current range of administration advisers to accommodate all those points of view,"" Segal said.
\
The Obama transition team did not make Browner or Summers available for on-the-record interviews. A spokesman, Nick Shapiro, said that Obama had appointed advisers with differing views but that ultimately he would set policy.
\
""At the end of the day,"" Shapiro said in an e-mail statement, ""the advisers will be charged with implementing President-elect Obama's strong targets that set us on a course to reduce emissions to their 1990 levels by 2020 and reduce them an additional 80 percent by 2050. However, the president-elect appointed a Cabinet with diverse views and looks forward to strong debate within the Cabinet on how best to achieve those outcomes.""
\
Emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases by the United States in 2007 were about 15 percent above 1990s level, according to the Department of Energy.
\
In past public statements and writings, Browner and Summers have wrestled with the difficult choices posed by global warming and at times have come to different conclusions on how to minimize the impact on the economy.
\
Browner has been a forceful advocate for strict carbon limits for years and has said that a comprehensive cap-and-trade system is the best way to achieve swift and certain reductions in emissions. She has said that the plan could include flexibility for carbon-emitting businesses by allowing them to bank and borrow permits, but she has not supported setting a maximum price or ""safety valve"" cost in case permits become prohibitively expensive, as Summers and Orszag have.
\
Browner has urged Congress to take up the issue quickly in the new year. In September, in testimony before the House Ways and Means Committee, she pointedly noted that the Supreme Court had given the EPA authority to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. She implied that if Obama was elected, the new administration might unilaterally seek to curb carbon emissions should Congress not act.
\
""Given the magnitude of the problem, and the scale of the solution required,"" she said, ""I believe it is important that Congress provide national leadership on this issue.""
\
Summers believes a cap-and-trade program can be a workable solution, provided it includes some sort of escape clause if prices rise too quickly, according to several articles he has written in the past two years. He has also expressed a belief that developing nations must also adhere to carbon limits, or manufacturing jobs will migrate to countries without them.
\
In a forum at the Brookings Institution a year ago, Summers said the current moment on climate change was analogous to that on health care in 1992: Everyone agreed that the current system was unsustainable, but there was less agreement on how to address the complexities and costs. There was a general expectation that with the inauguration of a new Democratic president, something would be done.
\
""In the end,"" Summers said, ""what everyone agreed needed to happen didn't happen in 1993.""

To hear many politicians expound on the virtues of ""growing the economy"" as the panacea for society ills, the results in the country with the No. 1 GNP in the world (us) have shown a slide in most measures of overall ""well-being"" (or the ""Quality of Life Index""). The U.S. is not ranked anywhere near the top in literacy, infant mortality rate, income equality, or providing universal health care relative to other industrialized nations. It does rank second however in greenhouse gas emissions! One major step in the right direction could be to formulate a sound energy policy that incorporates both free market and governmental incentives. British Columbia implemented a carbon tax about two decades ago and has enjoyed cleaner air, and no net change in taxes as both personal and corporate rates were lowered at the same time.

Will they support free and easy purchase of implements designed specifically to violate the command, ""Thou shalt not kill""?\Perhaps I have unfairly challenged this church's commitment to their asserted priority. I do believe our justly cherished First Amendment frees us to top the American flag on our church grounds with a religious flag. However, exercising that freedom may be colossal bad judgment. I hope it doesn't spark a childish flag squabble with Jews, Muslims, and other faith communities adopting the same idea. This could set back the drive for interfaith harmony and distract us from our commitment to religious freedom.\Johnny Douglass, Asheville"

The first four words of the Second Amendment read ""A well-regulated militia..."" What is well regulated about every yahoo owning a gun and shooting up elementary schools, movie theaters, night clubs and court houses, but is not part of a well-regulated militia as required by the Second Amendment? Gun owners need to meet the need of a well-regulated militia which would normally fall under the Defense Department. That means gun owners must always be in continuing education and training to keep up responsible skills as long as they own guns. Just like any member of the military or Congress it means a background check. It then means strict enforcement of those regulations to maintain that militia.\Philip Burton, Weaverville\Steps needed to protect\the environment\In recent summers there have been severe droughts and dangerous forest fires in California and other western states. If something is not done to protect the environment it is likely these will increase in future years.\Along the U.S. Pacific coast, prevailing winds blowing inland from the ocean bring high humidity and low rainfall. Giant sequoia trees thrive in this climate. They hold soil and when torrential rains occur sometimes they help to form streams and rivers. These trees should not be cut, but where they have been cut, the land has been converted to other uses such as golf courses. The golf courses should be relocated and this former forest land planted in trees.\No land should be left bare, not even in deserts. Deserts are the best place for solar panels because of low cloud cover and rainfall. There is enough desert land in California to run all automobiles in that state on solar powered electricity. These panels could be constructed in the cool hours of the early morning and late evening using movable solar lights. These panels will slightly cool the atmosphere and help prevent desert winds from encroaching on adjoining agricultural lands.\Maude Gilmer, Asheville\Readers voice concerns\regarding Trump\Now that Donald Trump is the presumptive presidential nominee of the Republican Party, it is appropriate to examine his key strategy. Scott Adams, author of the comic strip Dilbert, recently opined it is ""confirmation of bias"".

Extreme weather can worsen poverty, leading to uprisings that can destabilize nations, allowing terrorists to expand.

This is a carbon tax with all revenue returned equally to all households, which will reduce greenhouse gas emissions 52 percent below 1990 levels within 20 years while growing the economy and saving lives. This payment would benefit those with a lower carbon footprint the most. It would offset the higher prices of fossil fuels while encouraging investment in energy efficiency and renewables. This allows for us all to take responsibility for our own carbon footprint while spurring on businesses to do the same - including our energy suppliers. The concept has received significant bipartisan support, and dozens of Asheville leaders, including city councilors, business owners and faith leaders, have signed on to a ""leader letter"" calling for climate action.\To help the effort, Citizens' Climate Lobby urges everyone to make calls on June 20.

70,"As citizens we are told to change our lifestyle drastically for the future -- we are told to reduce our energy use, insulate our homes better, replace our light bulbs, and on and on. There's just one major problem with this scenario. Climate change is happening because we put things that trap heat into the atmosphere. When you're on a sinking ship, the first thing you do is plug the hole. Therefore, we need to stop putting heat-trapping pollutants into our atmosphere and that requires energy companies to make better decisions for our future. If the electricity sector is the largest source of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for more than 30 percent of the U.S. total, then Duke Energy can play a major role in plugging that hole. So what's the fastest way to stop emitting pollutants? Start transitioning to renewables. How do we transition to renewables? Make them cost-competitive or even cheaper than fossil fuels. How do you make renewables cost-competitive? Raise the cost of carbon emissions!\Some call this a ""carbon tax"" but others prefer a ""revenue-neutral carbon fee"" or ""carbon fee & dividend"" where citizens receive 100 percent of the money back in the form of a monthly dividend check. The fee & dividend will produce the incentives for people, businesses, and innovators to make the transition happen more quickly as well as offset the rising costs that energy companies will pass along to us. So neither the energy companies, consumers or the economy will suffer as a result of this innovative solution. In fact, the quicker we transition to carbon-free alternatives the better off we'll be - reducing emissions and energy costs, thereby increasing our competitiveness around the world. But, if we don't make this transition quickly we could end up paying the cost for this bad miscalculation.\With a huge level of support behind carbon pricing that includes the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), IMF, IEA, World Bank, six major U.S. banks, Bill Gates, Elon Musk, top economists, and even six large European oil and gas companies, you can see why one might think this is our future. With that said, if we get locked into paying for carbon-based fuels like the natural gas plant that Duke is proposing, without a serious plan for transition to renewables, then we the people will end up paying the cost of Duke's bad decisions.\Please submit your comments to statements@ncuc.net before Feb. 22.\Steffi Rausch is an Asheville web designer with evolv.com and lead organizer for Asheville Citizens' Climate Lobby.\Steffi Rausch\guest columnist"
71,"Global warming is real. It is aggravated by human activities, and societies everywhere will have to adapt. While emissions already accumulated in the atmosphere make some damage inevitable, the worst can be avoided if all the world's nations take swift action to stabilize and then reverse emissions.\Although America, with 5 percent of the world's population, produces one-fourth of the world's emissions, it is China that already produces 16 percent of the world's CO2, where millions (the greatest migration in the history of the planet) are leaving their farms for urban areas, and that may soon approach America's energy consumption.\Two nations hold keys\Therefore, what America and China do about energy and the environment is what will determine the success or failure of the only international attempt to do something about the greatest problem humanity has ever faced.\In America, the automobile is considered an essential aspect of our culture. We have as many cars as we have people. In China the number of cars is increasing rapidly. However, China appears to be the world leader in embracing energy-efficient transportation technologies that will eliminate internal combustion engines.\The Chinese government rationalizes that the world cannot afford two countries that pollute as much as the United States. Therefore it mandates that automakers must produce more efficient cars. The recent auto show in Shanghai unveiled an unprecedented array of hybrid, electric and fuel-cell cars.\Serious about pollution\The Chinese government has initiated an effort similar to America's Apollo program. Universities and technical institutes across China are involved in advanced vehicle propulsion research and development programs.\China, like Europe and Japan, is concerned about the effects of severe air pollution and dependence on imported oil. It has already adopted European fuel economy standards, which are more stringent than American standards. Next year China plans to tighten its standards even more, as well as impose a carbon tax on gas-guzzlers.\Volkswagen, Toyota, Honda and General Motors have expressed interest in participating with Chinese automakers as joint-venture partners in the development of hybrid gasoline-electric and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles.\China's motor vehicle market is now the second largest in the world, after the United States, and is still expanding.\Rick Wagoner, GM's chairman, told the Chinese that GM was far enough along in designing fuel cells that it would commence engineering work on a production model.\Showing leadership\It was interesting that the fuel-cell shown in Shanghai was more advanced than the model shown at the Detroit auto show three months earlier. Wagoner said ""China may very well be the first country to develop a broad-based fuel cell infrastructure."" Two Chinese companies also showed prototype hydrogen fuel cell cars.\Now would appear to be an opportunity to cooperate with China and the United Nations to do better than we did with the Soviet Union, when we were unable to agree on a world policy to control nuclear energy.\Already the Security Council has discussed how global climate change may become a matter of world peace and security.\Therefore, a joint program by America and China, the major greenhouse gas emitters, to work together to prioritize the development of technical alternatives to the internal combustion engine would be a splendid example of cooperation to mitigate climate change.\Dr. Lloyd V. Stover is an environmental scientist who has been a consultant to the UN and World Bank on energy and environmental matters. He lives in Asheville."
72,"Thousands of Chinese are fleeing to the United States. We are not talking about impoverished peasants hiding in cargo containers. We're talking about millionaires flying first class and buying condos in the choicest ZIP codes.

These are not the ""huddled masses"" immortalized on the Statue of Liberty's poem, but they are -- quite literally -- ""yearning to breathe free.""\One can see the point of leaving China if you have the resources. Rust-colored toxic wastes choke its rivers. Sooty air makes eyes itch. And public health crises in some industrial towns have reached the level that they're being called ""cancer villages."" Who wants to expose the family to that if you can live under Boston's blue skies and in close proximity to the select U.S. universities you want your kids to attend anyway.\About a quarter of recent buyers for Boston's top luxury condos have been foreign investors, especially from China and other parts of Asia. A local entrepreneur, Patty Chen, runs a soup-to-nuts relocation service, American Asia Business Tour Group-Boston, helping out with immigration visas, real estate services, and advice on schools and neighborhoods.\Manhattan has experienced a similar rush of Chinese buyers. Michael Chen at the brokerage firm Bond New York cites their preference for New York's fresh air and ""better family and work/life balance."" Guess it's all relative.\How bad is the pollution back in China? A recent study published by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences found that Chinese living in their country's heavily industrial north die on average five years earlier than those living in the south. Reliance on coal-fired heating and factories is largely to blame.\China has been the world's third-most popular tourist destination, after France and the United States. But the number of visitors there fell 5 percent this year. The China National Tourism Administration cites the smog as a big factor keeping people away. Beijing saw a steeper, 15 percent, drop in foreign travelers. More and more businesspeople are reportedly trying to get moved out of Beijing for health reasons.\For decades, corrupt Communist Party leaders have squandered their natural heritage in their push to create jobs -- and stay in power. The policy has also enriched their families and cronies feasting off the big, dirty industrial machine. But now environmental squalor is beginning to be bad for business -- as well as stirring social unrest, which is about time.\The government has started sponsoring studies on ways to lessen pollution, both the noxious type you breathe and the invisible planet-warming gases from the same sources. Proposals include a carbon tax on fossil fuels and a national carbon credit market. Sound familiar?\Environmental segregation is not unknown in the United States. Affluent precincts in this country maintain pristine surroundings, while poorer ones often get the smokestacks, waste facilities and lax regulations.\But Americans never let things reach the point that their rich citizens immigrated in massive numbers to cleaner countries. And to their credit, Americans have accepted the loss of some competitive advantage in global manufacturing as a necessary price to pay for protecting our natural surroundings.\The alarm is sounding for China's elite to also address the trade-off between explosive economic growth and environmental degradation. Jobs versus early death should be a topic for national debate.\You wonder whether China's environment would have been allowed to get so putrid if rich Chinese had to gasp the same air as the toilers.

Washington's pushing yet another ""Chicken Little"" gambit. No it isn't the sky that's falling, but they say it's heating up so earth is in immediate and imminent danger according to team Obama.

Liberal Democrats dream of another tax nirvana where they have power to charge for ""excessive"" carbon footprints. This gas is their culprit du jour, the greenhouse gas most in political vogue, the gas they believe will condense into votes.

Maybe it's because carbon emissions are easier to measure since they're emitted from smokestacks and exhaust pipes. That makes a carbon tax computation relatively simple and straightforward.

74,"Global warming is real. It is aggravated by human activities, and societies everywhere will have to adapt. While emissions already accumulated in the atmosphere make some damage inevitable, the worst can be avoided if all the world's nations take swift action to stabilize and then reverse emissions.\Although America, with 5 percent of the world's population, produces one-fourth of the world's emissions, it is China that already produces 16 percent of the world's CO2, where millions (the greatest migration in the history of the planet) are leaving their farms for urban areas, and that may soon approach America's energy consumption.\Two nations hold keys\Therefore, what America and China do about energy and the environment is what will determine the success or failure of the only international attempt to do something about the greatest problem humanity has ever faced.\In America, the automobile is considered an essential aspect of our culture. We have as many cars as we have people. In China the number of cars is increasing rapidly. However, China appears to be the world leader in embracing energy-efficient transportation technologies that will eliminate internal combustion engines.\The Chinese government rationalizes that the world cannot afford two countries that pollute as much as the United States. Therefore it mandates that automakers must produce more efficient cars. The recent auto show in Shanghai unveiled an unprecedented array of hybrid, electric and fuel-cell cars.\Serious about pollution\The Chinese government has initiated an effort similar to America's Apollo program. Universities and technical institutes across China are involved in advanced vehicle propulsion research and development programs.\China, like Europe and Japan, is concerned about the effects of severe air pollution and dependence on imported oil. It has already adopted European fuel economy standards, which are more stringent than American standards. Next year China plans to tighten its standards even more, as well as impose a carbon tax on gas-guzzlers.\Volkswagen, Toyota, Honda and General Motors have expressed interest in participating with Chinese automakers as joint-venture partners in the development of hybrid gasoline-electric and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles.\China's motor vehicle market is now the second largest in the world, after the United States, and is still expanding.\Rick Wagoner, GM's chairman, told the Chinese that GM was far enough along in designing fuel cells that it would commence engineering work on a production model.\Showing leadership\It was interesting that the fuel-cell shown in Shanghai was more advanced than the model shown at the Detroit auto show three months earlier. Wagoner said ""China may very well be the first country to develop a broad-based fuel cell infrastructure."" Two Chinese companies also showed prototype hydrogen fuel cell cars.\Now would appear to be an opportunity to cooperate with China and the United Nations to do better than we did with the Soviet Union, when we were unable to agree on a world policy to control nuclear energy.\Already the Security Council has discussed how global climate change may become a matter of world peace and security.\Therefore, a joint program by America and China, the major greenhouse gas emitters, to work together to prioritize the development of technical alternatives to the internal combustion engine would be a splendid example of cooperation to mitigate climate change.\Dr. Lloyd V. Stover is an environmental scientist who has been a consultant to the UN and World Bank on energy and environmental matters. He lives in Asheville."

The result is that small disruptions in supply, such as bad weather in the Gulf of Mexico or terrorist threats, result in higher prices.\More refineries\In addition, there is a mismatch between the type of oil being produced and the refineries that must process it. Light crude oil, used to make gasoline, is easier to process. Heavy oil is used for making fuel oil. We need more refineries. None have been built in America for over 30 years. Sites are scarce, permitting is difficult and construction costs have doubled.\Much of the same applies to the development of new oilfields. The cost of developing them has also doubled. Environmental concerns (the Santa Barbara oil spill) have banned oil production off most coastal areas. Unfortunately, the most promising areas for exploration are also the most technically challenging: in deeper offshore waters, or in the Arctic. They will take at least a decade to develop and costs will be higher.\Then there is the possibility of extracting oil from shale or coal; but the costs and environment risks will be much greater.\The good news is that the European Union is serious about conservation and alternative energy.

79,"
I don't expect much from the G-20 meeting this week, but if I had my wish, the leaders of the world's 20 top economies would commit themselves to a new standard of accounting - call it ""Market to Mother Nature"" accounting. Why? Because it's now obvious that the reason we're experiencing a simultaneous meltdown in the financial system and the climate system is because we have been mispricing risk in both arenas - producing a huge excess of both toxic assets and toxic air that now threatens the stability of the whole planet.
\
Just as AIG sold insurance derivatives at prices that did not reflect the real costs and the real risks of massive defaults (for which we the taxpayers ended up paying the difference), oil companies, coal companies and electric utilities today are selling energy products at prices that do not reflect the real costs to the environment and real risks of disruptive climate change (so future taxpayers will end up paying the difference).
\
Whenever products are mispriced and do not reflect the real costs and risks associated with their usage, people go to excess. And that is exactly what happened in the financial marketplace and in the energy/environmental marketplace during the credit bubble.
\
Our biggest financial-services companies, some of which came to be seen as too big to fail, engaged in complex financial trading schemes that did not adequately price in the costs and risks of a market reversal. AIG, for instance, was selling insurance for all kinds of financial instruments and did not have anywhere near adequate reserves to cover claims if things went badly wrong, as they did. And our biggest energy companies, utilities and auto companies became dependent on cheap hydrocarbons that spin off climate-changing greenhouse gases, and we clearly have not forced them, through a carbon tax, to price in the true risks and costs to society from these climate-changing fuels.
\
""When the balance sheet of a company does not capture the true costs and risks of its business activities,"" and when that company is too big to fail, ""you end up with them privatizing their gains and socializing their losses,"" Nandan Nilekani, the co-chairman of the Indian technology company Infosys, remarked to me. That is, everyone gets to rack up their private profits today and pay them out in current bonuses and dividends. But any catastrophic losses - if the company is too big to fail - ""get socialized and paid off by taxpayers.""
\
This is why we need new banking regulation that reins in the leverage and speculative trading that big banks and insurance companies can undertake so they never again become simultaneously too reckless to regulate but too big fail and taxpayers are forced to pay off the toxic assets they accumulate. And this is also why we need a tax on carbon - so we and our power utilities don't become permanently addicted to cheap coal that makes for lower electricity prices today but spits out toxic greenhouse gases that have to be paid for by future generations tomorrow.
\
That's what ""Market to Mother Nature"" accounting is all about. It begins with the premise that the distinction between the G-20 and the Copenhagen climate change negotiations is totally artificial. They are just flip sides of the same global problem - how we as a world keep raising standards of living for more and more people in ways that will not, as a byproduct, have both the Market and Mother Nature producing huge amounts of toxic assets.
\
The old system, which has reached its financial and environmental limits, worked like this: We built more and more stores in America to sell more and more stuff, which was made in more and more Chinese factories powered by more and more coal that earned more and more dollars to buy more and more U.S. T-bills that got recycled back to America in the form of cheap credit to build more and more stores and more and more houses that gave rise to more and more Chinese factories. ...
\
This system was a powerful engine of wealth creation and lifted millions out of poverty, but it relied upon the risks to the Market and to Mother Nature being underpriced and to profits being privatized in good times and losses socialized in bad times. This capitalist engine doesn't need to be discarded; it needs some fixes. For starters, we need to get back to basics - accountable lending, prudent saving, reasonable leverage and, most important, more engineering of goods than just financial products.
\
Some of our biggest financial firms got away from their original purpose - to fund innovation and to finance the process of ""creative destruction,"" whereby new technologies that improve people's lives replace old ones, said the Columbia University economist Jagdish Bhagwati, in an interview in The American Interest. Instead, he added, too many banks got involved in exotic and incomprehensible financial innovations - to simply make money out of money - which ended up as ""destructive creation.""
\
""Destructive creation"" has wounded both the Market and Mother Nature. Smart regulation and carbon taxation can heal both.

The North Carolina Utilities Commission on Monday gave Duke Energy the go-ahead to replace its coal-burning plant in Arden with a larger natural gas plant, with a few caveats.
\
The Utilities Commission denied Duke's request for approval of a third, contingent unit that plans stipulated might be needed years down the road. The ruling followed the lead of the Utilities Commission's public staff, many members of the public and other groups that formally intervened in the process.
\
The expedited decision on the Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity for Duke Energy's Western Carolinas Modernization Project came exactly 45 days after Duke filed its application on Jan. 15. That was the deadline set by The Mountain Energy Act of 2015, signed into law last June.
\
That legislation also modified the company's requirements under the Coal Ash Management Act of 2014.
\
Duke now has permission to build up to 752 megawatts of natural-gas fueled electric generation, consisting of two new 280-megawatt simple cycle combustion turbines, each with a fuel backup. They would replace the current 376 megawatt coal plant at Arden.
\
According to Duke's application, the plan is estimated to cost roughly $1.1 billion, though further cost details were filed under seal.
\
In a news release Monday, Duke said it plans to file future applications for 15 megawatts of solar generation and 5 megawatts of utility-scale electricity storage. The release said the utility ""will continue to work with communities to explore and maximize programs and technology to delay or cancel future plans for additional peaking generation.""
\
David Fountain, Duke Energy's North Carolina president, said in the release that the company now has ""a unique opportunity to reduce energy demand and invest in technology that will provide cleaner energy to power the growing region of Western North Carolina.""
\
The commission released its Notice of Decision Monday afternoon, saying it accepts the public staff's recommendation to deny the third unit ""for reasons that will be discussed in a subsequent order granting DEP a certificate of public convenience and necessity.""
\
Duke's application says the two combined cycle units are set to begin operation in 2019, and the third unit would start up in 2023, if current demand was not reduced by the utilization of other technologies and programs.
\
The company is working with the Asheville, Buncombe County and the surrounding area to explore solutions to reduce demand in the Duke Energy Progress-West region, a nine-county area serving more than 350,000 people, the release says, ""and will closely track collective progress toward reducing daily and peak power demand."" If those efforts are successful, Duke will ""delay or cancel plans to file a future"" application for the third power plant, the release states.
\
According to the NCUC notice, the ""Commission denies the request for a CPCN for the 186 MW combustion turbine unit without prejudice to DEP's right to file a future CPCN application.""
\
Six conditions are listed, requiring Duke to retire its existing coal units at the Asheville site no later than the operation dates of the new units, that the company construct and operate those new units according to proper laws and regulations, investigate retrofitting its four coal burning power plants in Roxboro and that the notice of decision does not constitute approval of the final costs associated.
\
Among those requirements are also that Duke file annual cost reports, and annual progress reports that include the company's efforts ""to work with its customers in the DEP-Western Region to reduce peak load through demand-side management, energy efficiency or other measures, and on DEP's efforts to site solar and storage capacity.""
\
State Sen. Tom Apodaca (R-Henderson), who sponsored the Mountain Energy Act last year, said he was thrilled to hear of the approval of the two gas turbines and retirement of coal, but showed concern at the denial of the third.
\
""I don't want us to not do it if we need it,"" he said, adding that with the area's growth, he wants further study on energy demand and the third unit.
\
He also mentioned the recent announcement by automotive manufacturer GF Linamar that it would bring 350 jobs to Henderson County, saying a steady stream of power was a main reason the company located in the county.
\
Groups that formally intervened in the process include the Carolina Utilities Customers Association, the Carolina Industrial Group for Fair Utility Rates II, NC WARN, The Climate Times, the Sierra Club and MountainTrue.
\
The Southern Environmental Law Center, representing MountainTrue and Sierra Club, released a statement Monday shortly after the utilities commission announcement, expressing reservations about the announcement and calling the decision mixed.
\
""We're pleased that the Commission has denied permission to build the third, 186 MW 'peaking unit,' "" Joan Walker, campaign director at MountainTrue, stated in the release.
\
She said the decision is another step toward retiring the coal plant at Lake Julian, but ""We regret the Utilities Commission's approval of the two 280 megawatt natural gas combined-cycle units that expert analysis determined were unjustified and oversized and not the best use of ratepayer dollars.""
\
Emma Greenbaum, the North Carolina organizing representative for Sierra Club, expressed similar feelings toward the announcement, saying the group was pleased to hear of the denial of the third unit, but ""It is unfortunate that we're being forced to continue on a climate-polluting path when energy efficiency and renewables continue to be the best, least cost solution for consumers and the environment.""

85,"Asheville is a community of action rather than just talk and the Blue Horizons Project is all about action.\In 2016, the City of Asheville, Buncombe County and Duke Energy came together in a unique partnership to form the Energy Innovation Task Force, designed to lead Western North Carolina to a cleaner, affordable and smarter energy future. A specific goal of the partnership is to delay or avoid construction of a natural gas peaker plant on Lake Julian that would only run on the coldest and hottest days of the year.\These convening partners, along with local businesses, institutions and environmental and clean energy advocates, have now developed the path forward to reach both of these goals, and we are pleased to announce an outgrowth of those efforts with the launch of the Blue Horizons Project.\Asheville is a community of action rather than just talk and the Blue Horizons Project is all about action. The Blue Horizons Project creates a vehicle for collaboration and connects people with energy efficiency, demand-side management and renewable energy efforts. The website provides easy access to resources, tips and programs that help everyone take the first step in their clean energy journey — making your home and business more energy efficient.\Why is this important? Because energy generation and use has impacts on the environment and our climate. Because we are paying more and more for energy. And because both the environmental impacts and the increasing cost of energy fall heaviest on those in our community who are least able to absorb and afford the impact. We want to avoid these impacts.\Through this effort, we have learned a lot about energy use in our community. We have learned that our peak energy use occurs on cold winter mornings and that the largest contributor to that spike in energy use is residential heating. Indeed, we use 30 percent more energy on those cold winter mornings than on hot summer afternoons when everyone is running their air conditioning.\Because of this, the Blue Horizons Project is helping people use less energy on those cold mornings. Homeowners and renters can get a free energy audit of their home that will offer options on how to make their house more energy efficient. Homeowners can also join Duke Energy's EnergyWise program that offers up to $175 per year to reduce energy use in those peak hours.\In addition, through the Blue Horizons Project, hundreds of thousands of dollars are being invested to make the homes of our low-income neighbors more efficient. Through these efforts, we hope to reach well over 2,000 low-income households in Asheville and Buncombe County this year.\While residential heating is the primary driver of our peak energy use, it is not the only one. Commercial lighting and heating are also factors, so the Blue Horizons Project is offering ways for businesses to reduce their energy use through Duke Energy's business programs.\Clean energy technology also plays a role in helping us reach our goals. Buncombe County is installing a 5-megawatt solar field on its closed landfill and Duke Energy is committed to installing 15-megawatts of solar energy. Duke is also investing in commercial scale battery storage — 19 megawatts so far — a significant amount for a community our size. We also hope Asheville will be the site of North Carolina's first community solar project. And automatic meters, which are a proven tool to help reduce energy use, are also coming this year.\The Blue Horizons Project goals are big and no community has done what we are attempting to do — avoid new investments in fossil fuel infrastructure by investing much more in energy efficiency, demand management, and clean energy. Success will depend on all of us — individuals, businesses, institutions, government.\We invite you to visit bluehorizonsproject.com and join your neighbors on the journey to a clean energy future today.\Asheville City Councilwoman Julie Mayfield, Buncombe County Board of Commissioners Chairman Brownie Newman and Duke Energy District Manager Jason Walls serve as members of the Energy Innovation Task Force, which created the Blue Horizons Project.\Asheville is a community of action rather than just talk and the Blue Horizons Project is all about action."
86,"ASHEVILLE - A reworked Duke Energy natural gas plant proposal isn't drawing protests as an earlier version did, but some area residents and groups are raising concerns ahead of a North Carolina Utilities Commission meeting on the utility's plans.\That agency will host a public hearing on the proposal Tuesday at the Buncombe County Courthouse.\Critics say the planned natural gas-burning plant, one that would replace the coal-fired facility at Lake Julian, is being fast-tracked on a 45-day time frame that doesn't allow for proper vetting, that it's being overbuilt and that a possible future expansion will be unnecessary and should not be approved at this early stage.\Others, even as they applaud unplugging from coal and its toxic ash in Asheville, are critical of natural gas itself, saying the fuel isn't as clean as its blue-flame marketing leads consumers to believe.\Under the proposal, Duke Energy Progress would build a pair of generating units, together capable of producing 560 megawatts. Known as combined-cycle units, each is coupled with a recovery system able to capture heat that would otherwise be wasted to power a steam turbine.\The company would also have the option to build a third, 186-megawatt simple-cycle generator fueled by natural gas -- one without a heat recovery system -- if the plan is approved by the North Carolina Utilities Commission.\Two existing peaking units, powered by fuel oil or natural gas and rated together at 324 megawatts, will remain on site and available. The coal plant is rated at 376 megawatts, meaning the facility now has about 700 megawatts of local generation available. The new plan would boost that number to nearly 1,100 megawatts if it all portions moved forward, including a solar farm.\""The bottom line is we're shutting down a coal plant and we're replacing that capacity and adding a limited amount of capacity to meet some of the growing load. The fact is in Buncombe County the load is expected to continue to grow and it's growing faster than virtually any region in the Carolinas,"" said Tom Williams, a Duke spokesman. ""The way the federal standards work, we have to have a power plant close to the load in this area because it has to serve this control area.""\Methane, a national conversation\Natural gas is widely hailed as a bridge fuel, the only pragmatic option that balances efficiency, cost and environmental standards until technology breakthroughs allow renewables to shoulder more of the nation's power needs.\In the last five years, Duke has built five natural gas plants throughout North Carolina. In Asheville, the company expects pollution emissions to drop drastically, with nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxides falling by 35 percent and upwards of 90 percent, respectively.\""They're highly efficient,"" Williams said of the new natural gas facilities. ""This plant is almost as efficient, but not quite. It's more expensive to build because we're building two smaller units instead of one big unit.""\Construction of those two generators is a compromise after an earlier plan drew fury throughout the region.\Duke initially wanted to build a 45-mile transmission line from South Carolina's Upstate to Asheville, a move it said would supplement and offer redundancy for the region's power needs. But the company abandoned that project under pressure from thousands of irate residents, many of them living within the path of proposed line routes.\But natural gas, often pitched as an environmentally sound source of power, is raising concern among some scientists who say the potency of its methane and related greenhouse effects outpace carbon dioxide by 100 times.\At last month's climate summit in Paris, nations agreed they would try to limit global warming to well below the 2 degrees Celsius mark and would strive to stay under a 1.5 degrees Celsius increase, a goal that will be hard to achieve with the uptick in natural gas, said Professor Robert Howarth of Cornell University.\Methane is a greenhouse gas, more than 100 times as potent as carbon dioxide, said Howarth, who has studied methane leaks.\""If we were to drastically cut carbon dioxide emissions today, we would still meet those ranges, but focusing on carbon dioxide alone won't solve the problem. Methane productions will result in a much faster response by the climate,"" he said. ""If we cut methane emissions now, we can slow the rate of warming almost immediately and postpone that 1.5 degree target for 20, 30, up to 50 years.""\Research is showing methane leaks into the atmosphere from fracking sites and is also escaping through old, shuttered mines in a region undergoing fracking, he said. It further spills into the atmosphere during compression and from pipelines and plants.\Last summer, the Environmental Protection Agency proposed new rules to curb methane emissions from the oil and gas industry, which is in a public comment period until March 11.\While methane leaks don't touch off the furor of a proposed backyard transmission line, they should be considered and scrutinized, said Jim Warren of NC WARN, a Durham-based environmental group that wants to see Duke Energy produce further data on the need for the plant.\""Natural gas isn't a bridge fuel; it's a gang plank to an overheating planet,"" Warren said. ""We have a challenge on our hands and the key thing we all need to do is slow down and have a reasoned, careful and transparent public discussion about Duke Energy's future plans. It's not just the Asheville plant. Asheville is the tip of the spear of a big shift Duke Energy is proposing to make.""\The Asheville plant could be approved by the state Utilities Commission on March 1 or earlier, courtesy of a recent state law that allows commissioners to make that decision 45 days from Duke's initial filing to the commission.\The Public Staff of the state Utilities Commission, an independent arm that works in the interest of ratepayers, has assigned extra staff to review the filing, and has been working on the issue for the past several months, said Executive Director Christopher Ayers.\Many of the issues are typical of any new power plant: current and future load forecasting, reliability and cost, he said.\""One unique thing, this is on an existing site and is a replacement of an existing plant, as opposed to a completely new plant, so there are some efficiencies in the review,"" he said.\Duke officials often say the 160,000 homes and businesses it serves in the western region of Duke Energy Progress are an island, with little local energy generation in the midst of a growing area.

87,"Asheville is a community of action rather than just talk and the Blue Horizons Project is all about action.\In 2016, the City of Asheville, Buncombe County and Duke Energy came together in a unique partnership to form the Energy Innovation Task Force, designed to lead Western North Carolina to a cleaner, affordable and smarter energy future. A specific goal of the partnership is to delay or avoid construction of a natural gas peaker plant on Lake Julian that would only run on the coldest and hottest days of the year.\These convening partners, along with local businesses, institutions and environmental and clean energy advocates, have now developed the path forward to reach both of these goals, and we are pleased to announce an outgrowth of those efforts with the launch of the Blue Horizons Project.\Asheville is a community of action rather than just talk and the Blue Horizons Project is all about action. The Blue Horizons Project creates a vehicle for collaboration and connects people with energy efficiency, demand-side management and renewable energy efforts. The website provides easy access to resources, tips and programs that help everyone take the first step in their clean energy journey — making your home and business more energy efficient.\Why is this important? Because energy generation and use has impacts on the environment and our climate. Because we are paying more and more for energy. And because both the environmental impacts and the increasing cost of energy fall heaviest on those in our community who are least able to absorb and afford the impact. We want to avoid these impacts.\Through this effort, we have learned a lot about energy use in our community. We have learned that our peak energy use occurs on cold winter mornings and that the largest contributor to that spike in energy use is residential heating. Indeed, we use 30 percent more energy on those cold winter mornings than on hot summer afternoons when everyone is running their air conditioning.\Because of this, the Blue Horizons Project is helping people use less energy on those cold mornings. Homeowners and renters can get a free energy audit of their home that will offer options on how to make their house more energy efficient. Homeowners can also join Duke Energy's EnergyWise program that offers up to $175 per year to reduce energy use in those peak hours.\In addition, through the Blue Horizons Project, hundreds of thousands of dollars are being invested to make the homes of our low-income neighbors more efficient. Through these efforts, we hope to reach well over 2,000 low-income households in Asheville and Buncombe County this year.\While residential heating is the primary driver of our peak energy use, it is not the only one. Commercial lighting and heating are also factors, so the Blue Horizons Project is offering ways for businesses to reduce their energy use through Duke Energy's business programs.\Clean energy technology also plays a role in helping us reach our goals. Buncombe County is installing a 5-megawatt solar field on its closed landfill and Duke Energy is committed to installing 15-megawatts of solar energy. Duke is also investing in commercial scale battery storage — 19 megawatts so far — a significant amount for a community our size. We also hope Asheville will be the site of North Carolina's first community solar project. And automatic meters, which are a proven tool to help reduce energy use, are also coming this year.\The Blue Horizons Project goals are big and no community has done what we are attempting to do — avoid new investments in fossil fuel infrastructure by investing much more in energy efficiency, demand management, and clean energy. Success will depend on all of us — individuals, businesses, institutions, government.\We invite you to visit bluehorizonsproject.com and join your neighbors on the journey to a clean energy future today.\Asheville City Councilwoman Julie Mayfield, Buncombe County Board of Commissioners Chairman Brownie Newman and Duke Energy District Manager Jason Walls serve as members of the Energy Innovation Task Force, which created the Blue Horizons Project.\Asheville is a community of action rather than just talk and the Blue Horizons Project is all about action."
88,"ASHEVILLE - A reworked Duke Energy natural gas plant proposal isn't drawing protests as an earlier version did, but some area residents and groups are raising concerns ahead of a North Carolina Utilities Commission meeting on the utility's plans.\That agency will host a public hearing on the proposal Tuesday at the Buncombe County Courthouse.\Critics say the planned natural gas-burning plant, one that would replace the coal-fired facility at Lake Julian, is being fast-tracked on a 45-day time frame that doesn't allow for proper vetting, that it's being overbuilt and that a possible future expansion will be unnecessary and should not be approved at this early stage.\Others, even as they applaud unplugging from coal and its toxic ash in Asheville, are critical of natural gas itself, saying the fuel isn't as clean as its blue-flame marketing leads consumers to believe.\Under the proposal, Duke Energy Progress would build a pair of generating units, together capable of producing 560 megawatts. Known as combined-cycle units, each is coupled with a recovery system able to capture heat that would otherwise be wasted to power a steam turbine.\The company would also have the option to build a third, 186-megawatt simple-cycle generator fueled by natural gas -- one without a heat recovery system -- if the plan is approved by the North Carolina Utilities Commission.\Two existing peaking units, powered by fuel oil or natural gas and rated together at 324 megawatts, will remain on site and available. The coal plant is rated at 376 megawatts, meaning the facility now has about 700 megawatts of local generation available. The new plan would boost that number to nearly 1,100 megawatts if it all portions moved forward, including a solar farm.\""The bottom line is we're shutting down a coal plant and we're replacing that capacity and adding a limited amount of capacity to meet some of the growing load. The fact is in Buncombe County the load is expected to continue to grow and it's growing faster than virtually any region in the Carolinas,"" said Tom Williams, a Duke spokesman. ""The way the federal standards work, we have to have a power plant close to the load in this area because it has to serve this control area.""\Methane, a national conversation\Natural gas is widely hailed as a bridge fuel, the only pragmatic option that balances efficiency, cost and environmental standards until technology breakthroughs allow renewables to shoulder more of the nation's power needs.\In the last five years, Duke has built five natural gas plants throughout North Carolina. In Asheville, the company expects pollution emissions to drop drastically, with nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxides falling by 35 percent and upwards of 90 percent, respectively.\""They're highly efficient,"" Williams said of the new natural gas facilities. ""This plant is almost as efficient, but not quite. It's more expensive to build because we're building two smaller units instead of one big unit.""\Construction of those two generators is a compromise after an earlier plan drew fury throughout the region.\Duke initially wanted to build a 45-mile transmission line from South Carolina's Upstate to Asheville, a move it said would supplement and offer redundancy for the region's power needs. But the company abandoned that project under pressure from thousands of irate residents, many of them living within the path of proposed line routes.\But natural gas, often pitched as an environmentally sound source of power, is raising concern among some scientists who say the potency of its methane and related greenhouse effects outpace carbon dioxide by 100 times.\At last month's climate summit in Paris, nations agreed they would try to limit global warming to well below the 2 degrees Celsius mark and would strive to stay under a 1.5 degrees Celsius increase, a goal that will be hard to achieve with the uptick in natural gas, said Professor Robert Howarth of Cornell University.\Methane is a greenhouse gas, more than 100 times as potent as carbon dioxide, said Howarth, who has studied methane leaks.\""If we were to drastically cut carbon dioxide emissions today, we would still meet those ranges, but focusing on carbon dioxide alone won't solve the problem. Methane productions will result in a much faster response by the climate,"" he said. ""If we cut methane emissions now, we can slow the rate of warming almost immediately and postpone that 1.5 degree target for 20, 30, up to 50 years.""\Research is showing methane leaks into the atmosphere from fracking sites and is also escaping through old, shuttered mines in a region undergoing fracking, he said. It further spills into the atmosphere during compression and from pipelines and plants.\Last summer, the Environmental Protection Agency proposed new rules to curb methane emissions from the oil and gas industry, which is in a public comment period until March 11.\While methane leaks don't touch off the furor of a proposed backyard transmission line, they should be considered and scrutinized, said Jim Warren of NC WARN, a Durham-based environmental group that wants to see Duke Energy produce further data on the need for the plant.\""Natural gas isn't a bridge fuel; it's a gang plank to an overheating planet,"" Warren said. ""We have a challenge on our hands and the key thing we all need to do is slow down and have a reasoned, careful and transparent public discussion about Duke Energy's future plans. It's not just the Asheville plant. Asheville is the tip of the spear of a big shift Duke Energy is proposing to make.""\The Asheville plant could be approved by the state Utilities Commission on March 1 or earlier, courtesy of a recent state law that allows commissioners to make that decision 45 days from Duke's initial filing to the commission.\The Public Staff of the state Utilities Commission, an independent arm that works in the interest of ratepayers, has assigned extra staff to review the filing, and has been working on the issue for the past several months, said Executive Director Christopher Ayers.\Many of the issues are typical of any new power plant: current and future load forecasting, reliability and cost, he said.\""One unique thing, this is on an existing site and is a replacement of an existing plant, as opposed to a completely new plant, so there are some efficiencies in the review,"" he said.\Duke officials often say the 160,000 homes and businesses it serves in the western region of Duke Energy Progress are an island, with little local energy generation in the midst of a growing area. The bulk of the company -- and its major power plants -- lies in the eastern portions of North and South Carolina.\It is an assessment the Public Staff agrees with and that body is reviewing actual and forecasted demand for the next two decades.\Energy conservation on agenda\One route the company is pursuing is a reduction in demand for willing participants, measures like cutting energy to home water heaters for short intervals or encouraging businesses to cut consumption at peak energy usage hours.\Duke Energy Progress officials are also forming community partnerships, including with the City of Asheville, to address rising energy needs.

89,"The recent full page ad (September 9, 2012) endorsed by a 26 different faith communities in the region vividly called attention to the linkage between economy and ecology, ""that good stewardship of our air and water should go hand in hand with creating good jobs."" In a region where the electricity we use continues to rely on burning coal, the message of the ad deserves attention.\Since early spring of 2011, there has been a growing chorus of concern for dealing with the financial deficits of the U.S. and many other countries. There can be little doubt that without eventual attention to deficits we will all walk over a fiscal cliff. But what is less well understood, and too easily ignored when all the focus falls on the economy, is that there is an ecological cliff that portends even greater calamity.\The similarities between the fiscal and ecological cliffs are striking. In both cases there is conversation about passing tipping points beyond which corrective action will be difficult, if not impossible, to achieve. So with respect to both ""cliffs"" the argument is that embracing serious change now will avert catastrophic, unplanned changes later. Moreover, in both there is a proper appeal to what kind of world we will leave for future generations, our children and grandchildren who will have to live with the arrangements bequeathed to them by us. Consequently there is also a call in both cases for moving beyond ""business as usual,"" taking bold and dramatic action to respond to the crises.\Perhaps the most striking difference between the ""cliffs"" is that the current economic distress of the country draws attention much more sharply to the fiscal dilemma, while the ecological distress of the planet lurks (at best) on the edges of our consciousness. The economy is front and center while the environment recedes into the background. The irony is that without a habitable environment, no economy can prosper.\So in the growing emphasis on dealing with job creation in the near term and deficit reduction in the longer term, it is important to link the fiscal with the ecological. We need to create jobs that sustain rather than weaken the environment. And we need to reduce deficits in ways that support the health of the environment that is the one home we all share.\North Carolina already has legislation that eventually requires electricity suppliers to garner a modest fraction (12.5% by 2021) of the power we ask for from renewable energy resources. Though Duke Energy recently added a new coal plant to meet their production needs (and our consumption demands), they are also seeking to increase the amount of electricity coming from nuclear and natural gas sources. While these are less destructive to our environment than coal--though Japan's recent experience will cause us to think twice about nuclear-- we desperately need both legislative and business leadership that will set more ambitious goals representing a much more enthusiastic embrace of renewable energy resources.\In particular North Carolina has the potential for meeting 25% of its electricity demand by developing offshore wind resources. Moreover, an Energy Efficiency Standard for North Carolina will multiply employment opportunities in building trades, insulation production, and window manufacturing. A combination of renewable energy and energy efficiency is where some truly ""good"" jobs will be found.\The ad was right, ""We have a shared responsibility to be faithful stewards, while generating meaningful work for our brothers and sisters in WNC.""\D.

We don't know why, but the killjoys always seem to find a place in American politics.
\
Leave it to the New York Times, congressional Democrats and even some Republicans, however, to start talking about how we need to cut the music and kill the party by raising this nation's gas tax.
\
According to the Times editorial board: ""The federal excise tax of 18.4 cents per gallon on gas and 24.4 cents on diesel has not been increased since 1993. That has severely shortchanged the Highway Trust Fund, which is expected to run out of money in May if Congress does not transfer more into it or raise fuel taxes. If the federal tax on gasoline had simply kept up with inflation, it would be 30 cents today.""
\
They added that an increase ""could only be beneficial"" for the nation's roads and bridges, for the budget and for the climate. Apparently the editorial board for the New York Times isn't aware that some states (read North Carolina) already have substantial gas taxes. North Carolina's is among the largest, if not the largest, in the nation already at 37.5 cents per gallon - and it just went up a penny on Jan. 1, by the way.
\
The Times also paid lip service to the simple truth that raising the gas tax will hurt American workers who do not live in places like New York City, where driving is a luxury thanks to an extensive public transportation system.
\
But the fact remains that driving is not a luxury for most of this country's 290 million motorists. Nor do people get behind the wheel of their vehicles in some kind of giddy haze because they hope to hurt the environment. Instead, many Americans live paycheck to paycheck and must drive to and from work to keep their families fed and their lights on. And for them, and their families, public transportation, bicycles and walking, just aren't reasonable options. Many communities have no public transit. Burlington hasn't for years. And the city's much discussed plans to put a public transportation system in place is still a year or so from coming online. Meanwhile, our community's driving residents face a potential vehicle tax to make that happen.
\
The Times brushes past that monumental problem by saying, ""Some way should be found to offset the tax increase for low-income Americans, who would suffer most.""
\
""Some"" and ""should"" are the operative words.
\
Math isn't our strong suit, but when we added what motorists pay Uncle Sam (18.4 cents per gallon) and the state of North Carolina (37.5 cents per gallon) and subtracted it from the current rate for a gallon of gas, we came up with around $1.50 per gallon. Just think of what middle- and low-income people could do if the government got its hands out of their wallets every single time they went to the pump.
\
We know that's a pipe dream because, despite their rhetoric, state and federal politicians on both sides of the aisle almost never return money to the taxpayers once they have increased taxes. What that means, of course, is that when gas prices rise again, which you know they will, the tax increase will stay in place no matter how much pain that causes motorists.
\
With a decade of bad economic news hopefully heading for the rearview mirror, it's certainly not time to say yes to raising the national gas tax.

The Times also paid lip service to the simple truth that raising the gas tax will hurt American workers who do not live in places like New York City, where driving is a luxury thanks to an extensive public transportation system.
\
But the fact remains that driving is not a luxury for most of this country's 290 million motorists.
\
Nor do people get behind the wheel of their vehicles in some kind of giddy haze because they hope to hurt the environment. Instead, many Americans live paycheck to paycheck and must drive to and from work to keep their families fed and their lights on. And for them, and their families, public transportation, bicycles and walking, just aren't reasonable options.
\
The Times brushes past that monumental problem by saying, ""Some way should be found to offset the tax increase for low-income Americans, who would suffer most.""
\
Math isn't our strong suit, but when we added what motorists pay Uncle Sam (18.4 cents per gallon) and the state (37.5 cents per gallon) and subtracted it from the current rate for a gallon of gas, we came up with around $1.50 per gallon.
\
Just think of what middle- and low-income people could do if the government got its hands out of their wallets every single time they went to the pump.
\
We know that's a pipe dream because, despite their rhetoric, state and federal politicians on both sides of the aisle almost never return money to the taxpayers once they have increased taxes.
\
What that means, of course, is that when gas prices rise again, which you know they will, the tax increase will stay in place no matter how much pain that causes motorists.
\
After more than a decade of bad news and economic turmoil, American workers finally have something to celebrate. Can't we all agree to stay at this party a little longer?

95,"
The ""gas tax holiday"" proposed by Sens. Hillary Clinton and John McCain is a loser of a proposal that no reasonable person believes would help.
\
Congress and President George W. Bush could work to pass comprehensive energy reform, but what have we seen on that front? The gas lines of the 1970s didn't seem to serve as much inspiration.
\
The idea of a gas tax holiday through the summer sounds like a relief for travelers. But is it, really?
\
A gas tax holiday -- either by stopping tax collection or shifting responsibility for the tax to oil companies -- during the busiest travel time would worsen prices at the pump. The gas tax, used properly, is one of the fairest forms of taxation, used for maintenance.
\
The federal tax on a gallon of gas is 18.4 cents. In North Carolina, consumers lose another 48.6 cents per gallon of gas and 54.6 cents for a gallon of diesel to state government, but that's something for state lawmakers to fix.
\
Halting federal tax collection or shifting the federal tax burden temporarily would save the driver of a 20-gallon gas tank an entire $3.62 per fill-up, or about $61 from this week through summer to the end of August if he filled up once a week. Some people have switched to smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles or have begun driving less -- both market responses to gas prices -- so many wouldn't save even that much money.
\
In fact, every driver would end up paying more. Given that so many haven't changed driving habits -- and because even a minor dip in prices leads to lines -- demand would drive up prices, likely beyond 18.4 cents.
\
Government might not have that money for a while -- which would be great -- but neither would consumers.
\
While both state government and federal government could help with prices -- opening up offshore and Alaska National Wildlife Refuge drilling, easing environment restrictions and using gas taxes only for roads and bridges -- consumers hold the key to change. Although the price of gas bothers them, consumers continue driving, suggesting the price hasn't gone high enough to cut into demand. With limited supply, prices remain high.
\
For the most part, the gas tax serves its intended purpose. It pays for the roads on which we drive, to the tune of more than $9 billion if this summertime tax suspension were put into place, some critics estimate.
\
But in this time of rising costs and steady wages, it's natural to seek a panacea, especially if you are a politician or someone who loves sending out e-mails urging boycotts or only purchasing gas on certain days.
\
We need to open our own resources exploration and to earnestly search for workable alternatives to the combustible engine. We have enough faith in the inventiveness of Americans to believe this can happen.
\
But to support a gas tax holiday is pure pandering.

96,"Each Wednesday I receive the AC-T and begin to look at the food ads. Recently, looking at these ads has become more a horror story than a search for groceries to buy.\With the sizes of items shrinking and prices (rising), it has become scary. Hamburger at almost $3.50 a pound (on sale), milk at $4 a gallon, cheese $2.50 for 8 ounces, paper products (paper towels, napkins, toilet tissue) almost unaffordable and much smaller in size, mayonnaise (not 32 ounces, but 28-30 ounces) at $4 a jar. What are people to do?\Now, we are told the sales tax may go up. We all know it will. The gas tax is up yet again, there's the tax for A-B Tech improvements, gas price could possibly rise to $5 a gallon, increases in utilities (electric) are looming because of Duke and Progress Energy mergers.\We can all form a line at ABCCM and hope for help. It has all got to stop somewhere. We the people need to bring attention to all of this. It must be stopped and stopped now.\Carol Parker, Asheville\ID_Code: B0-120127019"
97,"The Republican primary race in the 7th Congressional District is all about who is more conservative - Ilario Pantano or David Rouzer.\Both Rouzer and Pantano have tried to paint their opponent as a big spender, and both talk regularly about cutting spending, lowering taxes and decreasing government regulation on businesses.\Recently, Pantano, an author and former Marine, called attention to letter grades Rouzer received from the The Civitas Institute for his General Assembly votes in 2009 and 2010. Rouzer, a state senator from Johnston County, received grades of F and D- in those years from the Raleigh-based conservative group, which grades lawmakers based on votes on certain pieces of legislation.\The Pantano campaign specifically has taken aim at Rouzer's vote to spend $25 million on a fishing pier in Nags Head and a vote in favor of setting a floor on the gas tax, which effectively prevented a decrease in the gas tax rate at that time. Rouzer said he did vote for the gas-tax bill on second reading but then voted against it on its final reading after fully understanding its implications.\Rouzer said the rankings and Pantano criticisms are misleading. Despite the letter grades, Civitas ranked Rouzer as the ninth most conservative of the 50 senators in 2009, and eighth most conservative in 2010.\In 2011, with Republicans in control of the General Assembly, Rouzer received an A grade in the Civitas rankings, voting conservatively on 95 percent of the bills used as part of the study.\Rouzer also pointed out that the N.C. Center for Public Policy Research, which ranks lawmakers' effectiveness, put Rouzer 10th among the 50 senators in 2011. He ranked near the bottom - 46th - in 2009. Today, Rouzer is co-chairman or chairman of five committees, including the Senate Agriculture/Environment/Natural Resources committee.\Andy Yates, a spokesman for the Pantano campaign, suggested that the rankings show Rouzer won't stand up for conservative ideas when his party isn't in the majority.\""It's easy to be a conservative when the conservatives are in charge,"" he said. ""It's hard to be a conservative when the other side's in control.""\But Rouzer countered that in 2009 and 2010, when Democrats controlled both the House and Senate, few Republicans scored well on the Civitas test. Reps. Frank Iler of Brunswick County and Carolyn Justice of Pender, both Republicans, received Fs in 2009 from Civitas, he said.\""Did they change all their stripes all of a sudden because Republicans were in control?"" he said. ""I don't think so.""\Pantano didn't buy that argument.\""If my children came home with two out of three failing report cards and said, 'Well, other kids failed too,' as a parent that's not acceptable to me,"" he said.\Pantano also pointed out that Rep. George Cleveland, R-Onslow, received an A in 2010, calling him his ""role model.""\""Sometimes it's important to be the only one who sticks to your principles instead of going with the tide,"" Pantano said.\Rouzer said Pantano was ""grasping at straws"" in his criticism of the rankings.\""I have a record. He doesn't,"" Rouzer said. ""That's a very important distinction in this primary race.""\Rouzer has also criticized Pantano on spending. In a recent TV ad and debate, Rouzer suggested Pantano would spend more than $100 billion on future space exploration. Pantano has said he supports space exploration and space dominance, and that cutting spending elsewhere could pay for it.\Pantano, an author and former Marine from Wilmington, and Rouzer, a state senator and business consultant from McGee's Crossroads in Johnston County, are locked in a heated primary for the GOP nomination in the 7th Congressional District. The redrawn district includes all or parts of 12 counties in southeastern North Carolina. Randy Crow is also in the race.\The winner of the May 8 primary will challenge U.S. Rep. Mike McIntyre, D-Lumberton, in November.\Patrick Gannon: (919) 854-6115\On Twitter: @StarNewsPat\Credit: By Patrick Gannon"

100,"Fiscal, ethical issues should be the focus of District 115 race\Editor's note: On Sept. 19, the AC-T gave Rep. Bruce Goforth an opportunity to respond to some of his critics. In the interest of fairness, we are giving the same commentary space to Eric Gorny, Goforth's opponent in the House District 115 race.\W\With this commentary I would like to take the opportunity to explain the state of our state.\We are now the highest taxed state in the southeast, with a 24 percent increase in the state budget the last four years. To cover this increase in spending the state has increased our taxes by $650 million in the last term alone.\According to the Civitas Institute we had a $2.4 billion surplus that was spent -- a surplus made of non-recurring funds, but was spent on recurring expenditures.\That means in January the state will most likely increase taxes.\To avoid this we need to elect people who support zero-based budgeting and a taxpayers bill of rights.\These reforms would allow the legislature to look at the budget and start at zero, then restrict the budget to the rate of inflation and population growth.\This would enable the legislature to cut waste from state departments.\We need to protect our trust funds from being raided as well. According to jwpcivitasinstitute.org, the Highway Trust Fund, which is funded by our gas tax, has had $3.4 billion diverted from it since its creation.\Now the DOT is short on funds.\If we protect our trust funds, our infrastructure can be maintained.\We need illegal immigration reform. Current legislators will say that they have restricted access to drivers licenses, but we are still one of eight states that do not meet the federal REAL ID Act, according to the U.S. Justice Department.\The Legislature did nothing to prevent illegal aliens from using our services such as schools, health care or even food stamps.\We can and need to require citizenship for services received in our state, or our services will go broke. We need a constitutional amendment restricting the use of eminent domain.\Right now we have a general statute, but a statute does not bind future legislation from changing it.\The only way to protect our property is with a constitutional amendment.\Finally, we need to elect ethical people to office. We now have a pay-to-play environment in Raleigh.\Our Democratic Speaker of the House, Jim Black, is under federal investigation for illegal legislative and campaign activities. According to the Charlotte Observer, my opponent, Bruce Goforth has received money from Black and from lobbyists. He has stated in the AC-T that he has not. It saddens me when elected officials mislead the people.\Eric Gorny has a BA in history from UNCA. A North Carolina resident for 13 years, he currently lives in Swannanoa."

N.C. Sen. Harry Brown is rewriting his measure seeking funds to dredge the North Carolina coast's shallow-draft inlets after facing pushback from boat owners who complained his originally proposed registration fee hikes were too high.
\
The reworked Senate Bill 58, which he plans to introduce this week in committee, will propose smaller fee increases and seek to siphon some $2 million from the state's gas tax that pays for highway improvements. Brown says many people fill up their boats at regular gas stations, and the shallow draft inlets should benefit from the gas tax.
\
Brown's original bill included a multi-tiered system for fee hikes depending on the size of the boat. Under the original measure, big boat owners, those with vessels 40 feet or longer, would have been asked to cough up 10 times the current cost: $150 per year. The rewritten measure he plans to introduce in committee is much simpler and scales back those increases.
\
Currently, it costs $15 a year to register a boat with the state, regardless of the vessel's size. Boat owners get a $5 break if they pay for a three-year registration.
\
Under Brown's latest measure, boats that are 25 feet long or less would pay $25 and vessels 26 feet and longer would pay $50 per year. Three-year registrations still would be allowed but would not come with a price break.
\
Brown said he's been in conversations with officials at the N.C. Department of Transportation about using a portion of the gas tax to fund shallow-draft inlets. DOT officials have appeared supportive, according to Brown.
\
""Right now, any time someone fills their boat up at the pump that money goes to the highway fund. This is just getting a small percentage of that back to put towards the dredging issue,"" he said.
\
As coastal lawmakers seek a solution to an ongoing problem, Rep. Chris Millis, R-Pender, also introduced companion legislation in the House last week. His measure, House Bill 707, provides a roadmap for the state to ensure dollars collected for inlet dredging ""go as far as possible,"" Millis said.
\
Among other measures, the bill would direct the N.C. Department of Environment and Natural Resources to work towards individual permits for these inlets that allow them to be dredged to deeper depths to make the dredging work last longer, Millis said.

105,"During the last session of the N.C. General Assembly, legislators passed a bill guaranteeing that the state would provide 50 percent of funding for the dredging of shallow-draft inlets, with affected counties providing the other half. How would New Hanover County pay to ensure that Carolina Beach Inlet remains open?\That was the topic at hand at an informational meeting held Wednesday night by the Carolina Beach Inlet Association at the Carolina Beach American Legion. The event brought together residents, county officials and state politicians, who provided updates and offered potential solutions to the problem.\""New Hanover County is so fortunate to have the beach renourishment fund that we have, but unfortunately, we do not have any funding for inlet dredging,"" said state Rep. Ted Davis Jr., R-New Hanover. ""I know that creates a problem.""\Funding for inlet dredging has been an issue since 2006, when the federal Office of Management and Budget eliminated government dollars for the process. Dredging of the state's five shallow-draft inlets - Carolina Beach, New Topsail, Bogue, Lockwoods Folly and New River - has since been funded via federal earmarks. That ended with the 2013 federal budget, which provided no money for dredging.\""That sends a message to us ... that the only funding we're going to get is within our state and here locally,"" said Robert Schoonmaker, president of the inlet association.\Per Senate Bill 58, the state's half of the funding will come from a mix of sources, including revenue from increased boat registration fees and a portion of money from the state's gas tax. Before the bill took effect, boat registrations, regardless of size, were $15 per year, with a $5 price break for boat owners who paid for a three-year registration. The new rates are $25 for boats 25 feet long or less, $50 for longer vessels. Three-year registrations are still permitted, but do not come with a price break.\The remaining 50 percent of the funding must come from the counties, though it's unclear where that money would come from or how much each municipality would be required to pay.\""What is the proportionate share that every municipality in the county would have to contribute?"" said Carolina Beach Town Council member Steve Shuttleworth. ""It's been recommended we come up with some kind of inter-local agreement that establishes those percentages .... Then how do you fund it? Hopefully the state will allow us some local authority to do that.""\The state funding will be administered by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, most likely at some point during the next year. Local officials aren't sure when the county would be required to pony up its portion, but Schoonmaker said it's important for municipalities to be proactive to guarantee that state funding remains available.\""We need to send the message back to Raleigh, that we all want to work together in New Hanover County and that we see the value of these inlets,"" he said. ""If we don't come up with the adequate amount of funding to maintain this inlet, I fear that Onslow County, Carteret County or Dare County will be more than happy to come in and take our state funds.""\Kate Elizabeth Queram: 343-2217\On Twitter: kate_goes_bleu\Credit: By Kate Elizabeth Queram"
106,"State legislators come back to Raleigh Wednesday for the start of the short legislative session, where the primary aim is to balance a two-year budget in the face of a Medicaid shortfall.\But other major issues are brewing in the background, including whether lawmakers will extend incentives for the film industry that play a major role in Wilmington's backyard and how policy makers will tackle water protection in wake of the coal-ash spill in the Dan River. Pay raises for teachers and state employees also is on the docket, and heated debate over the state's energy policy is expected, among other issues.\Here's a look at some of the big-ticket items before the legislature that will affect Southeastern North Carolina:\The main purpose of the so-called short legislative session is to tweak the two-year budget passed during last year's long legislative session. What happens with the budget is the backbone of crucial issues facing Southeastern North Carolina - such as the extension of the film incentives, whether there is new funding for beach nourishment and dredging, and how much or whether local teachers and state employees will see their pay increase.\But there's an elephant in the room: Medicaid shortfalls, coupled with botched revenue projections. The N.C. Department of Health and Human Services said it was unclear how much more money it will need for the health program for the disabled and needy above what was budgeted.\One of the most highly anticipated short session debates affecting Southeastern North Carolina is whether incentives for the film industry will be extended beyond their scheduled sunset date at the end of the year.\The film incentives, beefed up by the Democratic-controlled legislature in 2010, allow film companies to recoup 25 percent of their qualifying expenses. Prior to this juicing, the state's film industry was languishing, and some fear any structural changes will send the industry packing for a more favorable state. Yet others believe that the incentives are big on star-powered glitz and glam and light on economic benefit. Various studies differ in their takes on the matter.\Also caught up in the debate about whether to incentivize or not are historic preservation tax credits, which like the film incentives are scheduled to sunset at the end of the year. In Wilmington, there have been more than $46 million in historic preservation tax credit projects completed since 1998, of which about $38 million was for commercial projects.\Under the state program, which piggybacks on a federal credit, commercial users receive a 20 percent credit and residential users a 30 percent credit on all expenditures. The residential credit has a $25,000 threshold.\Gov. Pat McCrory said he supports the program but wants to redefine it. Detractors say special carve outs in the tax code stymie efforts to create an overall business-friendly environment.\One of the most controversial and pressing issues lawmakers will take up in the short session is dealing with the fallout of the Duke Energy coal-ash spill in the Dan River, which sparked a federal probe. There are coal ash ponds located in 14 places throughout the state, including the Sutton Plant just north of Wilmington.\Environmentalists say the massive spill that drew national attention should serve as a wake-up call to others living near the power utility's coal ash dump sites. Though McCrory, a former Duke executive, has been criticized for what some see as a too-cozy relationship with the power company, the governor has outlined a legislative plan to address the coal-ash ponds.\North Carolina, a retirement mecca, is one of the fastest growing states in the nation, and Southeastern North Carolina, particularly Brunswick County, is home to a burgeoning population. All those extra people translate into a growing need for energy. Some say it's time to look for home-grown solutions such as fracking and offshore drilling, and lawmakers are primed to consider controversial new energy policies during the short session.\North Carolina is on the precipice of a perfect financial storm when it comes to paying for roads and bridges as the state's primary funding source, the gas tax, makes up a dwindling piece of the transportation funding pie and gridlock in Washington threatens federal funding.\Because people are driving less miles and more fuel-efficient cars, the revenue source that has been in place since 1921 is not bringing in enough money to support road projects and improvements. That means lawmakers will have to address transportation funding sooner rather than later or further gridlock with ensue and the state's ability to attract major industry will dwindle, state transportation officials say.\Education\This legislative session should bring a dose of good news to teachers and state employees - and their wallets - as the governor and other top leaders all seem to agree that a pay raise is in order.\McCrory is pushing for a 2 percent pay raise for teachers, in addition to a longer-term solution that revamps the way teachers are paid. That long-term plan would base pay on a number of factors: experience, credentials, performance, market competition and leadership roles. McCrory has said his plan would reward star performers, particularly those serving hard-to-fill niches. He also proposed a $1,000 pay hike for state employees.\The General Assembly's Republican leadership has expressed support for teacher and state employee raises without giving a specific endorsement of the governor's plan.\Some of the state's job recruitment and retention functions may go the private side. The state has created an N.C. Partnership for Economic Development, to work in tandem with state government, but enabling legislation for Commerce to transfer some of its functions to the partnership stalled during last year's long session. Lawmakers are likely to tackle once again a proposal that could transfer to the partnership such areas as sales and marketing, international trade and travel and tourism.\The N.C. Film Office, which helps bring film employers to Wilmington and other locations, also could be transferred - a move with which not everyone agrees.\Metro desk: 343-2384\On Twitter: @StarNewsMolly\Credit: By Molly Parker"

But realistically, isn't the plan to share sales tax revenue in North Carolina the same thing? Counties that have larger populations and larger numbers of out-of-state visitors will naturally produce higher sales tax receipts. They also have higher costs to provide services to support those larger numbers.\What about the roads and bridges that need maintenance before they deteriorate beyond repair? How does cutting the gas tax address those issues? I suppose that making the localities raise property taxes to make up for the loss of revenue is preferable as long as the ""honorables"" can say that they have ""cut taxes across the board"" when it comes time for re-election.\I further question the concept of taxes having been cut. My state taxes aren't any lower. In fact, in 2014 I paid more, a lot more. Look at our crumbling infrastructure and the deterioration of our educational system just for starters.

109,"N.C. Coast | State and federal officials have finalized an agreement to allow dredging in shallow-draft inlets and channels on the North Carolina coast, according to an announcement from the state Department of Environment and Natural Resources.\The pact, which runs though September 2017, follows a bill passed by the N.C. General Assembly guaranteeing that the state will provide 50 percent of funding for the dredging of shallow-draft inlets, with affected counties providing the other half.\Federal money to dredge the state's five shallow-draft inlets - Carolina Beach, New Topsail, Bogue, Lockwood Folly and New River - has largely dried up.\Per Senate Bill 58, the state has set up a dredge fund from a mix of sources, including revenue from increased boat registration fees and the state's gas tax. The remaining 50 percent of the funding must come from the counties, though it's unclear where they will get the money.\- Kate Elizabeth Queram"
110,"
Sen. Harry Brown, R-Onslow, is rewriting his measure seeking funds to dredge the North Carolina coast's shallow-draft inlets after facing pushback from boat owners who complained his originally proposed registration fee hikes were too high.
\
The reworked Senate Bill 58, which he plans to introduce this week in committee, will propose smaller fee increases and will seek to siphon some $2 million from the state's gas tax that pays for highway improvements. Brown says many people fill up their boats at regular gas stations, and the shallow draft inlets should benefit from the gas tax.
\
Brown's original bill included a multi-tiered system for fee hikes depending on the size of the boat. Under the original measure, big boat owners, those with vessels 40 feet or longer, would have been asked to cough up 10 times the current cost: $150 per year. The rewritten measure he plans to introduce in committee this week is much simpler and scales back those increases.
\
Currently, it costs $15 a year to register a boat with the state, regardless of the vessel's size. Boat owners get a $5 break if they pay for a three-year registration.
\
Under Brown's latest measure, boats that are 25 feet long or less would pay $25 and vessels 26 feet and longer would pay $50 per year. Three-year registrations still would be allowed but would not come with a price break.
\
Brownsaid he's been in conversations with officials at the N.C. Department of Transportation about using a portion of the gas tax to fund shallow-draft inlets. DOT has appeared supportive, according to Brown.
\
""Right now, any time someone fills their boat up at the pump, that money goes to the highway fund. This is just getting a small percentage of that back to put towards the dredging issue,"" he said.
\
As coastal lawmakers seek a solution to an ongoing problem, Rep. Chris Millis, R-Pender, also introduced companion legislation in the House last week. His measure, House Bill 707, provides a roadmap for the state to ensure dollars collected for inlet dredging ""go as far as possible,"" Millis said.
\
Among other measures, the bill would direct the N.C. Department of Environment and Natural Resources to work towards individual permits for these inlets that allow them to be dredged to deeper depths to make the dredging work last longer, Millis said.

"
111,"Thanks for the article about the ridiculous tax on hybrid owners. Several things popped into my mind. I hope you write an article to introduce these ideas to the public.\1) All registered owners of electric and/or hybrids should be issued incentive checks by the state and federal governments for their collective and significant noncontribution to air pollution (this is factual, not political). Hybrid and electric cars significantly reduce the state and federal assistance required when thousands of citizens seek medical services they ordinarily would not have. Children with asthma, people with allergies, the elderly population -- all these groups suffer significant and measurable respiratory distress proportionate to the air pollution levels. Again, factual, not political.\2) All North Carolina citizens who do not have children should immediately receive annual refund checks from the state and the government. We have paid into the educational system our entire working lives to help support those with children, while not using the facilities one single second and not getting anything out of it. (Sorry, but this is precisely the same mindset as expecting people who buy less gas to pay more in taxes).\I look forward to reading this perspective in your paper.\Jean Troutman, Asheville\In keeping with the typical backward-thinking attitude of the N.C. House and Senate, they have proposed a $50 surcharge on hybrid owners and a $100 surcharge on electric-only cars.\The present trend in other educated and well-informed state legislatures is to work to increase miles per gallon, not penalize them. It appears that our N.C. Congress and Senate do not believe in global warming. Or that carbon emissions damage the environment. Or that our dependence on foreign oil contributes to both our deficit and our trade imbalance.\Will they next go one step further and vote a tax rebate to all the gas-guzzling Hummers and huge pickups that get 10-15 mpg? That would be in keeping with their general anti-environment program.\Phil Evanzo, Black Mountain\For advocates of smaller government and lower taxes, our legislators in Raleigh are too capable of conjuring taxes targeting specific groups and undoing regulations that protect the clean air, pure water, and natural beauty we in WNC value.\North Carolina's roads need repair and these repairs need funding so our legislators came up with a tax on hybrid vehicles ($50/year) and electric cars ($100/year) to raise $1.4-million. Why? The gas tax, highest in the South according to www.easy-tax-information.com, is not enough and environmentally friendly hybrid/electric vehicles should be discouraged.\Then again, perhaps the targeted tax on owners of fuel-efficient cars is hand-in-glove with the Legislature's moves to eliminate any and all other forms of environmental protections.\How hard would it have been to develop a tax scheme based on miles driven and vehicle weight? Both are known, mileage being reported to DMV every year as a result of safety inspections and weight dependent on make and model. Maybe with such a scheme, North Carolina could eliminate the gas tax altogether and prepare for the future when ALL forms of transportation will be less dependent on fossil fuels but that would be too proactive.\Lee McMinn, Brevard\Much of IRS 'scandal' blame points at Congress\As unfortunate as the IRS ""scandal"" is, the blame should not go to bureaucratic underlings trying to do their job administering a complex maze of laws with an inadequate staff.\Instead, it is the polarized Congress itself that must be blamed. The divided Congress has ignored the fact that the world has dramatically changed since the mid-1980s when the tax code was last revised. Today's Internet economy requires a whole new approach.\If congressional panels would spend less time on oneupsmanship, they might have time to do the thoughtful governing that the taxpayers have a right to expect.\Paula Robbins, Asheville"

Whoever wins the race to represent District 113 of the N.C. House will be doing a lot of driving, just as Democrat George Alley and Republican Chris Whitmire have done as they've campaigned across the far-reaching district.
\
The 113th stretches from Sapphire in western Transylvania county, across southern Henderson County and all the way to Sandy Springs in eastern Polk county. In Henderson, it includes 10 voting precincts: Armory, Atkinson, Crab Creek, East Flat Rock, Etowah South, Etowah Valley, Flat Rock, Green River, Horseshoe and Raven Rock.
\
Whitmire, who currently chairs the Transylvania County Board of Education, defeated incumbent Trudi Walend in a close race for the GOP nomination, taking 51 percent of the vote. Alley was unopposed in the Democratic primary.
\
Democrat George Alley Age: 47 Occupation: Park superintendent, Harmon Field, Tryon.
\
Experience: Former executive director of the American Red Cross, Polk County chapter; former athletic director for Carolina Classical School; former executive director of Carolina United Soccer Club; vice president of Striving Towards the Educational & Athletic Development of Youth.
\
Republican Chris Whitmire Age: 44 Occupat ion: Re a lt o r, pilot, officer in the Air Force Reserve.
\
Experience: Current chairman of the Transylvania County Board of Education, on which he's served for six years.
\
What should the General Assembly do to bring more jobs to the 113th and to WNC as a whole?
\
Alley: The General Assembly should refocus our economy by recruiting jobs in high-growth industries and retraining our workforce. This can be accomplished by partnering with schools, community colleges and the business community to fund infrastructure projects, review regulatory codes, and put the long term unemployed back to work.
\
I would also work to support our agriculture, equine and camp industries, as they are important assets that have a substantial economic impact on our region.
\
Whitmire: North Carolina is currently driving industry and manufacturing away with a corporate tax rate of 6.9 percent, the death tax and burdensome gas tax of 37-plus cents per gallon, which is more than double adjoining states. Our residents struggle with unemployment/underemployment and commute considerable distances to work.
\
As a small-businessman, my No. 1 objective is to apply common sense and regain North Carolina's competitive advantage. We must lower the corporate tax rate, reduce unnecessary regulation and eliminate the death tax to bring industry and manufacturing home. North Carolina pales in comparison to adjoining states. South Carolina is thriving and has a corporate tax rate of 5 percent, no death tax and a gas tax of 16 cents/gallon. Correcting these discrepancies will bring jobs and must begin as soon as possible!
\
What changes would you like to see in the way local public schools are funded and for how teachers are held accountable for student performance?
\
Alley: The state matrix for funding public schools is complex, but there is one area in particular that I would like to address. Discretionary funding is a chunk of money appropriated to school districts during the budget process, but then requested back later. The decision of where to cut funds is left to each locality.
\
This is a political shell game devised to give the illusion that schools are fully funded and local districts are given flexibility. Let's be honest with our schools and citizens and appropriate the necessary funds to operate efficiently. In terms of teacher accountability, this is an area where I would like to see some flexibility given to local school districts. This would allow leadership and staff to come together and discuss standards and the evaluation process, allowing teachers input into their assessment.
\
This would help increase ""buy-in"" from teachers while providing agreedupon accountability targets for leadership.
\
Whitmire: North Carolina should reward highperforming public schools and not penalize them. Currently the state's lower-performing systems receive more state money per pupil than high-performing ones. Today's funding formulas essentially ""rob Peter to pay Paul"" and the top performing systems in the 113th get shorted. This in turn costs every local tax payer because local funds have to make up the shortfall.
\
As the Transylvania County Board of Education chairman for the past four years, I know this firsthand and will address this discrepancy. As an individual who appreciates educators and the school systems of the area and the numerous accomplishments that they achieve, I will seek to ensure they are properly funded.
\
As far as teacher accountability, I will endeavor to ensure the upcoming accountability measures are fair and accurate so our dedicated educators can focus on preparing our nation's future leaders and not be distracted with ""administrivia.""
\
What means of energy production within the state would you support and what limits, if any, should there be on energy extraction?
\
Alley: Along with a commitment to renewable energy sources, accessing our state's oil and natural gas resources should be a part of our long-term energy plan.
\
While the technological and regulatory environment for fracking has matured recently, I think we need to do a better job of mitigating the impacts of fracking not only on our water table, but also on the infrastructure surrounding the drilling sites.
\
Frankly, I am also not convinced that the estimated oil or shale supply warrants the investment at this time. I would rather we dedicate our resources to converting more of our state fleet to utilizing our existing national supply of natural gas.
\
Whitmire: The strength of the U.S. economy is the backbone of our nation's instruments of power to include our military, foreign policy and a host of other incredibly important categories including environmental stewardship.
\
As we (as a nation) are further gouged by petroleum producers and subsequently spend ourselves into deeper economic disarray, our economic situation and strength further declines.
\
Given our current state of affairs, now is the time to tap domestic natural gas and oil sources and enable supply-and-demand to alleviate the situation.
\
Specific to North Carolina, offshore drilling is one viable means to relieve some of our needs, and we have the ability to drill responsibly. Additionally, actively pursuing environmentally safe methods to harvest natural gas is another means that must be pursued.
\
As far as limits, harvesting domestic energy sources must be accomplished with proven methods to ensure we protect our environment and prevent undesired repercussions.
\
Does North Carolina need a voter ID law?
\
Alley: N.C. Board of Elections Director Veronica Degraffenreid states, ""People are concerned about voter fraud, but... we are not finding evidence of (such fraud)."" (Charlotte Observer 9/24/12). Electoral fraud such as manipulating the vote count or demographics, disenfranchisement, intimidation and vote-buying has a greater impact on election results and should be addressed through comprehensive reform, not through a strict voter ID law that is perceived to be a voter-suppression tactic.
\
Not to mention that strict voter ID laws are currently being challenged across the U.S. and are wasting taxpayer dollars in litigation. So the question becomes, how do we protect the integrity of the election process without making it harder for citizens to participate in our democracy?
\
Whitmire: Yes! I absolutely support voter IDs so our elective process is fair and accurate. When your vote and mine is canceled by subversive activities such as those witnessed in the ACORN scandal in the 2008 presidential election, measures to restore validity to the process MUST be taken.
\
The vast majority of Americans already have photo IDs, and for the extremely small percentage of individuals who do not, it is extremely feasible for the state to facilitate such. This said, the 2013 legislative session will diligently pursue voter IDs so our elections accurately reflect the will of legitimately registered citizen voters.

South Carolina is thriving and has a corporate tax rate of 5 percent, no death tax and a gas tax of 16 cents/gallon. Correcting these discrepancies will bring jobs and must begin as soon as possible!
\
What changes would you like to see in the way local public schools are funded and for how teachers are held accountable for student performance?
\
Alley: The state matrix for funding public schools is complex, but there is one area in particular that I would like to address. Discretionary funding is a chunk of money appropriated to school districts during the budget process, but then requested back later. The decision of where to cut funds is left to each locality.
\
This is a political shell game devised to give the illusion that schools are fully funded and local districts are given flexibility. Let's be honest with our schools and citizens and appropriate the necessary funds to operate efficiently. In terms of teacher accountability, this is an area where I would like to see some flexibility given to local school districts. This would allow leadership and staff to come together and discuss standards and the evaluation process, allowing teachers input into their assessment.
\
This would help increase ""buy-in"" from teachers while providing agreedupon accountability targets for leadership.
\
Whitmire: North Carolina should reward highperforming public schools and not penalize them. Currently the state's lower-performing systems receive more state money per pupil than high-performing ones. Today's funding formulas essentially ""rob Peter to pay Paul"" and the top performing systems in the 113th get shorted. This in turn costs every local tax payer because local funds have to make up the shortfall.
\
As the Transylvania County Board of Education chairman for the past four years, I know this firsthand and will address this discrepancy. As an individual who appreciates educators and the school systems of the area and the numerous accomplishments that they achieve, I will seek to ensure they are properly funded.
\
As far as teacher accountability, I will endeavor to ensure the upcoming accountability measures are fair and accurate so our dedicated educators can focus on preparing our nation's future leaders and not be distracted with ""administrivia.""
\
What means of energy production within the state would you support and what limits, if any, should there be on energy extraction?
\
Alley: Along with a commitment to renewable energy sources, accessing our state's oil and natural gas resources should be a part of our long-term energy plan.
\
While the technological and regulatory environment for fracking has matured recently, I think we need to do a better job of mitigating the impacts of fracking not only on our water table, but also on the infrastructure surrounding the drilling sites.
\
Frankly, I am also not convinced that the estimated oil or shale supply warrants the investment at this time. I would rather we dedicate our resources to converting more of our state fleet to utilizing our existing national supply of natural gas.
\
Whitmire: The strength of the U.S. economy is the backbone of our nation's instruments of power to include our military, foreign policy and a host of other incredibly important categories including environmental stewardship.
\
As we (as a nation) are further gouged by petroleum producers and subsequently spend ourselves into deeper economic disarray, our economic situation and strength further declines.
\
Given our current state of affairs, now is the time to tap domestic natural gas and oil sources and enable supply-and-demand to alleviate the situation.
\
Specific to North Carolina, offshore drilling is one viable means to relieve some of our needs, and we have the ability to drill responsibly. Additionally, actively pursuing environmentally safe methods to harvest natural gas is another means that must be pursued.
\
As far as limits, harvesting domestic energy sources must be accomplished with proven methods to ensure we protect our environment and prevent undesired repercussions.
\
Does North Carolina need a voter ID law?
\
Alley: N.C. Board of Elections Director Veronica Degraffenreid states, ""People are concerned about voter fraud, but... we are not finding evidence of (such fraud)."" (Charlotte Observer 9/24/12). Electoral fraud such as manipulating the vote count or demographics, disenfranchisement, intimidation and vote-buying has a greater impact on election results and should be addressed through comprehensive reform, not through a strict voter ID law that is perceived to be a voter-suppression tactic.
\
Not to mention that strict voter ID laws are currently being challenged across the U.S. and are wasting taxpayer dollars in litigation. So the question becomes, how do we protect the integrity of the election process without making it harder for citizens to participate in our democracy?
\
Whitmire: Yes! I absolutely support voter IDs so our elective process is fair and accurate. When your vote and mine is canceled by subversive activities such as those witnessed in the ACORN scandal in the 2008 presidential election, measures to restore validity to the process MUST be taken.
\
The vast majority of Americans already have photo IDs, and for the extremely small percentage of individuals who do not, it is extremely feasible for the state to facilitate such. This said, the 2013 legislative session will diligently pursue voter IDs so our elections accurately reflect the will of legitimately registered citizen voters.

"
115,"
Two candidates for N.C. House District 117 and three GOP candidates for sheriff squared off Wednesday at a League of Women Voters forum in the City Operations Center, the first such event of the political primary season.
\
Questions about school resource officers dominated those asked of Henderson County Sheriff Charlie McDonald and his two challengers, Fletcher Police Chief Erik Summey and State Trooper Michael Brown.
\
Brown and Summey have made SROs a key part of their campaign platforms, pledging to put more armed officers in all the county's middle schools and elementary schools.
\
""When you turn on the news, what do you see?"" Brown asked. ""School shootings and school shootings. We're not immune here, so we need to protect against that. I want to protect the educators and children so they'll have a safe environment to learn in. And we're just, quite frankly, not prepared for that.""
\
McDonald said SROs are currently in all the high schools and most of the middle schools, with ongoing budget requests for two more.
\
""But I'm certainly interested in talking with Mr. Brown about how we can hire a lot more officers without costing the taxpayers any money,"" he said. ""I'm all about that.""
\
Summey agreed that SROs do cost money, but added there are federal matching grants available. He said an adjacent county used U.S. Department of Justice grant funds to hire seven SROs after the Sandy Hook, Mass. incident.
\
""It's not free money,"" he said. ""It's a 75-25 match and eventually the county has to absorb the cost, but my proposal is to sit down with the school board and commissioners and let's get a plan - short-term and long-term - to get school resource officers in the schools.""
\
Asked by moderator Judy Katz if SROs are ""the ultimate in keeping the schools secure,"" McDonald replied, ""I think it's effective, but I don't think it's the only thing.""
\
Law enforcement alone can't solve all of society's ills and security issues, he said; parents and educators play a role, too.
\
McDonald said local school officials have been ""real happy"" with his Adopt-a-School program ""that we utilize to cover the shortfalls that we have personnel-wise."" In the last three years, he said, the program has increased school contacts by officers from 98 percent the first year to 252 percent this year.
\
Summey agreed that school safety has to be a partnership between law enforcement, parents and school faculty. Just like parenting, he said, ""taking care of children begins at home."" But if elected, he pledged to work with the school board and county commissioners to place SROs in elementary schools and bump staffing at others.
\
""There's no question that an armed deputy is a deterrent to an active shooter,"" Brown said. ""Most shootings that you've seen, they did not have an SRO in place.""
\
Brown said the General Assembly amended state law last year to allow sheriffs to establish a volunteer force of SROs using those with two years of military or prior law enforcement experience, at minimal cost to taxpayers. The only cost to counties is putting them through a firearms proficiency test, he said.
\
Rep. Chuck McGrady and his Republican primary opponent, Ronnie Edwards, agreed on the majority of issues they were questioned about, from nonpartisan redistricting and voter IDs to higher teacher pay and legislative term limits. They supported them all.
\
But the two candidates split ways most decisively on Opportunity Scholarships - a pilot program that would provide low-income kids with $4,200 each to use for private school tuition - and a conceptual vehicle mileage tax.
\
Asked how he can support school choice without supporting vouchers, McGrady responded that he voted for the Opportunity Scholarships that some call vouchers.
\
""And I believe it's a good bill that provides parents one set of choices and I'm committed to parental choice,"" he said.
\
Edwards said he doesn't support vouchers because they hurt high-performing public systems like Henderson County's by pulling away resources and giving them to private schools that don't have to meet the same standards.
\
McGrady said the state is technologically ""years away"" from implementing a vehicle mileage tax, but said the state has studied the idea as a replacement to its gas tax. That revenue isn't covering the costs of bridges and roads like it once did, he said, so something has to make up the difference.
\
Edwards said he thinks a mileage tax would be unfair to lower-income and middle-class people because it's double taxation - ""you're paying a tax on your gas and then you're going to pay a tax to drive back and forth to work."" It also penalizes those who invest in energy-efficient vehicles like hybrids, he said.
\
The forum was the first of several local political roundtables being separately sponsored by the League of Women Voters, a nonpartisan political activist organization, and the Henderson County Republican Party and its Men's and Women's clubs.

"
116," For generations of motorists, the hidden meaning of the unofficial North Carolina nickname, ""The Good Roads State,"" was ""The No-Tolls State.""\ Unlike neighboring Virginia and some northern states, North Carolina chose to fund road building solely with gas tax revenues and regular borrowing. The Tar Heel State's freeways were truly free, with not a toll booth from Manteo to Murphy.\ But with commuter congestion mounting and fuel tax revenues slipping, the public and the candidates for governor say they are ready to discuss using tolls to speed up road-building.\ Pushing all these changes is a kind of road rage. Perhaps sick of waiting in traffic, 73 percent of the 1,012 adults polled by the Your Voice, Your Vote partners said the next governor should make improving traffic flow the primary basis of transportation policy decisions.\ The major-party candidates also hold contrasting positions on the proper role of state government in determining local transportation policy. In the poll, North Carolinians said they were more concerned about shorter commutes and cleaner cars than controlling urban sprawl or encouraging mass transit.\ Of those adults, 46 percent said traffic flow should be the only basis for transportation decisions. Another 27 percent said planners should consider both traffic flow and the control of development and sprawl.\ Of those adults, 46 percent said traffic flow should be the only basis for transportation decisions. Another 27 percent said planners should consider both traffic flow and the control of development and sprawl.\ ""I drive quite a bit and I can see that the roads are beat over and over,"" said Chris Gregg, a Baptist preacher from Wilmington who travels frequently to Winston-Salem. ""I don't know if (rapid) transit would work, but something's got to be done.""\ This summer, the General Assembly agreed to experiment with a program that would license a private company to build a road or bridge and recoup the cost through tolls.\ The major-party candidates were reluctant to say tolls are a solution to the state's transportation problems. Gasoline tax revenues have slackened, and state transportation planners said they need nearly $300 million in extra funding to meet road and bridge maintenance needs.\ Democratic candidate Mike Easley said he doesn't agree with privatizing road-building but that circumstances are forcing state planners to consider tolls as an option.\ Richard Vinroot, the Republican candidate and former Charlotte mayor, said he doesn't want tolls to become the state's dominant way of financing roads. But he said the concept is ""not a no-no.""\ Douglas Schell, the Reform Party candidate, and the Libertarian Party's Barbara Howe, favor tolls because those who benefit from using roads and bridges pay them.\ When the toll-road bill was passed, some lawmakers didn't want to reverse the state's reputation for toll-free roads.\ But many were swayed by arguments that toll roads are paid for by the motorists who use them and can be built more quickly than tax- funded projects stacked in the state's voluminous Transportation Improvement Plan.\ A road and bridge between Gaston County and Charlotte, one of the state's most congested commuter corridors, is a top candidate for the experiment.\ ""I have never liked toll roads, but I do recognize that we're in a tight fiscal environment,"" said Mr. Easley, the state attorney general. "" . . . We're going to have to think outside the box, and toll roads are outside that box.""\ For Mr. Vinroot, toll roads represent an opportunity to fix the worst traffic problems but aren't a larger solution.\ ""I don't want to build our road system on a toll system, but I will tell you there are places where I think people would, as opposed to standing in traffic . . . would choose an option if they had it,"" he said. ""I'm very willing to experiment with tolls. . . . But we're not going to build our system on tolls.""\ Asked if they favored tolls on new roads as a way of speeding construction, 52 percent of North Carolina adults surveyed by the Your Voice, Your Vote partners said they did.\ ""I'd pay the toll, but I don't want to have to,"" said Caroline Swaton, a retired physician who lives at Black Mountain. ""I'm also concerned about giving so much authority to a private company.""\ Representatives of 750,000 North Carolina motorists are wary of the toll-road plan, saying lawmakers and administrators will be tempted to erect toll booths on existing roads.\ ""There's a lot of schizophrenia about tolls and user taxes,"" said Tom Crosby of AAA Carolinas. ""It seems to us that people favor tolls when they think some other driver is going to be the one paying them.""\ Despite appearing to be unwilling to give up their cars for mass transit, poll respondents said they believe urban sprawl to be a problem across the state and in their communities. Asked to rate on a scale of 1 to 5 to what degree urban sprawl was a problem in North Carolina - with 5 being a major problem - respondents scored it an average 3.22.\ Using the same scale, they rated sprawl in their communities an average 3.11.\ ""We need more roads, and tolls could speed it up,"" said Charles McGee of Rural Hall. ""I think paying the toll is as easy as paying the gasoline tax.""\ Other North Carolinians might disagree. Asked their view of the gasoline tax, 76 percent of respondents said they thought it was too high.\ The candidates for governor differ on how state government can direct urban and transportation planning to control congestion- causing growth.\ Mr. Easley said he would use the power of the purse strings to promote proper urban planning and might favor new standards for auto emissions.\ ""We are not encouraging mass transit, we don't have bus lanes,"" he said. ""The state must force the local municipalities to make decisions, and long-term decisions, and you are going to have to tie that to funding. It is the only way we are ever going to afford it.""\ Mr. Vinroot, however, said transportation policy should be largely a local affair, with state government providing expertise and money, if necessary.\ ""I don't see the state or the governor as deciding where people live, and deciding that, 'Look, in my wisdom I know that you ought to be living in the center of Greensboro; you should not live in the suburbs,'"" he said. ""I think local communities have to decide how they want their communities to develop.""\ Ms. Howe, the Libertarian, believes that ""mass transit has failed everywhere it's been tried,"" and favors toll roads. She said she would encourage motorists to buy more fuel-efficient cars.\ Dr. Schell, a business professor at UNC-Pembroke, said he would seek advice on transportation matters from the state Highway Patrol.\ Tolls would bring fairness to highway funding, he said. ""Let people pay for it, and if they're not willing to pay for it, then they have to live with what they have,"" he said.\ Mark Schreiner is an assistant city editor for the Sunday Star- News."
117," Help teachers maintain order\ EDITOR: (In response to articles and a recent letter concerning) discipline in schools of choice, may I offer that we all seem to be overlooking the critical issue?\ Discipline in schools today is simply not what it used to be. Instead of considering where we send disruptive children, should we not be evaluating what we do to motivate better behavior?\ Indeed, in schools of choice, we have a powerful incentive toward respectful behavior that other public schools do not. That is that everyone understands disruptive children will be asked to give up their seat in the classroom and return to their districted school. As a result, everyone - parents, teachers and the students, themselves - are allies in nurturing an environment strong in classroom discipline.\ If all schools, school administrators and teachers were provided the support necessary to truly discipline misbehaving children, I dare say this would not be such an issue. Yet, today, discipline procedures favor the child, defend the parent and leave teachers sadly without recourse in dealing with problematic, disruptive, disrespectful and misbehaving children.\ So worried are we about raising children with high self-esteem, that teachers have been rendered weak in simply demanding what is rightfully theirs: respect in the classroom.\ Ultimately, we should look at the lack of discipline problems in schools of choice as indicative of the solution. When the consequences are significant, students straighten up.\ Margee Herring\ Wilmington\ Equi-critical\ EDITOR: It is remarkable how rapidly our state's new lottery program has descended into the moral cesspool that many of us naysayers predicted. Or maybe not. Even its legislative approval was fraught with 'dirty tricks' if not outright illegality.\ I commend our local editorial staff for keeping a watch on the ""Black & Decker"" shenanigans and would hope that those who frequently complain about the ""Red Star"" would note which side of the aisle that Messrs. Black, Basnight and others reside on.\ I believe that on the state and local level, at least, our journalists are equal-opportunity critics of abuses of governmental power and therefore, provide a useful service to our community.\ Perhaps they could even give some lessons in journalism to their big sister in New York.\ Howard Talley III\ Wilmington\ Gay caballeros\ EDITOR: I believe I am going through a kind of psychological tsunami. Cigarette companies are paying for ads to tell people not to smoke, and employees at Staples say that folks have actually come in to purchase an ""easy button."" However, the thing points to the ""Outer Limits"" of the ""Twilight Zone"" is the assault on the American Cowboy.\ Much has been made of Brokeback Mountain. No doubt Willie Nelson's latest recording about gay cowboys will do the same.\ It seems that few people really know what cowboys do. They work with cows.

In short, they had as much admiration for each other as the Carolina Tar Heels and Duke Blue Devils do.\ So let a cowboy be a cowboy...\ Walter C. Strickland\ Cerro Gordo\ Bad decision\ EDITOR: Blessings on those particular souls who are trying to save some green space in our dear city.\ I am referring to the bond issue for the establishment of parks, i.e., natural open spaces, not housing, commercial mega developments, etc.\ Where were you when we citizens appealed (for five hours) in front of the planning and zoning commission to save an adjacent 3.5 acre ""park"" instead of allowing 49 units and 116 parking spaces to be erected on the space? (I estimate this will house about 150 persons and their vehicles on 3.5 acres. ...Investors have bought several units, no doubt to rent to college kids or other transients. (Maybe nice kids. Usually awful neighbors. Just ask us.)\ The developer ... could have chosen a less-destructive plot from which to fuel his ambition.\ ... When the ""for sale"" sign went up and we tried to protest, the reply was, ""Yes, but he has most of his permits.""... How is that possible?\ This totally intrusive construction will inevitably reduce the value of the established condo homes it abuts. ... These units have long been owned and cared for by permanent citizens who pay their way in the community, and in one stroke, the developer has said, in essence, ""Tough luck, guys, I got mine!""\ Ann B. Robins\ Wilmington\ Does it compute?\ EDITOR: The thrust of your Feb. 17 headline, ""Consumers saving gas, costing DOT,"" appears to blame the taxpayer for providing less than the needed amount of revenue for DOT projects.\ Are there no calculators at the Star-News? Gasoline sales may have dropped by 2.5 percent (per the 2nd half of '05 sales figures), but the state gas tax has recently risen by 10.7 percent (from 27.1 to 29.9 cents/gallon).\ This means that the state gasoline tax revenue should now be running at least 7.5 percent above last year's level. The consumers seem to be providing a rather generous, albeit unavoidable, increase in DOT funding.\ The article asserts that ""inflation (is) racing along at almost 20 percent a year."" This statement is factually incorrect. The cost of road building may have risen substantially, but the rate of inflation is running benignly in the 2.8 percent to 3.4 percent range (2005 data). The cost of gasoline rose by 50 percent, but that did not mean inflation rose by 50 percent. Your reporter should have used more precise language...\ Lynn Amos\ Wilmington\ (EDITOR'S NOTE: The article cited gas conservation and a reduction in the amount collected from the Highway Use Tax, as well as increased construction costs as reasons for cutting the number of road projects.)\ Taking aim\ EDITOR: If Dick Cheney had served a hitch in the military rather than having ""other priorities,"" perhaps he would have learned something about firearm safety.\ Carl Cerniglia\ Castle Hayne\ Doggone good\ EDITOR: I would like to commend the Carolina Beach officials for their positive approach in dealing with the issue of dogs on the beach.\ I hope educating the public and community support will allow everyone, including our four-legged family members, to enjoy the beach.\ Abbie Sinclair\ Carolina Beach\ His legacy\ EDITOR: Dick Cheney and his now super-famous, quail-attacking hunting party are still grabbing headlines.\ Even with a full-blown war going on and U.S. budgetary problems so far in the red that it causes one to shudder, the Elmer Fudd- like quail hunt is still capturing news headlines.\ ...

As a poll worker in Buncombe County, our machines are top- notch and we have a great staff that oversees them. I think the state should give counties more time for the changeover. I think more money should be provided also. Every county is in the middle of a budget year, so that puts a burden on them. They should let them use the present machines for the primary and hopefully by the general elections have the changeover. I encourage everyone to contact their representatives and let them know how they feel about this and also contact the governor.\Donald Ramsey,\Arden\U.S. must remember Sept. 11\and stand and fight together\E\Ever since President George Washington people have complained about the job the president is doing. It does not matter who is president, they continue to complain. I remember shortly after Sept. 11, 2001, when the president stood in New York and said this (war on terror) would take a long time and we must stand fast and wait. America has already forgotten the thousands who died that day. We must stay strong and back our president and our troops. We can't let the enemy think we are growing weak.\God bless America.\Ken Edwards,\Asheville\Parkway isn't to be used\like an interstate highway\R\Responding to the letter, ""How can they close the Blue Ridge Parkway?"" (AC-T, Dec. 24), about the ""nerve of the parkway cops prohibiting our use of the Blue Ridge Parkway"": He must be ignorant of the fact that the parkway is a national park, not an interstate he is entitled to drive on in any weather. It has no road-scraping equipment and to use chemicals to clear the road would harm the environment.\Park? Nature? Hello? He most assuredly isn't from around here.\Elaine Loutzenheiser,\Black Mountain\Recent letter put words\in the mouth of Jesus\I\I would like to respond to the letter, ""ACLU not guilty as charged in recent letter to the editor,"" (AC-T, Dec. 18). I quote the letter writer, ""Christ did not teach intolerance ..."" She may want to reconsider that statement. Was Jesus ""tolerant"" of the moneychangers at the temple? He said, ""I am the way, the truth and the life. No one comes to the father but through me."" Does that sound like he's tolerant of other paths to God? This lady is attempting to broad-brush Jesus under the heading of ""love."" While it is true Jesus was love, a better way to define Jesus would be God: then his attributes become more clear. Then we understand that not only is he love, but that Jesus is all-powerful, all-knowing, eternal, creator and yes, it also includes ""just"" and ""wrath."" In spite of what the letter writer thinks, it seems obvious to me from Scripture Jesus was not as politically correct as she might wish, because yes, Jesus was forgiving, but not a part of today's philosophy of ""moral relativism,"" thus leaving him, at times, intolerant. Intolerance isn't a cuss word. In my opinion we've been tolerating too much for too long.\Thomas Rhodes,\Asheville\Schools not the place for\religious belief to be taught\I\I am a person of faith, a scientist, and a teacher, and as such I was very much relieved by the recent decision in Pennsylvania to keep ""intelligent design"" out of the public school science classroom. Dover's school board members had decided that their religious beliefs should be taught as if they were scientific concepts. In doing so, they were trying to impose their particular religious beliefs on all of the schoolchildren of Dover. Science teachers in public schools should teach science and not someone's religious beliefs, as presiding Judge Jones concluded. Science is based upon measurements, observations and replicable experiments. Intelligent design, on the other hand, is a belief that cannot be tested or proven, and therefore has no place in the teaching of science. It is essential to the freedoms inherent in our nation's Constitution that religious beliefs are not taught in public schools; this is true whether they are my beliefs, the Dover school board's or anyone else's.\Amy Boyd,\Asheville\There is a reason for the\chip on the shoulder of WNC\R\Regarding the story, ""Legislators split over incentives; Lawmakers agree WNC needs more help for small businesses,"" (AC-T, Dec. 17). Like many legislators from WNC's delegation, small business is also confused that Gov. Easley allocated only $1 million earlier this month to the One North Carolina Small Business Fund. Your paper also uncovered that only 7 percent of the $25 million One North Carolina Fund and a mere 4 percent of the $118 million Job Development Investment Grant made its way to WNC.\Suggestions that Western North Carolina is being ""shortchanged"" could not be truer. The reality is most state funds wind up in the districts of Raleigh's power brokers. Similarly, many elected officials are eager to show up at ribbon-cutting ceremonies for the beneficiaries of corporate welfare, but give scant notice to entrepreneurs. Small business, like Western North Carolina, isn't looking for a handout, but it knows when it's being ignored. Some would even say, blown off. As the head of the National Federation of Independent Business/North Carolina (NFIB) and a former legislator from Spruce Pine, I encourage the western delegation to continue to raise their collective voice in Raleigh -- for the region and for small business. Eventually, something very good is bound happen.\Gregg Thompson,\Raleigh\Thompson is NFIB/N.C. state director.\Questioning motives, effort\in Goforth's recent actions\I\I read about Rep. Bruce Goforth's useless grandstanding recently. Goforth's efforts were meaningless, poorly timed and disingenuous. We had known for months the gas tax would be raised. Goforth took no action when meaningful action might accomplish something. Goforth waited until the last minute when there was no chance of success. It was meaningless since Goforth will never go against House Speaker Jim Black, who helped funnel roughly $170,000 to Goforth over two elections (2002 and 2004) on anything Black really wants. That money ensured Goforth will never force the issue when denied. Mark my words, Goforth will be denied by Gov. Easley and Black. Finally, Goforth's disingenuousness stemmed from both his knowledge of Easley's earlier refusal to drop or reduce the gas tax after Hurricane Katrina and that there was no way the leadership would call a special session now.\Like his vote on the lottery when Goforth publicly campaigned his opposition but still voted opposite his words, Goforth now seeks the positive press knowing full well it was a meaningless, grandstanding effort. I noticed 114 other House members chose not to join Goforth's efforts -- probably fully recognizing the disingenuousness of the act.\Mark Crawford,\Cullowhee\Editor's note: Crawford is a former state representative who lost to Goforth in 2002.\Can't believe how foolish\her fellow Americans can be\I\I cannot believe there was dissent going on over whether clerks in stores should say ""Merry Christmas"" or ""Happy holidays,"" something that has been going on for the last 1,000 years or so. It is so totally bizarre considering we have our own boys getting killed in a war that is totally useless. We have people dying every day simply because they cannot afford to see a doctor. Think about it - having to die because you cannot afford a doctor or a hospital.\Yet the biggest problem recently seems to be over ""Merry Christmas"" and ""Happy holidays."" I have finally decided I have entered the ""Twilight Zone"" for sure.\Mary Ingram,\Asheville"
122,"A mattress sits under the south side of the North Third Street bridge over the abandoned Atlantic Coast Line Railroad bed.\Blankets, a curling iron, 40-ounce beer bottles, clothing and broken glass and other trash scattered under the bridge are signs that it recently provided shelter. The smell of urine is pervasive.\Not far away, chunks of concrete rest on the ground, having fallen from the underside of the bridge, exposing reinforcement bar in the bridge belly.\If it weren't for the concrete railing along the side, many motorists might not know there was a bridge between Campbell and Hanover streets. Regardless, most motorists probably don't know that homeless people sleep under it, or that many Cape Fear Community College students walk under it to get to their cars in an adjacent parking lot.\Or that N.C. Department of Transportation inspectors rank its structural condition among the worst of the region's bridges. Or that there are no immediate plans - or dollars - to replace it.\Roby Powers, who operates the Nsalo Salon on North Front Street, two blocks to the west in downtown Wilmington, takes Third Street to get to the Isabel Holmes Bridge on his way home to Pender County.\""I had no clue,"" he said when told of the bridge's condition. ""That's kind of scary.""\The DOT recently added the North Third Street bridge to a priority list for replacement, but hundreds of others across the state remain ahead of it in the funding line.\The DOT considers 55 of the 233 bridges in Brunswick, New Hanover and Pender counties - nearly 1 out of 4 - ""structurally deficient,"" but the state's seven-year transportation funding plan includes money to replace just eight of them, or about 15 percent.\Thirteen other deficient bridges are either listed on the funding plan but don't have construction dollars assigned to them or, like the Third Street bridge, have been identified as priorities and may be added to the plan soon.\That leaves 34 deficient bridges in the three counties with little or no chance of replacement during the next decade unless new funding sources are created or more money is dedicated to bridges. The now-deficient bridges were built from the 1920s to 1980s, with the majority constructed in the 1950s and 1960s.\""We know that the infrastructure is aging, and all of the bridges that were built in the interstate era, those bridges are coming of age,"" said Amanda Glynn, bridge maintenance engineer for the DOT's Division 3, which includes the local counties.\""That's what we have to plan for,"" she said.\Tolls and gas taxes\Allen Pope, who oversees the DOT's Division 3, which includes six counties in Southeastern North Carolina, said the coastal environment causes corrosion at greater rates than in noncoastal areas and that the DOT has trouble keeping pace with deteriorating bridges.\""There are certainly more needs than there is current revenue,"" he said.\The state's transportation funding plan through 2014, known as the State Transportation Improvement Program, includes money to replace 514 of North Carolina's 2,228 ""structurally deficient"" bridges, or about 23 percent, according to information provided by the DOT.\When it comes to transportation funding, Division 3 is a microcosm of the nation. But national and state proposals to raise more money for transportation projects - from tolls to increased gas taxes - might not be easy to swallow.\The National Surface Transportation Policy and Revenue Study Commission last week said federal gasoline taxes should be increased by up to 40 cents a gallon over five years to fix aging bridges and roads and reduce traffic deaths nationwide. The two-year study is the first to recommend broad changes after the bridge collapse in Minneapolis last August, which killed 13 people and injured about 100. The commission also warned that urgent action is needed to avoid future disasters.\Under the proposal to raise gas taxes, the current tax of 18.4 cents per gallon would be increased by 5 cents to 8 cents annually for five years and then indexed to inflation to help fix the infrastructure, expand public transit and highways, and broaden railway and rural access. Other revenues could come from tolls, peak-hour ""congestion pricing"" on highways, freight fees and ticket taxes for passenger rail improvements, according to the report.\The report said the nation would need to spend $225 billion a year for 50 years to upgrade the existing system to a ""state of good repair."" Today, the nation spends less than 40 percent of that amount each year.\The report has already sparked political debate, even among commission members. Commission chairwoman Mary E. Peters, the U.S. transportation secretary, refused to sign it because of the gas tax recommendation.\Responding to the report, Thomas Donohue, president and chief executive officer of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said the federal government must bear a significant part of the responsibility to ensure national needs are met for roads, bridges and transit systems.\""It is clear that chronic under-investment is a major contributing factor to the problems across all modes of transportation,"" he said. ""The nation must also address rampant earmarking, misuse of funding, lack of resource prioritization and poor comprehensive planning that marks current federal transportation programs.""\'Primary routes'\The state's 21st Century Transportation Committee is also considering new funding options, including toll roads and public-private partnerships, motor-vehicle fees and other options.\Most bridge-replacement dollars come from the federal government, with the state chipping in a share. The gas tax is the primary source.\Glynn, the local bridge maintenance engineer, recently compiled a list of bridge priorities beyond those already in the State Transportation Improvement Program. Among the recommendations are the two bridges over Banks Channel on Wrightsville Beach, the North Third Street bridge and the River Road bridge over Lords Creek in New Hanover County.\Glynn said she prioritized bridges based on a number of factors, including repair histories, structural conditions, bridge ages and the number of cars that travel across them.\The two bridges over Banks Channel - on Causeway Drive and West Salisbury Street - aren't rated quite as low structurally and don't have posted weight limits. But they do carry heavy traffic loads, especially during tourist season. If either bridge had to be closed, it would put a serious strain on transportation on Wrightsville Beach.\""They're primary routes, and we want to focus on those,"" Glynn said.\If and when those bridges are added to the State Transportation Improvement Program, they would compete with all other projects in Division 3. Once in the state's sights, it can take a decade or more to plan, design and construct a bridge replacement.\Locally, two bridge replacement are currently under construction - the N.C. 210 bridge over the Northeast Cape Fear River in Pender County and the bridge over Davis Creek on Oak Island, part of the project to build a second bridge to Oak Island.\Construction is expected to begin this year on the N.C. 179 bridge over Jinny's Branch and a new bridge to Sunset Beach in Brunswick County. In New Hanover County, replacement of the Cornelius Harnett Road bridge over a railbed is expected to begin this year.\Third Street bridge\Connie Majure-Rhett, president and chief executive officer of the Greater Wilmington Chamber of Commerce, said infrastructure struggles are a regular theme of new-member orientation sessions at the chamber. Area residents are already concerned about decaying roads and bridges. Imagine the situation after the influx of new people projected to arrive in the coming years, she said.\The state's 21st Century Transportation Committee is expected to release recommendations in May for new funding sources.\""Our needs are not going to get less, they're going to grow,"" Majure-Rhett said. ""I'm interested to see what North Carolina is going to propose.""\At 5 p.m. Friday, cars backed up over the North Third Street bridge, as workers in downtown Wilmington and other motorists headed toward the Martin Luther King Jr. Parkway and the Isabel Holmes Bridge for their afternoon commutes.\The opening of the parkway and the subsequent rise of the PPD headquarters downtown have put a lot more stress on the bridge. As of March 2007, 21,945 vehicles each day crossed over it.\The Third Street bridge was first built in 1920 and reconstructed in 1955. Its sufficiency rating, a measure of a bridge's structural condition, is 7.4 on a scale of zero to 100 scale, with zero representing a failed bridge. All of its major components - its deck, its deck supports and foundation - were rated ""poor"" on its most recent inspection in May 2007.\Plus, it carries traffic to and from the Martin Luther King Jr. Parkway, making it vital link in the local transportation network. The Third Street bridge also has posted weight limits, which restrict heavy trucks from legally crossing it.\Because of those limits, the DOT has resisted moving the designated U.S. 17 Business route from South Third Street to North Third, despite complaints by South Third Street residents about large trucks shaking their homes.\Mike Kozlosky, senior transportation planner with the Wilmington Metropolitan Planning Organization, said transportation officials have floated an idea to replace the bridge along with construction of a planned transportation center on North Third. The DOT is acquiring land for the ""multi-modal transportation center,"" which would provide a central location for Wave Transit bus transfers, out-of-town bus service, taxi service and potentially passenger rail service.\Construction of the center could happen within several years, Kozlosky said, but funding isn't available for that either.\The Associated Press contributed to this report.\Patrick Gannon: 343-2328\patrick.gannon@starnewsonline.com"
123,"
Republican candidates for North Carolina Senate District 48 and House District 113 seats promised a crowd at a Chamber of Commerce-sponsored candidate forum they would focus on the economy and education if elected.
\
Candidates Lisa Carpenter Baldwin and Chuck Edwards, Republican contenders for the Senate seat, and Cody Henson and Coty Ferguson, Republican candidates for the House seat, answered questions Tuesday from moderators on business-related issues from incentives and workforce readiness to maintaining the statehouse clout of outgoing Sen. Tom Apodaca.
\
The third Republican candidate for District 48, Dennis Justice, boycotted the forum over what he saw as misleading fliers mailed by the North Carolina Chamber endorsing Edwards, saying the local Chamber will go as the state Chamber goes.
\
Edwards said he's ""clearly the most pro-business candidate here,"" touting his experience of 17 years with the Henderson County Chamber, 15 years with the Transylvania Chamber and his endorsement from the North Carolina Chamber. He said he's worked alongside the state Chamber and been quoted in the Charlotte Observer and Wall Street Journal.
\
Baldwin said the Chamber plays a large role in the politics in Raleigh, but she's ""got a reputation of not being a 'yes woman.'"" She added that there are some policies of the Chamber's that she would disagree with, ""but I would be willing to meet them at the table and discuss these differences.""
\
She noted that the Chamber is pro-Common Core, and said she's concerned about the North Carolina Chamber's ""position on amnesty for illegal immigrants,"" producing a copy of a letter the ""(Henderson County) Chamber, under (then-Chairman) Chuck Edwards, sent to Nancy Pelosi and (John) Boehner to push for what became the Obama amnesty executive order.""
\
She said she would enforce existing immigration laws, but would work to fix the migrant worker program if it needed fixing.
\
Edwards was given 30 seconds to refute Baldwin's claims. In a raised voice, Edwards said that when he was the chairman of the Chamber, farmers were struggling with finding labor to work in their fields and came to him for help. Edwards said he signed the letter, ""and we asked them to get off of their butts and fix immigration once and for all, and give the farmers a way to legally and reliably tend to their crops.""
\
""We never asked for amnesty,"" he added. ""Those words are missing from this letter, and I find it totally offensive that I would be accused of something so heinous in simply trying to represent the agricultural community in Western North Carolina.""
\
Priorities and issues
\
The candidates began the forum by stating their top two priorities. For Baldwin, a past Buncombe County school board member, the first priority is education. She said Common Core needs to be stopped and school choice expanded. Her second priority is the economy, and Baldwin said regulations need to be rolled back and taxes lowered.
\
Edwards said his first priority is protecting and growing the region's economy, which is needed to provide services and jobs, and education is part of that. His second priority, he said, would be creating jobs, touting his business experience and saying there are hundreds of thousands of jobs that can't be filled because of a nationwide skills gap.
\
Henson's first priority is jobs and the second is education. He wants to bring in jobs to allow people to raise families in Western North Carolina, and said he favors ending Common Core and returning power from Raleigh to local teachers and administrators.
\
Held up by school delays, Ferguson missed the introductions and first few questions, including the question about top priorities.
\
When questioned about their positions on economic incentives and their philosophy on taxes and tax policy, for the most part the candidates were in similar camps.
\
On incentives, Henson said the state has made strides in advancing its business climate, but power needs to be pushed from Raleigh to local governments so areas can remain competitive.
\
""We need to eliminate any type of wasteful government spending,"" he said when asked about taxes, going on to say he favors reducing the 30 percent state gas tax that's down to 20 percent in neighboring states, as well as a broader-based income tax approach and getting the corporate income tax rate to zero. He added that he'd love to see the personal income tax abolished.
\
Edwards said he doesn't like the idea of incentives, but they're needed. Through discussions, he said, he heard two requests from local economic development leaders, one being that ""they absolutely have got to have incentives in their arsenal."" The leaders also asked that funding be maintained for the state's economic development partnership.
\
As for taxes, Edward said he's ""extremely satisfied with the progress that we have made so far,"" but added that ""we can do better."" Lowering taxes, he said, begins with prudent budgeting. He again stressed his business background, which ""prepares me to get under the hood"" of the state's budget.
\
Baldwin said she's reluctant to support incentives to businesses, but can as long as the value to the community is there with clearly defined benefits. But the best thing for businesses would be a lower tax environment, she added.
\
Baldwin said she'd like to see the 2 percent corporate income tax go to zero, touting her fiscally conservative school board record and background as an economist. She also mentioned increasing efficiency, going to zero-based budgeting and costly occupational licensing as opportunity areas.
\
Housing
\
Affordable housing, an issue that affects area leaders' ability to attract businesses to the area, was the next issue, and the candidates varied on their approaches.
\
Baldwin said Section 8 housing is a necessity, and that she supports efforts to increase affordable housing opportunities, but that ""expectations are too high.""
\
She said when she was in grad school, she rented a room in a house, with roommates to split rent, but ""I'm seeing things with single people in particular where it's as if they feel they are entitled to have their own apartment and be able to afford it alone.""
\
Henson agreed. As the young head of a household, he said more affordable housing is needed, but a lot of it comes back to bringing jobs to the area to get residents off government assistance.
\
""I believe the answer to affordable housing is more to help people afford housing, not to produce something that just gets them by,"" Edwards said, reiterating that what's really needed is a robust economy and jobs, and to help people be able to fill those jobs.
\
Ferguson said affordable housing is a tricky thing, but the biggest hurdle is infrastructure. He said it takes things like water and sewer lines, which are at capacity in his district.
\
Ecusta Trail
\
Candidates spoke about the proposed Ecusta Trail, which would connect Hendersonville and Brevard via an unused rail line that would be converted to a greenway.
\
Henson said the trail is a county commissioner issue; that he's talked to WATCO, owners of the rail, who have told him it's currently looking for businesses to use the line. He said he's discussed alternate routes with members of the Friends of the Ecusta Trail, and at the end of the day, will have to side with property owners, several of which have raised security concerns.
\
Edwards said that since his first objective is to grow the economy, his primary wish would be to have an industry with 1,400 jobs for the line, but the rail line has been unused for 15 years. ""It's beginning to look like using that line for rail service is an unviable option,"" he said, adding that the biggest property owner is WATCO.
\
Without the industry, he thinks the ""next highest and best use"" of the rail line, which is ""wasting away,"" should be looked at, and ""it would be a huge game changer"" for the region to realize that use and turn it into an asset to attract tourists, businesses and residents. Without rail service, he'd like to see it developed as a trail.
\
Ferguson pointed out that if the line was rail banked, like Ecusta Trail supporters propose, the property rights of the rail bed would remain with WATCO. The company told him that to be viable, the rail would need to have 200 rail cars per month traveling on it, something he said could not even be met by Sierra Nevada Brewery, which considered property along the rail.
\
Ferguson said it's actually been 19 years since the line was in use, and the infrastructure along the rail line would not handle the needed industry to bring the rail back to life.
\
Baldwin said she would not oppose the project, but property rights are a concern and that she thinks it's a local decision that must be decided by weighing the costs versus the benefits. It's premature to assign a state role, she said, but quality of life is a big draw for the area.
\
Replacing Apodaca
\
Candidates were also asked how they would work to keep the power base established by Western North Carolina legislators like Chuck McGrady and Tom Apodaca intact.
\
Edwards said he'd do it ""by simply being relentless,"" saying he's a stakeholder, and that the Eastern part of the state may be the noisiest, but he'll work alongside colleagues to create a synergy to constantly remind folks that this corner of Western North Carolina deserves and receives its fair share.
\
Ferguson cited his experience with the U.S. Army, working in civil affairs, especially four years in Iraq, to show that he can get things done. He said it's his job to negotiate with the military, state department, nonprofit groups and foreign governments.
\
""If I can fix the Iraqi government, you'd better be damn sure I can fix ours,"" he said, adding his No. 1 goal is to establish a relationship with the state economic development team to push incentives back to Western North Carolina.
\
Baldwin said she has a proven track record as an elected official, initiating change on the Buncombe County school board. She mentioned the list of her accomplishments on her website, adding that she was the only one of seven with a conservative voice pushing for conservative values, transparency and making sure citizens had a voice.
\
She said she became known as a fighter battling at the state level against Common Core, being covered by Fox News and Carolina Journal for her efforts in the area, and said she's already prepped to ""jump right in there.""
\
Henson said he's been in touch with officials like McGrady and House Majority Leader Mike Hager, who are ""all in agreement that, for too long, the state of North Carolina has seemed to end right around Winston-Salem, with a little dot called Asheville, and that's unacceptable.""
\
He mentioned the second-largest industrial development site in the state, sitting empty in Transylvania County, saying that the district needs someone to work in Raleigh to fight for this part of the state, and that's him.
\
Health care in North Carolina
\
Candidates were asked how they would work to support health care in the state.
\
Ferguson said this was a question that he's OK saying he doesn't know the answer to. The first question he asks candidates is if they see themselves as a delegate, making decisions on their own, or a representative, someone who gets stakeholders together and forms a plan.
\
He said he doesn't know what it's going to take to sustain the health care industry, but that he needs to hear from stakeholders, though health care seems to be going well and there are other things that need attention to get the economy ramped up.
\
Baldwin said she'd work to strengthen the health care establishment in the area, calling it a great marketing tool to attract more retirees. But she's concerned about the free market, not wanting to see Mission Health expand into a monopoly. She said the state needs to do away with the Certificate of Need, and that she'd like to see limited government roles to allow the industry to flourish.
\
Henson said the health care industry is great, paying roughly half his bills because his wife works at Mission. There's no magic wand to wave over health care, he said, and pledged to go out and talk to hospitals and administrations to see what he could do to help them.
\
Edwards said ""Obamacare has wrecked the health care system,"" and added that the state is constricted in what it can do by federal mandates, which is the first obstacle. He said he's spoken to several hospitals and understands their problems more. The best thing he feels he can do is listen to folks in the health care system and help fashion solutions to fix them without creating additional problems.
\
Education spending
\
Candidates were also asked to give their opinions on education spending and what they would do in terms of the state's education budget.
\
Baldwin said she supports school choice, though the playing field needs to be kept level. She said there needs to be more local control, citing studies that show academic achievement increases when principals have 25 to 50 percent of the school's budget, making decisions on things like whether to pay certain teachers more. She again came out against Common Core, and said remediation rates of over 50 percent at community colleges need to be addressed.
\
Henson said power needs to be pushed down to local administrators for budgets and calendars, and proposed reforming the lottery to get more money flowing to the schools. He wants to focus on improving education standards, which he said in North Carolina are now pretty much ""you show up, you pass.""
\
Edwards said there are a lot of things about the education budget he doesn't understand, primarily where the $1.5 billion increase over the last six years is going. He gave seven points for education: getting politics out, developing a personal relationship with parents and teachers, replacing Common Core, addressing workforce readiness, developing a merit system to award the best teachers, looking at age 0-5 at-risk development, and expanding school choice.
\
Ferguson pointed out that 58 percent of the state budget and 33 percent of Transylvania County's budget goes to education, so funding isn't the problem. He said money should follow students, not remain within systems where high property taxes keep them well-funded. He advocated for school choice and the implementation of career academies.
\
Transportation infrastructure
\
Candidates spoke about their approaches to funding and making sure Western North Carolina gets its fair share of those funds.
\
Western North Carolina seems to be overlooked a lot, said Henson, and this is another example of the need for a person to fight for the region in Raleigh, to get a transportation system ""that connects us all"" and helps to bring in jobs.
\
Edwards lauded work during the last General Assembly session to better equalize how transportation funds are distributed, returning $600 million to transportation projects rather than taking it to fill other general fund shortfalls. With drivers using less gas, the state is making less money on its gas task, so the concern is finding the next source of transportation funding.
\
Ferguson said he would try to work with Congressman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) to change how transportation funding gets allocated to keep dollars in the states where they are collected.
\
He also said the state should look at toll roads, moving to a fee-for-service model, eliminating income tax. He said the upcoming Connect NC Bond, to be voted on in March, was supposed to go to transportation but isn't actually going toward infrastructure projects.
\
Baldwin said she's commonly known as a government watchdog, saying the transportation area has been ""ripe for construction,"" with projects being chosen not for merit but on a ""cronyistic"" way. She mentioned the role of the state auditor to re-evaluate transportation funds, both financially and how projects are chosen for funding.
\
She also said the gas tax should continue going toward infrastructure and that ethanol should play a smaller role.

124,"The boundaries of state House District 16 may have shifted under recent redistricting, but according to the three Republicans vying for a seat there, the major issues of the election cycle remain the same.\Previously, the district encompassed Pender County and the northern tip of New Hanover. Under the new lines, the boundaries shifted west, out of New Hanover and into Onslow County.\""It really hasn't changed the approach or the principles. The message is the message, whether you're in the western side of Onslow County or the northern part of New Hanover."" said Chris Millis, a civil engineer who will face Tim Thomas and Jeff Howell in the May 8 Republican primary.\There is no Democratic opposition for the seat.\All three men are from Hampstead.\Though each candidate said the economy continues to be a major issue in the upcoming elections, the three men approached it differently. Millis, for example, believes that economic growth is directly linked to fiscal responsibility at the state level.\""It's about creating an environment for each and every one of us to be able to prosper, and that environment can only be created if we have a government that reins in our spending,"" he said.\For Howell, a business owner, the issue of economic development is directly tied to North Carolina's gas tax.\""Gas has ties to everything. It has everything to do with the economy,"" he said. ""The guys I work with in construction, they work payday to payday and they're paying $500 to $700 a month in gas.

125," New Hanover County needs bicycle paths.\ That's the consensus of people who responded recently when Neighbors asked about riding conditions in the area for cyclists.\ Following are some of the comments:\ ***\ Since this state in general doesn't believe in shoulders, what is a disabled motorist who has to change a tire on dirt with a jack to do or a person walking from one place to another or a cyclist who uses his bike for work or exercise? The entire length of River Road should have a bike and walking path to the beach . . . The state should pay for it all. The taxes are not cheap in this state. Even Manhattan has bike lanes in the city on a few streets. GEORGIANA WOLF\ Wilmington\ . . . This beautiful city can only be seen safely from a car. We need bike paths and walk paths for the safety of the people.\ KIM KELLEY\ Wrightsville Beach\ Bicyclists do pay taxes, contrary to comments in letters to the editor. Bicyclists do own cars and homes but do use bikes for exercise, to do short shopping trips and to work if possible. Cars are necessary, but if bike paths were available, some of the traffic congestion would be relieved. I strongly encourage bike paths. IRENE LORD\ Wilmington\ Cycling promotes road safety, cleaner air and exercise. There are far too many cars on the road! The city should be encouraging cyclists much more.\ M.M. MORAN\ Wilmington\ New Hanover County needs safe cycling paths. Eastwood Road to the beach would be a viable road to initiate this alternative mode of transportation.\ CAROL SIMS\ Wilmington\ Bike riding is good for your health, the environment and your pocketbook. Unfortunately, it is also very dangerous. Let's make this wonderful city even better by making it safe for bikers and walkers.\ JANE BRODER\ Wilmington\ As a longtime local cyclist, 23 years, I have sadly watched as our roads have become treacherous for cycling and as our community rejected a $100,000 grant for a bicycle connector path and as a rails-to-trails opportunity was shot down by local land owners.\ Wide, paved shoulders should be added with each repavement project, all new road construction should have wide paved shoulders and new developments should be required to provide paved bike lanes to encourage safe bicycle commuting. . . . SALLY MESEROLE\ Wilmington\ I moved to Wilmington about three years ago from Quebec, Canada, where it is winter six months during the year. My favorite sport was bicycling. Every day I would go for a ride on one of the numerous bicycle trails in my town. Most of the major streets had an extra section specially dedicated to bicycle riders. . . . Even Montreal, which is the biggest city of eastern Canada, has bicycle paths. I miss my bicycle rides!\ Since I have lived in Wilmington, my ""brand new"" bicycle sits in my garage. I haven't used it once in three years except the day I almost got killed on Shipyard Boulevard on my way to mail some letters. What can the local government do? When a street is planned, pave an ""extra"" eight feet on the side, with signs for bicycles. On existing streets, draw a line on the pavement and make room for bicycles. It will create jobs, reduce stupid accidents and maybe make a new attraction for tourists . . . VERONIQUE LANGLOIS\ Wilmington\ Yes! This should have been in progress a long time ago. Along with the growth of autoways, we need bikeways! What could be a safe, affordable means of transportation and a delightful recreation for people of all ages has been ignored for far too long! TERESA JONES\ Wilmington\ . . . Bike paths and lanes are absolutely essential. Councilmen/women, commissioners and aldermen of our area appear to be unaware of the need for safe travel for cyclists. In a university community, the bicycle traffic will continue to grow. And well it should. Obviously, it is an economical form of travel.\ Broad-ranging public transportation (always needing heavy subsidization) does not appear to be on the horizon. Many people travel by bike other than students. To some degree, cyclists of all ages will help absorb some of the automobile traffic.\ . . .\ The Wilmington area is somewhat parochial and isolated from other urban and metropolitan areas; hence, unaware of the development of greater use of bicycle transportation for other than recreational activity. In Davis, Calif., a university town, with terrain as level as here, bicycles are a common mode of transportation. There are wide, wide lanes and safe paths all over town. Impressive numbers of bike racks with thousands of bicycles are all over the campus. Berkeley, Calif., has excellent bike lanes and paths; also cops on bicycles downtown. The university provides shuttle buses with multi-bike racks on the rear. . . . The West Coast seems on the leading edge for bicycle travel; this area is on the back edge. It will be hard to catch up, but it must be done . . .\ CLAUDE DAUGHTRY\ Wrightsville Beach\ Many single-car accidents happen in North Carolina because of the state policy of not building stabilizing shoulders on our secondary roads. Three-foot paved shoulders will solve this problem along with allowing ""safe"" bikeways and postal delivery access.\ WAYNE HANSON\ Wilmington\ We live in an area in which we can recreate year-round, but because of limited or no access we cannot. By putting safe cycling lanes on roads and throughout town, it would promote family outings, exercise, and may even help traffic. I would certainly pay more in taxes.\ L. WINNEBERGER\ Wilmington\ Cycle lanes (or simply shoulders) should be added to roads wherever possible and practical. Money should come from county/city taxes (go ahead, raise them, it's worth it) since this will benefit everyone. Bikers will ride more often, which will result in fewer cars on the road.\ PAUL REINMANN\ Wilmington\ Making Wilmington safer for cyclists would be the modern and intelligent accompaniment to our rapid growth. More cyclists represent less traffic and less pollution and better health. It's an obvious step in the right direction to benefit the entire area. KRISTIN K. HOWELL\ Wrightsville Beach\ We have a tandem and would love to ride it, but we live off Beasley Road, a narrow two-lane road (speed limit 45 mph) with no shoulder, potholes and the edges of the road rapidly crumbling. Right now, it's terrifying to just be on it in a car if a school bus or truck is approaching. So you can imagine how safe we have felt riding our bike on it!\ DIANE SAVOIA\ Wilmington\ Should local governments do more to create a safe environment for health transportation alternatives, such as cycling? Absolutely! I cannot imagine an argument against it. Non-motorized transportation brings the community outdoors, interacting and participating in healthy recreation. More people on the streets can have an effect on reducing crime, and local business flourishes with human activity. The prospect of having the ability to get to the beach from downtown and back safely can only help both areas.\ The money for trail building is already available via the Intermodal Surface Transportation Act (ISTEA), passed in 1991, that earmarked $820 million for path and trail facilities for use by inline skates, bicyclists and pedestrians. These funds are taken from our gas tax and given to states that apply for the funding. Reputable organizations such as the Rails to Trails Conservancy have helped to transform areas all over the nation. For those citizens who do not participate in alternative transportation, think of it this way: We're saving your air.\ KALINDA MATHIS\ DENNIS MATHIS\ Wilmington"

America is at a tipping point, and we need strong, courageous, visionary leadership to turn things around before it is too late. My proven history of business leadership (former office president and senior partner with North Carolina's largest architecture firm), as well as my experience as an architect make me well-suited to help lead our state. Architects are visionaries, planners, creative problem solvers and consensus builders -- I believe that is what we need more of in Raleigh.\""We also need leaders who are willing to protect our state's powers. The 10th Amendment to the Constitution tells us that all powers not given to the national government are reserved for the states. We need leaders who are willing to stand up for these powers and reject the overreaching power play by the federal government.\""The lieutenant governor serves on the state school board by Constitution. We need a lieutenant governor who is willing to fight for our children's future by breaking the state government-controlled monopoly on education and introducing choice. This free-market principle will lead to true innovation in education.\""The lieutenant governor also serves on the N.C. Board of Economic Development. North Carolina ranks 44th in the nation in business tax climate. We have the highest corporate income tax rate and the highest gas tax in the Southeast, and one of the highest personal income tax rates in the nation.

The answer is getting government out of the way so that North Carolina's job creators can go back to work doing what they do best -- growing our economy. North Carolina deserves better. We deserve leaders in Raleigh who understand that jobs are created not by government action, but by private-sector investment and innovation. As a small-business owner, I understand the importance of lowering taxes and reducing the regulatory burden on small businesses to turn the economy around.\""North Carolinians also deserve a more transparent, more accountable and more responsive government. As a Wake County commissioner, I championed a program called Wake Watch, which allows Wake County residents to go online to search the county budget and see every expenditure. Can you imagine what concerned citizens around the state would find if we put the state budget online in a searchable and accessible format?\""I also want to be small-business ambassador for our local small businesses.

My parents made sure they worked with me to overcome what was to have been a permanent disability.\""I lost my father in 1987 when I was 9. My mom was a homemaker at that time, and she had to obtain a career in the textile industry to provide for our needs while helping me maintain the farm. I know firsthand what it is to be a member of an unplanned single parent family.\""At age 14, I obtained my first formal employment at the local grocery store to help maintain our home and assist in providing for our needs.

Throughout my life I have been watching, listening and feeling the effects of politicians' decisions. My vision, goals and ambitions for North Carolina cannot be achieved at any other position than governor.

We have multiple candidates throughout the state who are running for different offices, from city, county and state positions, who have excellent ideas and visions also. In order for them to be able to accomplish their goals, they need a governor that will support them. My first goal is to eliminate property tax. This will accomplish two goals: first, it will help businesses grow and bring other businesses to North Carolina; second, it will stop forced annexation.\""I believe in a flat fair tax for everyone. The Constitution gives the authority to tax the people equally. Everyone pays the same percentage whether you make one dollar or you make a million dollars, no exceptions, no deductions, no nothing.\""Our state and country are based on the vote. Voting is our existence. Our military goes to other countries to help them conduct and supervise voting, and yet our voting procedures here are very corrupt. Before the next elections in two years my goal is to totally revamp the procedure we use to vote. Voter ID is crucial; dead people and illegal immigrants should not be allowed to vote.

I have a proven record of successful leadership experience throughout my career on issues like economic development, recruitment, strategic planning, problem-solving, finance, training and homeland security.\""North Carolina is the greatest state in the country, but we need a different vision in order to get back on track. We have one of the highest unemployment rates in the country but lack an economic strategy. We have too much political bickering and not enough problem-solving. It's time to fix North Carolina's broken government and broken economy and put our resources back to work.\""We must foster an economic environment with less costly and burdensome regulations and taxes not only to compete for out-of-state jobs, but also help our existing businesses create jobs. We need to reward the productivity and innovation of North Carolina businesses and entrepreneurs, rather than giving away upfront cash to out-of-state corporations offering promises. We need to get into the energy business so we can be more energy-independent and create a new economic engine.\""We also must reform education to ensure that all of our children are learning the vital skills like reading and math and reward our best teachers.

127,"washington -- Congress returns Tuesday for a four-week legislative sprint to confront a number of domestic and foreign policy matters before lawmakers adjourn for the annual August break.\A long-delayed transportation bill will take top billing with a July 31 deadline looming on how to keep funding flowing to the nation's highways and other infrastructure projects.\The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee recently approved a six-year highway bill, but how to pay for it remains a significant hurdle. Many lawmakers, mostly Democrats, want to pay for it in part by raising the gas tax, which has remained at 18.4 cents per gallon since 1993. But that's a non-starter for the GOP-controlled Congress. There is also a bipartisan effort afoot to raise revenues by raising taxes on profits U.S. companies earn overseas.\The highway bill is also expected to become a vehicle for a fight over whether to reauthorize the Export Import Bank of the United States, the nation's official export credit agency, whose charter expired on July 1.\The House and Senate are scheduled to take up a six-year reauthorization of the federal education law overseeing elementary and secondary education.\The Senate may try again to take up legislation overhauling the nation's cyber-security laws after an attempt to add it to a defense bill last month failed.\Congress may also be thrust into the ongoing international talks to get Iran to abandon its nuclear ambitions if the six world powers negotiating the deal strike a final agreement this month.\Then, of course, there are the 12 annual spending bills that fund the federal government. The House is nearing completion of its work, but Senate Democrats are blocking appropriations bills from moving in the Senate in order to force larger budget talks to set new spending levels for defense and domestic programs."

129,"Marine fuel taxes and increased fees for fishing licenses and boat registrations could help pay to dredge coastal inlets in the future, according to a legislative committee's recommendation.\The Marine Fisheries Committee on Thursday endorsed proposed legislation to conduct a study to identify possible state funding sources for dredging and maintenance of inlets. The full General Assembly would still have to approve the language.\""It is the intent of the General Assembly to provide funding for the dredging and maintenance of the state's coastal inlets from fees charged to those who make use of the inlets,"" according to draft legislation.\The draft bill goes on to say that dredging could be paid for through increased fees for commercial and recreational fishing licenses and the numbering and titling of vessels, as well as marine fuel tax revenues.\State Rep.

""That gas tax should be used.""\State Sen.

Now into his sophomore year as a state legislator, N.C. Rep. Chuck McGrady said he will continue to stand on his principles -- even if it means ruffling feathers sometimes with fellow Republicans in Raleigh.
\
McGrady, who resigned as a Henderson County commissioner in December 2010 to fill the seat of former state Rep. Carolyn Justus when Justus retired, announced last week he intends to seek re-election.
\
Following what he called a ""very productive"" freshman year, McGrady said he looks forward to using his unique position as a fairly conservative Republican and staunch environmentalist to help the General Assembly reach compromises and get key legislation passed.
\
From clear-cutting around billboards to hydraulic fracturing, McGrady's pro-environment stance on many proposed laws didn't always sit well with members of the Republican-controlled General Assembly, he said.
\
In the end they were able to work through most issues -- to some degree -- because of McGrady's ability to bring all perspectives to the table by relating to key people on both ends of the political spectrum.
\
""I've been pleasantly surprised that my colleagues have been willing to accept my periodic independence and difference of views with them on a range of issues,"" said McGrady, citing his vote against the regulatoryreform bill as another example.
\
""There's a host of issues where I dissented, and I've sometimes been the only dissenting voice, but I think my colleagues have recognized that I have a real ability to reach across party lines.""
\
Not that it's been easy, he added. McGrady said there were instances when bills he was sponsoring were taken off the legislative calendar to ""teach me a lesson"" as a freshman lawmaker.
\
For example, his proposed amendments to the original billboard bill -- which, among other things, increased the cutting zone around outdoor advertisements -- caused a rift among some Republicans.
\
At the same time, McGrady was trying to push through House Bill 350, or Land Trust Bill -- which clari- fies when land used for conservation purposes is to be excluded from the property-tax base.
\
""All of a sudden that bill got yanked right off the floor and put in committee; it was one vote away from passing,"" McGrady said. ""And they came to me and said, 'Chuck, can you modify your views on billboards?' And I said, 'No, I need to remain firm on what I need to do (with the billboard law), and long-term, people will gain respect for you being highly principled,' and it all worked out.""
\
McGrady said the support he's received from state Sen. Tom Apodaca has been a huge help, and that the Hendersonville legislators' strong working relationship has led to the success of several bills. One of them -- the protection of DuPont State Forest through its designation as the state's first ""recreational forest"" -- McGrady considers his proudest accomplishment so far.
\
The role McGrady and Apodaca played in passing legislation that helped bring Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. to Mills River was ""icing on the cake.""
\
Looking ahead, McGrady said he will continue to focus on some of his areas of expertise, and transportation will be one of his top priorities.
\
""I think there's going to have to be a significant change in how we finance transportation infrastructure,"" said McGrady, who sits on the House Transportation Committee.
\
""The gas tax isn't going to provide enough revenue to fund transportation infrastructure that we need -- roads, bridges, rail, whatever. So I think that will be one of my key issues.""
\
Another top priority may be getting more sleep. McGrady quickly tired of the very thing that led to Justus' retirement -- the constant fourhour commute to and from Raleigh. The contentiousness of partisan politics hasn't helped.
\
""The thing I get asked most is, 'Do you like what you're doing?' And my response is, 'Well, no, not really,'"" McGrady said with a hearty laugh.
\
He said getting key legislation passed would give him the ""highest high,"" but then the next battle would have him thinking, ""Oh, God, why did I do this? It could be so much better being a county commissioner and sleeping in my own bed.""

131,"
Norman Sanderson is completing his first term in the N.C. House, but with N.C. Sen. Jean Preston's decision not to seek another term, is running for the N.C. Senate District 2 seat she held.
\
Labeling himself ""a Christian, a conservative, and a Republican in that order,"" the one-term legislator has decided to test his experience and his knowledge of 20 years as a small businessman in a run for N.C. Senate.
\
He said that as the son of a farmer and member of a large family, he has long known the value of a strong worth ethic, and his business experience has proven that and further taught him to make tough decisions and appropriate compromise except on moral, ethical or constitutional issues.
\
Sanderson serves on House committees including Homeland Security-Military-Veterans Affairs, vice chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Education, Agriculture, Appropriations, Commerce and Job Development, and Environment. He has pushed for state funding of local historical sites that affect tourism and for support of Cherry Point.
\
He said he believes in the sanctity of human life and was endorsed by N.C. Right to Life but voted against the eugenics bill to provide some compensation to those who were sterilized by the state; is a strong Second Amendment rights advocate endorsed by the National Rifle Association, and believes that marriage should be between one man and one woman and supported that state constitutional amendment initiative.
\
Sanderson voted essentially down party lines on bills that passed the House during his first term, except the eugenics compensation bill and bill expanding casino gambling.
\
And he voted for the state budget that included ferry tolls. He said at an elections forum earlier this year that he did so as a compromise to other proposed cuts or the inevitability of a budget deficit and to keep his promise to put North Carolina back on the path toward fiscal accountability. Sanderson lives in Pamlico and has a business in Havelock so he would have to pay ferry tolls if implemented.
\
Sanderson said he is proud that the Republican-controlled House voted to cap the state gas tax and helped pass a state budget that include pay raises for teachers and state employees for the first time in four years.
\
""We loosened regulatory requirements on citizens, businesses and community colleges, made additional steps toward the safe exploration of natural gas off our coast, and strengthened Second Amendment rights and private property rights,"" he said.
\
""We must not go back to the way things were two years ago in North Carolina when the liberals were in control,"" he said.
\
He said he plans on working for conservative principles in the Senate and ""represent the citizens, not special interests.""

132," Arsonists burned Dickie Jolly's gas station in 2001. No arrests were made, and he tore it down the next year. Its three underground gasoline tanks have been removed, but he still can't finish the cleanup.\ He's waiting on the state to authorize his plan to take out the contaminated soil.\ ""I could have had the dirt out a long time ago, but I have to have authorization to be reimbursed,"" he said. He figures the cleanup will cost $30,000 to $35,000.\ Deborah Mayo, a hydrologist with the local office of the state Department of Environment and Natural Resources, said she has to be more careful now about approving cleanup costs for leaking underground storage tanks.\ New laws require that only the most dangerous sites be cleaned up and, effective today, reimbursements must be paid within 90 days of project approval.\ The General Assembly took money from the state Department of Transportation to pay $30 million in reimbursements.\ Sites that pose the greatest danger will be cleaned up first, said Grover Nicholson, chief of the Underground Storage Tank Section of DENR's Division of Waste Management.\ That means some low-priority sites may never get cleaned up.\ And for the first time, homeowners may not get reimbursed for cleaning up tank spills, which might make it harder to sell a house. Last year, the commercial fund paid out about $27 million, while the noncommercial fund for homeowners paid out about $6 million. There are no residential tank fees.\ Environmentalists complain that the industry doesn't pay to clean up after itself. Tank fees make up only about 30 percent of the commercial tank fund.\ We pay 40 percent of the commercial fund through taxes on gasoline and other motor fuels. Fuel inspection fees add another 10 percent, Mr. Nicholson said, and the rest comes from various sources.\ Doug Howie of the N.C. Petroleum Marketers Association said it would take ""astronomical"" tank fee increases to eliminate the gas- tax portion.\ But David Knight, a lobbyist for the Sierra Club, said he doubts the increases would greatly drive up gas prices. He said with not enough money coming in, DENR had to institute the priority system. But he wonders what will happen in future decades to sites that were never cleaned up.\ Mr. Nicholson said the department will focus on sites that threaten people who get water from wells. A site with neighbors on city water is a lower priority than well-water areas.\ Cases where fumes pose a health threat or risk of explosion are also high priority.\ Surface water contamination is of less concern. Pollution oozing into a creek behind a gas station is a lower priority.\ After going $30 million in the hole, lawmakers demanded a pay-as- you-go system. If the department can't pay a claim within 90 days, it won't be approved. Mr. Nicholson said the state is tightening down on cleanup costs.\ ""We were getting Cadillac systems where we only needed a Yugo system,"" he said.\ Some homeowners may not be able to get tank cleanups approved in areas served by city water. The rules now prioritize residential cleanups. Mr. Nicholson said banks may be leery of lending money on residential property with unresolved environmental issues.\ Molly Diggins, state director of the Sierra Club, said it might be time to consider handling the commercial tank fund like any other insurance program. That would put the burden on tank owners, not the general public.\ Good point.\ The General Assembly took $30 million from the Department of Transportation to bail out the tank fund. It could have been used for new roads, bridge repairs or mass transit improvements.\ If mass transit ever becomes a viable option for a sizable portion of the motoring public, maybe we won't have so many leaking gasoline tanks to worry about.\ Visit the online ""Common Sense"" forum via www.starnewsonline.com/ cantwell.

133,"A recent poll about North Carolina residents' opinions about public records and access to government information yielded disturbing results.\It came from Elon University and was released before ""Sunshine Week"" in March, a time dedicated every year to the importance of open government and freedom of information.\The Elon poll found that 62 percent of North Carolinians aren't aware that ""sunshine laws"" exist here to require governments to make their records available for public inspection, with few exceptions. And only two-thirds of those surveyed believe it is important for people to be able to get documents they want from the government. Also, just 69 percent said they believe all government meetings should be open to the public.\""Sunshine laws are foundational in a democracy because they provide the path for citizens to inform themselves about their government,"" said Jonathan Jones, director of the N.C. Open Government Coalition, in a statement accompanying the poll. ""These poll results show that a great deal of work remains to educate North Carolinians about their right to know how their governments and elected leaders do business.""\The poll numbers cited above are scary for any number of reasons. Here's one:\Media members get press releases every day from the governor's office, state legislators, state agencies and other taxpayer-funded organizations. Most of us know better than to simply take them and put them online, in the paper or on TV without scrutinizing them and ensuring accuracy and appropriate context.\Releases range from well-written and thorough to misleading or even false, in some instances. If we had to rely solely on what politicians and state bureaucrats told us, we would seldom get a full, accurate picture. They're likely not going to volunteer what they don't want you to know.\For example, state Senate leader Phil Berger's office recently sent out a news release lauding the passage of a compromise between the House and Senate on various tax-related changes, including the stabilization of the gas tax. The release also pointed out that the compromise includes a tax deduction for teachers who buy classroom supplies out of their own pockets.\But it didn't mention the more controversial aspects of that legislation. One provision requires homeowners who have debt forgiven by a mortgage lender as a way to avoid foreclosure to pay state taxes on that forgiven debt. In other words, if a homeowner received $20,000 in mortgage principal forgiveness, he or she would have to pay $1,160 in additional taxes, based on the state's individual income tax rate of 5.8 percent, the Charlotte Observer reported. Some opponents criticized that as ""kicking a man while he's down.""\Also recently, Gov. Pat McCrory's office sent out a news release about his signing of legislation that ""will provide added environmental protections for our state."" That might have been true for parts of the bill, but the release also included somewhat misleading information about a section that some legislators and environmental groups believe could end up harming the environment.\The press release noted that the law ""clarifies"" that the Environmental Management Commission has the authority to make additional rules ""if necessary"" to address possible air pollution from hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. It did not mention that the former law would have required the commission to make additional air quality rules to address possible effects of fracking. The press release was headlined, ""Governor McCrory Signs Legislation Strengthening Environmental Protections.""\Do you trust government agencies to accurately tell you what they're doing? You probably shouldn't.\That's one of many reasons why public access to government records and meetings is so important.\Distributed by Capitol Press Association.\patrick gannon\state columnist"

136,"House races a mix\of solid candidates,\varied storylines\S\State House contests in this section of Western North Carolina have a variety of themes in 2006. One contest features a race where voters are guaranteed to end up with an experienced legislator. Three pit relative newcomers against more seasoned veterans.\District 116\One election will close a chapter in Western North Carolina politics while opening another.\That race is in N.C. House District 116, where veteran Republican Rep. Wilma Sherrill is vacating her seat after a dozen years. Sherrill leaves a strong legacy, having been an effective advocate for child care, fiscal sanity and domestic violence reforms. Moreover, Sherrill established an enviable reputation as an independent voice during her years in the General Assembly. She will not be an easy act to follow.\Two young men are vying for the opportunity to do just that, and they come with many similarities. Democratic hopeful Doug Jones is a teacher who pledges to reduce high property taxes while focusing on education, health care and job issues. He also pledges to ban political ""robocalls,"" an idea with more than a little appeal. Republican candidate Charles C. Thomas comes off a career in the U.S. Army, where he served from 1992 to 1998. He was recalled in 2004 during Operation Enduring Freedom. Thomas and his wife operate a flight school, WNC Aviation, LLC.\Both candidates are thoughtful and energetic, and mirror Sherrill in that they have the bipartisan streak necessary to be effective in representing the 116th District.\We feel Thomas would fill that role best because of his more varied background in business and the military.\District 114\District 114 pits incumbent Democrat Susan Fisher, appointed to complete Martin Nesbitt's House term in 2004 and elected by the voters later that year, against challenger Mike Harrison, who retired from the U.S. Army as a colonel in 1998 after serving 28 years. He is a farmer, runs a small business and is a management consultant. Harrison is running as a traditional small-government conservative. Fisher cites among her accomplishments: increasing the state's minimum wage, working for a clean environment, working on health care concerns and bringing jobs and job training to Western North Carolina.\She has been an effective leader and deserves to be returned to Raleigh.\District 115\In District 115, two-term incumbent Democrat Bruce Goforth faces a challenge from Republican Eric Gorny. Goforth's credentials include his work on recovery programs to address widespread storm damage from Hurricanes Frances and Ivan, the Hurricane Recovery Act of 2005, helping to spearhead the state gas tax cap and work on identity theft, sex offender registration and eminent domain restrictions. Goforth is climbing the leadership ladder on important legislative committees such as appropriations and education. Gorny is an energetic campaigner running on a conservative platform that at times seems more suited for a congressional run than a state house bid. His platform includes ""red meat"" issues like a marriage amendment, abortion restrictions and zero-based budgeting. Gorny also has an agreeably strong focus on corruption in government. A small businessman, Gorny believes a good way to attract business to the state is via a solid public infrastructure - roads, Internet and water and sewer systems.\Rep. Goforth has established a solid record of public service and keeps his eye on the legislative ball, and should be returned to Raleigh.\District 117\In District 117 Republican Rep. Carolyn Justus, first elected in 2002, squares off against political newcomer Gordon Hoots. A Democrat from Flat Rock, Hoots is tightly focusing on local matters such as acquiring land for the Hickory Nut Gorge State Park and funding for a youth program at Flat Rock Playhouse. Justus brings not only her two full legislative terms to the table but the 18 years of experience she accumulated clerking for her husband, then-Rep. Larry Justus, in Raleigh. Despite being a member of the minority party in Raleigh, Carolyn Justus has performed well in the legislative trenches, and was a powerful force in addressing the needs of farmers harmed by the 2004 storms. She comes with the ability to work across the political aisle and a mountain of knowledge concerning issues of importance, and deserves another term.\District 119\In the 119th District, voters will get a legislator with experience no matter who wins. Four-term incumbent Democratic Rep. Phil Haire is being challenged by Republican Marge Carpenter of Waynesville. Prior to redistricting, Carpenter served in the old District 52. Following redistricting she was defeated in 2002 by Ray Rapp, and lost to Rep. Haire in a 2004 contest. Haire's credentials include chairing the House Select Committee on Homeland Security, Military and Emergency Management, and work on judiciary and appropriations committees. He has been working on issues of local import such as slope development and mobile home disposal. Carpenter comes to this race with a fresh perspective, having become a foster parent. That's switched much of her focus to child-related issues such as drug prevention and health care. She still brings to the table a strong conservative slant on tax and property rights issues. Both candidates have experience and would represent the area well. Rep. Haire gets the nod because of his seniority, and deserves another term."

Editor's note: First in a series of two
\
My recent articles on the Neuse River Bridge project led to a conversation with Jay Mattingly, former New Bern alderman, on his role in getting two abandoned tugboats removed from Scott's Creek. The two abandoned, derelict tug boats rested on the bottom of this tributary of the Neuse River, at the foot of what is now the base of the western ramp of the Neuse River Bridge, just east of New Bern.
\
Mattingly brought me his huge file of correspondence, photos, newspaper articles and summaries he amassed during the three years and five months he pursued every avenue to get the derelict tugboats removed.
\
Mattingly said, ""It seemed to me if these were motor vehicles on a city street they would have been removed promptly by city ordinance. Why can maritime law protect scofflaws who ignore or refuse to take proper care of their vessels?""
\
Official records confirm the two tugs boats, the George McBlockwood and the J. Edgar Steigerwalk (aka) Snapper (built in the 1920s) were stuck in muck and mire, rusting away for more than 10 years. Sold ""as is"", ""where is"" on Sept. 23, 1993, the tugs were considered abandoned as they were never moved by the owner. In 1994, in response to a complaint by the Neuse River Foundation, the U.S. Coast Guard ordered having the fuel pumped out of the two vessels and removal of an oil slick coming from the tugs.
\
In December 1995, the N.C. Department of Transportation purchased land from Weyerhaeuser Company which included the submerged land the tugboats were on to construct U.S. 17and N.C. 55 across the Neuse River.
\
Mattingly's quest began July 15, 1998.
\
He met with Special Deputy Attorney General, N.C. Department of Justice and the Manager of the Department of Transportation (DOT) Right of Way Branch who advised, ""They were well aware of the situation but DOT's mission was to build highways and not to move boats. DOT advertised and received one bid for $258,000, then decided to reject it since the bridge project could be built without moving the boats."" The meeting ended with a referral to speak with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Assistant Chief of Operations who stated, ""Since the boats were in the creek and not a hazard to navigation, they were not responsible for doing anything.""
\
With both avenues closed, Mattingly contacted P.A. Wojciechowski, division manager, Public Trust Submerged Lands in Morehead City who was knowledgeable on this case. Wojciechowski said he had talked to one of the partners who owned the boats but was unable to get them to remove them.
\
At his recommendation, Mattingly contacted the Commander and Executive Officer for the Port of Wilmington who advised, ""since the pollutant fuels had been pumped out of the tugs, they were no further concern to the U.S. Coast Guard.""
\
Undaunted, he contacted the N.C. Department of Environment and Natural Resources. Boyce Hudson, senior field officer, who investigated the site, told him the boats were there when construction began so provisions were made to work around them and they were no longer a problem to the contractors.
\
In August, he wrote to DOT Secretary Norris Tolson. Several days later, the N.C. Highway Administrator called and advised ""DOT cannot do anything. Legally gas tax dollars can only be spent on highway projects and cannot be used to move boats.""
\
Secretary Tolson's response was more of the same and encouraged Mattingly to continue to work with local authorities. A letter from then Sen. Bev Perdue suggested Craven County could authorize their removal with county funds. Mattingly's position: since local county officials did not design, purchase the land, or contract with the bridge builders, why should the remedy fall in their jurisdiction?
\
At an October meeting with a subcommittee of the Coastal Resources Commission, who are responsible for protecting the estuaries in the coastal region and shoreline stabilization of Public Trust Waters, Mattingly was told, ""The tugs did not come under their mandate.""
\
On May 21, 1999, he spoke with Rick Dove, Lower Neuse Riverkeeper who referred him to Weyerhaeuser management who in turn told him, Weyerhaeuser sold the property (real estate) where the bridge would be located to DOT and they were not involved with the tugboats.
\
Many phone calls and contacts later, he found out previous owners of the tugboats were Bob Piner, general manager of the Morehead Towboat Company, Charles Carver who signed the bills of sale, and Cary McIntyre who was reported to be the primary purchaser. Piner advised Mattingly he sold both boats to a man from Leland, N.C. Mattingly's attempts to contact that person were not successful and since he had no legal authority or official status to question him, he planned to inquire what his intentions were when he bought them.
\
June 9 correspondence from County Attorney Jim Sugg advised, the subject was discussed at the June 7 Board of Commissioners meeting and the County Manager will pursue the matter with DOT. Although unsuccessful to date, the county was trying to find someone other than the County that was involved as the cost of removing the tugs would cost the taxpayers more than $250,000.
\
The Sun Journal's first of many articles began on June 24 reporting, County officials want tug boats removed; not sure what can be done, but haven't given up.
\
On the same day, Jason Goins, Legal Aide, Neuse River Foundation advised they were preparing a warning letter to the DOT Secretary, with the intent to sue unless the tugs were removed within 60 days.
\
In a June 28 letter to David McCoy (the new DOT Secretary), Mattingly asked him to reconsider DOT's previous opinion.
\
More letters and meetings with state and local officials ... no replies or ""nothing can be done.""
\
N.C. Secretary McCoy held a meeting in New Bern with Marion Smith, executive director of the Neuse River Foundation (NRF), Harold Talton, chairman of the County Commissions, Bob Mattocks, Division II Board of Transportation member, and other state and city officials and DOT staff. McCoy agreed to review DOT's position, would provide a written up-date on their position and proceed with appropriate solutions.
\
To be continued.

141,"Small businesses see sales, profits declining\RALEIGH -- North Carolina's small-business owners said sales and profits are declining, according to this quarter's North Carolina Small-Business Conditions.\The report's data, which was released by the National Federation of Independent Business/North Carolina, provides an overview of small-business conditions within North Carolina and compares them with neighboring states.\A net 40 percent (positive percent minus negative percent) of respondents said sales were ""good,"" down from a net 50 percent last quarter, while a net 24 percent characterized profits as ""good,"" down from a net 32 percent the last two quarters. The net 40 percent in sales and net 24 percent in profits trailed South Carolina (net 44 percent; net 32 percent), Tennessee (net 47 percent; net 32 percent) and Virginia (net 53 percent; net 33 percent). North Carolina ranked No. 18 in sales and No. 14 in profits among 26 states in the survey group.\According to 66 percent of respondents, average prices paid for goods and services ""increased"" during the last three months, up from last quarter's 55 percent, while 23 percent reported they increased average selling prices during the last three months, up from last quarter's 17 percent. A net 60 percent said the outlook for business is ""good"" over the next three months, down from last quarter's net 65 percent.\A net 38 percent of respondents said business conditions are ""good,"" down from last quarter's net 43 percent. The figure trailed South Carolina (net 45 percent), Tennessee (net 43 percent) and Virginia (net 53 percent), and was actually closer to California (net 41 percent) and Massachusetts (net 34 percent). Optimism continued to fade, dropping to a net 10 percent, which compared with a net 14 percent in September and net 25 percent in June.\""Curiously, business conditions in North Carolina are closer to states like California and Massachusetts than South Carolina and Virginia,"" NFIB/N.C. state director Gregg Thompson said. ""There's been a shift in momentum, and clearly North Carolina's small-business owners are being challenged a great deal by inflationary pressures in this post-Katrina environment.""\Asked which total costs are rising most rapidly, respondents answered materials (28 percent), energy (26 percent), insurance (25 percent), and labor (9 percent). Thompson asserted North Carolina's gas tax, which is the highest in the Southeast at 27.1 cents per gallon, is a contributing factor to the pressures small-business owners are facing.\Eveland named as interim leader of NCCBI\RALEIGH -- Barry Eveland has been named as the interim head of the N.C. Citizens for Business and Industry, a 2,000-member statewide chamber of commerce.\Past chair of the NCCBI board and retired IBM senior state executive, Eveland will start work as interim CEO and president on Jan. 1.\NCCBI chairman Steve Miller of The Biltmore Co. in Asheville said, ""NCCBI is very fortunate that Barry has enthusiastically agreed to serve our organization in this capacity as we move forward with our mission to be the premier voice of influence in protecting and growing North Carolina's favorable business climate and positive quality of life.""\Eveland retired from IBM in March. He had 39 years of experience in manufacturing and logistics and served as senior state executive for North Carolina for 10 years.\A search committee hopes to recommend a permanent president by next summer.\Atema leaves radio stations\BLACK MOUNTAIN -- Tom Atema, executive director of Blue Ridge Broadcasting, will depart the stations on Dec. 31 to become vice president of Strategic Partnerships for EQUIP of Atlanta.\In his new role, Atema will work to build partnerships with the many ministries and networks interested in using EQUIP's curriculum to provide leadership training.\Jim Kirkland, WMIT and WFGW general manager, will assume Atema's duties in addition to his present responsibilities.\Atema joined Blue Ridge Broadcasting in 1999 as assistant general manager, becoming general manager the following year.

142,"despite efforts against it\Some conservatives hope President Obama fails to get his economic stimulus plan passed in the Senate, because they don't want to see him get credit for preventing another depression.\Rush Limbaugh, for example, said, ""I hope Obama fails.""\Obama, who has the job of rebuilding a shattered economy as well as a shredded Constitution, must not fail. The stimulus creates or saves 3-4 million jobs; did you know the real unemployment rate is already more than 13 percent?\The official numbers don't count the underemployed and those who have given up looking. The bill creates hundreds of thousands of ""green"" jobs, needed for the economy, the environment, even for national security.\The Republicans are nitpicking over tiny aspects of the bill, because even they can find no fault with the bulk of it. America is in a mess now because conservative Republicans (and their Blue Dog Democrat enablers) have let Wall Street burn down Main Street. Look around you: notice how much was built during the New Deal years? The Blue Ridge Parkway, for example. President Franklin Roosevelt saved America from a GOP-caused depression.\Let Obama and America succeed. Pass the stimulus. It's time to do something progressive again.\Thomas Buckner, Asheville\Pondering 'What would Jesus do'\in modern-day America\If Jesus Christ showed up today, he would say to the politicians of our time, ""You hypocrites.""\Our own politicians are at the root of this current economic disaster. I remember a story from years ago about a little boy trying to hold his finger in a dam. I think you can imagine what happens next.\The Earth-lease is about to expire. That means globally. The best thing Washington, D.C., can do is show as much charity to the taxpaying citizens of our nation as is possible.\We have all sown our seed money into it; we should at least have some semblance of a harvest. I think some of the people in this nation still believe in prayer. We should pray for the right stimulus package that Congress can pass into law for our nation.\Paul D. Shelton, Asheville\Would bet letter writer\would choose anesthesia\In response to the letter, ""Warren Wilson College responds to concerns about its pigs,"" (AC-T, Feb. 3), I have the following to say.\I don't care how vehemently the letter writer denies that castration without anesthesia is less stressful than ""handling,"" that doesn't make it true. I don't care how many other humane practices the WWC farm may have in place, it does not make this one humane, too. If he would only ask himself, ""If I had to pick one, which would I rather undergo -- the stress of 'handling' or the surgical removal of my testicles without pain relief?""\I'd bet the farm he'd choose the former.\Bonnie Evans, Candler\Agrees 100 percent with\Shuler's votes so far\As a lifelong Democrat watching Congressman Shuler's voting record thus far, I completely agree with every single one of his votes on matters concerning our country and the mess it is in due to the Republican Party -- whose policies have put us all in the poorhouse -- over the last eight years.\The stimulus package which he just voted against is at the very time being torn apart in the Senate as gross over spending on ""special projects"" of various congressmen around this country. The waste was so bad it would make anyone who is paying attention and reading about to also vote against it.\Shuler did the right thing and voted against it. There were billions of dollars in wasteful spending in that package. Also don't worry about the president and Shuler, as they both know the right direction that is needed to get our country out of this mess we are now in and will be in for perhaps the next couple of years.\Bill Morris, Arden\GOP needs to offer up some\new thinking on economy\Republicans once more prove the old saw: If your only tool is a hammer, then every problem is a nail.\Our economy is like a broken motor: It needs certainly new fuel (money), a new throttle (regulation), a new carburetor (lender-investors) and probably more.\Republicans offer, yet again, only a lower gas tax (lower taxes only). Cheaper fuel won't start a broken motor. Repeating the same old fruitless action (lower taxes) but expecting different results is dangerous thinking.\Apparently President Franklin Roosevelt's famous phrase is now just half right: We have nothing to fear, except Republicans themselves.\Gregory Forsythe, Asheville\Tired of hearing about\a lack of employment\I have now read one too many stories of some unfortunate soul who has lost a $100,000-a-year job and can no longer afford the posh condo they grew to love.\I'm sorry, no sympathy for people who overextend themselves with luxuries they failed to save for. Your unemployment check is only a few hundred dollars a week but you can work, you simply choose not to. Rarely have I ever passed a McDonald's or Wendy's or Taco Bell without a ""now hiring"" sign in the window. However, because it's not your dream job or you think you're overqualified for a fast food job you draw unemployment.\You are not overqualified for a job that you work at and get paid for doing, but you are probably underqualified for unemployment (that whole being able-bodied and healthy and willing to work thing always gets you).\I just wish someone could smack some sense into these people and let them know that unemployment still probably pays less than a 40-hour-a-week job at minimum wage. Go to work; it's out there.\Adam Blankenship, Sylva\GOP lawmakers do not have\a credible leg to stand on\Isn't it ironic that many of the same Republican senators and representatives who now stand in the way of President Obama's economic stimulus package either supported or stood idly by as former President Bush presided over eight full years of deficit spending that took our national debt from $5 trillion to $10 trillion?\They gave the former president a blank check but now scrutinize and micro-manage Obama's ideas. I wonder how many of these Republican lawmakers, who like Rush Limbaugh has admitted, secretly want this president to fail?\If Republican lawmakers had exercised to just a slight degree their fiduciary responsibilities under the former president, their actions now would be justifiable and I would agree with them.\But based on their past behaviors, their actions to me smell like politics, hypocrisy and a huge double standard.\Andy Brown, Asheville\Letters to the Editor"
143,"over more reliance on oil\A\As Americans face the stark reality of skyrocketing energy costs, we must look for long-term solutions rather than short-term fixes that exacerbate the problem. Recently, Sens. Dole and Burr supported the new Gas Price Reduction Act of 2008, which proposes to lower gas prices by increasing offshore oil drilling and enabling fuel production from oil shale on federal properties.\Instead of feeding our insatiable addiction to dirty, finite fossil fuels, Congress should prioritize conservation and efficiency measures while sustainable, renewable sources are developed. Even if offshore oil drilling was not a slow, dirty and expensive process, the Energy Information Administration states that America's offshore oil resources would not significantly impact oil production until 2030, having only a minimal impact on prices. What about the near-term impacts that offshore oil drilling would have on our beaches and the businesses that rely on visitors to them?\Better solutions to high gas prices are increased fuel economy in our vehicles and increased access to mass transit, reducing our dependence on all oil - foreign and domestic.

In our evermore polluted environment, we must choose organically grown foods to reduce the toxic burden that herbicides and pesticides place on our bodies. These substances contribute to many of our chronic illnesses.\Similarly, we must choose cows that have been fed organically grown grasses, because the cow's milk concentrates the herbicides and pesticides found in anything the cow eats. Therefore, when we consume that milk, we get even more of those health-diminishing substances.\And what the article did not mention was the potential to reduce our ""carbon footprint"" by not having to haul the milk all over the Southeast.

If their owners can afford those huge vehicles, then let them pay to use them. Either pay double what we do or have to pay a penalty for recreation. I know this may hurt the tourism industry, but if we don't do something people are not going to be able to get to work or eat or pay for medicine.\I say let the ones who use the most for recreation pay the most.\Kelli Conner, Black Mountain\Column didn't do much to\promote sharing the road\R\Regarding the column, ""Power to the pedaling set,"" (AC-T, June 28): Does AC-T columnist Nancy Williams actually think bicycles should be banned from roadways? Why promote such a silly argument? Her column is dangerous fluff because it fans the flames of a very real menace to bicyclists' lives. Frustrated motorists use their cars as weapons in venting anger toward bicyclists. Many people are driving around frustrated and angry, and who can blame them? But let's not pretend the real reason is a slow cyclist. Most of us are guilty of occasionally venting our emotions inappropriately, but when a driver chooses to ""buzz"" a cyclist by passing too closely or swerving toward them it is no less dangerous than pointing a loaded gun at someone. Most don't pull the trigger (though it has happened), but the threat is no less serious.\If Williams thinks I am overstating the case, she should look at the online responses her column evoked. One calls for ""running over all bicyclists.""\The Asheville Citizen-Times should not print material whose only purpose is to fan the flames of hatred and division.

That may be the real driving force behind making this happen.\Elizabeth Pavka, Asheville\Pavka is a licensed dietician/nutritionist.\Proposes a gas tax on\recreational vehicles\I\I have a few ways to help with gas prices.\First, lower the speed limit back to 55.\Then, instead of our truck drivers and those who have to drive for a living having to pay so much for gas and diesel, let the recreational vehicles pay for the use. If their owners can afford those huge vehicles, then let them pay to use them. Either pay double what we do or have to pay a penalty for recreation. I know this may hurt the tourism industry, but if we don't do something people are not going to be able to get to work or eat or pay for medicine.\I say let the ones who use the most for recreation pay the most.\Kelli Conner, Black Mountain\Column didn't do much to\promote sharing the road\R\Regarding the column, ""Power to the pedaling set,"" (AC-T, June 28): Does AC-T columnist Nancy Williams actually think bicycles should be banned from roadways? Why promote such a silly argument? Her column is dangerous fluff because it fans the flames of a very real menace to bicyclists' lives. Frustrated motorists use their cars as weapons in venting anger toward bicyclists. Many people are driving around frustrated and angry, and who can blame them? But let's not pretend the real reason is a slow cyclist. Most of us are guilty of occasionally venting our emotions inappropriately, but when a driver chooses to ""buzz"" a cyclist by passing too closely or swerving toward them it is no less dangerous than pointing a loaded gun at someone. Most don't pull the trigger (though it has happened), but the threat is no less serious.\If Williams thinks I am overstating the case, she should look at the online responses her column evoked. One calls for ""running over all bicyclists.""\The Asheville Citizen-Times should not print material whose only purpose is to fan the flames of hatred and division. Williams' column was dangerous and irresponsible.\Ken Abbott, Asheville"
145,"Real issues get ignored EDITOR: I've figured out why so many people don't vote. In this election year we are barraged with campaign ads on TV that seem to be addressed to people who haven't the slightest idea as to what should be government priorities. It gets worse with each election. . . .\I personally do not know anyone who thinks same-sex marriages is the most outstanding problem we face today. At least I hope I don't.\We have a widening discrepancy between the haves and have-nots, a situation that is aided and abetted by tax laws, especially in North Carolina.\To tax food is an absolute disgrace. There is no way the needs of the state could be so hard to meet as to warrant taking food money from people who have to struggle to make ends meet.\The same goes for owning a car, another necessity for most people who have to get to work - licenses, taxes, inspection fees, plus that ridiculous gas tax.\Why take money away with one hand and give it back with the other and call it charity?\SUE PHILEMON ROCHELLE\Burgaw\GOP was blocked\EDITOR: The anti-conservative bias of your paper shows itself every day. (On Oct. 3) the front page showed a chart concerning the GOP Contract With America. Each item that this conservative Congress considered was identified as passed or rejected.\Actually many, identified as rejected, have passed by Congress but were vetoed by Bill ""The New Conservative Liberal"" Clinton.\Why didn't you identify the reason for the rejection?\Also alongside this analysis was an article headed ""Broken contract."" It identified that Mr. Clinton vetoed the tax cut for families.\The entire heading or headline for this article misrepresents what actually occurred. Bill Clinton's anti-family and anti-tax cut was the pure, single reason why the entire proposed legislative Contract wasn't fulfilled as promised. . . .\JIM DEEHAN\Calabash\Hogs are an issue\EDITOR: Citizens of North Carolina, arise! The stink and filth of the hog farms are moving towards your neighborhood.\Help the Carolinians who are already gagging on the disgusting odors of animal waste, which pollute the air and defile the land and water.\Write and call your state officials, including the governor. Make it absolutely clear to them that if they do not introduce bills or make a firm promise to limit and control hog farms, we will not vote for them.\Only the power of withholding your vote will overcome the money and influence of the hog industry on politicians.\Do not accept lip service and weak regulations which attempt to lull you into complacency.\Rise up and fight to protect your property, our beautiful waterways, and the very precious air we breathe.\JUSTIN RAPHAEL\Wilmington\Cable headaches\EDITOR: I write in reference to the Sept. 13 editorial, ""Isn't it time to bury the lines?""\I worked as an engineer in the insulated wire and cable industry for more than 42 years and offer you the following:\The National Electrical Code has a definition for wet locations. Until the middle of this century, electric power cables for use in wet locations were provided with a lead sheath over the insulation, a seamless tube that completely excluded moisture. If the sheath remained undamaged, a cable delivered power reliably for many years. . . .\For new residential and suburban developments, utilities began to install in the 1960s a design with aluminum conductors and vulcanized polyethylene insulation.\Tests in water . . . demonstrated that insulation would retain its good electrical properties. Mechanical tests for impact and abrasion resistance and the like demonstrated its ruggedness. The cost was acceptable. The prediction the design was reliable has proved to be true.\The problem remains of overhead distribution cables in areas developed before the (new) underground design became available.\The work required to tear up streets and properties and install the new design would be huge. The pockets of the utilities and of the communities they serve are not bottomless.\To say the least, underground distribution cables must be reliable in an extremely hostile environment. . . .\JOHN N. REYNOLDS\Wilmington\A bad rap\EDITOR: I read the recent article on ""Bad rap"" (on the controversy about a rap concert at New Hanover High School.) I think that rap gets a bad name.\First of all, a lot of rap is dealing with what is going on in the communities of this nation at this point in time. It seems like every time something is held here for the youth to enjoy, someone is waiting to step on it.\I would like to also say that the race card was played, due to the fact the artist was black. If the concert had been by a country-Western or a rock 'n' roll group it would have not been a big deal.\I feel rap is about us, the black community, and how we are sometimes forced to live. Rap is out to change lives, not to destroy them.\If anyone is to blame for the so-called ""bad"" rap, look to the government, as well as the White House. Until things can be better for our community, rap will continue to rap reality. . . . AON'TONIO RIPLEY\Wilmington\Nowhere to go\EDITOR: On Sept. 26, a program titled Transit 2001 was televised, detailing transportation plans for the next century in North Carolina.\The 11-minute program depicted many transportation problems in our state.\It was very educational. I learned there are no disabled people in our state.\Focus was given, extensively, to the problems faced by our growing population in regard to suburbs and annexation. Well-deserved attention was given to the elderly.\(Yet) there was not even a 10-second spot given to the transit problems the disabled face now. It leads one to conclude that there are no handicapped/disabled people in North Carolina, nor do they face any transportation problems.\Could it be that the state has formulated a plan to remove all disabled people from the state by 2001?\Maybe all of the disabled people seen in the state now are a figment of everyone's imagination.\The difference between ""able"" and ""disable"" spans only one second of time.\With elections so close, I hope those who are disabled and those who have genuine concerns for the disabled will pay close attention to the platforms of those seeking election. Disabled people vote, and many will vote for the first time in November.\MARGARET S. ROGERS\Wilmington"
146,"despite efforts against it\Some conservatives hope President Obama fails to get his economic stimulus plan passed in the Senate, because they don't want to see him get credit for preventing another depression.\Rush Limbaugh, for example, said, ""I hope Obama fails.""\Obama, who has the job of rebuilding a shattered economy as well as a shredded Constitution, must not fail. The stimulus creates or saves 3-4 million jobs; did you know the real unemployment rate is already more than 13 percent?\The official numbers don't count the underemployed and those who have given up looking. The bill creates hundreds of thousands of ""green"" jobs, needed for the economy, the environment, even for national security.\The Republicans are nitpicking over tiny aspects of the bill, because even they can find no fault with the bulk of it. America is in a mess now because conservative Republicans (and their Blue Dog Democrat enablers) have let Wall Street burn down Main Street. Look around you: notice how much was built during the New Deal years? The Blue Ridge Parkway, for example. President Franklin Roosevelt saved America from a GOP-caused depression.\Let Obama and America succeed. Pass the stimulus. It's time to do something progressive again.\Thomas Buckner, Asheville\Pondering 'What would Jesus do'\in modern-day America\If Jesus Christ showed up today, he would say to the politicians of our time, ""You hypocrites.""\Our own politicians are at the root of this current economic disaster. I remember a story from years ago about a little boy trying to hold his finger in a dam. I think you can imagine what happens next.\The Earth-lease is about to expire. That means globally. The best thing Washington, D.C., can do is show as much charity to the taxpaying citizens of our nation as is possible.\We have all sown our seed money into it; we should at least have some semblance of a harvest. I think some of the people in this nation still believe in prayer. We should pray for the right stimulus package that Congress can pass into law for our nation.\Paul D. Shelton, Asheville\Would bet letter writer\would choose anesthesia\In response to the letter, ""Warren Wilson College responds to concerns about its pigs,"" (AC-T, Feb. 3), I have the following to say.\I don't care how vehemently the letter writer denies that castration without anesthesia is less stressful than ""handling,"" that doesn't make it true. I don't care how many other humane practices the WWC farm may have in place, it does not make this one humane, too. If he would only ask himself, ""If I had to pick one, which would I rather undergo - the stress of 'handling' or the surgical removal of my testicles without pain relief?""\I'd bet the farm he'd choose the former.\Bonnie Evans, Candler\Agrees 100 percent with\Shuler's votes so far\As a lifelong Democrat watching Congressman Shuler's voting record thus far, I completely agree with every single one of his votes on matters concerning our country and the mess it is in due to the Republican Party - whose policies have put us all in the poorhouse - over the last eight years.\The stimulus package which he just voted against is at the very time being torn apart in the Senate as gross over spending on ""special projects"" of various congressmen around this country. The waste was so bad it would make anyone who is paying attention and reading about to also vote against it.\Shuler did the right thing and voted against it. There were billions of dollars in wasteful spending in that package. Also don't worry about the president and Shuler, as they both know the right direction that is needed to get our country out of this mess we are now in and will be in for perhaps the next couple of years.\Bill Morris, Arden\GOP needs to offer up some\new thinking on economy\Republicans once more prove the old saw: If your only tool is a hammer, then every problem is a nail.\Our economy is like a broken motor: It needs certainly new fuel (money), a new throttle (regulation), a new carburetor (lender-investors) and probably more.\Republicans offer, yet again, only a lower gas tax (lower taxes only). Cheaper fuel won't start a broken motor. Repeating the same old fruitless action (lower taxes) but expecting different results is dangerous thinking.\Apparently President Franklin Roosevelt's famous phrase is now just half right: We have nothing to fear, except Republicans themselves.\Gregory Forsythe, Asheville\Tired of hearing about\a lack of employment\I have now read one too many stories of some unfortunate soul who has lost a $100,000-a-year job and can no longer afford the posh condo they grew to love.\I'm sorry, no sympathy for people who overextend themselves with luxuries they failed to save for. Your unemployment check is only a few hundred dollars a week but you can work, you simply choose not to. Rarely have I ever passed a McDonald's or Wendy's or Taco Bell without a ""now hiring"" sign in the window. However, because it's not your dream job or you think you're overqualified for a fast food job you draw unemployment.\You are not overqualified for a job that you work at and get paid for doing, but you are probably underqualified for unemployment (that whole being able-bodied and healthy and willing to work thing always gets you).\I just wish someone could smack some sense into these people and let them know that unemployment still probably pays less than a 40-hour-a-week job at minimum wage. Go to work; it's out there.\Adam Blankenship, Sylva\GOP lawmakers do not have\a credible leg to stand on\Isn't it ironic that many of the same Republican senators and representatives who now stand in the way of President Obama's economic stimulus package either supported or stood idly by as former President Bush presided over eight full years of deficit spending that took our national debt from $5 trillion to $10 trillion?\They gave the former president a blank check but now scrutinize and micro-manage Obama's ideas. I wonder how many of these Republican lawmakers, who like Rush Limbaugh has admitted, secretly want this president to fail?\If Republican lawmakers had exercised to just a slight degree their fiduciary responsibilities under the former president, their actions now would be justifiable and I would agree with them.\But based on their past behaviors, their actions to me smell like politics, hypocrisy and a huge double standard.\Andy Brown, Asheville\Letters to the Editor"
147,"White phosphorus use ushers\in new era of ghastly warfare\W\With the now proven U.S. use of white phosphorus as a weapon in Iraq, a new level of horrific inhumanity has been reached. Depleted uranium, accumulating from this and the previous Iraq invasion, already plagues pregnant Iraqi women with the possibility of hideous birth deformities. But this new ghastliness eats the faces of its victims --- innocent or guilty, women and children as well as men -- and melts their flesh while leaving their clothes intact. Only in America, where the public is regularly lulled to sleep by President George Bush's sweet bedtime story of freedom falling from the sky courtesy of the Pentagon, does the brutal breaking and entering, bullying, prisoner taunting and general savagery perpetrated by U.S. troops there (and captured by the world's media) pass for anything resembling good news. Our elected (?) leader reportedly views himself as chosen by God to march into battle. But, considering what has been raining down from above on Iraq (next Iran and Syria?) -- cluster bombs, bunker busters, remote control assassination by Predator drones using Hellfire missiles, and this latest fiery form of death -- the ""heaven"" that sent us this president is beginning to look a whole lot more ... like that other place.\Beverly Dratz,\Hendersonville\Supposed 'rights' should not\overshadow war on terror\W\When the Fourth Amendment banning ""unreasonable searches"" was being drafted, little thought was given to the possibility that someday our entire population would be threatened by a suicidal pack of Islamic killers seeking the celestial rewards of martyrdom and committed, at the behest of Allah, to the eradication of America, The Great Satan. Killers, moreover, who -- as we are being warned by the State Department's top counterterrorism officer, J. Cofer Black -- ""have the will and some of the expertise to make chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear weapons, and are doing everything they can to acquire the materials."" A goal which, unless they are stopped, they will inevitably, achieve. This being so, those who oppose President Bush's electronic surveillance tactics should do more than attack them on politically motivated grounds, thinly disguised as ""legalistic"" but, rather, ask themselves one question, namely: Does, or does not, this surveillance increase our defensive and -- consequentially and eventually -- our offensive capabilities? Keep in mind while searching for the answer that which is the most crucial of all considerations: A civil right, if lost, can be restored. A human life cannot.\Irv Filler,\Candler\Republican wreckage\outweighs benefit of tax cuts\B\Bryan Aleksich, a frequent ""contributor"" of profoundly right-wing views, objects to the gas tax hike (AC-T, Jan. 14), saying Gov. Easley and N.C. Senate Majority Leader Basnight ""pretty much run this state as Saddam Hussein ran Iraq."" Aleksich may have seen evidence that Easley and Basnight have torture chambers throughout the state, have used poison gas on thousands of their enemies, have built 40 opulent palaces, and have slaughtered thousands of resistors and thrown them into mass graves. I haven't seen it. This bent ""thinking"" is not surprising: A while ago, Aleksich wrote that the rich are really generous and we should trust them. Recently he wrote that Iraq is progressing nicely -- the problem is bias in ""the liberal media.""\His recommendation is, ""If you want taxes lowered, elect Republicans."" He didn't mention the increase in national debt load under Presidents Reagan/Bush/Bush to $11 trillion (by 2008) -- nor that the interest on our borrowing now tops $300 billion per year -- nor that Republicans (and their predecessor Whigs) have initiated the Mexican-American War, the Spanish-American War, Contra war, Panama invasion, '91 Gulf War and the current atrocity. It's clear: If you want continuous war, economic disaster and destruction of the environment, vote Republican.\William Jakobi,\Swannanoa\Has an idea for future\direction of newspaper\A\As a reader of the Citizen-Times for almost 45 years, it is painfully apparent that if the current management of the paper spent less time pontificating about diversity and mindless political correctness, and more time demanding insightful and accurate reporting of the news, we would all be better served.\Hayes C. Martin,\Asheville\Commentator misidentified\his military service\I\Ineed to correct my guest commentary, ""Let Iraqis vote on whether U.S. forces should stay or go,"" (AC-T, Jan. 14). It has me identified as one of those brave souls who actually traveled on a swift boat during the Vietnam War. That was not the case. This is the sentence from my first letter: ""I was in the Navy and served on an LST off the coast of the Mekong Delta; we would supply and send other young men up the river on swift boats. We also served Navy helicopter gundhips the same way."" Through editing and versions going back and forth my bravery was significantly enhanced. My apologies.\Jim Wohlgemuth,\Asheville\Kennedy acting a bit high\and mighty, isn't he?\A\Am I the only one who sees the absolute absurdity of Sen. Ted Kennedy seeking ""dirt"" in the personal background of Judge Sam Alito?\Unbelievable.\Slade Marlow,\Asheville\Asheville is savvy enough\to decide on Civic Center\I\I have a simple solution to the Asheville Civic Center question. Let the citizens of Asheville decide the fate of the Civic Center in the next general election. If the citizens decide to fix it up, float the bonds or whatever. If the people decide the other way, sell it and give the buyer a five-year tax break. I actually think all these commissions think the people can't make an informed decision.\Charles Biddix,\Asheville\One of these years, U.S. will\hang its head in shame\S\Sanctity of Human Life Week (Jan. 15-22) has been observed recently by many of our churches. In 1984, President Ronald Reagan issued the first presidential proclamation designating National Sanctity of Human Life Day.\The 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision discovered an expansive right to privacy that includes a woman's right to choose to terminate the life of her unborn child. Since then, according to Dr. James Dobson, approximately one-sixth of the population of planet earth has been removed worldwide. In 2000, more children died from abortion than Americans died in the Revolutionary War, Civil War, World Wars I and II, the Korean, Vietnam and Gulf Wars combined.\During the course of the Alito hearings, Kate Michaelman -- former head of the National Abortion Rights Action League (on Fox News) and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (on National Public Radio) -- indicated women have come to depend on Roe vs. Wade. That is not a compliment. If indeed abortion is desired by ""the mainstream,"" states have the right to enact their own laws without constitutional discoveries.\We admitted slavery was wrong and corrected that. When will we admit that abortion is wrong and correct that? One day there will be accountability for wrongs committed.\Gail M. Harding,\Candler\Turnabout is fair play in\the how-did-we-get-here game\I\If intelligent design is taught in the schools as science, then unintelligent design should be taught in the churches as religion.\John A.

148,"Commentator also 'forgot'\a few negative facts\K\Kelly Olson, author of the guest commentary, ""We can stay with a proven Social Security, or abandon it to the winds of Wall Street,"" (AC-T, Aug. 13), is obviously informed and experienced with respect to our Social Security system. She accused previous commentator Lauren Pinilis of misleading his readers by leaving out facts detrimental to his argument. I believe that Olsen is guilty of the same sin.\She stated that ""the value of life insurance provided to survivors of an average deceased worker is more than $400,000 ..."" She failed to clarify that in order for the monthly life insurance payments to kick in, there must be at least one surviving child younger than 18 years of age (less than 16 in some cases). If there is no qualifying child surviving, the surviving spouse must be 60 or older to qualify for the life insurance payments. The regulations are complicated and hard to understand. The main point is that Olsen was disingenuous to simply state that the average life insurance benefits are more than $400,000.\The fact that she also hyped a celebration sponsored by the Buncombe County Young Democrats may indicate what political axe Olsen has to grind.\Edward Osada,\Asheville\Downhill homeowner offers\example of erosion problems\W\We in Asheville are badly in need of enforcement on site, and in the planning and approval of the existing ordinances for erosion control, storm water runoff and hillside development. I will gladly show city employees classic damages to Ballantree homeowners' properties occurring over the last decade here. It borders on criminal.\William G. Becker,\Asheville\Media gives Islam a free pass\while piling on Christians\W\Why does the liberal news media in the United States not come down on the world's Muslim leaders for not coming down on their radical terrorist element? What would the liberal media reaction be to Christian leaders worldwide if they did not speak out strongly against such an element within Christianity? A silent Christian leadership in those circumstances would be continually vilified (and rightly so) by the media.\Never mind that al-Qaida manuals instruct captured terrorists to abuse the Quran in order to inflame and recruit. Never mind that kidnapped Americans are the recipients of beheadings, not Bibles, from their Muslim captors.\Evil people are determined to kill the ""infidels"" -- that's you and me, so excuse me if I'm not kindly persuaded toward Muslim sensitivity these days. I refuse to wring my hands about defiled Qurans, lawyers for terrorists, calculated anti-American demonstrations and European criticism. I choose to support our military and dismiss its detractors' accusations. I prefer to win the war against terrorism the old-fashioned way: by killing the enemy before they kill us.\Sensitive?

There was a wonderful line in it, ""I'm madder than hell and I'm not taking it anymore."" Well I've reached that point. One day recently I bought gas at $2.60 a gallon; a few days ago it was $2.54, and a few days before that it was $2.44. A friend of mine was telling me that she bought gas several days ago for $2.45 at 10 p.m.; her significant other bought gas the next morning at the same place for $2.55. There was no delivery of gas either. I ask you, how can the gas companies raise the price of gas 10 cents on the gallon for gas that was already in the ground? They can't. I might be off a few cents either way, but you get the point.\Therefore I propose a revolution. On Friday, Sept. 30, do not buy any gas, not a drop. E-mail your family, friends, whatever. Talk to your neighbors, family, friends and co-workers. Ask them to do the same thing. If a bunch of people band together, things get done.

Today she mocks President Bush for suggesting there ought to be limits to our freedoms. Well, Ms. Ivins, there are. Many years ago, G.K. Chesterson wrote an essay, ""In Defense of Liberty."" In it, this brilliant man stated that true liberty must involve the ""moral ought."" We are free only when we do what we ought to do.

Here's how North Carolina House members voted on major issues in the week ending June 1. The Senate was in recess.
\
ABORTIONS BASED ON GENDER: Voting 246 for and 168 against, the House on May 31 failed to reach a two-thirds majority for passing a bill (HR 3541) that would impose criminal and civil penalties on doctors who perform abortions thought to be based on the gender of the fetus. Under the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling, abortion is legal up to the time when the fetus reaches viability -- usually after 24-to-28 weeks of pregnancy -- and after viability if it is necessary to protect the health or life of the mother. By disregarding the court's distinction between viable and non-viable fetuses, this bill would allow doctors to be prosecuted and jailed for performing certain first- or second-trimester abortions that are legal today. According to Roe v. Wade, viability occurs when the fetus can potentially survive outside the womb with or without artificial aid.
\
A yes vote was to pass the bill.
\
Voting yes: Renee Ellmers, Walter Jones, Virginia Foxx, Howard Coble, Mike McIntyre, Larry Kissell, Sue Myrick, Patrick McHenry, Heath Shuler
\
Voting no: G.K. Butterfield, David Price, Melvin Watt, Brad Miller
\
FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION: Voting 387 for and five against, the House on May 30 passed a bill (HR 5651) that authorizes $6.4 billion, over five years, in Food and Drug Administration user fees on companies seeking approval of new brand-name and generic drugs, medical devices and biotechnology products. Additionally, the bill seeks to prevent shortages of lifesaving drugs; spurs development of new drugs for treating diseases that are resistant to existing antibiotics; steps up FDA inspections of foreign facilities that manufacture pharmaceuticals and devices sold in the U.S.; lengthens prison terms for drug counterfeiters; requires studies and labeling standards to ensure the safe use of drugs for children; promotes the development of pediatric medical devices and requires the FDA to consider updated health warnings on tanning beds, among other provisions. The bill now must be reconciled with a competing Senate bill.
\
A yes vote was to pass the bill.

Voting yes: Butterfield, Ellmers, Jones, Price, Foxx, Coble, McIntyre, Kissell, Myrick, McHenry, Shuler, Watt, Miller
\
2013 INTELLIGENCE BUDGET: Voting 386 for and 28 against, the House on May 31 passed an estimated $80 billion budget (HR 5743) for U.S. civilian and military intelligence agencies in fiscal 2013. The House Intelligence Committee says the classified figure is down 4 percent from 2012 and reflects an overall personnel freeze but increases in surveillance staffing. The bill requires the director of national intelligence to report to Congress within 60 days on the consequences of any U.S. military attack on Iran; steps up defenses against mounting Chinese and Russian cyber-espionage against U.S. governmental agencies and corporations; boosts spending for the FBI's National Gang Intelligence Center and boosts the ability of spy satellites to monitor hostile areas abroad with non-stop video as well as still photography. The bill awaits Senate action.

VETERANS, MILITARY CONSTRUCTION: Voting 407 for and 12 against, the House on May 31 sent the Senate a bill (HR 5854) to appropriate $60.7 billion in fiscal 2013 discretionary spending for the Department of Veterans Affairs. The bill also would appropriate about $11 billion for building or repairing family housing, schools, medical units and other facilities at U.S. military bases worldwide. Additionally, the bill provides $74.6 billion in mandatory veterans spending for programs such as disability compensation, pensions and the post-9/11 GI Bill. The bill also appropriates several hundred million dollars to operate Arlington National Cemetery, the Armed Forces Retirement Home, the American Battle Monuments Commission and the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims.

150,"By year's end, Black resided in a federal prison in Pennsylvania. The corruption allegations that dogged him for nearly two years finally led to his political demise in 2007.\Black's final fall from power and five-year prison sentence -- the culmination of one of the most significant political corruption scandals ever to take place in North Carolina -- again dominated the political news during the year. An investigation into his fellow House Democrats continued, leading to the indictment of a former legislative lieutenant and other unsavory revelations.\But the year also saw significant policy changes, especially on the environment and health care fronts. And the ever-accelerating campaign season, this one for the 2008 elections, got under way, with the fields for governor and Elizabeth Dole's Senate seat more or less set.\Black's departure from power, of course, meant someone else's rise.\Democrats united\House members elected Orange County Democrat Joe Hackney as speaker in a contest that, once Democrats decided on their nominee, became largely anticlimactic. Republicans, at a substantial minority in the chamber, decided to avoid any attempts at power plays designed to elect a Democrat other than Hackney. Democrats, meanwhile, united behind him after going through a ballot process that saw former Speaker Dan Blue and others fall short in their bids.\A 14-term veteran of the House, Hackney came to the job with a reputation as a prickly but hardworking policy wonk. Over the years, he had a significant hand in shaping criminal, environmental and elections law that came out of the legislature.\As speaker, Hackney said his first task would be to try to restore dignity and civility to the House. Part of the process included regular meetings with Republican leaders, who generally praised the Democrat for bringing more fairness to legislative operations.\The legislative session, though, began slowly, in part because of the leadership change.\Busy legislative session\By its end, though, legislators had approved a sweeping change requiring the state's electricity utilities to begin producing 12.5 percent of their energy from alternatives to fossil fuel and nuclear power. They had largely banned future construction of hog lagoons. They passed legislation that scuttled plans for mega-landfills in several areas of the state. Regarding health care, state lawmakers required insurers to give mental health-related illnesses the same coverage as physical ailments and created a high-risk insurance pool.\After years of talk, the legislature also decided to phase out county governments' responsibility for covering a portion of Medicaid costs, a move expected to ease pressure to raise property taxes.\Of course, new laws passed are one thing. Making laws already on the books work are another.\Nagging problems\North Carolinians with mental health problems and developmental disabilities struggled to receive services under reforms intended to standardize services and create more community-based treatment options. Instead, cost overruns and uneven services plagued the system.\And a lottery expected to bring new revenues for public education failed to live up to its billing. Revenue for school programs came up $112 million short of the $425 million projected for the first full year of lottery operations. In response, Gov. Mike Easley convinced legislators to boost prize awards to try to ramp up sales. In the first quarter of the new fiscal year, sales still weren't meeting expectations but were at least close to the target.\Lobbyists, legislators and political appointees also were forced to change their ways because of reforms designed to prevent conflicts of interest. Lobbyists wining, dining and gift-giving of legislators was banned, and more financial disclosure was required of a range of public officials. Some didn't like it and quit state boards. Others didn't comply and were kicked off.\The state's policies regarding business recruiting incentives came under more scrutiny when Easley vetoed legislation that promised millions to Goodyear simply to maintain a tire plant in Fayetteville. Legislative leaders blustered about overriding the governor's veto. Instead, they pursued a compromise bill containing job guarantees but creating an ongoing incentives program to provide tax breaks to retain industry. Critics howled that the result was an expansion of corporate welfare.\While the governor kept intact his streak of successful vetoes, his would-be replacements began their campaigns for 2008.\On the Republicans side, Salisbury lawyer Bill Graham turned his anti-gas tax crusade into a gubernatorial campaign. Homebuilder and state Sen. Fred Smith of Johnston County used a biography as an effective campaign tool and railed against illegal immigrants. Former state Supreme Court Justice Bob Orr parlayed his role as vocal incentives critic into a bid for the state's top office while running a shoestring budget campaign. Meanwhile, Charlotte Mayor Pat McCrory made noises about joining the Republicans seeking to take up residence on Raleigh's Blount Street. Then again, he'd made similar noises in the past.\The top two Democrats seeking the gubernatorial post wasted no time getting at it. State Treasurer Richard Moore began slinging the mud at Lt. Gov. Beverly Perdue before the summer was over, challenging resumes, her abortion-rights credentials and positions on transportation spending. Perdue eventually counterpunched, calling into question Moore's own education claims and trying to cast blame on him for problems at a taxpayer-financed theater in Roanoke Rapids.\After a lot of speculation that she might not, Elizabeth Dole did. The Republican announced that she would seek another term in the U.S. Senate. Even with the GOP's troubles in Washington, Democrats had trouble recruiting candidates. Jim Neal, a Chapel Hill financial consultant, finally announced. And state Sen. Kay Hagan of Greensboro, after initially saying no, later decided to enter the race.\The shadow cast by the Black corruption scandal only diminished intermittently.\After resigning from office, Black pleaded guilty to a federal public corruption charge in February. But his problems didn't end in federal court. The Mecklenburg County Democrat also pleaded guilty to state charges of bribery and obstruction of justice. After spending an August day in a Wake County courtroom testifying about offers of vote-buying in speaker races, Black was ordered to pay a $1 million fine. He was then sent to Pennsylvania to begin serving a 63-month prison sentence.\Out of Black's testimony came revelations that Don Beason, once listed as the most influential lobbyist in Raleigh, provided the speaker with a $500,000 loan. After some companies indicated that they would drop Beason as a lobbyist, he pre-empted any others, giving up his lobbying business and credentials.\A former Black ally, Democratic Rep. Thomas Wright of Wilmington, had his own campaign finance-related problems, eventually leading to his criminal indictment in state court and efforts to remove him from the House. Ugly revelations also emerged about the use of a college scholarship foundation operated by the Legislative Black Caucus, with some of the money going to legislators' relatives.\Scandal wasn't limited to Democrats either. Former state GOP chairman and federal prosecutor Sam Currin was sentenced to more than six years on federal money laundering and obstruction of justice charges. David Almond of Stanly County abruptly resigned from the state House after whispers of improper behavior.\Lawmakers not caught up in scandal hoped that by year's end the bad publicity would end.

152,"State senate candidate Michael Lee's latest television ad points out that Sen. Julia Boseman didn't pay taxes on her ""million dollar mansion"" and that she is ""too irresponsible to trust in Raleigh.""\While the Republican Lee has said he planned to focus only on the issues in his campaign, Boseman said she believes the ad stoops to the level of a personal attack.\""He's doing something he said he wouldn't do,"" she said.\But Lee, in an interview at his downtown law office last week, said he believed Boseman's recent struggles with foreclosures, including the public auction of her house near Figure Eight Island for more than $1.3 million, and late payment of property taxes were ""fair for the public to know.""\In recent months, Boseman faced considerable public scrutiny after several properties she owned in New Hanover and Pender counties faced foreclosure. She was also late paying taxes on certain properties. \""It goes back to public trust,"" Lee said.\Boseman called the ad ""despicable.""\The gloves apparently have come off in what had, until recently, been a relatively subdued campaign for New Hanover County's state Senate seat. Boseman, a 42-year-old attorney, is vying for her third, two-year term in the 50-member Senate.\Lee, who turns 40 in late November, ran unsuccessfully for New Hanover County Board of Education in 2004 and hopes to win his first elected position just more than a week from now.\Boseman also was criticized recently in an editorial in Wilmington's African-American newspaper, The Wilmington Journal, which accused her of a ""vile disregard for our issues and our people."" The Star-News' editorial board endorsed Boseman in Friday's newspaper.\Earlier in the campaign, Lee's ads went after Boseman for what he considers wasteful, pork-barrel spending in Raleigh, including $2.9 million for a polar bear exhibit at the North Carolina Zoo and $400,000 for the Sparta Teapot Museum, which some officials in the western part of the state see as an important economic development project. \Lee said he isn't against cultural projects but that the state first needs to focus on ""basic government functions,"" including education, transportation and public safety.\Boseman said the museum and other projects were investments in economic development in other parts of the state approved as part of state budgets, which also included money for the N.C. State Ports Authority, the University of North Carolina Wilmington and film industry incentives.\""The budget's a compromise,"" Boseman said. ""There's always going to be things in the budget I don't like. I'm not going to criticize other area's economic development projects.""\Lee said each project should stand on its own merit and that he would speak out against projects he believed were frivolous. Boseman's campaign questioned whether Lee would be able to radically change the way budget and legislative processes work in Raleigh.\Boseman's campaign, on the other hand, has focused on her accomplishments during four years in Raleigh, including her support of $90 million in state funding for the N.C. State Ports Authority. She also supported funding for UNCW, including $4.3 million for an oyster research hatchery . \Boseman greeted voters one morning last week in the parking lot of an early voting site at New Hanover County's Northeast Branch Library on Military Cutoff Road. Within minutes, a woman approached her to express concern about the Titan Cement plant proposed for Castle Hayne. She told Boseman she planned to vote for her because the senator is against the plant and the $4.2 million in incentives offered to the company by the New Hanover County commissioners.\""I will introduce legislation to stop polluting industries from locating within a few miles of a school or conservation area and stop Titan's project in its tracks,"" Boseman has said.\Lee says he generally opposes incentives but that he believes the Titan incentives were appropriate if the company can operate safely in New Hanover County and if the company would have gone elsewhere without the incentives. Lee hasn't taken a position either way about Titan, saying he can't support or oppose the cement plant until after the environmental review process is complete and solid research is available. \As Boseman stood outside the library, a man who had just voted said he was employed by the film industry and thanked the senator for her support of the state's film incentives program. While Boseman supports increased incentives, Lee wants to see evidence that the financial impact of the film industry is worth the cost of the incentives. \While the latest poll from the Civitas Institute shows Boseman with a double-digit lead, the N.C. Republican Party considers the District 9 Senate race one of several statewide where a Republican could oust an incumbent Democrat.\Lee said the race is about ""honesty, integrity, transparency and accessibility.""\Lee said he learned early in life from his father that integrity and your good name are the two most important assets to maintain. As for his opponent, Lee said voters can make their own judgments about Boseman and her financial and personal issues. Her messy split-up with a former domestic partner and subsequent child custody dispute the couple has a young son together revealed that Boseman had smoked marijuana in the past. \Lee said he has been pressured by supporters within the Republican Party to air Boseman's family issues, but he has resisted. \""My opinions don't lend anything to her personal circumstances,"" Lee said. ""They are what they are. You don't have to beat somebody down to get your policy differences across. We're very different people.""\Tom Keating, Boseman's campaign manager, said the foreclosures and late taxes were a result of the custody battle. He reiterated that the Boseman campaign believes the recent ad about her foreclosures and late tax payments is a personal attack.\""It sounds like he's trying to justify what personal attacks he's going to make"" after he said he wouldn't make them, Keating said.\Campaign finance reports are due early this week for state candidates, and they are expected to show significant dollars have been spent on this race.\As of June 30, Boseman had raised more than $121,000, with Lee far behind at about $19,000. But Lee said last week he had raised and spent about $200,000 on this campaign and that he expected Boseman would outspend him by a ratio of 4:1. Boseman's campaign had no comment on how much she's spent defending her seat.\Patrick Gannon: 343-2328\patrick.gannon@starnewsonline.com\Listen to the candidates debate the issues\Candidate Introductions\ABC Boards\Film Industry Incentives\Corruption in Raleigh\Gas Prices\Historic Preservation\Immigrants and Education\Lottery\Medical Malpractice\Mental Health Care\Taxes\Titan America\Julia Boseman \Date of birth: 08/20/1966\Political affiliation: Democrat\Family: Son, Jacob\Education: Law, North Carolina Central University, 1992.

Julia Boseman didn't pay taxes on her ""million dollar mansion"" and that she is ""too irresponsible to trust in Raleigh.""\While the Republican Lee has said he planned to focus only on the issues in his campaign, Boseman said she believes the ad stoops to the level of a personal attack.\""He's doing something he said he wouldn't do,"" she said.\But Lee, in an interview at his downtown law office last week, said he believed Boseman's recent struggles with foreclosures, including the public auction of her house near Figure Eight Island for more than $1.3 million, and late payment of property taxes were ""fair for the public to know.""\In recent months, Boseman faced considerable public scrutiny after several properties she owned in New Hanover and Pender counties faced foreclosure. She was also late paying taxes on certain properties. \""It goes back to public trust,"" Lee said.\Boseman called the ad ""despicable.""\The gloves apparently have come off in what had, until recently, been a relatively subdued campaign for New Hanover County's state Senate seat. Boseman, a 42-year-old attorney, is vying for her third, two-year term in the 50-member Senate.\Lee, who turns 40 in late November, ran unsuccessfully for New Hanover County Board of Education in 2004 and hopes to win his first elected position just more than a week from now.\Boseman also was criticized recently in an editorial in Wilmington's African-American newspaper, The Wilmington Journal, which accused her of a ""vile disregard for our issues and our people."" The Star-News' editorial board endorsed Boseman in Friday's newspaper.\Earlier in the campaign, Lee's ads went after Boseman for what he considers wasteful, pork-barrel spending in Raleigh, including $2.9 million for a polar bear exhibit at the North Carolina Zoo and $400,000 for the Sparta Teapot Museum, which some officials in the western part of the state see as an important economic development project. \Lee said he isn't against cultural projects but that the state first needs to focus on ""basic government functions,"" including education, transportation and public safety.\Boseman said the museum and other projects were investments in economic development in other parts of the state approved as part of state budgets, which also included money for the N.C. State Ports Authority, the University of North Carolina Wilmington and film industry incentives.\""The budget's a compromise,"" Boseman said. ""There's always going to be things in the budget I don't like. I'm not going to criticize other area's economic development projects.""\Lee said each project should stand on its own merit and that he would speak out against projects he believed were frivolous. Boseman's campaign questioned whether Lee would be able to radically change the way budget and legislative processes work in Raleigh.\Boseman's campaign, on the other hand, has focused on her accomplishments during four years in Raleigh, including her support of $90 million in state funding for the N.C. State Ports Authority. She also supported funding for UNCW, including $4.3 million for an oyster research hatchery . \Boseman greeted voters one morning last week in the parking lot of an early voting site at New Hanover County's Northeast Branch Library on Military Cutoff Road. Within minutes, a woman approached her to express concern about the Titan Cement plant proposed for Castle Hayne. She told Boseman she planned to vote for her because the senator is against the plant and the $4.2 million in incentives offered to the company by the New Hanover County commissioners.\""I will introduce legislation to stop polluting industries from locating within a few miles of a school or conservation area and stop Titan's project in its tracks,"" Boseman has said.\Lee says he generally opposes incentives but that he believes the Titan incentives were appropriate if the company can operate safely in New Hanover County and if the company would have gone elsewhere without the incentives. Lee hasn't taken a position either way about Titan, saying he can't support or oppose the cement plant until after the environmental review process is complete and solid research is available. \As Boseman stood outside the library, a man who had just voted said he was employed by the film industry and thanked the senator for her support of the state's film incentives program. While Boseman supports increased incentives, Lee wants to see evidence that the financial impact of the film industry is worth the cost of the incentives. \While the latest poll from the Civitas Institute shows Boseman with a double-digit lead, the N.C. Republican Party considers the District 9 Senate race one of several statewide where a Republican could oust an incumbent Democrat.\Lee said the race is about ""honesty, integrity, transparency and accessibility.""\Lee said he learned early in life from his father that integrity and your good name are the two most important assets to maintain. As for his opponent, Lee said voters can make their own judgments about Boseman and her financial and personal issues. Her messy split-up with a former domestic partner and subsequent child custody dispute the couple has a young son together revealed that Boseman had smoked marijuana in the past. \Lee said he has been pressured by supporters within the Republican Party to air Boseman's family issues, but he has resisted. \""My opinions don't lend anything to her personal circumstances,"" Lee said. ""They are what they are. You don't have to beat somebody down to get your policy differences across. We're very different people.""\Tom Keating, Boseman's campaign manager, said the foreclosures and late taxes were a result of the custody battle.

155,"| jboyle@citizen-times.com\This election year, it's all about jobs and the economy.\Sure, voters also say they're concerned about educational funding, the deficit, immigration, health care, gas prices, annexation, abortion, gay marriage, overregulation, high taxation, incivility in politics and maybe just throwing all the rascals out of office.\Last week, Citizen-Times reporters hit the streets to conduct an informal survey of voters, buttonholing 62 people to ask them what their top issues were this election season.\All those aforementioned concerns -- and plenty more -- surfaced.\But at the local, state and national levels, politicians better have jobs and the economy on their radar. Just about every conversation about the top issues this election season started with the most-used four-letter word in the language these days.\""Jobs,"" said Michael Bryan, a 55-year-old Arden resident and part-time teacher at Haywood Community College. ""The economy. It's very slow to improve. There are very little jobs out there, very little good paying jobs, decent-paying jobs.""\Christine Patterson, 27, has plenty of jobs, just not all in her field. A clerk at the Cigarette Depot in Candler and a part-time kindergarten teacher at Sand Hill-Venable Elementary School, she has a degree in education. Sand Hill is her third school in six years because of cuts.\""I've seen what happens when you have a lack of jobs,"" she said.\Her mother is paying for her health insurance, something she could not afford to do on her own.\The polling group Rasmussen Reports surveyed 1,000 likely voters in December and 80 percent regarded economic issues as ""very important"" in terms of how they'll vote in the next congressional election.\""That's down slightly from 84 percent in October but generally consistent with regular tracking since January 2008,"" Rasmussen noted.\While the Great Recession technically ended in June 2009, plenty of Americans don't see the evidence. Even college professors still refer to the recession in the present tense.\""There's still nearly double digit unemployment in North Carolina and nationally, and I think the recession has lasted longer than most people have hoped for,"" said Gibbs Knotts, a political science professor at Western Carolina University.\""The party in power, a lot of times it catches the blame,"" Knotts said. ""Certainly, national policies are set by the legislative and executive branches, but Congress is an institution of 535 people. So that means the president is going to be able to ride the good economic times with a lot of support, but he's going to suffer in bad economic times.""\In the latest unemployment report, for the month of December, 59 of North Carolina's 100 counties reported a rate of 10 percent or higher, and the statewide average was 9.8 percent.\Graham County, in far Western North Carolina, had the worst rate in the state at 17.5 percent, while Swain County wasn't far behind, at 15.7 percent.\The unemployment rate for North Carolina hovered at 9.9 percent in December, compared with 8.5 percent nationwide.\The Asheville-Buncombe region is probably luckier than most, with a 7.5-percent rate and a couple of high-profile job announcements in the last year, including the Linamar automotive parts plant that will invest $125 million and bring 400 jobs to the old Volvo Construction plant in South Asheville.\In northern Henderson County, the Sierra Nevada beer company recently announced it will build a brewery, employing about 175 people, full and part time.\""There are pockets of manufacturers that are doing well and our call centers,"" said Rick Elingburg, manager of the Asheville office of the N.C. Employment Security Commission. ""The hospitality industry, quite honestly, has done pretty good, although it's a slow time of year now.""\On the slow side, construction remains moribund, at best, and retail is sluggish.\The region is in for a long, slow climb back from the Great Recession, said Tom Tveidt, an economist and the founder of Syneva Economics in Haywood County.\Another report from the state Employment Security Commission noted the Asheville area produced only 100 net new jobs for 2011.\""The overarching issue that keeps coming back up again and again and again is that there's so much debt,"" Tveidt said. ""You see it nationally, and with individuals and in housing, and that trickles down in consumer spending and business spending. Out on the horizon, I don't see anything that's uniformly holding everybody back that's going to change. That debt is going to take a long time.""\The national debt has sailed past $15 trillion, and the total of all consumer debt in America totaled $11.66 trillion in the third quarter of 2011 according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's ""Quarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit.""\In 2010, the U.S. Census Bureau reported that Americans have more than $886 billion in credit card debt alone, or about $5,100 per credit card holder.\Politicians have some tools at their disposal to help with job creation -- incentives for business, adjustments to regulations, monetary policy decisions -- but they probably get too much credit when the economy is going well and too much blame when it's sluggish, Tveidt said.\""I sort of look at politicians as they can change the environment a little to make it better for jobs to grow, but it's hard for me to think of anything they can do in the real short term to just turn things around,"" Tveidt said. ""By default, they've sort of taken that on themselves, because that's what people want to hear. Nobody is going to say, 'I can't do anything about it.'""\The Congressional Budget Office expects the economy to continue a slow recovery, with the real gross domestic product growing by 2 percent this year and 1.1 percent next year, according to a press release. The CBO expects economic activity ""to quicken after 2013 but to remain below the economy's potential until 2018.""\The unemployment rate nationally will remain above 8 percent this year and next, according to the CBO, largely because of continuing weakness in demand for goods and services.\""As economic growth picks up after 2013, the unemployment rate will gradually decline to around 7 percent by the end of 2015, before dropping to near 5.5 percent by the end of 2017,"" the office stated.\Clearly, the voting public does not want to wait that long, and politicians better put jobs front and center this year.\""There's really only one issue and that's the economy,"" said Mills River resident Dan McCormick, a 62-year-old teacher. ""We have to find ways to put people back to work. I see a lot of young people who don't have the promise of a future with employment.""\Stop the bickering\Gloria and David Johnson, who have owned their home on Burton Street in West Asheville since 1973, have a lot on their minds this election year, and in that, they reflect the larger population.\The future of Social Security and health care legislation for themselves, and the economic situation for their three children and seven grandchildren, are some of the issues that trouble the couple, both registered Democrats.\But the Johnsons, married 42 years, say what troubles them most is the vitriol and gridlock in Washington that seems to be a concrete barrier to any positive change for everyday Americans. That topic ranked third with local voters when asked what the most important national issues are this year.\""I hate this bickering -- why can't they just help each other instead of (talking negatively) about each other?"" said Gloria Johnson, 62. ""The president has done everything he can do, but (Congress) won't let him do anything.""\David Johnson, 67, said he and his wife ""are very much in love with this country ... but even the Bible talks about homes divided, and there is so much hatred today,"" including a hint of racism coming from some candidates, he said.\""It really bothers me, because I think there are too many folks who would rather see the country fail because of who's at the top, and I get the feeling that so many people aren't as in love with this country as they say they are,"" he said.\The lack of civility got a lot of concern in the informal survey, with eight people mentioning it specifically. It lagged behind only jobs, the deficit and health care as a top national issue for voters.\An assistant pastor who is retired from the military and from Arvin Meritor, Johnson said he had respect for some of the GOP candidates of the past, including John McCain, whom he said he considered a hero because of his military service.\Here are the other top national issues voters identified:\The national debt\It's past $15 trillion and keeps climbing. Locals who mentioned this uniformly want the country to get a handle on this.\""Our country just can't sustain it. It's like watching the fall of the Roman Empire,"" said Leicester resident Jerry Shelton, 69. ""They call them entitlement programs, but I don't see where anybody's entitled to anything from the government. A lot of people are just riding the system.""\Health care\Not surprisingly, Democrats want to keep the health care reforms President Barack Obama championed and Republicans want them overturned. Opinions varied among unaffiliated voters.\""This isn't a country where so many people should not be able to get the care they need,"" said Salim Lakhani, manager of a convenience store in West Asheville who declined to identify his political party. ""If you start with nothing here, you can't work your way up anymore because if you get sick, you'll lose everything, and if you have nothing you can't afford insurance. It's a very unfair system.""\But Emily Singleton, 32, a stay-at-home mom in Arden, is concerned the country is ""moving more to socialized medicine.\""We don't feel that it's the government's place to be in control of that,"" she said. ""I think as working individuals we should be able to choose and pay for our medical and our health care.""\Wars: Staying out of Iraq, getting out of Afghanistan, avoiding conflict with Iran.\Gas prices: Several voters said the state gas tax is too high, and prices are too high in general, particularly in the mountains compared to other areas.\Immigration: Respondents who mentioned this wanted to see the border tightened and rules enforced more.\Education: Across political affiliation, voters stressed the importance of top-notch education and adequate funding.\Several voters mentioned environmental concerns, a fairer tax code and concerns about energy and hydraulic fracking to extract natural gas tied.\Top local issues\As in the national category, jobs and the economy topped the list of local issues, with 17 mentions. Residents want leaders to do whatever they can to keep and attract good-paying jobs.\Fourteen people mentioned education, many of them listing it as a top local and national issue. Nearly all were concerned about recent cuts in educational spending and our system keeping pace with other states and countries.\Patrick Gladys, a 40-year-old teacher, zeroed in on teacher pay.\""We are home to world-class universities, the Research Triangle Park and have been pioneers in education throughout history,"" he said. ""Currently, we are headed toward the bottom of the 50 states in teacher pay, spending on a per-pupil basis, and we are discouraging highly qualified young people from entering this profession.""\Growth/development/planning\In a nutshell, residents aren't opposed to growth, they just want it done carefully and the mountains protected.\""I don't want to see this beautiful place be overdeveloped,"" said Riceville resident John Jordan, a 53-year-old physician assistant.\Transportation\Several people mentioned a more efficient road system, better bus service and concerns about the possibility of changing Charlotte Street from four lanes to three.\Pisgah View Apartments resident Iindia Pearson, 24, said city buses stop farther away than they used to and that the hours are very limited.\""The people making decisions about buses obviously aren't the people who ride them,"" Pearson said.\Taxes\Not surprisingly, voters feel overtaxed and want the burden reduced.\Water\Control of the Asheville water system has been in the news lately, and it's on voters' minds, too.\""He who controls the water controls the future of this area,"" said George Weaver, a retired attorney and city resident. ""I have reservations about putting it in the hands of this so-called third party.""\Annexation\Those who mentioned this issue seem pleased that the General Assembly enacted rules making it tougher for cities to annex.\""Cities have been too cavalier using involuntary annexation to take property to add to their tax base without any representation,"" said Robert Spillane, an Asheville retiree.\Staff writers Julie Ball, Mark Barrett, Barbara Blake, Casey Blake, Karen Chavez, Tyler Goode, Keith Jarrett, Tony Kiss, Clarke Morrison, Carol Motsinger, Dale Neal, Jon Ostendorff, Andrew Pearson and Sabian Warren contributed to this report.\ID_Code: B0-302050074"

That topic ranked third with local voters when asked what the most important national issues are this year.\""I hate this bickering -- why can't they just help each other instead of (talking negatively) about each other?"" said Gloria Johnson, 62. ""The president has done everything he can do, but (Congress) won't let him do anything.""\David Johnson, 67, said he and his wife ""are very much in love with this country ... but even the Bible talks about homes divided, and there is so much hatred today,"" including a hint of racism coming from some candidates, he said.\""It really bothers me, because I think there are too many folks who would rather see the country fail because of who's at the top, and I get the feeling that so many people aren't as in love with this country as they say they are,"" he said.\The lack of civility got a lot of concern in the informal survey, with eight people mentioning it specifically. It lagged behind only jobs, the deficit and health care as a top national issue for voters.\An assistant pastor who is retired from the military and from Arvin Meritor, Johnson said he had respect for some of the GOP candidates of the past, including John McCain, whom he said he considered a hero because of his military service.\Here are the other top national issues voters identified:\The national debt\It's past $15 trillion and keeps climbing. Locals who mentioned this uniformly want the country to get a handle on this.\""Our country just can't sustain it. It's like watching the fall of the Roman Empire,"" said Leicester resident Jerry Shelton, 69. ""They call them entitlement programs, but I don't see where anybody's entitled to anything from the government. A lot of people are just riding the system.""\Health care\Not surprisingly, Democrats want to keep the health care reforms President Barack Obama championed and Republicans want them overturned. Opinions varied among unaffiliated voters.\""This isn't a country where so many people should not be able to get the care they need,"" said Salim Lakhani, manager of a convenience store in West Asheville who declined to identify his political party. ""If you start with nothing here, you can't work your way up anymore because if you get sick, you'll lose everything, and if you have nothing you can't afford insurance. It's a very unfair system.""\But Emily Singleton, 32, a stay-at-home mom in Arden, is concerned the country is ""moving more to socialized medicine.\""We don't feel that it's the government's place to be in control of that,"" she said. ""I think as working individuals we should be able to choose and pay for our medical and our health care.""\Wars: Staying out of Iraq, getting out of Afghanistan, avoiding conflict with Iran.\Gas prices: Several voters said the state gas tax is too high, and prices are too high in general, particularly in the mountains compared to other areas.\Immigration: Respondents who mentioned this wanted to see the border tightened and rules enforced more.\Education: Across political affiliation, voters stressed the importance of top-notch education and adequate funding.\Several voters mentioned environmental concerns, a fairer tax code and concerns about energy and hydraulic fracking to extract natural gas tied.\Top local issues\As in the national category, jobs and the economy topped the list of local issues, with 17 mentions. Residents want leaders to do whatever they can to keep and attract good-paying jobs.\Fourteen people mentioned education, many of them listing it as a top local and national issue. Nearly all were concerned about recent cuts in educational spending and our system keeping pace with other states and countries.\Patrick Gladys, a 40-year-old teacher, zeroed in on teacher pay.\""We are home to world-class universities, the Research Triangle Park and have been pioneers in education throughout history,"" he said. ""Currently, we are headed toward the bottom of the 50 states in teacher pay, spending on a per-pupil basis, and we are discouraging highly qualified young people from entering this profession.""\Growth/development/planning\In a nutshell, residents aren't opposed to growth, they just want it done carefully and the mountains protected.\""I don't want to see this beautiful place be overdeveloped,"" said Riceville resident John Jordan, a 53-year-old physician assistant.\Transportation\Several people mentioned a more efficient road system, better bus service and concerns about the possibility of changing Charlotte Street from four lanes to three.\Pisgah View Apartments resident Iindia Pearson, 24, said city buses stop farther away than they used to and that the hours are very limited.\""The people making decisions about buses obviously aren't the people who ride them,"" Pearson said.\Taxes\Not surprisingly, voters feel overtaxed and want the burden reduced.\Water\Control of the Asheville water system has been in the news lately, and it's on voters' minds, too.\""He who controls the water controls the future of this area,"" said George Weaver, a retired attorney and city resident. ""I have reservations about putting it in the hands of this so-called third party.""\Annexation\Those who mentioned this issue seem pleased that the General Assembly enacted rules making it tougher for cities to annex.\""Cities have been too cavalier using involuntary annexation to take property to add to their tax base without any representation,"" said Robert Spillane, an Asheville retiree.\Staff writers Julie Ball, Mark Barrett, Barbara Blake, Casey Blake, Karen Chavez, Tyler Goode, Keith Jarrett, Tony Kiss, Clarke Morrison, Carol Motsinger, Dale Neal, Jon Ostendorff, Andrew Pearson and Sabian Warren contributed to this report."

Julia Boseman didn't pay taxes on her ""million dollar mansion"" and that she is ""too irresponsible to trust in Raleigh.""\While the Republican Lee has said he planned to focus only on the issues in his campaign, Boseman said she believes the ad stoops to the level of a personal attack.\""He's doing something he said he wouldn't do,"" she said.\But Lee, in an interview at his downtown law office last week, said he believed Boseman's recent struggles with foreclosures, including the public auction of her house near Figure Eight Island for more than $1.3 million, and late payment of property taxes were ""fair for the public to know.""\In recent months, Boseman faced considerable public scrutiny after several properties she owned in New Hanover and Pender counties faced foreclosure. She was also late paying taxes on certain properties. \""It goes back to public trust,"" Lee said.\Boseman called the ad ""despicable.""\The gloves apparently have come off in what had, until recently, been a relatively subdued campaign for New Hanover County's state Senate seat. Boseman, a 42-year-old attorney, is vying for her third, two-year term in the 50-member Senate.\Lee, who turns 40 in late November, ran unsuccessfully for New Hanover County Board of Education in 2004 and hopes to win his first elected position just more than a week from now.\Boseman also was criticized recently in an editorial in Wilmington's African-American newspaper, The Wilmington Journal, which accused her of a ""vile disregard for our issues and our people."" The Star-News' editorial board endorsed Boseman in Friday's newspaper.\Earlier in the campaign, Lee's ads went after Boseman for what he considers wasteful, pork-barrel spending in Raleigh, including $2.9 million for a polar bear exhibit at the North Carolina Zoo and $400,000 for the Sparta Teapot Museum, which some officials in the western part of the state see as an important economic development project. \Lee said he isn't against cultural projects but that the state first needs to focus on ""basic government functions,"" including education, transportation and public safety.\Boseman said the museum and other projects were investments in economic development in other parts of the state approved as part of state budgets, which also included money for the N.C. State Ports Authority, the University of North Carolina Wilmington and film industry incentives.\""The budget's a compromise,"" Boseman said. ""There's always going to be things in the budget I don't like. I'm not going to criticize other area's economic development projects.""\Lee said each project should stand on its own merit and that he would speak out against projects he believed were frivolous. Boseman's campaign questioned whether Lee would be able to radically change the way budget and legislative processes work in Raleigh.\Boseman's campaign, on the other hand, has focused on her accomplishments during four years in Raleigh, including her support of $90 million in state funding for the N.C. State Ports Authority. She also supported funding for UNCW, including $4.3 million for an oyster research hatchery . \Boseman greeted voters one morning last week in the parking lot of an early voting site at New Hanover County's Northeast Branch Library on Military Cutoff Road. Within minutes, a woman approached her to express concern about the Titan Cement plant proposed for Castle Hayne. She told Boseman she planned to vote for her because the senator is against the plant and the $4.2 million in incentives offered to the company by the New Hanover County commissioners.\""I will introduce legislation to stop polluting industries from locating within a few miles of a school or conservation area and stop Titan's project in its tracks,"" Boseman has said.\Lee says he generally opposes incentives but that he believes the Titan incentives were appropriate if the company can operate safely in New Hanover County and if the company would have gone elsewhere without the incentives. Lee hasn't taken a position either way about Titan, saying he can't support or oppose the cement plant until after the environmental review process is complete and solid research is available. \As Boseman stood outside the library, a man who had just voted said he was employed by the film industry and thanked the senator for her support of the state's film incentives program. While Boseman supports increased incentives, Lee wants to see evidence that the financial impact of the film industry is worth the cost of the incentives. \While the latest poll from the Civitas Institute shows Boseman with a double-digit lead, the N.C. Republican Party considers the District 9 Senate race one of several statewide where a Republican could oust an incumbent Democrat.\Lee said the race is about ""honesty, integrity, transparency and accessibility.""\Lee said he learned early in life from his father that integrity and your good name are the two most important assets to maintain. As for his opponent, Lee said voters can make their own judgments about Boseman and her financial and personal issues. Her messy split-up with a former domestic partner and subsequent child custody dispute the couple has a young son together revealed that Boseman had smoked marijuana in the past. \Lee said he has been pressured by supporters within the Republican Party to air Boseman's family issues, but he has resisted. \""My opinions don't lend anything to her personal circumstances,"" Lee said. ""They are what they are. You don't have to beat somebody down to get your policy differences across. We're very different people.""\Tom Keating, Boseman's campaign manager, said the foreclosures and late taxes were a result of the custody battle. He reiterated that the Boseman campaign believes the recent ad about her foreclosures and late tax payments is a personal attack.\""It sounds like he's trying to justify what personal attacks he's going to make"" after he said he wouldn't make them, Keating said.\Campaign finance reports are due early this week for state candidates, and they are expected to show significant dollars have been spent on this race.\As of June 30, Boseman had raised more than $121,000, with Lee far behind at about $19,000. But Lee said last week he had raised and spent about $200,000 on this campaign and that he expected Boseman would outspend him by a ratio of 4:1. Boseman's campaign had no comment on how much she's spent defending her seat.\Patrick Gannon: 343-2328\patrick.gannon@starnewsonline.com\More than $1 million invested in state Senate race\ \By Patrick GannonStaff Writer\The campaign of state Sen. Julia Boseman, D-New Hanover, has raised $846,000 in her bid for a third term, including more than $537,000 from state Democratic Party committees.\According to campaign finance reports filed at the State Board of Elections this week, Boseman had out-raised Republican challenger Michael Lee by more than a 3-1 ratio. Lee has raised about $255,000, including $70,600 from the state Republican Party. Lee also received $4,000 from the New Hanover County GOP.\The reports cover campaign activity through mid-October, as well as large contributions since then.\Boseman and Lee, both Wilmington attorneys, are vying for New Hanover County's seat in the N.C. Senate. Combined, they've raised more than $1.1 million for the race and spent most of it. The numbers are sure to grow as campaign cash continues to flow during the last few days before Tuesday's election.\The fact that both candidates had received considerable cash from their respective state parties shows that Senate District 9 is competitive and highly sought after by the Republicans and Democrats at the state level.\Bob Hall, executive director of Democracy North Carolina, a Durham-based nonpartisan organization seeking election reform, said Boseman's financial backing by the state party is ""a lot of money for sure,"" but other candidates in sharply contested races have received similar amounts. \""It's a measure of commitment that they really want her,"" Hall said. \Hall said he wasn't surprised by the numbers.\""It's just where we are in the arms race of political spending,"" he said. ""It unfortunately keeps heading up and up. What's at stake is who gets to be the majority party in the legislature and control the agenda in the legislature.""\Democrats control the Senate and House in North Carolina.\Tom Keating, Boseman's campaign manager, said both parties ""compete pretty fiercely"" for the contested Senate seats. The spending is consistent with spending in other swing districts, he said.\""If you care about what you're doing and want to make a difference, you have to run to win,"" Keating said.\Receiving financial help from the state party is nothing new for Boseman, who has received more than $1.2 million from Democratic Party committees in her three Senate runs. In 2006, she received more than $413,000 from the committees. In 2004, she received $277,000. \Lee pointed out that the majority of Boseman's money came from outside New Hanover County, including the funding from the state Democrats and about $78,000 from political action committees, or PACs.\""It's not from individuals in the county,"" Lee said.\He said the outside money allows Boseman to send mass mailings and buy television and radio spots, including some he claims are false. One Boseman ad, for example, claims that Lee is against the N.C. Education Lottery. Lee said he supports the lottery but doesn't believe it has the positive affect on education funding that some had hoped.\""Because I don't have the money, it's hard to get the truth out,"" he said.\Keating, Boseman's campaign manager, said Boseman is proud of her ""broad cross-section of support,"" including money from Republicans and Democrats in New Hanover County.\""(Lee) also received a substantial amount of money from his (state) party as well,"" Keating said.\The Boseman/Lee race is by far the most expensive among Southeastern North Carolina legislative races, according to campaign finance reports. But campaign cash is also flowing in the Senate District 8 race between incumbent Sen. R.C. Soles Jr., a Democrat, and challenger Bettie Fennell, a Republican. The district includes Columbus, Brunswick and Pender counties.\Soles, who has raised about $404,000, has out-raised Fennell by about 3-1. Fennell's campaign had brought in about $151,000 through Oct. 18.\Soles and Fennell have attacked each other relentlessly in television ads.\Patrick Gannon: 343-2328\patrick.gannon@starnewsonline.com"

159,"Micro hydropower, with access to the grid, would give WNC a green energy boost\A\A recent article in the Asheville Citizen-Times (NC GreenPower fuels renewable energy work, Nov. 28) did a good job of describing the program -- from the consumer perspective. There were, however, some important aspects of NC GreenPower that were not explained.\First, there was one omission in its description of the sources of green power that are part of the residential mass-market program. The source of green power not included in the article is micro hydropower.\When most people think of hydropower the first thing that comes to mind is large dams flooding whole valleys. While this large hydro source of power is free of the emissions that come from oil/gas/coal power production, it has its own environmental issues; namely ecosystem destruction, water flow conflicts and native fish habitat disruption. With the growing awareness of the environmental costs of this form of electricity production a new dam-building spree isn't likely.\That does not mean that new power cannot come from something we have in abundance in the mountain regions: water flowing downhill. NC GreenPower has acknowledged this in their acceptance, with appropriate certifications, of micro/small hydropower into the GreenPower program.\Every region of this country has a renewable power source that best fits their ecosystem; a source that will generate the most power at the least relative costs. The Southwest has lots of sun, the Dakotas and the coasts have consistent wind, and we have water flowing down mountains. That water can be utilized with a minimum impact on the environment. Micro hydropower systems are not based upon dams, but instead are ""run-of-the-river"" systems that don't require the whole stream or river flow (for a more detailed explanation of the workings of micro hydropower go to www.microhydropower.net).\The micro hydropower generators can be small and owned by individuals or groups of people who have flowing water on their property, but if distributed widely and connected to the transmission and distribution grid the aggregate power generated by micro hydropower has the potential to be quite significant.\This leads to the issue of existing barriers to entry for small renewable power producers (of all types) who wish to supply power to the grid. The current North Carolina interconnection standards are extremely unwieldy and prohibitive for small green power producers because they place most of the decision-making regarding the process and connection fees in the hands of the individual utilities (a classic David and Goliath scenario).\It is expected that the utilities want to protect their investment in the electricity transmission and distribution system, but simplified interconnection standards for small producers do not threaten those investments, and 18 states have some form of these standards in place, most of them mirroring proposed national standards created by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) in cooperation with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).\Just as important is the need for net-metering in this state. Net-metering is simply the ability for someone with an on-site power source to stay connected to the grid with a single electricity meter that can record when the individual is taking power from the grid and when they are sending power to the grid by producing more electricity than they are using.\This produces a net measurement of their energy usage from the power grid over the course of a billing period.\I cannot stress enough how important net-metering is for the goal of increasing the percentage of power that comes from renewable sources. With net-metering and the ability to stay connected to the grid as an incentive, literally thousands of us could end up being renewable power producers in this state. Unfortunately, while 37 states have enacted net-metering rules and standards, North Carolina is not one of them.\Certain utilities in this state do not consider net-metering to be in their best (short-term) interests and have been successfully raising various technical and accounting objections to the net-metering proposals that continue to come before the state legislature and utility commission.\It is ironic that while North Carolina has the most extensive GreenPower program in the whole country, we do not have the simplified interconnection and net-metering standards to allow green power producers to take full advantage of the program, thereby satisfying the most basic of the NC GreenPower program's goals -- increasing the amount of renewable energy actually produced.\So, by all means join NC GreenPower and contribute to the program. It needs all of our support.\But if those contributions are going to maximize the production of those of us who want to supply green power to this program, we need simplified access to the grid and standards for net-metering. A little consumer pressure on the utilities and constituent pressure on our state representatives would be a big help as well.\Sid Cullipher is an environmental economist and political scientist with particular expertise in environmental policy mediation.

160,"Couple reap benefits of using solar power\Progress Energy buys back electricity in new program\MBARRETT@CITIZEN-TIMES.COM\BENT CREEK -- Ske and Kitty Boniske equipped the home they had built in 1993 with renewable energy features, mostly because of their desire to be kind to the environment.\But the systems, thanks in part to new state regulations, are making more and more dollars and cents these days, Ske Boniske says.\The Boniskes are the first homeowners in Progress Energy's western region to employ a ""net metering"" system that allows residential users to sell extra electricity back to the utility.\They and Progress Energy community relations manager Ken Maxwell showed off the system to reporters Thursday.\The roof of the Boniske home off Brevard Road holds photovoltaic cells that convert sunlight into electricity.\One of the two meters Progress Energy recently installed at the home measures the amount of electricity the home draws from the utility's system. The other measures the power generated by the cells that goes into the electrical grid.\The state Utilities Commission adopted an order last October requiring the state's three investor-owned electric utilities -- Progress Energy, Duke Power and Dominion North Carolina Power -- to buy electricity generated by renewable means from residential customers.\The Boniskes used to store the electricity generated at their home in batteries and were not connected to the electrical grid at all until June. Ske Boniske says he expects to roughly break even on electrical costs, getting about as much or a little more from Progress Energy in payments as the couple owes for the power it draws from the utility.\When the photovoltaic cells were installed 13 years ago, ""It wasn't economical at the time. It's what we wanted,"" he said.\But the cost of the cells has fallen, Boniske said, state government offers tax credits of 35 percent of the costs of such systems and the federal government gives another 30 percent in tax credits. A similar system might cost $20,000 before tax credits, he said.\""With the tax credits ... all of a sudden, anybody could do it"" with reasonable financial results, he said.\""People have been told by the coal, oil, nuclear and gas industry that renewable energy's going to be here someday,"" Ske Boniske said. ""It's here now.""\The owner of a typical home might, once the impact of tax credits are included, recoup the costs in payments from the utility over about 10 years, said David Wallace, program manager for the state energy office for the western region.\Optional trim begins\Maxwell said five other customers in Progress Energy's western region, which has 145,000 customers in Buncombe, Haywood, Mitchell and seven other Western North Carolina counties, are in the process of starting net metering.\""It's a fairly involved process at this point, but hopefully the more we do, there'll be ways to streamline and make the process easier,"" he said.\WEB EXTRA\Hear Ske Boniske talk about his interest in renewable energy at CITIZEN-TIMES.com.\MORE INFORMATION\Contact Progress Energy at (800) 452-2777 for information about net metering.\More information about solar and other types of renewable energy options for home and commercial users, including state programs, is available at the North Carolina Solar Center Web site: www.ncsc.ncsu.edu."
161,"(Solar)power\to the people\I\If you're paying triple-digit electric bills this summer to cool your house, consider the relationship Ske and Kitty Boniske have with Progress Energy. They're expecting to roughly break even, and maybe get paid for producing electricity.\The Boniskes are the first homeowners in Progress Energy's western region to employ a ""sell all net metering"" system that allows residential users to sell electricity to the power company. The couple equipped the home they built in 1993 in Bent Creek with a solar energy system that Ske Boniske helped design. Until recently, they weren't even tied into the electric grid. Their solar system provided all the energy for their household needs using a full array of appliances.\They readily acknowledge the cost of installing the system in 1993 outweighed the economic benefit of not having to pay power bills. They installed it because they didn't want to contribute to the environmental damage that results from air pollution generated by power plants.\New incentives\But new state regulations and tax credits are changing the energy landscape for homeowners who want to generate some or all of their own electricity.\With the ""sell all net metering"" system the Boniskes sell all the power they generate to Progress Energy and buy back the power they use. One meter measures the amount they sell and another measures the amount they use. The utility pays them fewer cents per kilowatt produced than it charges them per kilowatt used.\But in addition to the money paid by the utility, an independent nonprofit organization established to improve the state's environment will also pay them so many cents per kilowatt, meaning they will receive more for the power they generate than they will pay for the power they buy.\The nonprofit, NC GreenPower operates on voluntary contributions. Any customer of one of the state's power companies can contribute by choosing to buy blocks of ""green"" power. A contribution of $4 per month adds one block of 100 kilowatt-hours of green energy to North Carolina's power supply. The contributions are used to buy ""green"" energy from producers like the Boniskes.\NC GreenPower is a landmark initiative approved by the N.C. Utilities Commission. It is the first statewide green energy program in the nation supported by all the state's utilities. The contributions are collected by the utilities through monthly power bills, but Advanced Energy, an independent nonprofit corporation in Raleigh, administers the program.\The goal of NC GreenPower is to supplement the state's existing power supply with electricity generated from renewable resources like the sun, wind and organic matter.\NC GreenPower combined with tax initiatives means the cost of building or retrofitting a home to produce green energy is no longer economically impractical. Income tax credits of 35 percent from the federal government and 30 percent from the state now go toward the installation of conservation and renewable energy features and equipment.\The upfront cost are daunting to many, but Ske Boniske points out that adding cost to a mortgage to build a green energy home, or to retrofit one, makes financial sense. The lower energy costs for the house will more than offset the additional amount of the mortgage.\The Boniskes plan to use any money they make from selling solar power to Progress Energy to contribute toward more blocks of green power. It's their hope that contributions will grow to the point that instead of building more power plants, the state's utilities will have to go looking for more sources of ""green"" energy. With the incentives now in place, there's reason to hope the Boniskes will be the first among many anxious to sign on as green power producers.\A new trend?\The owner of a typical home might, once the impact of tax credits are included, recoup the costs in payments from the utility over about 10 years, said David Wallace, program manager for the state energy office for the western region. If homeowners and businesses need an additional incentive, the rising cost of oil and natural gas and the near-certainty that those increases will translate to higher energy costs over time should be a serious consideration. Producing more green energy also means cleaner air and a healthier environment. And it means that over time, the United States will become less vulnerable to sharp price increases and shortages of the fossil fuel essential to meeting our energy needs at the present time.\Building and retrofitting homes to produce some or all of their own energy from renewable, environmentally friendly sources has always made sense from every other standpoint. Finally, it has become economically feasible."

I completely agree with Lower Neuse Riverkeeper Travis Graves' assessment of solar in North Carolina (column, Dec. 21 Sun Journal). It's clear to me that solar is the way to go as we work to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and to protect our environment. I'm glad to read that others have come to the same conclusion!
\
Star Power, a recent report released by Environment North Carolina, shows that our state will reach 20 percent solar by 2030 at only a fraction of its current rate of growth. However, that's only achievable if we continue the policies that have made North Carolina a hospitable place for solar development.
\
For example, North Carolina has some of the most generous solar tax credits in the country. While this has been instrumental in the growth of the solar industry, these tax credits are set to expire at the end of 2015.
\
We need to show our state legislature that the solar industry is wanted and needed by North Carolinians across the aisle and the state. Our government should be extending solar tax credits and creating more solar-friendly policies like net metering. Ultimately, we should commit to a goal of 20 percent solar by 2030!

In 2007, North Carolina became a leader in renewable energy development by becoming the first state in the Southeast to adopt a Renewable Portfolio Standard. North Carolina set the goal of acquiring 12.5 percent of our energy through renewable resources and increased efficiency by 2026, saving us money while providing new jobs and a cleaner environment. Now, 30 states have adopted such goals, including Virginia.
\
Unfortunately, some in the North Carolina General Assembly are moving to make our state one of the first states to reverse this progress.
\
By claiming that renewable power is more expensive than fossil fuel power, outside groups are pressuring North Carolina and other states to repeal clean energy standards. This claim is just not true. RTI International and La Capra Associates Inc. conducted a study showing that North Carolina consumers stand to gain more than $173 million in cost savings by 2026 as a result of the state's clean energy policies, including the RPS. That study also demonstrates that the RPS does not raise rates.
\
Thanks to clean energy industry investment, solar panel costs have dropped 80 percent in the past five years. Michigan regulators found that renewable energy often costs less than new coal-fired energy. That is money that can stay in the state, supporting our businesses and boosting our economy.
\
Since the passage of Renewable Portfolio Standards, North Carolina has become a leader in the renewable energy industry, with more than 1,400 people working in the solar industry and 2,000 employed by the wind energy industry. We are now sixth in the country for the number of homes powered by the sun.
\
Since 2007, $1.4 billion has been spent on project investment in the state, resulting in more than 21,000 job-years, and this type of economic investment is not limited to our state's large cities. Forty-seven of our 100 counties have seen $1 million-plus economic benefit from solar projects, many in our state's rural regions. Davidson, Person and Robeson Counties have experienced more than $100 million in renewable energy project investment over the past six years, and the nation's largest solar water heating system was built by a North Carolina Company, Asheville's FLS Energy, at a turkey plant in Robeson County. These are new investments in rural areas hard-hit by job losses and economic divestment.
\
Our Renewable Portfolio Standard provides long-range benefits for North Carolina. Thanks to our current RPS, our energy supply chain is becoming less vulnerable to inevitable fluctuations in petroleum prices. Through clean energy investment we avoid future cost uncertainties that happen when you are subject to future volatile prices from non-renewable energy sources. Investors like dealing with the known costs associated from renewable energy projects, and are able to plan projects they can afford. Much of the money spent can stay in North Carolina as an investment in jobs and infrastructure in our own energy supplies, rather than supporting the out-of-state coal and gas industry that currently supplies a majority of our power and who have little incentive to consider our state's best interest.
\
It is not just those in the clean-energy industry that support an RPS. Duke Energy supported the passage of the original 2007 renewable-energy law, and Jim Rogers, the company's CEO, has championed these provisions as well. Rogers recognizes that the current law has a provision that prevents utility companies from passing on rate increases to the consumer.
\
Unfortunately, outside groups are putting at risk all of the cost savings, job growth and in-state clean energy production. Through large campaign donations to our legislative leaders and legislation drafted by outsiders, these outside groups are working to dismantle RPS policies in North Carolina, and in 19 other states. If the proposed bills pass, they will dismantle our renewable energy policy standards and halt the economic benefits and energy independence we have gained. Keeping a strong renewable energy standard is good for North Carolina. We shouldn't let outside groups reverse the progress we have made.

164,"Renewable energy could pioneer a bright future for WNC\W\What's frustrating about the Buncombe County Commissioners' recent decision to approve a petroleum power plant is the lack of competition in North Carolina when it comes to megawatt-scale clean energy production. We're in the dark in that sense.\The Connecticut Clean Energy Fund's ""Project 100"" effort to develop 100 megawatts (MW) of renewable energy produced a bid from a fuel cell company, FuelCell Energy, to fulfill all 100 MW. Fuel cell power plants generate electricity electrochemically -- without combustion -- so they significantly reduce emissions. The first of these plants could be online by 2009, the same year the new Buncombe County petroleum combustion plant is scheduled to open.\Some environmental groups are apparently surprised that a $72 million Ultra Low Sulfur Oil (ULSO) power plant is on its way to the old Buncombe County landfill in Woodfin. This 130 MW plant represents our unmet clean energy planning here in North Carolina, and so the plant proposal is not surprising. For the sake of scale, the Progress Energy Vanderbilt substation on Rankin Avenue and its 32.2 MW of coal-fired electricity only powers up Central Asheville. However sophisticated, the Woodfin ULSO plant will use an estimated 2.5 million to 3.5 million gallons of the petroleum product annually.\We are likely to end up with the ULSO plant because North Carolina is very far behind in comparison to other state clean energy programs. What we can work toward now is turning off older, less efficient coal burning and nuclear plants, and reducing the number of new ones.\The WNC Regional Air Quality Agency is presently unable to verify the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) the Woodfin plant will produce and we will not have that data for several months. CO2 is the major greenhouse gas (GHG) contributor to global climate change. CO2 mostly comes from power plants and totally escapes EPA regulation. The truth is, communities have few alternatives to choose from here in North Carolina.\However initially expensive, cutting-edge alternatives do exist, like stationary fuel cells. It all begs questions and deeper answers.\Due to global climate change and dwindling conventional energy supplies, a more polluting centralized plant is now more expensive than a series of smaller user-site fuel cell plants; especially combined with other cleaner, more efficient systems like megawatt-scale solar fields, wind, microturbines and combined heat and power (CHP) units. Located at large energy user sites like hospitals, municipal buildings like jails and other 24/7 demand sites, this is a system of energy production known as distributed generation (DG). It's about cutting transmission waste as much as anything.\Fuel cell plants and other medium and large clean energy systems, ranging from 200 kilowattts to 30 MW with near zero emissions throughout WNC, provide a climate change technology alternative to just burning off fossil and bio fuels, and cover the intermittent solar and wind yields in our region and what batteries can't do. Other efforts closer to users, including efficiency measures, can all combine for a thought-out energy plan for our region; no doubt a model for North Carolina's future potential and well-being.\The good news is that a new report to the N.C. Utilities Commission refutes claims that invalidate cleaner alternatives to systems like the Woodfin petroleum plant. Unfortunately, not even 2 percent of our state supply is from renewables. However, we can achieve more through renewable portfolio standards (""Report: State could go more green,"" Raleigh News & Observer, Dec. 14, 2006). Sadly, solar was discounted as being ""too expensive.""\Fuel cells and other DG systems are barely recognized. It's unfortunate North Carolina decided to delay renewable portfolio standard (RPS) policy, as we lost momentum in an important area of competitive advantage and will be starting the energy modernization race late.\An example of the twists and turns of energy technicalities is NC GreenPower. NC GreenPower is not a modern clean energy fund as there are no equipment purchase subsidies, beyond our existing solar incentives.\With most NC GreenPower generation, much is lost in conventional energy combustion methods and transmission resistance. The Woodfin ULSO plant will suffer the same kind of transmission waste factor, whether petroleum is used, or, if available in quantity, biofuels.\We need policies establishing terms for true competition and robust energy modernization -- and to address climate change -- if North Carolina is expected to compete in the 21st century. We need a plan for at least 50 MW of clean 24/7 distributed generation for Buncombe County.\Manufacturing more of this equipment will be a boon for regions like ours. The seemingly divergent concepts of commerce and environment actually can come together for a greater and more reliable basis of energy production when all the modern options are viewed.\Grant Millin is president of Public Fuel Cell, Inc., a clean energy ideas and information organization dedicated to energy modernization. He lives in Asheville."
165,"Being pregnant with twins is stressful enough. But being pregnant with twins determined to enter the world three months early ups the ante just a tad. \""They weighed two pounds apiece when they were born,"" said Morganton resident Annie Campero, recalling the June 13 birth of her fraternal twins, Severina and Mario. ""They're my little miracle babies."" \As with many such babies born in Western North Carolina, Campero's twins spent the first few weeks of their lives in the neonatal intensive care unit of Mission St. Joseph's Health System. \Housed in a 50-year-old portion of Mission Hospital, the NICU is a busy place, to put it mildly. Designed for 35 bassinets, the unit sometimes accommodates 50 or more babies and their families. \""We really do have a very modern, state-of-the-art nursery in terms of the educational level of our staff and their compassion, as well as with the dealings with the patients and parents - and also in terms of equipment,"" said Dr. Drew Litzenberger, a neonatologist with the NICU. ""It's not an equipment or staff problem. It's really a bricks and mortar problem. We strictly don't have enough space for the number of babies we deal with, and that hinders the privacy and respect each baby and the parents need for this crisis time in their lives."" \That's where this year's annual Ducky Derby comes in. Proceeds from the fund-raising event on Saturday will go to construction of a new $$@$!11.7 million NICU at Mission Hospital. The NICU cares for 700 babies a year, with a total of 150 staffers. \While Campero is highly complimentary of NICU staff, she also noticed the tight quarters. \""It's a little scary - your babies are hooked up to those machines, and you see the other babies hooked up,"" she said. ""You didn't have much room, barely enough room to turn around."" \The new NICU will be more efficient and allow for much-needed expansion, as well as more privacy for families and the latest in construction technology. The Ducky Derby fund-raisers, begun in 1990, have raised $$@$!778,000 to date. \Litzenberger hopes this year's event goes a little smoother than last year's. \""Last year, the dam broke when they dropped the ducks from the crane, and the tidal wave breached the cement block lake,"" he said with a chuckle. ""Water was running down the parking lot, and all these ducks were hauling buns down the parking lot. I suspect they'll have a reinforced lake this year."" \No one minded getting their feet wet for a good cause, though. Many people who buy ducks realize that almost all of Western North Carolina's sick newborns rely on Mission's NICU. \Campero gave birth at Grace Hospital in Morganton, but the babies were immediately taken to Mission's NICU, which is designated by the state to care for the region's premature and ill newborns. She and her husband, Arturo, and their other two children, Arturo Jr., 4, and Stephanie Conley, 9, spent many days in the NICU, monitoring the progress of the twins. \Despite the extremely early birth, the babies thrived under the care of the NICU nurses and doctors. Success wasn't guaranteed at first - babies born that early often have severe problems, particularly with breathing. \""But I see God worked a miracle,"" Arturo Campero said. ""They call my babies a miracle."" \Both babies weigh more than six pounds and are healthy. They came home two months after being born - and the Campero household livened up considerably. \""Sometimes one starts crying and then the other one starts crying,"" Arturo said. ""Sometimes in the night I wake up and I have to feed them. Sometimes I feel like ... crazy."" \Annie says she's impressed with the progress the twins have made. \""They're rolling over, holding their heads up,"" she said. ""Sometimes they say premature babies are a little slower developing, but I don't think mine are going to be slow. They're doing wonderful. God just worked miracles in their lives."" \Call John Boyle at 232-5847, or e-mail at JBoyle@CITIZEN-TIMES.com \DUCKY DERBY \WHAT: The ninth Ducky Derby Dive, a fund-raiser to help build a new $$@$!11.7 million Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at Mission St. Joseph's Health System.
