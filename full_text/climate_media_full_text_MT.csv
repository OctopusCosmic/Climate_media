0,"HELENA - Montana's U.S. senators are preparing to dive in on another big national issue - climate change and energy legislation - but it appears they're facing a divided state electorate on the subject.\The issue is ""cap and trade"" legislation before the U.S. Senate, an approach that will cap and reduce greenhouse gases over time in the United States and increase the cost of fossil fuels, such as coal and oil.\Cap-and-trade bills also are designed to raise money that pays consumers, to offset higher energy costs, and helps fund renewable-power production. The goal is to push America toward an economy that produces more green energy and is less reliant on foreign oil.\Sens. Jon Tester and Max Baucus, both Democrats, say they generally support the idea of capping greenhouse gases, which are seen as a primary , cause of climate change. President Barack Obama is behind the idea, as well.\Tester and Baucus say Congress should act sooner rather than later on this thorny subject, not only because they believe climate change is harming the state but also because they don't want the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to trump Congress by creating EPA's own rules this year for regulating greenhouse gases.\""I don't think anybody wants EPA to be making all the rules;' Tester said in an interview last week. ""That's why I think Congress needs to act.""\Yet in Montana, opinion is far from settled on whether cap-and-trade - or any attempt to limit greenhouse gases - should go forward.\Many traditional business and industry lobbies are lining up against it, including the Montana Chamber of Commerce, National Federation of Independent Business, farm and ranch groups and the oil industry.\They say higher prices for fossil-based energy, like gasoline and coal-fired power, will harm those industries and their states' economies. They also question whether renewable power, like wind, solar and geothermal, can realistically replace oil, gas and coal.\""I haven't seen any credible models that say in the next couple of decades that we can replace fossil-fuel technology with green technology,"" said Jon Bennion, director of government affairs for the Montana Chamber of Commerce. ""We'd like to see both (types of energy) developed. I think that is where most Montanans are right now.""\On the other side is a broad coalition of conservation and environmental groups, as well as some businesses that believe boosting green energy and combating climate change help the state economy.\""We need a clean-energy bill to fix our economy, to address issues of national security (related to over reliance on foreign oil), and to address climate change, which if we don't solve is going to cost us far, far more in the long term,"" said Chuck Magraw, a Helena attorney representing the Natural Resources Defense Council.\Tom France, regional director for the National Wildlife Federation in Missoula, notes that cap-and-trade legislation has broad corporate support on the national level: ""They recognize that climate change is a threat not only to their corporations but to their families.""\Baucus, like many Democrats in the Senate, hasn't spelled out exactly what approach he'll support, although he says he wants to make sure it works for Montana business, including agriculture, while limiting greenhouse gas emissions.\Tester also is noncommittal on cap-and-trade, although he said he's intrigued by another approach called ""cap and dividend,"" which still limits greenhouse gases but rebates directly to the public most of the money raised by the sale of pollution permits.\Cap-and-dividend also eliminates Wall Street ""trading"" of pollution credits among various parties - another plus, as far as Tester is concerned.\""I'd rather approach it as a cap and revert (the money) back to the people, than turn it over to Wall Street,"" he said.\Yet regardless of how the greenhouse-gas cap is designed, some still say it's a bad idea, because of the cost to fossil-fuel users - or because they doubt the link between climate change and greenhouse gases.\Last week, the Montana Policy Institute, a Bozeman-based conservative think tank, released a study that said the higher energy prices and phase-down of fossil-fuel industries brought on by cap-and-trade legislation will hammer the state's economy.\The study predicted big drop-offs in coal production, oil production, industrial output, tax collections and jobs.\""I would like to see a true cost-benefit analysis of any proposals that are out there, rather than just saying, 'reducing greenhouse gas is worth any cost to jobs, to society, to our future,' "" said Carl Graham, president of the Institute.\John Youngberg, vice president of government affairs for the Montana Farm Bureau Federation, said the group's farm and ranch members are urging opposition to cap-and-trade because of the costs to agriculture from higher fuel prices and because many doubt the warnings about climate change.\""I'm not sure people are buying into (it) anymore,"" he said. ""All of a sudden, it starts to smell like this might be a scam, and a big one. They're starting to question if this is really happening.""\Yet there are farmers and ranchers who support cap-and-trade legislation, saying they're convinced that the global climate is changing, to the long-term detriment of agriculture and the environment.\""Springs and summers are coming earlier and are more intense,"" said Chuck Merja, a Great Falls-area grain farmer and former president of the Montana Grain Growers Association. ""I think climate change is real, and to ignore it, we do it at our peril....\""I think (fossil-fuel) energy costs are going to go up with or without cap-and-trade. We need to find ways to move us away from a petroleum-, fossil-fuel-dependent environment and to something else."""

The EPA's new ""Clean Power Rule"" imposes new limits on carbon emissions that would devastate our coal industry. As a result, these rules will increase energy costs, hamstring job creation and economic growth and reduce the amount of revenue available for Montana's infrastructure and schools. In the long run, this rule may even have the opposite impact of what is intended. It may be harmful to the environment. And by penalizing cost-efficient energy sources like coal, this rule favors renewable energy sources, creating disincentives for innovation in renewable technology.
\
Under the rule proposed by President Obama's EPA, our state is facing a federal mandate to cut carbon emissions by more than one-fifth from 2012 levels. These reductions would have a negligible impact on carbon emissions. Even the president's former-EPA administrator Lisa Jackson admitted that ""U.S. action alone will not impact world CO2 levels."" Another analysis concluded that the ""U.S. could shut down all coal-fired plant and global carbon emissions would only be reduced by less than 1 percent.""
\
However, the rule would have farreaching negative implications for Montana businesses and working families. More than 5,000 good-paying jobs with an annual payroll of $273 million would be at stake. The unemployment rate on the Crow Indian Reservation alone would ""skyrocket from 47 percent to 80 percent"" without coal revenue.
\
These new rules would require Montana to either join an expensive regional ""Cap and Trade"" Program, compel coal plants buy expensive retrofitting equipment, or force them to shut down. All of these options are bad. Each of them imposes new costs on energy producers which will be passed onto consumers as higher utility bills.
\
These rules threaten funding for Montana's infrastructure and needed programs. Montana's coal industry contributes over $100 million in tax revenue to the state's economy, with $35.5 million going towards infrastructure, $15.6 million for schools, and $3 million to libraries and parks.
\
Montana is home to one-third of all coal in America, with reserves that could meet America's energy demand for over 100 years. Currently, Montana's coal industry supplies over one-half of the state's electricity needs. Coal remains the most cost-effective and reliable option for electricity generation in the state, and is a key reason that Montana has the 14th lowest electricity prices in the nation.
\
The ramifications of the EPA regulations would not be restricted solely to jobs in Montana's energy sector. As the Montana Chamber of Commerce stated, ""higher energy input prices will also be a big hit to other industries, like agriculture and manufacturing that use a lot of electricity and fuel."" One analysis projects a 26 percent increase in energy prices directly attributable to these regulations. And higher energy costs mean increased prices for products and services.
\
Struggling Montana families will be the hardest hit by higher electricity bills. Lower income families spend an estimated average of 22 percent of their after-tax family budgets on energy. If the president's EPA regulations are approved, these families may be forced to choose between heating their homes and putting food on the table.
\
In the long run these regulations could have the opposite impact intended. Kenneth Green, author of Abundant Energy: The Fuel of Human Flourishing, says that encouraging prosperity and economic growth is the best way to ensure the development of clean environmental technology. ""The single best thing we could do to minimize energy's impact on the environment is to not only maximize our own economic growth but also help developing countries to increase theirs, letting them switch to every cleaner, less polluting forms of energy,"" writes Kenneth Green.
\
Gov. Bullock is currently developing a plan to adopt these new rules even before they are finalized by the EPA. The public is encouraged to weigh in with the governor immediately and has until Dec. 1 to submit comments to the EPA. While many are focused on November and then the holidays, let's not forget the many benefits we receive from our coal industry. And for the sake of our state's economic growth, good-paying jobs, revenue for infrastructure, and affordable clean energy, Gov. Bullock should oppose not adopt these wrongheaded bureaucratic rules.

3,"You are starting to build yourselves a new coal-fired power plant which most likely will prove to be technologically obsolete about the time construction is completed (if it ever is).\Wind power electricity already comes in well below your power plant's projected cost of production, as will certain other alternatives just getting started.\The federal protocol for dealing with climate change will require some kind of ""cap-and-trade"" procedure (similar to that already operating in California), by which those facilities that create polluting discharges will have to pay to offset their pollution.\With those two facts in mind, you have bad news for Highwood. Also, other factors add still more bad news. For example, efficiency improvements to homes and the building environment will reduce the amount of electricity that Montana will need in the coming years.\Paradoxically, the factors which are going to render Highwood its death blow are precisely the advances in energy strategy that Great Falls should be woking on right now. Consider just the replacement of incandescent light bulb with compact fluorescents. Nationwide that one change means dozens of new coal-fired power plants will not be needed.\Please Great Falls, wake yourselves up and kill Highwood while you still can.\? Robert T. Stevens Jr., Helena"
4,"A federal appeals court on Friday tossed out Bush administration rules for controlling mercury emissions from power plants, saying that the Environmental Protection Agency's mercury emission limits and cap-and-trade rule are illegal.\Montana environmental groups hailed the decision as a major victory for public health, but an official with the state Department of Environmental Quality said it's too soon to tell how the ruling might impact future and existing coal-fired power plants in Montana.\The court's decision centered on the Bush administration's ""clean-air mercury"" rule.\Mercury is a powerful neurotoxin that accumulates in fish and poses the greatest risk of nerve and brain damage to pregnant women, women of childbearing age and young children. Emissions of mercury total about 48 tons a year nationwide, according to the EPA, most of it in the form of air pollution that winds up in waterways.\Under the Clinton administration, the agency adopted provisions in the Clean Air Act that required coal- and oil-fired power plants to control mercury emissions using ""maximum achievable control technology."" But the EPA modified those rules under the Bush administration by removing coal- and oil-fired power plants from the list of mercury sources whose emissions could be regulated. The agency also implemented a system for controlling mercury called ""cap and trade,"" whereby some power plants could continue to emit the toxic pollutant while buying pollution credits from cleaner-burning plants.\The three-member Washington, D.C., appeals court unanimously ruled that both measures were against the law.\""You cannot control an air pollutant as toxic as mercury in a manner that says that it's not a hazardous air pollutant,"" said Anne Hedges of the Montana Environmental Information Center. ""The EPA was trying to say that every other industry that emits large amounts of mercury has to treat mercury as a toxin except the very largest emitters of mercury, which are coal plants.""\The MEIC, along with other environmental and public health groups, urged the DEQ to adopt the more stringent maximum achievable control technology standards when the agency was is the process of formulating the state's mercury rules in 2006. The DEQ instead adopted a rule that calls for the ""best available control technology,"" a lower standard of emission control.\Debbie Skibicki, lead environmental engineer for the DEQ's resource management bureau, said it's too soon to tell if the appeals court's ruling will require the DEQ to modify its mercury rule. She said the agency won't know if Montana's existing mercury emission-control standard will end up meeting the maximum achievable control technology standard the EPA might eventually adopt.\""I would guess that Montana's standards will be comparable, but I don't know,"" Skibicki said. ""It will take some time for the EPA to come up with its decision.""\Abigail Dillen, an attorney for the environmental law firm Earth Justice, said the state will probably have to revisit its mercury rule. She said there is little doubt that the state's rule fails to comply with the stricter requirement in the Clean Air Act.\""Let's take Highwood (Generating Station) as an example. They have an emission limit that, at most, will require the plant to control 90 percent of its mercury emissions,"" Dillen said of the coal-fired power plant proposed eight miles east of Great Falls. ""We know that right now, by using maximum achievable control technologies, you can get a lot higher level of control than that.""\Dillen said some coal plants in the United States are controlling as much as 95 percent of their mercury using existing technology.\""Ninety percent is by no means the high mark, and the high mark is what's required,"" Dillen said.\Jeff Chaffee is the vice president of Bison Engineering Inc., the environmental consulting firm for Southern Montana Electric Generation & Transmission Cooperative's proposed Highwood Generating Station. Chaffee said Friday that he has not yet had a chance to thoroughly review the court's decision, but said he thinks it's unlikely the decision will impact plans for the Highwood plant because Montana's mercury rule is more stringent than the federal rule that was tossed out by the appeals court.\""Montana established a mercury emissions rule at the state level that was much more stringent than the (clean-air mercury rule),"" Chaffee said. ""And Montana is implementing a best-available control technology standard. In this case, it is very likely equivalent to, or very close to being equivalent to, the maximum achievable control technology.""\SME has pledged to install and operate mercury-specific equipment that uses a process called ""activated carbon injection."" Chaffee said the Highwood plant could achieve, or even set, the maximum achievable control technology standard using that process.\Hedges said that's only possible if SME voluntarily spends money to inject carbon in amounts not mandated by the DEQ.\""DEQ told them they have to hit a certain emission limit. I can guarantee that they are only going to spend as much money as they have to in order to hit that emission limit,"" Hedges said.\Power companies supported the Bush administration mercury rule because it gives the industry until 2018 to reduce total mercury emissions to 15 tons per year from the current level of about 48 tons.\In Montana, the state's largest source of mercury emissions is PPL's four coal-fired generating stations at Colstrip, which emit an estimated total of 852 pounds of mercury per year. When the new DEQ mercury rules take effect in 2010, that amount will be required to drop to 176 pounds per year. Highwood Generating Station would be allowed to emit an estimated 20.7 pounds of mercury a year under the new rule.\According to the DEQ, Montana's existing coal-fired power plants emit a combined 950 pounds of mercury each year. Under the new rule, that number must drop to less than 300 pounds, including any new facilities that come online after 2010.\Many observers say that the federal court's ruling will probably be challenged by the electric utility industry. In the meantime, environmental and public health groups say Friday's decision is a huge step toward a cleaner and healthier environment.\""I think it's a tremendous victory for public health,"" Hedges said. ""It's unfortunate that the Bush administration was able to delay that public health protection as long as it did, but it gives me hope that some day the public will be better protected from this incredibly toxic pollutant. ""\The Associated Press contributed to this report."
5,"Election Day was a bad day for Democrats in Montana and across the nation.\Much like it was like for Republicans in 2006 and 2008.\""Democrats were dispirited across the country and here in Montana,"" Montana State University political science professor David Parker said. ""There was lower voter turnout, and the folks who Democrats needed to turn out didn't.""\As the polls closed on the East Coast on Tuesday and results began rolling in, it was clear early in the evening that a red tidal wave was making its way west, likely to crash over Montana as it did much of the rest of the country.\The early signals of a higher-than-expected voter turnout Democratic operatives crowed about online and in social media in the days leading up to the election didn't materialize.\Voter turnout was 54.6 percent, less than it was for the 2006 midterm election that saw Democrat Jon Tester narrowly defeat incumbent Republican Sen. Conrad Burns.\And if there's one thing Democrats need to win, it's high voter turnout.\""The information environment is a heck of a lot lower in a midterm election than a presidential election,"" Parker said. ""Because there is less information, a lot of the voters Democrats rely on -- the less educated, lower income, people with less free time -- are not able to deal with a less information-dense environment.""\When the waters settled and the new political landscape took shape, Republicans nationally won 23 of the 36 U.S. Senate seats up for grabs, including Montana's, to give the GOP a 52-seat majority and solid control of Congress.\Republicans also widened their lead in the U.S. House, strengthening their grip on that chamber with up to 250 seats, depending on the outcome of a few close races.\The carnage for Democrats wasn't contained to Capitol Hill, however.\Across the country, Republicans picked up seats in state legislatures -- now controlling 70 percent of state legislative bodies -- and now control at least 31 governorships (two races are still undecided).\In Montana, Democrats -- who faced large GOP majorities in the state House and Senate going into Tuesday's election -- managed to pick up a couple of seats in the House. They remain a 29-21 minority in the Senate added to seats in the House for a 59-41 minority in that body.\Though they still control the governor's office, Democrats will find it difficult to move their party's agenda forward in the 2015 Legislature. Republicans won't be eager to hand Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock or his party many policy victories in advance of the 2016 election cycle.\Changing tides\Not since the 1928 presidential election have Democrats across the country suffered such massive defeats.\It was a stark electoral contrast to just a few short elections ago, when Democrats in Montana and across the nation beat back Republican majorities in statehouses and in Washington, D.C., and made gains in traditionally red Western states such as Montana, Colorado and Wyoming.\In 2006 and 2008, the country was tired of the policies of Republican President George W. Bush and 12 years of Republican control of Congress. Voters were growing weary of the war in Iraq, warrantless spying on Americans and the Patriot Act, and they took out those frustrations on the president's party at the polls.\Back then Democrats ran on a clear message -- much of it focused on opposing Bush and Republicans in Congress -- and they were rewarded with majorities.\In 2006, the first election after Gov. Brian Schweitzer ended the Democrats' 16-year drought in the governor's office, the party held their own in the Montana statehouse.\Democrats battled to a near tie in the House. Rick Jore, a Constitution Party candidate from Ronan, caucused with Republicans for a 51-49 majority in that body.\But in the Senate, Democrats maintained their control for the second election in a row, holding a narrow 26-24 majority.\In 2006, Montana Democrats' standard-bearer, Tester, ran a Senate campaign that called for withdrawing troops from Iraq. Tester said he didn't want to weaken the Patriot Act, he wanted to repeal it. He called for raising the minimum wage, ending the ""irresponsible"" Bush-era tax cuts and forcing the federal government to negotiate Medicare prescription drug prices with pharmaceutical companies. Tester also touted renewable energy such as biofuels, wind and solar and publicly supported American involvement in the Kyoto Protocol, the international agreement to reduce global warming greenhouse gas emissions.\Tester found electoral success with those progressive messages, and so did his party.\In 2008, Democrats across the nation campaigned on ending the war in Iraq, ending the Bush tax cuts, repealing the Patriot Act, and implementing cap and trade greenhouse gas legislation. The national party platform called for affordable health care for all, closing the terrorist detention center at Guantanamo Bay, immigration reform, cutting military spending, reducing oil consumption and investing in renewable energy.\The year Barack Obama won the Democratic Party's nomination and eventually the presidency, Montana Democrats picked up a seat in the House, bringing that body to a 50-50 tie. With Schweitzer's easy re-election that year the Democrats controlled the governor's office, which also gave them control of the tied House.\While Democrats slightly slid backward in Legislative seats in 2008 -- ceding three seats to Republicans in the Senate -- they strengthened their grip on statewide offices, winning all five statewide elected Land Board seats, and Democrat Max Baucus cruised to an effortless reelection in the U.S. Senate.\Broken promises?\So what happened to Democrats' fortunes in 2014?\Some liberal critics say the Democrats didn't give their base a reason to show up.\Despite ruling majorities in both houses of Congress, Obama and the Democrats failed to deliver on key promises: from immigration reform to universal health care to closing down Guantanamo Bay to capping greenhouse gas emissions.\Democrats made little effort to overturn the Patriot Act, curb NSA spying, reduce military spending or roll back tax cuts for the rich.\Charles Lipson, a director of the Program on International Politics, Economics and Security at the University of Chicago, told the Washington Times the day after the election that Obama lost the party base ""because he overpromised and underperformed.""\""There's a lot to be disappointed with,"" Lipson said.\In Montana, where election results have bucked national trends in the past, Tuesday's results showed that our politics have become nationalized.\""National trends are affecting Montana more and more,"" Carroll College political scientist Jeremy Johnson said. ""It's more challenging in this environment to run away from your party.""\Some critics say it's difficult to know what Democrats stand for when their campaigns blur the line between solidly Democratic principles and Republican principles on issues ranging from global warming and the environment to guns and taxes.\Whereas Republicans have embraced their tea party base on the right, Democrats have shunned the left, wrote liberal activist William Rivers Pitt on Truth-Out.org.\""Say what you will about the Republicans, but you cannot fault their tactics when it comes to winning,"" Pitt wrote in an open letter to ""Democratic Spammers"" in early October. ""They are a minority in the United States, by the numbers, but they are running the show both politically and economically, and for one reason: they fire up their base.""\Longtime liberal columnist and former environmental lobbyist George Ochenski has been an ardent critic of Montana Democrats' approach to governing over the 10 years, particularly as it pertains to the ""all of the above"" energy policies that ignore the threat of global climate change.\""Keystone XL pipeline? They all support it. Mining more coal to ship to China? You bet. Cutting down more forests that actually take carbon dioxide out of the air? Oh yeah, let's congressionally mandate even higher harvest levels. And of course more drilling and fracking garners universal applause from Republicans and Democrats,"" Ochenski lamented in a column that appeared in the Missoulian the day before the election.\Some say Democrats also failed to articulate what they stand for. In 2006 and 2008 the line between Democrats and Republicans was clear on issues ranging from war, to the environment, to the economy and jobs.\""What is the Democratic economic platform for guaranteeing a chance at prosperity for everyone? Voters can't articulate it. In the absence of that, you vote for change,"" Democratic pollster Celinda Lake said in an interview with the Washington Post the day after the election.\Pendulum swings\Republicans face a challenge over the next two years both in Montana and nationally: They have decisive majorities in the legislative branch, but they don't control the executive.\Simply opposing Obama on the national level, or obstructing every policy goal Bullock promotes here in Montana, may not be a successful strategy for Republican looking ahead to 2016, Johnson said.\""We have sort of gotten into this dysfunctional dynamic where it's hard to have much getting done,"" Johnson said. ""The Republicans didn't really run on a mandate for their own policies, it was largely running against the policies of Obama.""\Johnson said Republicans risk facing a backlash from voters in 2016 if they don't offer substantive policy solutions to the problems facing Americans and Montanans. Johnson said many of the candidates who ran for office nationally, and in Montana, ran on promises to oppose the policies of the administration and not be conciliatory with Democrats.\""People don't think about that when casting their ballots, but that is the net effect of all this: More dysfunction, not getting things done. Both in Montana and nationwide."" Johnson said.\If the next two years resemble the past two years -- full of gridlock, acrimony, and stalemate -- it could hurt the ruling party come 2016.\Johnson said the electorate is likely to look more favorable for Bullock and the Democrats in two years during a presidential cycle, where the information environment is richer and more likely to attract the Democratic base. And with Obama no longer on the ballot, Republicans will have to come up with a more clearly defined message in 2016 than they did in 2014.\""My guess is 2016 will end up being a lot better for Democrats than it is today,"" Johnson said."
6,"CANBERRA, Australia -- In 2007, Australians were ready to do something to combat climate change, even if it was expensive.\More than two-thirds of them said so in a poll, and both major political parties vowed to make industries pay for greenhouse-gas emissions.\The undoing of that perspective will likely be complete after a new Senate is sworn in today. It's expected to give Prime Minister Tony Abbott the votes he needs to repeal a 2-year-old tax charged to around 350 of Australia's biggest carbon polluters. Three top political leaders lost their jobs over the issue as support for climate-change measures plummeted.\A global recession, political miscalculations and failed negotiations only partially explain the dramatic change.\Opponents of the carbon tax implemented in 2012 had the media largely on their side. Electricity prices soared -- not mainly because of the tax, but because power companies were spending billions on infrastructure. Most electricity users were compensated for the added cost of the tax, but many of them didn't know that. And rising gas prices fed the fury -- even though the tax didn't apply to gasoline.\Australia's experience illustrates how easy it is to scuttle complicated environmental laws, and serves as a warning to President Barack Obama, whose recent proposal to force a 30 percent cut in power plants' carbon emissions is drawing anger from both sides of politics.\""One of the keys was the fact that we did lose bipartisan support for emissions trading as one of the solutions,"" said John Connor, CEO of the Sydney-based Climate Institute think tank. ""And that then threw this issue into the sort of political and cultural trench warfare that you see in the U.S., but not so much of elsewhere.""\Australians' concerns about global warming peaked before elections in 2007. Prime Minister John Howard had grown unpopular for joining Washington in refusing to accept U.N. Kyoto Protocol targets for cutting carbon emissions. Both Australia and the U.S. are leading producers of coal, a major source of the pollution.\An annual poll by the Lowy Institute for International Policy shows the proportion of Australian voters who saw global warming as a serious problem that demanded immediate steps -- even at significant cost -- peaked at 68 percent in 2006. The telephone survey of 1,007 voters had a 3.1 percentage-point margin of error.\Facing defeat, Howard's conservative coalition back-flipped. Both sides advocated a cap-and-trade scheme in which free-market forces set the price of emitting a ton of carbon dioxide.\Kevin Rudd's center-left Labor Party won, but the Senate thwarted his efforts to introduce a cap-and-trade system. Some senators considered his plan too extreme, while others found it too weak. Meanwhile, the global economic crisis eclipsed the environment in Australian politics.\The government and the leader of Australia's conservative opposition, Malcolm Turnbull, were on the verge of a cap-and-trade deal in 2009. But Turnbull lost his leadership post to Abbott, then a senior opposition leader and a fierce opponent of the proposal.\Rudd shelved the plan. His popularity plummeted, and he lost his job in a Labor Party leadership vote to Julia Gillard.\The minor Greens party soon became pivotal. Rather than a cap-and-trade scheme, the Greens advocated a carbon tax in which government, not the market, set the price of pollution. After the 2010 election, Gillard needed the Greens' support to form a government. To get it, she agreed to a carbon tax, something she had vowed not to allow.\The tax, which went into effect in July 2012, charged major polluters a fixed price on carbon. It was to switch in mid-2015 to a cap-and-trade scheme.\Gillard and her government's popularity nose-dived. The 2012 Lowy poll showed support for costly steps to combat global warming hit bottom: 38 percent.\While Gillard's broken promise drove much of that anger, other forces were at work.\Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., which owns 70 percent of Australia's newspapers, supported Rudd in 2007 but by 2010 was backing Abbott. The top talk radio hosts in every major Australian city pushed the climate skeptic line.\Within days of the tax taking effect, Australia's consumer watchdog cautioned two companies that sold solar panels for falsely claiming electricity prices under the tax would rise 400 percent by 2019.\It was easy to attribute higher electricity costs to the tax. Between 2006 and last year, the average Australian household power bill increased more than 85 percent, the Grattan Institute think tank reported.\Opinion polls indicated Australians were overestimating the impact of the carbon tax.\A survey by the think tank Per Capita soon after the tax started found that most people blamed it for higher gasoline prices -- even though the tax didn't apply at the pump.\Most estimated the tax increased their weekly cost of living by 20 Australian dollars ($19) or more, about twice the government's estimate.\And while 90 percent of households received tax-related government compensation, half those surveyed said they hadn't received anything. The Per Capita online survey of 1,422 Australians did not publish a margin of error."

Skinner deserves support
\
Recently a letter to the editor mentioned the present County Commission as being out of balance since it has three members from one party.
\
I have lived in Montana all my life, and in Bozeman since December 2001. When I came, the county commission was divided, divisive and always in controversy. This commission is balanced with three strong, fiscally responsible commissioners that often disagree but find good compromise and get their work completed.
\
I personally believe Joe Skinner is a big reason the commission operates in this way and intend to continue to support him in this coming election

Give Hinkle nod in HD 66
\
OK, all of us in District 66, let's go to the polls on Nov. 2 and vote for Jedediah Hinkle. In supporting Jedediah, we will be in support of smaller governments, lower taxes and healthy businesses.
\
Our current representative, Mike Phillips, is one of the highest spenders in the entire House. He has voted for more than $560 million to be spent in 2009. This is of great concern to me, and I'm certain it concerns many of you. Does it make you wonder if proponents of big government actually want to bring Americans down to a poverty level, and dependent on more government? When politicians insinuate ""private business making a profit is evil,"" it is an insult to millions of honest, hard-working Americans.
\
I've sat down and visited with Jedediah in our home. He is our best choice in District 66 for less taxes, less spending and taking steps at a local level for putting government back into the hands of the people.

Cashell a true professional
\
I have been associated with the sheriff 's department of Gallatin County in one form or another since 1961, the last 20-plus years in the coroner's office. In all those years, and all those sheriffs, I have never worked with one more professional nor dedicated to his position and the public he serves than Sheriff Jim Cashell. Given his budget, he and his dedicated team have given the residents of the county the best enforcement one could ever expect.
\
Join me in returning a true professional to his office as sheriff/coroner of Gallatin County.

Phillips too big of spender
\
I live in District 66 where incumbent Mike Phillips has served two terms. In my mind, two terms is more than enough. Research his voting record and I am sure you will be as alarmed and concerned as I am that this big spender could be headed back to Helena to waste more taxpayer money. Montanans in Action, a nonpartisan organization, ranked him as No. 83 out of 100 in fiscal responsibility (more like irresponsibility). During this last session Phillips voted for more than $561 million in spending. Yes, that's right, over half a billion dollars.
\
It was also during this last session that the state of Montana had a huge income surplus of $1 billion. Since there is no such thing as a ""surplus"" in government, Mr. Philips and his comrades in Helena spent that surplus on new programs instead of giving Montana taxpayers a refund for over-taxation ... all while you were probably struggling financially or were perhaps unemployed (I know I was). It is time to expect the same kind of fiscal responsibility from our government and elected representatives that we have all been forced to personally adopt in a shaky economy.

More stands up for liberty
\
One can only wish that there were more folks with as much integrity as Mike More who were willing to run for Legislature. In the last term he stood up for the principles of liberty, especially the Second Amendment, and he defended against the government's ever more detailed regulation of the minute details of our individual lives. His opponent, on the other hand, is active in two homeowner's associations.
\
Also, Mike More represents every businessmen and all private landowners, not just tourist-related businesses as it appears it is the only ""industry"" his opponent supports.

Stahl will listen to voters
\
The most important race on the ballot this year is for the county commissioner, yet the impact that they have on our everyday life is seldom appreciated. Ask people who have been adversely affected and they can tell you the pain of having $675 added to their property taxes every year for at least four years. This was the result of commissioners contracting with a private company, Utility Solutions, to provide the basic service of water for the Four Corners Area.
\
Or, if you have been working for years to alleviate some of the hazards from living next to a gravel pit, and saw that all your work was struck down by District Court Judge John Brown because of a procedural misstep by the County Commission which killed the proposed zoning districts, you could speak to the power the county commissioners have.
\
Carol Stahl is running for the county commission because she does believe in listening to the people's voice in local government. She will bring years of experience as a legislator, a business entrepreneur, a tireless volunteer. If you would like to see a better outcome to the decisions made by the commission, join me in voting for Carol Stahl.

I'm voting for Burnett
\
All right, I must admit I have had it. I am a mother and a grandmother of 13 and have worked all my life to teach my family to care for themselves, care for others, be responsible workers and savers and protect the foundations of this great country which allows us all to do so.
\
I do not believe the government owes us anything but to strictly sustain the rule of law which qualifies us as a civilized nation. Attack ads dwelling on negatives tell me nothing about the things I want done to keep our society a great one. I want to know what you have done, candidates. I do not want to hear that your party is what has made Montana or the nation great.
\
Let me know about your philosophy for handling my hard-earned savings. Tell me how you are going to support our businesses and environment that they may grow of their own volition. Tell me how you are going to teach my children and not indoctrinate them. My entire family and I always vote, so let's hear how you are going to support me with your labors.

Wilmer makes her case
\
It has been my honor to serve House District 64 for two terms and I ask for your support again this November. I'm proud of our schools and support the continued quality, accessibility and affordability of public education. I treasure and work to protect the unique beauty of our natural surroundings and appreciate their contribution to tourism, businesses, and our quality of life.
\
I have worked across the aisle to enact fiscally responsible policies over the last four years. When adjusted for inflation and population growth, ongoing spending in that time has risen less than increases in personal income, allowing businesses and income earners to keep a bigger share of their earnings while supporting programs like children's health insurance for working families, better coverage for autistic kids, and all-day kindergarten to improve our children's educational and economic potential throughout their lives. The nonpartisan Tax Foundation now ranks Montana the sixth best tax climate for business and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce ranks Montana first in the nation for entrepreneurs.
\
Montana was one of only two states with budgets that stayed in the black in 2009-2011 and our unemployment rate stayed below the national average during the recent recession. By all estimates we will have a positive ending fund balance July 1, 2011.
\
But we still need to stimulate the growth of good-paying jobs. We made some overdue ""one-time-only"" investments in 2007 and maintained a positive balance in 2009, but in 2011 we will face a leaner budget. We must find efficiencies while carefully prioritizing the public services Montanans expect and deserve.
\
My experience in the past two sessions and my record of responsible leadership will enable me to continue to work hard for my constituents in the next session, and I hope you will support me for another term.

More too radical for HD 70
\
Hopefully, voters in HD 70 will be investigating the past legislative record of incumbent candidate Republican Mike More. More is a ""tea party"" supporter whose biggest legislative accomplishment was sponsoring HR 3, a ""successionist"" document viewed by opponents as a beatyour-chest states' rights resolution that fuels the kind of anti-government ideas that give strength to the militia movement. Thankfully, this bit of stinkum was soundly defeated.
\
More also opposed taking any badly needed federal stimulus dollars in Montana. He shuns modern science by promoting ""creative design,"" expresses disbelief in climate change, is anti-choice, and supports ""school choice,"" whatever that means.
\
The Chronicle staff was right to choose Democratic candidate April Buonamici over More. Buonamici, a retired teacher, is a thoughtful moderate who indicates a desire to work across party lines to solve the problems that affect all Montana citizens, instead of wasting the public's time and money in order to prove their point that the ""the government"" is some sort of vast conspiracy.
\
There is no doubt times are tough. The public is well-served by choosing candidates like Buonamici who are prepared to ""talk turkey"" about pending state issues, and should reject ""talking turkeys"" like More and his far right, anti-government nonsense.

Brastrup on taxes, access
\
It is important for voters to remember that income tax, not property tax, is used to fund state government. Property tax is used to fund city and county government, local schools, libraries, etc. The business equipment tax is a property tax. If it is eliminated, state spending will not be reduced and local property taxes will increase. Montana is not unfriendly to business because of taxes. The Tax Foundation ranks Montana sixth best on the list of tax-friendly states (state business tax climate rankings).
\
As your legislator from House District 68, I will look out for the interests of local property tax payers, not special interests.
\
I will also work to increase public access to public lands and streams and to protect the rights of adoptive parents.

Comstock lost my vote
\
On Thursday, Oct. 7, I attended the League of Women Voters public forum to learn the candidates' positions on specific issues. Imagine my surprise after submitting my question that Mike Comstock, the Republican nominee for the senate in my district, was not in attendance.
\
My question was answered, but as Mr. Comstock's opponent stated, ""It's hard to have a debate when your opponent isn't here."" I attended hoping to educate myself and left questioning any candidate who does not appear at a public forum or send a statement as allowed by the League of Women Voters.
\
As this was the only public election forum, it was my one chance to hear the candidate. In my disappointment, I realize I cannot vote for any candidate who does not attend a nonpartisan public forum to answer questions submitted by the voters.

Time to vote Phillips out
\
Mike Phillips is proud to have been on one of Obama's panels for cap and trade. I don't think he should be so proud of that. When we examine the cap and trade bill we find that not only is it ineffective, but that even if it was effective its effectiveness would come at the cost of massive fuel price increases and a general depression of our economy. As if it weren't depressed enough.
\
Mike Phillips says that he represents a balanced approach to environmental issues, when in fact he represents the most radical aspects of environmentalism. His presence on an Obama-appointed panel on cap and trade is questionable at best. His duty in regards to being an elected official is to serve the interests of his constituents, not spend his time helping to develop flawed legislation and programs for the federal government.
\
We've given him two chances in the Legislature, and both times he's shown himself to be a radical environmentalist. It's time to vote Mike Phillips out.

How can we keep real estate taxes within reason?
\
Every real estate tax appeal must be heard. This past year we had more than 50 which did not receive a hearing. When determining the tax base, each property owner becomes a small percentage of the whole. If every tax appeal is not heard, one individual ends up unfairly paying a larger percentage of the tax base than he or she should have to pay.
\
There are already laws in place that give real estate tax assistance to the elderly, the handicapped, and others with low incomes. Unfortunately, many of the people that could have this assistance do not know how to go about obtaining it.
\
Just as we have volunteers who help seniors at the Senior Center in Bozeman with their income tax, I would propose we train volunteers who can help with filing for real estate tax assistance. As a candidate running for House District 70, I am interested in helping people solve local and state issues. Our district needs someone who will attend to these issues, rather than just promote ideology. I wish to focus on education, local economics and our outdoor heritage, but I will assist any resident with any problem at any time. I ask for your vote this November.

As we conclude this campaign season, thank you to the residents of House District 65 (urban southeast Bozeman and MSU area) for welcoming me to your doors and contacting me to share your concerns, ideas, hardships and hopes for Montana's future. I am inspired by and share your continued optimism and fortitude in difficult times and in an environment often clouded with cynicism.
\
And thanks for making time - when the kids needed their bath, dinner was on the stove, textbooks beckoned, or the dogs were trying to sneak out the open door. Through these conversations, and those that I hope will continue, we are focusing our shared legislative priorities to address this district's needs -- a revitalized economy that will add new, clean jobs; a strong public education system that is a leader in preparing both youth and adults for success ; and a world-class environment that is both economic asset and valued natural refuge. I pledge to you to work hard to protect what we value and build a bright future for Bozeman and the state.
\
I hope on Nov. 3 I will also be able to offer my thanks to you for voting for Kathleen Williams for House District 65. Know that your vote is a strong message for experience and professionalism in the Montana Legislature. You can vote (and still register) in person now through Nov. 1 at the county courthouse, and on Nov. 2 at Bobcat Stadium. Every vote is critical in this important race.

Time to re-elect Skinner
\
Joe Skinner should be re-elected this November. Over the past six years Joe has been a county commissioner who listens to all sides of an issue and makes a reasoned decision based on what is best for the citizens of Gallatin County. As a landowner in the county he knows the issues around land use and protection of private property rights that are critical in an area with the rapid growth that has been experienced over the past 20 years in Gallatin County. Balancing the needs of the county with those rights takes the patience and thoughtfulness that Joe has shown consistently.
\
In the coming years our county will be facing many challenges especially budgetary. Joe is someone who can face these challenges and make the best decisions for our county. Joe is a fiscal conservative who will work to balance the county budget without burdening county residents with higher taxes.
\
I urge you to vote for Joe Skinner this November. During times like these we need someone capable, thoughtful, hardworking and who will listen to make decisions for the residents of Gallatin County.

""Almost all utilities around the country ... are doing the same thing.""\Flathead Electric Cooperative, the second-largest electric utility in the state, has come out against the cap-and-trade bill that passed the House June 26, using its customer newsletter and an op-ed column in the Kalispell Daily Interlake to express opposition.\Montana-Dakota Utilities, which serves oil and gas customers in eastern Montana, has publicly expressed concerns about the bill, but hasn't sent anything to customers in its bills.\NorthWestern's Web site at www.northwesternenergy.com also has more detailed information on the legislation.\The House measure, now before the U.S. Senate, aims to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by creating a cap-and-trade system.\The government would set a cap on greenhouse gases, such as CO2, that cause global warming.\Companies that emit greenhouse gases, such as utilities that use coal-burning power plants, would have to acquire or buy credits equal to the amount of ""emission permits"" allowed under the cap.\NorthWestern Energy says that under the current bill, it would start out with credits that are 40 percent less than what they need to stay under the cap. The company says it would have to buy additional credits, thus creating costs to be passed on to customers.\NorthWestern serves about 320,000 customers in Montana.

Hill apparently would deny any restoration of wild bison and has chastised FWP and its commission for beginning the public analysis process.\Two recent polls indicate that almost 70 percent of Montana voters support restoration of wild bison in Montana, especially on the Charles M. Russell National Wildlife Refuge. Years ago, the Montana Legislature developed the Montana Environmental Protection Act to, among other goals, ""fulfill the responsibilities of each generation as trustee of the environment for succeeding generations."" MEPA mandates analysis of controversial environmental issues, public disclosure of good and bad impacts of management options, and subsequent public input regarding those options. It is the established way for Montanans to become informed and reason together on controversial issues.\Hill's positions on bison restoration and his criticism of FWP's mandated and orderly process for considering bison restoration are an attempt to gratify a minority of Montanans. Bullock disagrees, demonstrating his strong recognition of the democratic process in Montana.

I spent a year trying to work with my unit, my military branch and Tricare with no success. I vividly remember looking at my wife and asking her, ""What now?""\I decided to walk into Rehberg's office in Billings. After having spent a year getting ignored, pushed around and abandoned by the government, I had no expectations. Upon walking in, I immediately knew this would be different. The office manager could just tell how upset and down-trodden I was. Before I could say much, she hugged me. After a year of the government telling me they would not help and after being forgotten in red tape and nonsense, I was literally welcomed with open arms. Rehberg, along with his staff, quickly resolved my situation.\Days later, someone at the Pentagon called me and apologized. Soon afterward, I had my surgery, and Rehberg's staff stayed with me during continued care to ensure it would not happen again.

Didn't he say he would ""fix"" the problem but make it worse than any other president? Is it because he has reduced our credit rating? Is it because he has told other countries we are ""ashamed"" for passed aggressions to keep dictators from taking control of other countries, or is it because you are proud that he has lowered our defense missiles from 5,000 to 1,500 and is aiming for 300? Maybe it is because he is going to cut billions from our defense budget, making us more vulnerable.\Is it because you support his stand on abortion or because he is devout Muslim? Have you supporters checked to see what religion has been killing Americans? Is it because you like his method of amnesty? Or is it because he has sealed all of his history? Have you ever seen any incumbent president running for re-election who has this type of negative record?\A DVD called, ""Agenda, a True Story,"" will let you know what the liberals have been doing since the early 1900s.

Then I was disgusted. There are so many wrong things with this article, I am not sure where to begin.\My daughter is an honor student in Schreiner's science class. She has never liked science, but Schreiner, being the awesome teacher he is, has turned her attitude toward the class around, and she is getting an ""A"" in the class. I was also very disgusted with Paul's reference, ""Schreiner would leave his students."" My daughter is one of those students, and she does not feel abandoned by her teacher. She is very proud of Schreiner and that he will be representing them, as well. We have a citizens' Legislature with a great majority of legislators leaving their jobs to do their civic duty and representing all of us. This is short-sighted and a very ""below-the-belt"" comment. How dare Paul assume that we would be upset? He is wrong.\Schreiner is on a year-to-year contract with the school district, and last year, when my daughter found out he had to re-apply for his job and go through the interview process again, she was one of the first ones to make her positive feedback known as to the great job Schreiner does. The people of HD 22 would be proud Schreiner as their legislator. He views all issues evenly and will take all opinions into consideration.\?Sandra Lynne Pepos,\Great Falls\Obama should go\My hope is that those voting in this most important election are knowledgeable about the candidates' positions on abortion and same-sex marriage, as both are intrinsically evil.\Our nation was founded on Judeo, Christian values. The Ten Commandments are not suggestions but commandments. ""Thou shalt not kill"" is one of those commandments. Have you ever stopped to think that most people favoring birth control laws have been born already? Four years ago we voted in Pres. Barack Obama, who has endorsed abortion and same-sex marriage. In 2008, candidate Obama stated if he hadn't solved our nation's problems in one term, he shouldn't get another. I agree Obama should go!\When he was senator, he was one of the few to vote for infanticide, which means if an unborn baby survives the abortion, kill it. Nothing destroys life more than abortion. No baby is conceived without the hand of God; 3,000 unborn children are destroyed by abortion every day. Planned Parenthood's founder, Margaret Sanger, started a war on women. Planned Parenthood talks about health care for women ? what a falsehood. Abortion not only destroys an unborn person, but causes many mental and physical problems for women. Death and lies are bound to affect anyone.\There is a saying, ""God always forgives; man sometimes forgives but hatred never forgives."" I hope we vote for candidates who believe in liberty and justice for all, not only a few.\?Helen Mears,\Great Falls\Support Weber\When we hear all of the noise that's cluttering the political dialog these days, we rejoice at the opportunity to vote for a candidate who embraces and practices essential values and attributes that we hold dear ? mutual respect, active and intelligent listening, a committed work ethic and a true sense of community.\We've known Jane Weber for almost 20 years as a neighbor, community activist, facilitator and, above all, a stand-up individual of high moral and ethical values. Weber is a listener, and she strives to find common ground to solve community problems and achieve community growth.\We're voting for Jane Weber for Cascade County Commissioner. Now, if only we could clone her to run for Great Falls City Commissioner, as well!\?Sheila and Bob Kelly,\Great Falls\Will there be justice?\Raised in the contentious Hi-Line area, we were prideful when our Hays-Lodgepole basketball team won championships in 2006 and 2007, lead by A.J. Longsoldier. Next, while attending his grandfather's funeral, we heard he was arrested in Havre for a misdemeanor warrant, jailed for days without needed medicines and died, screaming, all alone in his cell from delirium tremens and indifference from those officials who assumed his safeguard. A nurse even said he was ""playing them.""\This tragedy is another example that, in spite of our population, 65,000 First American voters in Montana and cultural awareness in the schools, some things never change. An inquest was held in Havre in March of 2012 by the ""judge and jury,"" and no one in the audience was allowed to seek answers. The atmosphere was oppressive, and we felt like we were all on trial. Of course, the police, jailers and medics were then declared innocent of any responsibility.\Some miles east of the agency is an abandoned church, and we stopped there to say goodbye to a special Indian boy who is now not able to shoot more baskets, get a college degree, join the military or have a family, for there he lies beneath a mound of dirt and his basketball.

Justice, finally?\?George P. Horse Capture Sr.,\Great Falls\These taxes are job killers\Montanans should be very concerned about three job-killing taxes that Pres. Barack Obama will push hard for if he gets re-elected. The first is cap and trade, also known as cap and tax. This is a carbon-emissions tax that taxes energy and manufacturing with the end-payer being consumers.\The second tax is the carbon tax which is a tax on the carbon content of fuel. As 85 percent of America's energy needs are met by natural gas, coal and oil, this tax will directly raise the cost of gasoline, natural gas, electricity, diesel fuel and propane. Of course, as any business is hit with higher costs, they are passed on to the consumer.\The third tax is the value-added tax, also known as a national sales tax. It is levied on a product's value added at each stage of production with you, the consumer, being the end-payer.\These will not be temporary taxes; they will be permanent. It doesn't matter your politics or income level, you will be paying these taxes if enacted. Obama, though, will need the help of wasteful spenders, Sen. John Tester and Kim Gillan, to enact these taxes. Don't fall for Tester's campaign diversions, as he really has voted with Obama 95 percent of the time.\Please vote for Rep. Denny Rehberg and Steve Daines who oppose these jobs-outsourcing taxes.\?Ron Hepp,\Great Falls\Protect wolverines\Minke whales and wolverines ? the Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks is right behind the Japanese in ""Alice in Wonderland"" convoluted reasoning that you have to kill threatened and endangered species in order to save them.\We all know that those ""researched"" minke whales land on Japanese dinner plates. We also know that those vanishing wolverines are mostly taken to stoke the egos of successful trappers. When you rely on the predator to inform a life-or-death vote on its prey, the special interest predator is the only beneficiary.\Montanans, call the five lord high executioners of diminishing wildlife populations at the FWP and tell them to:\1) Repeal their uninformed vote allowing the trapping of five wolverines.\2) Stop pandering to trappers who regard the trapping of a wolverine ""the height of expertise in the trapping culture.""\3) Do their homework. There is hard, factual science out there from data published in peer-reviewed journals by field biologists. See the Petition to End the Trapping of Wolverine in Montana, www.westernlaw.org.\The wolverine is fighting for survival as climate change melts away nursery glaciers, as traps that don't discriminate ""catch"" are laid, as high-elevation recreationists drop from the skies into wolverine habitat and more roads divide the back country. Knowing this animal has been warranted for endangered species listing, don't our FWP commissioners owe its existence an informed vote?\?Pat Helvey,\East Helena\Bad employers don't deserve protective unbrella\I disagree with the Oct. 8 legal reform op/ed article, specifically the comment about Montana's wrongful-discharge laws and the role of trial attorneys in creating an adverse environment for Montana businesses.\I am a member of the Montana Chamber of Commerce, a transactional attorney and owner of multiple businesses for more than 36 years. I have employed countless employees and terminated numerous employees, or they left for their own reasons. I was sued once for wrongful termination. I won, and my business was not destroyed.\I have witnessed a close family member become the subject of wrongful termination. The employer's wrongful actions were financially devastating for the employee and her family and equally devastating to her sense of dignity. Bad employers in Montana do not deserve the same protective umbrella as the thousands of businesses who provide safe and dignified workplaces.\Wrongful-termination laws in Montana never fully compensate the employee no matter how good their case or their attorney's skills. There is no compensation for emotional distress. Statutory ""caps"" limit the employee to four years of lost wages and benefits. Income from a new job or income imputed to the employee offsets any recovery.\Thankfully, a Montana trial attorney is helping my family member regain some of her monetary loss and dignity. I hope anyone who finds themselves in a similar situation will have the benefit of a professional trial attorney to assist them.\?Max A. Hansen,\Dillon\God cares for us all\In her letter to the editor, Gloria Burrow asked how any thinking woman could support the Republican Party. Well, I am a thinking woman who seems to think that there are more important rights out there that women deserve and need rather than the choice to end the life of her child.\She states that Paul Ryan and other Republicans are against women and their rights. Since when did someone become a bad person because he or she believes taking a human life is wrong? To me, be they Republican or Democrat, those who believe in the sanctity of life are the modern-day Christians who suffer persecution for their beliefs.\In answer to Benny Potter's letter, there is someone in the voting booth with you, and God does care about us all.\?Karen Grove,\Great Falls\Support Glover\Tom Glover is an educator and a business owner. He is a community leader and an innovator. Most importantly, I know Tom Glover as my dad. I am so excited to support his race for House District 24. Great Falls could not ask for a more compassionate and forward-thinking candidate for the Montana House.\Despite the onslaught of money and negativity in this year's election season, I hope that Montanans look to values and leadership in making their vote. My dad taught my sister and me to listen first, talk later. He taught us patience, and he taught us to care about other people and look out for those less fortunate. He spent most of his career as a teacher working with students with special needs, and he has lived the ideals he taught us every day of his life.\Glover will represent his district because he will listen to his constituents, and he cares about their lives and the future of Great Falls. I have worked at a number of sessions with the Montana Legislature, and sadly, all too often money and power motivate many representatives, rather than values and hard work.\Residents of HD 24, a vote for Tom Glover is a vote for a candidate who will listen to you, represent you and work hard for you. He will take your ideas to Helena, and he will work with you to continually improve the community of Great Falls.\?Annie Glover,\Helena\Protect collective bargaining\Currently, collective bargaining is being attacked. It is my feeling that collective bargaining is how our nation was formed. If the 13 colonies had not come together collectively, they could not have escaped the tyranny of King George III. Bargaining separately, they would have been easily defeated.\So if you truly are American, vote to protect collective bargaining.\?Jerry Ferderer,\Great Falls\Obama, Tester need to go\I can't believe all the recent letters from whiny Democrat women focused solely on their reproductive organs. In the immortal words of Pres. Bill Clinton's adviser, James Carville, "" It's the economy, stupid."" If there is a war on women, its an economic war, and it's being waged against not just women but families. Under Pres. Barack Obama and his 95-percent-of-the-time sidekick, Sen. Jon Tester, family incomes have dropped by more than $4,000 per year.\Make no mistake about it, women are worried. And they're not just worried about themselves. They're worried about their children's future. They don't want them to be saddled with debt from our generation which has surpassed a record-high $16 trillion. The new women's issues are economic security, job growth, lower taxes and reasonable federal spending. I fail to see how dependence on food stamps and free birth control is a path to strength and independence. It's highly offensive that the Obama/ Tester campaigns think women either haven't noticed ? or just don't care ? how devastating this administration's failed economic policies have been for us.\Obama and Tester have been urging women to ""vote like their lady parts depend on it."" I will vote with my most important lady part, my brain. Obama and Tester need to go.\?Cyndi Baker,\Great Falls\Supports Loney\I am a neighbor of Jan Cahill, chairman of the board of trustees for Great Falls Public Schools. I noticed that several weeks ago, he put a Cleve Loney sign in his front yard. Obviously, he is supporting Loney over his opponent in the House District 25 race.\This kind of punches a hole in Dennis Granlie's recent letter stating that Loney is somehow anti-education. I would assume the chairman of the school board would be deeply interested and informed as to which candidate would be the better one with regard to education issues.\Letter-writers such as Granlie are entitled to their own opinions but not to their own facts. Loney supports our public education system. This is only one of the reasons he was awarded a ""Good Apple"" award by the district. Loney is proud of his award as well as his work on behalf of the Great Falls Public Schools. Vote to re-elect Cleve Loney in HD 25.\?Maria Acord,\Great Falls"

This year marks the 41 st  anniversary of Earth Day. Forty-one years ago there was an outcry because of how Americans were treating our planet. The message of the times was dire and everyone heard it. At the end of his reporting of the day's events, Walter Cronkite stated, ""Someday, we heard today, the world will be a better place if it listens and acts. In the meantime, perhaps for a generation or more, it will be frighteningly costly to each of us to clean up the mess each of us has made, but the cost of not doing so is more frightening. That's what today's message really means, and those who marched today, and those who slept, and those who scorned are in this thing together.""
\
That first Earth Day motivated a generation to create policies to protect our environment in ways we haven't seen since. Under Nixon, a Republican, we passed the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act (the senate overruled Nixon's veto), the National Marine Sanctuaries Act, and created the EPA. It wasn't a partisan issue. It was an American issue and, a responsibility we all felt. Yet today concern for the environment and conservation has become a political issue, rather than a ""we're all in this together"" fact.
\
In looking back 41 years, I can't help but wonder what the secret formula was to get the public and politicians to, as Walter Cronkite said, ""listen and act"". I had a wonderful opportunity to ask James Smith, a former senior official of the EPA, a former Board Member of Gallatin Valley Land Trust, and an essential player in making the first Earth Day happen, a few questions.
\
COLUMBINE: James, one of the challenges of the environmental movement today is getting the word out and mobilizing people to act. 41 years ago, you were the senior public outreach staffer at the Conservation Foundation and were essential to mobilizing twenty million people in six months to show up for Earth Day. Tell me about that experience and your secret to energizing so many in such a short amount of time.
\
JAMES: Teach-ins were a big thing at the time. The Vietnam War was raging and students around the country were rallying against the war. Senator Gaylord Nelson from Wisconsin decided that we needed to have an environmental teachin and approached the Conservation
\
Foundation about the idea. The Foundation was an unlikely organization to approach given its roots were in ultraestablishment with a board made up of folks like Gifford Pinchot, Jr., and The President of the National Geographic Society. However, the project was approved. We moved forward and tapped into the already organized anti-war groups that were spread around college campuses throughout the country.
\
In a way, Earth Day's success is because of two misunderstandings: The establishment thought it was a way to get the youth away from the anti-war movement, and the youth thought it was a way to vocalize their anti-establishment beliefs. Without the anti-war groups it would have been impossible to pull off the Earth Day celebration.
\
COLUMBINE: Why do you think it is so difficult to mobilize people today? James: A couple reasons: First of all, the whole thing has turned out to be enormously costly. Money that was thought to be sufficient at the time has turned out to be inadequate in truly protecting our environment. Additionally, the messaging had simplicity then. We've lost the simplicity and the appeal to those who might otherwise be interested. Exhaustion sets in. There's a sense of pushing a rock up a hill with it rolling back. There's a sense of accomplishment with legislation, but almost inevitably it turns out to be complex and often ineffectual. Originally, environmental issue had bi-partisan support, but now neither political party seems to advance that agenda. Even the rank and file democrats aren't effective. All of these factors diminish enthusiasm.
\
COLUMBINE: ""Science Communication"" is a big buzz in the environmental community because scientists are not communicating in ways the public can understand. A good example of this is the term ""Global Warming"" and the public misunderstanding of what it means. What do we need to do differently to be more effective today?
\
JAMES: Widen the field of participation. Not just through activists and students, but through everybody. One of the things that came out of Earth Day was creating an interdisciplinary environmental field that, while engaged greater numbers of people, was self contained and created a complexity difficult to understand. We have things like ""cap and trade"" that combine science speak, economic speak, and manufacturing speak that are difficult to fully understand.
\
However, if we return to conservation: the protection of land, wildlife habitat and water, we are simplifying the message to something the average citizen can rally around. This is what the Gallatin Valley Land Trust (GVLT) can do for our community. With very little public expenditure GVLT's programs provide conservation easement work that doesn't involve much public cost while harnessing people's resources and land to help protect wildlife habitat, land and water. If we return to the theme of conservation, it'll be easier to digest.
\
COLUMBINE: I couldn't agree with you more. It all comes down to our conservation roots. Thank you James!
\
By making sure special places are protected, GVLT provides an essential service to our community and our earth. However, they couldn't do it without those who have donated conservation easements their land, and we thank them for their vision and generosity.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- One thing that Tim Pawlenty, Jon Huntsman, Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney have in common: These GOP presidential contenders all are running away from their past positions on global warming, driven by their party's loud doubters who question the science and disdain government solutions.
\
All four have stepped back from previous stances on the issue, either apologizing outright or softening what they said earlier. And those who haven't fully recanted are under pressure to do so.
\
The latest sign of that pressure came Thursday when New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said he was pulling his state out of a regional agreement to reduce greenhouse gases, saying it won't work. While Christie, a rising GOP star, has said he's not running for president, some in the party continue to recruit him.
\
It's an indicator of a shift on the issue among conservative Republicans, who have an outsized influence in the party's presidential primary elections. Over the last few years, Gallup polling has shown a decline in the share of Americans saying that global warming's effects have already begun -- from a high of 61 percent in 2008 to 49 percent in March. The change is driven almost entirely by conservatives.
\
In 2008, 50 percent of conservatives said they believed global warming already is having effects; that figure dropped to 30 percent this year. By contrast, among liberals and moderates there's been relatively little movement, and broad majorities say warming is having an impact now.
\
Not all Republicans are happy with the trajectory the party is on when it comes to global warming. Former New York Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, a 27-year veteran of Congress who was known as a staunch protector of the environment, said he has ""never been so disappointed all my life in the pretenders to the throne from my party.""
\
""Not one of them is being forthright in dealing with climate science,"" he said in an interview. ""They are either trying to finesse it, or change previous positions to accommodate the far right. They are denying something that is as plain as the nose on your face.""
\
But for some, opposing mandated solutions to climate change has become party orthodoxy.
\
""Republican presidential hopefuls can believe in man-made global warming as long as they never talk about it, and oppose all the so-called solutions,"" said Marc Morano, a former aide to Oklahoma Sen. James Inhofe, one of the most vocal climate skeptics in Congress.
\
Morano now runs a website called Climate Depot where he attacks anyone who buys into the scientific consensus on climate change. Enemy No. 1 for Morano these days is Gingrich, the former House speaker who in 2008 shared a couch with then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in a TV ad backed by climate change guru Al Gore.
\
In it Gingrich says, ""We do agree that our country must take action on climate change.""
\
Since that appearance, Gingrich, who once ran an environmental studies program at a Georgia college, has called for the abolition of the Environmental Protection Agency. He's also spoken out against a Democratic bill that passed the House in 2009 that would have limited emissions of greenhouse gases and created a market for pollution permits to be bought and sold.
\
But that hasn't been enough to satisfy conservative critics. Gingrich went further in a recent interview when he said he doubted there was a connection between climate change and the burning of fossil fuels.
\
""The planet used to be dramatically warmer when we had dinosaurs and no people,"" Gingrich told The Macon (Ga.) Telegraph last week. ""To the best of my knowledge the dinosaurs weren't driving cars.""
\
Where Gingrich has waffled, other GOP contenders have conceded on the issue of climate. Romney, Pawlenty and Huntsman potentially come into the race with even more climate baggage, since each of them as governor supported a regional ""cap-and-trade "" program to reduce greenhouse gas pollution, like the one Christie bailed out of this week. All have since abandoned that stance.
\
It's a marked turnaround for a party that just three years ago gave its presidential nomination to Sen. John McCain, who long has supported cap and trade to reduce greenhouse gas pollution and who campaigned on the issue even though it put him on the same side as his opponent, Barack Obama.
\
In fact, the whole idea of a market to trade pollution credits came from the Republican Party. It emerged in the late 1980s under the administration of President George H.W. Bush as a free-market solution to the power plant pollution that was causing acid rain. It passed Congress nearly unanimously in 1990 as a way to control emissions of sulfur dioxide.

13,"To what do you attribute the widening income gap between the rich and the poor, and what would you do as a senator to work to close that gap?\During my time in business, I witnessed firsthand that many of the bright spots in our economy are being threatened by overreaching federal regulations that directly threaten thousands of middle class, family wage jobs. In Montana, many of our rural communities and reservations are facing double-digit unemployment. These are the same areas where responsibly managing our forests and developing our natural resources could create hundreds of good-paying Montana jobs, yet senseless Washington regulations are holding these jobs back. That's why I'm fighting for commonsense policies that grow our economy and create jobs, solutions like building the Keystone XL pipeline or increasing active management of our national forests.\What is your position on cap-and-trade, carbon taxes and other policies proposed to address global climate change, and what steps should we take to improve our ability to tackle challenges such as climate change that cross state and national boundaries?\Our mountains and rivers, our clear blue skies and our unmatched public lands are an important part of our state's heritage and our way of life. Montanans know better than anyone how to best protect these precious resources, and we also know that protecting our environment and growing our economy isn't an ""either/or"" choice. We must be mindful of the consequences of policies that affect Montana jobs, energy prices and the economy. President Obama's war on coal and cap-and-trade policies threaten nearly 5,000 Montana jobs and would cause Montana's electricity prices to skyrocket, while having little to no impact reducing global carbon emissions. I support an all-of-the-above energy approach to securing American energy independence that includes alternative sources of energy -- hydropower, wind, and solar -- along with coal, oil, and natural gas. It's also long-past time we approve the Keystone XL pipeline to create good-paying Montana jobs and reduce our dependence on foreign oil.\What should be done in Congress to protect Social Security for today's seniors and ensure that the program remains viable for future generations?\As a society, we have a responsibility to keep the promises that have been made to our seniors. Social Security provides critical support to seniors and people with disabilities, and I will work to ensure Montana seniors receive the benefits they have earned.\I also am committed to working toward common-sense reforms that ensure these important programs are secured for future generations.\The first step is putting more Americans back to work. Our economy continues to underperform, which reduces revenues going into the Social Security Trust Fund. We need to enact policies that promote job creation and encourage work to get our economy back to strong employment levels. In addition, Social Security is structured to provide lower- and middle-income individuals with a larger share of their earnings when they retire. We should consider ways to expand on this principle to keep the program strong and solvent for our children and grandchildren.\What policies or principles do you support to strengthen Medicare?\I will stand strong against any efforts to change Medicare for today's seniors and those near retirement -- that's one reason why I'm fighting to repeal Obamacare, which cut more than $700 billion from Medicare to pay for the health care law's increased costs. Additionally, more than 30,000 Montana seniors could have faced up to a $180 cut every year to their Medicare Advantage plan and thousands more may lose access to Medicare Advantage plans because of cuts made to pay for Obamacare.\I introduced the ""Ensuring Medicaid and Medicare Access to Providers Act"" to protect access to critical health care services for disabled, elderly and low-income Montanans by ensuring that businesses which provide services through Medicaid and Medicare do not face the crushing burden of Obamacare's employer mandate.\We need to address the insolvency of Medicare Part A so the next generation can benefit from this program by building on bipartisan initiatives to enhance choice and competition. We need to do this while keeping beneficiaries 55 and older exempt from changes. We should also ensure that government targets greater financial assistance to lower-income Americans by building on means-related policies that already exist in parts of Medicare.\What is the root cause of inaction in Congress? Where should Americans place the blame for partisan stalemate?\Washington has become a town that promotes all the wrong behavior and all the wrong people at the expense of hard-working taxpayers. It is no accident that Washington, D.C., has emerged from the recession better than any other region in the country. Inaction is rewarded, and politics trump finding solutions.\We need to bring accountability to Washington. That's one of the reasons I introduced the ""Balanced Budget Accountability Act,"" which simply states that if members of Congress don't do their job and pass a balanced budget, they shouldn't get paid.\These principles reflect the way we do things in Montana -- and they stand in stark contrast with the Senate, where Democrats have decided that the American people don't deserve a budget at all.\In the past year and a half, the House passed more than 350 bills -- many with bipartisan support -- of which the Senate refuses to even take up for a vote.

Once upon a time King Coal was indeed a major employer: At the end of the 1970s there were more than 250,000 coal miners in America. Since then, however, coal employment has fallen by two-thirds, not because output is down -- it's up, substantially -- but because most coal now comes from strip mines that require very few workers. At this point, coal mining accounts for only one-sixteenth of 1 percent of overall U.S. employment; shutting down the whole industry would eliminate fewer jobs than America lost in an average week during the Great Recession of 2007-09.
\
There are three things we know about man-made global warming. First, the consequences will be terrible if we don't take quick action to limit carbon emissions. Second, in pure economic terms the required action shouldn't be hard to take: emission controls, done right, would probably slow economic growth, but not by much. Third, the politics of action are nonetheless very difficult.
\
But why is it so hard to act? Is it the power of vested interests?
\
I've been looking into that issue, and have come to the somewhat surprising conclusion that it's not mainly about the vested interests. They do, of course, exist and play an important role; funding from fossil-fuel interests has played a crucial role in sustaining the illusion that climate science is less settled than it is. But the monetary stakes aren't nearly as big as you might think. What makes rational action on climate so hard is something else -- a toxic mix of ideology and anti-intellectualism.
\
Before I get to that, however, an aside on the economics.
\
I've noted in earlier columns that every even halfway serious study of the economic impact of carbon reductions -- including the recent study paid for by the anti-environmental U.S. Chamber of Commerce -- finds at most modest costs. Practical experience points in the same direction. Back in the 1980s conservatives claimed that any attempt to limit acid rain would have devastating economic effects; in reality, the cap-and-trade system for sulfur dioxide was highly successful at minimal cost. The Northeastern states have had a cap-and-trade arrangement for carbon since 2009, and have seen emissions drop sharply while their economies grew faster than the rest of the country. Environmentalism is not the enemy of economic growth.
\
But wouldn't protecting the environment nonetheless impose costs on some sectors and regions? Yes, it would -- but not as much as you think.
\
Consider, in particular, the much-hyped ""war on coal."" It's true that getting serious about global warming means, above all, cutting back on (and eventually eliminating ) coal-fired power, which would hurt regions of the country that depend on coal-mining jobs. What's rarely pointed out is how few such jobs still exist.
\
Once upon a time King Coal was indeed a major employer: At the end of the 1970s there were more than 250,000 coal miners in America. Since then, however, coal employment has fallen by two-thirds, not because output is down -- it's up, substantially -- but because most coal now comes from strip mines that require very few workers. At this point, coal mining accounts for only one-sixteenth of 1 percent of overall U.S. employment; shutting down the whole industry would eliminate fewer jobs than America lost in an average week during the Great Recession of 2007-09.
\
Or put it this way: The real war on coal, or at least on coal workers, took place a generation ago, waged not by liberal environmentalists but by the coal industry itself. And coal workers lost.
\
The owners of coal mines and coal-fired power plants do have a financial interest in blocking environmental policy, but even there the special interests don't look all that big. So why is the opposition to climate policy so intense?
\
Well, think about global warming from the point of view of someone who grew up taking Ayn Rand seriously, believing that the untrammeled pursuit of self-interest is always good and that government is always the problem, never the solution. Along come some scientists declaring that unrestricted pursuit of self-interest will destroy the world, and that government intervention is the only answer. It doesn't matter how market-friendly you make the proposed intervention; this is a direct challenge to the libertarian worldview.
\
And the natural reaction is denial -- angry denial. Read or watch any extended debate over climate policy and you'll be struck by the venom, the sheer rage, of the denialists.
\
The fact that climate concerns rest on scientific consensus makes things even worse, because it plays into the antiintellectualism that has always been a powerful force in American life, mainly on the right. It's not really surprising that so many right-wing politicians and pundits quickly turned to conspiracy theories, to accusations that thousands of researchers around the world were colluding in a gigantic hoax whose real purpose was to justify a big-government power grab. After all, right-wingers never liked or trusted scientists in the first place.
\
So the real obstacle, as we try to confront global warming, is economic ideology reinforced by hostility to science. In some ways this makes the task easier: We do not, in fact, have to force people to accept large monetary losses. But we do have to overcome pride and willful ignorance, which is hard indeed.

According to recent news reports, dogs may not be man's best friend after all. Revelations by scientists doing some real scientific research have come to the conclusion that owning a mediumsized dog actually has twice the impact on the environment as owning an SUV and driving it 10,000 miles a year. It'll be interesting to see how the eco-minded global warming zealots in Bozeman take that news.
\
In a new book titled ""Time to Eat the Dog: The Real Guide to Sustainable Living,"" Robert and Brenda Vale, specialists in sustainable living at Victoria University, analyzed popular brands of pet food and calculated that a medium-sized dog eats around 360 pounds of meat and 200 pounds of cereal a year. That takes a lot of agricultural activity which in turn generates a large carbon footprint. A similar study at the Stockholm Environment Institute in York, U.K., confirmed the data.
\
It turns out that footprint size is about two acres for a medium-sized dog, compared to about one acre for the typical SUV. There are a lot of SUVs in Bozeman, but I'm willing to bet there are far more dogs. While we all need vehicles to commute to work, transport goods, etc., dogs are essentially an extravagance with an exceptionally large carbon footprint. Perhaps the proposed cap and trade bill should be amended to tax dog owners say $3,000 a year for a dog license. The money could be sent to Third World nations to pay them not to have dogs.
\
Of course for those of us who subscribe to the theory that anthropogenic global warming exists but is immeasurably small as compared to solar variations which have caused warming and cooling for hundreds of millions of years, we'll continue to drive SUVs and own dogs without all that liberal guilt.

Rehberg must be getting really desperate since the Republicans are distorting the truth in order to instill fear and panic.
\
One example: a TV ad states that Tester voted for the death tax. Never mind there is no such thing as a death tax. There is an estate tax (what a difference a word makes) and it does not go into effect unless one person inherits $5 million and two people inherit $10 million. Yes, Jon did vote for a tax on inheritances above these levels.
\
And what about the latest flyer sent to homes stating, ""Tester's cap-and-trade energy plan will cause your electricity rates to sky-rocket ;"" that it ""COULD COST YOU $1,700 more every year."" Again look at the language. The figures the Republicans cite are intended to scare and not fact (in 2007 they used a tax figure of $3,100). No mention that these programs are necessary to protect human health and the environment. No mention that individual states as well as Europe have already instituted caps on emissions without the sky falling down. Be careful what you take as fact. It seems that Republican lies, distortions and over-simplifications are the rules of Rehberg's game.

18,"As a Montana farmer and as a director for CHS Inc., an agricultural cooperative owned by farmers across our state and throughout the U.S., I want to thank U.S. Sen. Max Baucus for his role in the debate over climate change/cap-and-trade legislation.\This is a very complex issue with significant implications for all agricultural producers and those who serve them. We are very concerned with the House-approved Waxman-Markey Bill. CHS operates a small refinery at Laurel and our primary markets are agriculture and rural America. We estimate the economic burden of the current bill on our refinery could be over $600 million a year.\As a farmer-owned company, CHS has a deeply rooted commitment to environmental stewardship within all of its operations, but we believe there are fairer, more effective and more economically sound means of addressing climate change.\We appreciate the time Sen. Baucus and his staff have devoted to listening to the concerns of small refiners and agricultural companies like CHS. As the senior member of the Senate's Environment and Public Works Committee, he has helped create a version of the bill that addresses the needs of these important economic contributors to Montana agriculture and energy.\Montanans should be grateful that Senator Baucus is providing important leadership that understands the needs of this state's farmers and the businesses that serve them.\?

19,"The Environmental Protection Agency and ""Climategate,"" cap-and-trade, cap-and-tax, carbon tax and emissions tax are all becoming synonymous and intertwined in speeches everywhere ? in debate, United Nations reports, data manipulation by climatologists and political chicanery. Who and what is the EPA?\The EPA is a bureau of non-elected officials ? bureaucrats ? whose chairperson, Lisa Jackson, was appointed by Pres. Barack Obama and, for all intents and purposes, observes the goals and objectives of the president. In December of 2009, the EPA declared that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are pollutants dangerous to public health because they are alleged to cause global warming. This finding gave the EPA the immense power to regulate CO2 emissions. This dangerous pollutant is what we exhale from our bodies every second.\For the ruling, the EPA relied primarily on data from a U.N. global warming report. Emails leaked in 2009 in the ""Climategate"" scandal showed that some of the world's prominent climatologists manipulated data to overstate the effects of carbon dioxide in the environment. The EPA and much of the U.N. report relied on that questionable data.\If the EPA is allowed to move forward with its regulation of CO2, costs to every American household are projected to increase by $3,000 a year due to higher prices for energy and any goods that require energy to manufacture or transport.

Steven Hayward, co-author of the annual Index of Leading Environmental Indicators, said President Barack Obama's goal of cutting America's greenhouse gas emission to a fifth of what they were in 2005 by 2050 would require U.S. citizens to return to 1910 levels of emissions, when the country had 92 million people.
\
Policy scholar Steven Hayward told attendees of a property rights forum in Bozeman Thursday that proposals to drastically cut greenhouse gasses emitted by the United States are ""economically insensible and undemocratic"" and are facing a crisis in public support.
\
Hayward, a senior fellow of the American Enterprise Institute and co-author of the annual Index of Leading Environmental Indicators, said President Barack Obama's goal of cutting America's greenhouse gas emission to a fifth of what they were in 2005 by 2050 would require U.S. citizens to return to 1910 levels of emissions, when the country had 92 million people.
\
The goal set by Obama would mean the entire county could emit 1 billion tons of CO2 tons in 2050. With Census Bureau predictions putting the 2050 population at about 420 million, per capita emissions would have to fall to 2.5 tons per person, Hayward said.
\
""The only countries that can match this are Haiti, Somalia and Belize,"" he said. The target is ""completely out of the realm of reality.""
\
Hayward gave the luncheon address, entitled ""Property Rights and the Global Commons : An Alternative to Kyoto-Copenhagen Climate Policy,"" at a forum sponsored by the Montana Policy Institute and the Property and Environment Research Center.
\
Hayward said the ""cap and trade"" legislation currently stalled in the U.S. Senate, which would require companies to purchase permits to emit carbon dioxide, threatens property rights by mandating energy efficiency standards in homes and commercial structures. It would also give the federal government unprecedented regulatory powers over the energy industry, he said.
\
As of Thursday, three companies -- British Petroleum, ConocoPhillips and Caterpillar -- announced their decision not to renew memberships in the U.S. Climate Action Partnership, saying proposed climate change legislation would harm the motor fuel and natural gas industries.
\
Hayward spoke mostly about the ""green fatigue"" that he said has set in, especially after the hacking of e-mails exchanged by some climate change scientists that were made public last year. He compared the affect of ""Climategate "" on the global warming movement to the emergence of the Pentagon papers on the Vietnam War.
\
""It changed the conversation fundamentally,"" he said. ""It's the issue that ate their movement alive.""

21,"Wouldn’t it be great if there were some way to create jobs, continue to grow the economy, stimulate innovation, make people healthier, our nation and world safer, and address climate change? Carbon pricing with dividends can do that.\While there are other kinds of carbon pricing, such as cap-and-trade, carbon pricing with dividends involves putting an incrementally increasing fee on fossil fuels that is paid by the company that extracts the oil, natural gas, or coal from the ground. The fees collected are returned to all Americans as dividends, which compensates them for the increased costs of gasoline or other fuels. A border tax adjustment would prevent other countries from having a competitive advantage over U.S. firms because of the fee.\An economic model of the carbon fee and dividend, or CFD, proposal backed by the Citizens Climate Lobby concluded that jobs will be created, the economy will grow, and lives will be saved due to improved air quality under CFD. In that model over half of U.S. households and 58 percent of individuals end up with more money in their pockets at the end of the year from the dividends, benefiting those with the lowest incomes most.\A similar plan that differs in a few details is supported by the Climate Leadership Council, which includes such distinguished conservatives as George Schultz, former secretary of state under President Reagan; and James Baker, former secretary of state under President Bush. The Climate Leadership Council website states, “Our carbon dividends solution is: Pro-Environment, Pro-Growth, Pro-Jobs, Pro-Competitiveness, Pro-Business and Pro-National Security.”\Why bother discussing carbon pricing?\Amidst the hubbub of confirmation hearings and investigations, and the furor surrounding the upcoming midterm elections, many may have missed the article on the front page of the Billings Gazette and many other media outlets earlier this month discussing the new report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released on October 8.\The report, titled the Special Report on 1.5 C, or SR15, suggests that unless we are able to dramatically decrease the amount of greenhouse gases being dumped into the atmosphere by 2030 we will see severe changes as soon as 2040— much sooner than was previously thought. More frequent and more intense heat waves, longer droughts, and more wildfires are expected. Coral reefs, which are the source of many of the fish humans get from the oceans, could disappear due to the combination of warming temperatures and ocean acidification.\Though sea level and more intense hurricanes seem distant from the plains, Montanans will have to deal with decreased crop production from heat effects and water shortages, as well as even more wildfire smoke. Over 90 scientists reviewed 6,000 studies to develop the conclusions in the report.\The conclusions in the IPCC report should make us uncomfortable. If we aren't worried, we do not understand the report's implications. In order to prevent those dire predictions from becoming reality we need to make some significant changes in what goes into our air.\It will not be easy, but it can be done. No one company, political party, nation or region can do it alone. But, putting a price on carbon offers Americans immediate returns and is a big step toward preventing those dire forecasts. Many other countries, including China, are already working on this.\Carbon pricing alone will not be enough, but it is a start that benefits us all.\Climate change is the greatest group participation experiment in the history of the world; we can all win together."

""The edge is where you can have a true learning experience. "" -- Will Steger
\
Will Steger has been places very few others have seen, exploring and pioneering since his childhood in Minnesota, always ""seeking the edge. "" The renowned arctic explorer has spent some 45 years traveling more than 10, 000 miles by kayak and dogsled, through some of the world's most extreme terrain at both Poles. ""The edge is where you can have a true learning experience, "" Steger said Wednesday talking about clean-energy issues with business and environmental interest groups. These days, Steger has turned his passion for adventure to global climate change and clean energy because, he said, ""We are all on an edge right now, and it's an opportunity for us to think outside the box and learn what we can do. "" Steger conveyed his ""eyewitness account of climate change"" to a standing-room-only audience Wednesday night at the Museum of the Rockies' Hager Auditorium, using photos and stories of his adventures from Antarctica to the North Pole. ""He and his work are truly extraordinary, "" Rep. Phillips, D-Bozeman, said, introducing Steger to the crowd. Steger described his routes across various frozen landscapes, and the endless dog-sledding, kayaking and kite skiing required to travel thousands of miles in areas where the wind chill averages 70 to 100 degrees below freezing. But he said some of his old haunts have all but disappeared due to ""drastic change in the arctic environment. "" He showed maps of disappearing ice shelves and described places that have gone from dog-sled territory to canoe territory in less than a decade, ""taking scientists completely offguard. "" ""The science is very confusing, but seeing the changes firsthand can be empowering, "" Steger said. ""And then we need to try and make those observations into solutions. "" Sometimes, Steger said, he feels as if he is preaching to the choir when he talks about climate change, so he makes a concerted effort to visit conservative areas where there is a lot of skepticism. ""Science is always a matter of percentage, "" Steger said, ""so nothing is ever certain, but I have witnessed these changes firsthand. "" To critics of climatechange science, he points out three interrelated issues that he said must be addressed equally: ""the climate crisis, the economic crisis and national security. "" The shaky state of the global economy is one of the best reasons to support climate-change legislation, ""no matter what side of politics you see it from, "" Steger said. ""If we can become entirely self-reliant on clean energy, the billion dollars a day we spend on foreign oil would stay in our economy, "" he said. ""It would be like a free stimulus package every day. "" Obstacles in the political arena have come to define climate change, but Steger believes there will be advancements soon simply because ""the clock has literally run out. "" ""They're too busy distorting the facts, "" he said, pointing to a time-lapse video of a disintegrating ice shelf. ""But our elected officials really need to see this. "" Pete Strom, CFO of PowerHouse Integrated Conservation Systems in Bozeman, attended the afternoon session and agreed with Steger. ""There's the potential for 13, 000 clean-energy jobs in Montana, but it's critical that this happens now, "" Strom said after the session. A member of the Montana Business Leaders for Clean Energy, which has lobbied in Washington for clean-energy initiatives, Strom said the United States needs a ""market signal"" to incorporate climate change legislation into the free market, using cap-and-trade policies. ""China is already spending $12 million per hour for clean energy, and the longer we wait, the further we fall behind, "" he said.

23,"Following two of the most destructive years for climate catastrophes, President Obama is now calling for a ""wide-ranging"" conversation with scientists. Let's talk.\As scientists who've together spent decades studying how and why our climate is changing, we welcome that opportunity. ""Frankenstorm"" Sandy brought a message for you and all of us: climate change impacts are here now, right now.\Climate change clearly contributed to Hurricane Sandy, one of the most destructive superstorms in U.S. history. On the stretch of the Atlantic Coast where we call home, sea level is rising four times faster than the global average. Global warming is heating the Atlantic Ocean and increasing atmospheric water vapor loading, both of which contributed to Sandy's power and deluge.\Were Sandy just a single disaster, the story might end there. Unfortunately it is not. The insurance giant Munich Re reports annual weather-related loss events have quintupled in the United States, costing Americans more than a trillion dollars.\This year we have suffered through a string of record-breaking extreme weather events, all worsened by climate change. These included ""Summer in March,"" the hottest month in U.S. history (July 2012), the worst drought since the 1950s and a wildfire season that is rivaling the worst ever, a record set only six year ago. In 2011, the United States broke its record for the most billion-dollar weather disasters in a year: 14 totaling $47 billion. And this year's number of disasters puts it on track to be No. 2.\The last few years are part of a longer trend of climatic disruption that is impacting communities and the world here and now. Already, observations indicate that the ranges of more than a thousand species are shifting poleward and up mountainsides to escape the increasing heat; CO2-driven ocean acidification is starting to dissolve coral reefs; the number of regions experiencing drought have doubled since the 1970s; over the last 10 years, wildfires in the American West burned twice as much land area each year as they did just 40 years ago; twice as many new high temperature records have been set in the past decade compared to new record lows; and both the minimum area and minimum volume of Arctic sea ice each summer are well below their values of 30 years ago with new records set in 2012.\The danger of such large changes, accompanied by an increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather, loss of biodiversity, imperiled food systems, a 2-to-4-foot sea level rise, and myriad national security risks, will present enormous challenges to our nation's infrastructure and landscapes and to the well-being of people and communities around the globe.\An increasingly disruptive climate and a bankrupt nation could be the legacy we leave our children. According to projections presented to the U.S. Congress by Tufts University economist Frank Ackerman, inaction will cost our nation more than 1 percent of GDP by 2025 ? more than $200 billion a year. And costs will skyrocket from there to an estimated $1.8 trillion a year by 2100.\The next four years ? the second term of President Obama's administration ? will be critical. Faith Birol, chief economist for the usually conservative International Energy Agency, has repeatedly said that real progress toward a low-carbon economy needs to start very soon to avoid warming of 6 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century.\Patience and credence can no longer be given to those denying climate change. The delays that these so-called ""skeptics"" and vested fossil-fuel interests are causing in the face of convincing detection and attribution only increase the staggering costs of adaptation and relocation.\Having seen the impacts of Sandy, at least a few leaders in Washington seem poised to acknowledge what scientific analyses have clearly shown: human activities are causing climate disruption. Whether encouraged and forced by regulations, product standards, a cap-and-trade policy, or a carbon tax (possibly with a proportional dividend to every American), we need a national policy to initiate the transition to a low-carbon economy.\According to Bloomberg Finance, the best wind farms in the world already produce power as economically as coal, gas and nuclear generators, and solar energy is proving a good investment in many states. Iowa now generates nearly 20 percent of its electricity from wind energy and Colorado and Oregon more than 10 percent.\Clean energy is the fastest-growing industry in the U.S. today, growing at a rate of 8.3 percent, creating vital American jobs despite the depressed economy and the fact that over the past century fossil fuels have received subsidies 75 times the size of those for renewables since the mid-1990s.\We saw inspiring political leadership when Sandy struck. Now we need equally bold and visionary action that taps into the best in ingenuity and technology that our country has to offer. Encouraging both economic development and environmental well-being requires creation of a modern, clean energy system that protects both our nation and our environment.\The scientific community is eager to engage in the conversation the President seeks, but we all must recognize that the conversation must turn quickly from talk to action. This story can have an ending we can live with. It is up to us.\Michael MacCracken is chief scientist for Climate Change Programs at the Climate Institute in Washington. James J. McCarthy is a professor of ocean science at Harvard University and former president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.\ID_Code: G1-312080027"
24,"After an investment of $408 million and a year of rapid construction, the first coal train will leave the Signal Peak Energy Mine near Roundup next week, carrying the first load of low-sulfur Montana coal east to an Ohio utility.\A new railroad junction near Broadview and the mine site south of Roundup were officially dedicated Wednesday, by top executives from BNSF Railway; FirstEnergy, an Ohio utility; the Boich Group of Ohio; Signal Peak Energy; and a corral of Montana politicians, including Gov. Brian Schweitzer.\In the early 1990s, efforts began anew to reopen the mine, then owned by the Bull Mountain Coal Co. But the attempts were unsuccessful and a string of lawsuits followed.\BNSF Chairman and Chief Executive Matt Rose, who traveled to Montana for Wednesday's ribbon-cutting ceremonies, said that after many years of talk, ""nothing ever happened.""\But in the spring of 2008, when the Boich Group of Ohio and an Ohio utility, FirstEnergy, teamed up to buy the mine, Rose said he became convinced they were going to be successful. And other key players are taking a fresh look at this Montana mine as well, he said.\""It really does make people start to reconsider how the quality coal can be used in their portfolio,"" Rose said. ""Coal will remain a very large piece of our energy future.""\Coal currently produces 52 percent of the electricity consumed in the U.S.\The rail spur ties into the BNSF main line three miles south of Broadview at a crossing that was named ""Walter"" on Wednesday in honor of the world's oldest man, 112-year-old Walter Breuning of Great Falls. For half a century, the Montanan worked for BNSF's predecessor, the Great Northern Railway.\The Boich Group and FirstEnergy are 50/50 owners in the Signal Peak project. The 36-mile rail spur cost $105 million.\In one year, the mine site progressed from a few older buildings and little external infrastructure to a large industrial complex.\The mine site has a new office, warehouse and shop; a wash plant capable of cleaning 2,000 tons of coal an hour; two giant storage silos; an extensive conveyor system; and the railroad spur.\""It's not just the rail, there was a whole infrastructure built,"" said Signal Peak Energy President John DeMichiei.\A six-car VIP train with plush silver Pullman coaches from the 1940s and '50s carried the delegation from the Walter junction to the mine. As the silos and mine came into sight, the crowd cheered.\""Governor, this is a different place from a year ago,"" Wayne M. Boich, chief executive of the Boich Group, said to Schweitzer.\The Bull Mountain mine is going to be the most productive underground mine of its kind in the country, he said.\""We've never owned mines in the West, so this is a new spot for us, and it should be a big coal: 10,300 British thermal one,"" he said.\The mine employs 190 people and, along with the railroad, is expected to pay $28 million per year in federal and state taxes.\The first 120- to-140-car train is expected to leave the mine for Ohio on Sept. 9.\Boich said the coal will be marketed across the United States and to the Pacific Rim countries.\But the U.S. coal market is depressed right now, largely due to a mild summer and a slowdown in manufacturing.\In its most recent quarterly financial report, BNSF said its overall freight revenues dropped 26 percent from the previous year. Rose called this ""an extremely difficult economic environment.""\But on the train ride to the mine, Rose pointed out that U.S. manufacturing is growing for the first time in 18 months. The country's 100 million tons of surplus coal will be used up when the manufacturing sector is healthy again and the climate returns to more normal temperatures, he said.\FirstEnergy Chief Executive Tony Alexander said that in a good year his utility burns about 20 million tons of coal. The Signal Peak mine is expected to supply 7 million tons, or about one-third, of FirstEnergy's needs when it is running at full capacity next year.\Alexander said his utility signed a long-term contract with BNSF and a contract of up to 20 years with Signal Peak.\""This is one of the best resources we've seen,"" he said.\The Montana coal has more heat per ton than Powder River coal: 10,300 British thermal units compared to 8,000 Btus. That means FirstEnergy can ship less coal to produce the same energy, which helps\make up for railroad shipping costs, Alexander said.\""The combination of those allows this coal to compete in Ohio with alternative fuels,"" he said.\At maximum capacity, the Signal Peak mine can load seven trains per day of 120 to 150 cars.\Schweitzer, Rose and Alexander all agreed that the proposed cap-and-trade legislation to curtail greenhouse gas emissions, especially from coal, lacks enough votes to clear Congress.\As an alternative, Schweitzer said he would tax producers $12 per ton of carbon dioxide and use the money exclusively to develop better technology to sequester the gas. When that is accomplished, the U.S. could sell that technology to the world, he said.\""We're behind the Chinese in coal gasification. We're behind the Chinese developing other energy resources. How the hell did that happen?"" he said.\Montana State Sen. Kelly Gephardt of Roundup put the mine's opening in perspective by pointing out that the last commercial coal mine in Musselshell County closed nearly a half century ago.\""In 1991, I was county commissioner when we had an announcement at the end of Main Street that the mine project was going to go. Now 18 years later, we're seeing the ribbon cutting,"" he said. ""Forty six years we've been waiting for amine to get going in Musselshell County again."""
25,"HELENA ? Gov. Brian Schweitzer and Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall are turning to taxpayers to help fund a massive carbon sequestration demonstration project they say could be a major first step in solving the global carbon crisis.\""Almost 99.999 percent ... of the coal plants produce their electricity through a pulverized coal process, which means once the coal is burned, then lots of things go up the smokestack,"" said Schweitzer, one of the nation's most vocal proponents of so-called ""clean coal"" technology. ""Everybody who is studying this knows that if we want to decrease CO2 in a meaningful way, we have to attack those existing smokestacks.""\According to Schweitzer, here are the basics of what the proposed $250-million Canadian-Montana project would entail:\Capture about 1,000 tons of the CO2 emitted from SaskPower's Poplar River coal-fired generating station near Coronach, Saskatchewan.\Pipe the captured CO2 about 50 miles to northeastern Montana.\Inject the pressurized and liquefied CO2 about 6,000 feet deep into the earth into a geological formation called the Bowdoin Dome in northeastern Montana.\Monitor the CO2 once it's sequestered beneath the earth.\After scientists are satisfied that the CO2 will stay in place and not pollute groundwater or migrate to the surface, pump the CO2 back out of the ground and use it for advanced oil recovery in the Bakken oil fields. Injecting the CO2 into oil-bearing stratum would push oil into the piping network and up to the surface.\But some observers say Montana isn't ready for a project like this because Montana lacks the regulatory framework for dealing with the complexities of sequestration and it's extremely expensive to do.\""Sequestration might be an alternative, but it is going to be very expensive and the potential danger from doing it poorly could have a significant impact not only on public health and the environment, but also on property rights and water quality,"" says Anne Hedges of the Montana Environmental Information Center in Helena. ""If we're going to go down this path, we should do it with extreme caution and with our eyes wide open.""\Proponents of the idea say something has to be done now to address the millions of tons of CO2 pouring out of existing smokestacks around the globe.\Schweitzer says Canadian researchers at the University of Regina have developed technology that will separate ""pure CO2"" from other stack pollutants. He says the proposed project would benefit Montana while addressing the carbon crisis.\""Think of a big tank down there,"" Schweitzer says of the Bowdoin Dome.""We pump a lot of CO2 in and we keep it there for several years and we continue to measure it. After we have demonstrated that, yes, you can geologically store (CO2)...we will be able to now take that CO2 back out and pipe it over to the Bakken oil field where we will get enhanced oil recovery and we will increase oil production by hundreds of millions of barrels.""\Schweitzer says he wants to secure about $100 million for the project from the $3 billion set aside in the federal economic stimulus package for sequestration research. He says the Canadian government and private energy companies would partner in the project, though he wouldn't disclose the names of those companies because of ""proprietary agreements with the Saskatchewan government.""\Environmentalists caution that the state lacks the necessary regulatory framework for dealing with large-scale subterranean CO2 storage, and that it may not be a wise investment given global economic circumstances.\""I think that we have to look at all options for controlling carbon emissions, and I think that sequestration will be a part of the puzzle,"" says Hedges. ""But I think when we consider the issues, we have to consider the costs and the benefits. And we have to take a look at alternatives that may be more cost effective.""\Why sequestration?\Those who working to address the world's growing energy crisis realize that if humans want to continue to enjoy all of the conveniences of the modern industrialized world then we're going to need a lot more energy in the future.\The federal government estimates that world energy consumption will rise by nearly 50 percent from 2005 levels by 2030, and more than half of the electricity we consume in this country comes from coal, the United States'?and Montana's?most abundant fuel source.\But generating electricity from coal comes with serious drawbacks. Coal-fired power plant produce tremendous amounts of CO2, the greenhouse gas most scientists agree is responsible for global warming.\While scientists are debating the extent to which human-caused CO2 is impacting the globe, lawmakers in Washington, D.C., and Helena are preparing for what they say will be an inevitable regulatory cap on CO2 emissions.\Plans for new coal-fired power plants have stalled throughout the country as investors wait to see what kind of carbon regulations come out of Washington, D.C. and how costly it will be for polluters to pump CO2 into the atmosphere.\With Democratic President Barack Obama in the White House and Democrats in control of Congress, most observers say legislation that penalizes CO2 polluters is on the horizon, likely through a carbon tax or a cap and trade system whereby the biggest polluters buy carbon credits from smaller emitters.\The Legislature\If developers are going to burn coal, they're going to need to find a way to deal with the CO2 other than pumping into the air.\With that in mind, lawmakers in Helena are considering a bill by Sen. Keith Bales, R-Otter, that would put a state carbon sequestration program under the supervision of the state Board of Oil and Gas Conservation.\""Whether or not you believe in global warming being caused by CO2, I think it's inherent upon us to have a program in place to sequester CO2,"" Bales said about Senate Bill 498 earlier this month.\After initially vowing to veto the measure because it didn't define ownership of the ""pore space"" beneath the surface where the CO2 would be stored, Schweitzer now says he supports the bill. A compromise version of the measure gives surface owners the ownership rights to the pore space beneath their land, Schweitzer says.\Under the legislation, developers would have to get a permit from the Board of Oil and Gas before they drill and inject carbon into the earth. Twenty years after pumping is complete, the companies could hand off liability and ownership of the CO2 reservoir to the state.\The measure was approved by the Senate and awaits a hearing in the House energy committee.\A bill that would regulate CO2 pipelines is also in the works. Rep. Duane Ankney, R-Colstrip, has proposed a measure that would give ""common carrier"" status to CO2 pipelines similar to oil and gas pipelines. House Bill 338 would allow private companies to use eminent domain to take private property to build the CO2 pipelines.\That bill passed the House and on Saturday easily cleared a key vote in the Senate. A final Senate vote is expected this week and then the bill heads to the governor where it will likely be signed.\Hedges says lawmakers are hastily acting on sequestration legislation without considering the possible long-term drawbacks of their actions.\""The path we're on should be to proceed with caution,"" says Hedges. ""So often that gets lost in the heat of a legislative session where everybody is just thinking about today. That's unfortunate because these are long-term issues and you're potentially saddling the state with long-term consequences.""\And Hedges says those consequences could be catastrophic.\But Schweitzer says the time is now to begin testing the future of carbon sequestration, and Montana can be a leader.\""We have coal. We need to clean up the coal and get the CO2 out of it,"" Schweitzer says. ""We can demonstrate that we can use (CO2) for enhanced oil recovery and along the way we can develop the technology to for geologically storing CO2.""\But Hedges says the state would be wise to consider alternatives before embarking on costly sequestration projects. She cautions against foregoing other opportunities such as funding for consumers to make homes more efficient with ground source heat pumps, solar panels and wind mills.\""Ultimately, sequestration is just a bridge technology to a more efficient future that is more reliant on renewable energy,"" Hedges says. ""We can decide to make the enormous investment in sequestration and then move forward with these efficient and renewable technologies, or we can just move straight to efficiencies and renewables.""\Reach Tribune Capitol Bureau Chief John S.

26,"CANBERRA, Australia -- In 2007, Australians were ready to do something to combat climate change, even if it was expensive.\More than two-thirds of them said so in a poll, and both major political parties vowed to make industries pay for greenhouse-gas emissions.\The undoing of that perspective will likely be complete after a new Senate is sworn in today. It's expected to give Prime Minister Tony Abbott the votes he needs to repeal a 2-year-old tax charged to around 350 of Australia's biggest carbon polluters. Three top political leaders lost their jobs over the issue as support for climate-change measures plummeted.\A global recession, political miscalculations and failed negotiations only partially explain the dramatic change.\Opponents of the carbon tax implemented in 2012 had the media largely on their side. Electricity prices soared -- not mainly because of the tax, but because power companies were spending billions on infrastructure. Most electricity users were compensated for the added cost of the tax, but many of them didn't know that. And rising gas prices fed the fury -- even though the tax didn't apply to gasoline.\Australia's experience illustrates how easy it is to scuttle complicated environmental laws, and serves as a warning to President Barack Obama, whose recent proposal to force a 30 percent cut in power plants' carbon emissions is drawing anger from both sides of politics.\""One of the keys was the fact that we did lose bipartisan support for emissions trading as one of the solutions,"" said John Connor, CEO of the Sydney-based Climate Institute think tank. ""And that then threw this issue into the sort of political and cultural trench warfare that you see in the U.S., but not so much of elsewhere.""\Australians' concerns about global warming peaked before elections in 2007. Prime Minister John Howard had grown unpopular for joining Washington in refusing to accept U.N. Kyoto Protocol targets for cutting carbon emissions. Both Australia and the U.S. are leading producers of coal, a major source of the pollution.\An annual poll by the Lowy Institute for International Policy shows the proportion of Australian voters who saw global warming as a serious problem that demanded immediate steps -- even at significant cost -- peaked at 68 percent in 2006. The telephone survey of 1,007 voters had a 3.1 percentage-point margin of error.\Facing defeat, Howard's conservative coalition back-flipped. Both sides advocated a cap-and-trade scheme in which free-market forces set the price of emitting a ton of carbon dioxide.\Kevin Rudd's center-left Labor Party won, but the Senate thwarted his efforts to introduce a cap-and-trade system. Some senators considered his plan too extreme, while others found it too weak. Meanwhile, the global economic crisis eclipsed the environment in Australian politics.\The government and the leader of Australia's conservative opposition, Malcolm Turnbull, were on the verge of a cap-and-trade deal in 2009. But Turnbull lost his leadership post to Abbott, then a senior opposition leader and a fierce opponent of the proposal.\Rudd shelved the plan. His popularity plummeted, and he lost his job in a Labor Party leadership vote to Julia Gillard.\The minor Greens party soon became pivotal. Rather than a cap-and-trade scheme, the Greens advocated a carbon tax in which government, not the market, set the price of pollution. After the 2010 election, Gillard needed the Greens' support to form a government. To get it, she agreed to a carbon tax, something she had vowed not to allow.\The tax, which went into effect in July 2012, charged major polluters a fixed price on carbon. It was to switch in mid-2015 to a cap-and-trade scheme.\Gillard and her government's popularity nose-dived. The 2012 Lowy poll showed support for costly steps to combat global warming hit bottom: 38 percent.\While Gillard's broken promise drove much of that anger, other forces were at work.\Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., which owns 70 percent of Australia's newspapers, supported Rudd in 2007 but by 2010 was backing Abbott. The top talk radio hosts in every major Australian city pushed the climate skeptic line.\Within days of the tax taking effect, Australia's consumer watchdog cautioned two companies that sold solar panels for falsely claiming electricity prices under the tax would rise 400 percent by 2019.\It was easy to attribute higher electricity costs to the tax. Between 2006 and last year, the average Australian household power bill increased more than 85 percent, the Grattan Institute think tank reported.\Opinion polls indicated Australians were overestimating the impact of the carbon tax.\A survey by the think tank Per Capita soon after the tax started found that most people blamed it for higher gasoline prices -- even though the tax didn't apply at the pump.\Most estimated the tax increased their weekly cost of living by 20 Australian dollars ($19) or more, about twice the government's estimate.\And while 90 percent of households received tax-related government compensation, half those surveyed said they hadn't received anything. The Per Capita online survey of 1,422 Australians did not publish a margin of error."
27,"Montana lawmakers are considering two bills to tax carbon pollution, and not surprisingly owners of Colstrip Power Plant say the measures would kill the facility.\Democratic legislators are floating two bills creating a $10-per-ton tax on carbon dioxide from various sources, including coal-fired power plants. Theirs aren’t the first attempts targeting Colstrip. Washington State, where 1.8 million customers draw power from utilities with Colstrip ownership shares, twice attemptedunsuccessfullyto tax greenhouse gases last year, first in the Legislature, then by initiative.\The message delivered to Montana lawmakers by carbon tax supporters is to impose a tax in Montana and reap the revenue, or draw none of the benefits when another state’s carbon tax bites Colstrip.\“At some point, there’s going to be a cost on carbon, and that’s either going to be imposed on the state of Montana, or you can be in the driver’s seat and we can collect that money at home,” said Ann Hedges of the Montana Environmental Information Center. “I think it’s a better idea that we collect the money here at home and that this state craft a market-based solution to the crisis that we are facing today.”\Hedges made her comments Jan. 31 during a legislative hearing about a carbon tax proposed by Rep. Mary Ann Dunwell, D-Helena. The hearing was the first of two spread over a week’s time in Helena. A second carbon tax proposal by Sen. Dick Barrett, D-Missoula, will be taken up Thursday.\Dunwell’s bill targets carbon emissions of 25,000 tons or more, meaning that small industrial polluters would avoid the tax. Still, there are 22 polluters who would pay. The businesses range from the Malteurop North America malting facility in Great Falls to the Colstrip Power Plant, according to EPA pollution data.\The malting business is the smallest polluter among the 22, with 33,704 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually. Colstrip tops the list at 14.3 million tons of carbon dioxide per year. The southeast Montana power plant has been identified as a top-15 producer of greenhouse gases by the Environmental Protection Agency.\All told, 22 businesses subject to the tax produce 20.8 million tons of carbon annually. The four biggest polluters after Colstrip are in the Billings area — Phillips 66 refinery, Yellowstone Energy Limited Partners, CHS refinery and ExxonMobil refinery.\Legislative fiscal analysts expect that $210 million a year in carbon taxes would be raised under Dunwell’s bill, $21 million of which would be dedicated to helping communities like Colstrip transition away from fossil fuel-based economies. The remaining money would go to general state government spending, or to programs supported by coal tax revenue, which has been declining for years.\Colstrip’s monopoly utility owners argue that a carbon tax means consumers will pay more for electricity. Dunwell counters that Montanans already pay a climate change price for carbon pollution.\Carbon dioxide emissions, most scientists conclude, contribute to the trapping of the sun’s heat within the earth’s environment, which warms the planet, causing adverse climate changes.\“Frankly there is a cost to society,” Dunwell said. “By emitting carbon in the atmosphere there’s a cost to our agriculture, to our tourism economy, to our outdoor economy, to our public health and our national security, and certainly our safety.”\The two Colstrip owners objecting to the carbon tax bills are NorthWestern Energy, Montana’s largest monopoly utility, and Avista Corp. of Spokane, Washington.\“Coal-fired power from Montana is an important part of Avista’s portfolio. It is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week and represents a good value for our retail customers,” said Tom Ebzery, Avista lobbyist.\Speaking at the Dunwell hearing, Ebzery acknowledged that challenges are mounting for Colstrip. Already, two of Colstrip’s four units are slated for shutdown no later than 2022 in order to settle an air pollution lawsuit. In Washington, Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee and legislators are attempting to end coal power consumption by 2025, a move that would shutter Colstrip entirely.\Even Avista, pressed by state regulators to come up with a power plan for a post-Colstrip era, has identified a way forward without the Montana power plant that has helped electrify the Pacific Northwest for more than 40 years. If the power plant’s regulated owners can’t use coal power, then Colstrip energy will have to be sold on the open market, where it already struggles to compete against cheaper energy sources, like natural gas.\“With Colstrip being exposed to the market, a carbon tax could price the power plant out of market and potentially kill the plant,” Ebzery said. “We may not like what the other states are doing, but that doesn’t mean that Montana should provide the last nail in the coffin at a plant that is a valuable asset and had been for many years.”\NorthWestern argued a carbon tax was regressive once the utility passed the cost on to consumers.\“Our customers are already paying taxes and fees each month for things beyond the service of electricity, for example property taxes alone account for nearly 15 percent of a bill,"" said David Hoffman, NorthWestern lobbyist. “A tax on electricity which is what this ultimately is, is one of the most regressive taxes you can think of. Every customer pays the same amount on usage regardless of income level or wealth.”\Dunwell said Wednesday that NorthWestern customers have paid a carbon fee for several years now. The utility baked a carbon fee into its 2014 purchase of hydroelectric dams from PPL, she said. The assumption was that a carbon tax was imminent. Once state regulators approved the $870 million sale, the carbon fee remained in the 30-year dam payment plan passed onto customers, creating an additional $247 million burden for ratepayers. The actual tax never materialized.\Barrett’s bill works a little differently than Dunwell’s. It creates a $10-per-ton tax on carbon dioxide, but only on power plants. It creates incentives for companies to offset their carbon pollution by investing in renewable energy. Barrett's plan uses revenue raised through carbon taxes to lower the property tax burdens of certain low-income Montana homeowners and renters.\The state-level push for carbon taxes is a response to the federal withdrawal of the Obama-era Clean Power Plan and the Paris Climate Agreement."
28,"The one thing Avista Corp made clear to Montana utility regulators Thursday is that it will not give a shutdown date for Colstrip Power Plant, even as it plans to be financially ready to do so in nine years — and even though it’s offered the coal burner’s host community $4.5 million to prepare for the end.\Colstrip is on shaky ground. The first two of its four units are scheduled to shut down in five years or less. The power plant’s operator, Talen Energy, once entertained leaving by May 2018, citing financial losses, before backing down. Westmoreland Coal Co., the owner of the coal mine that feeds Colstrip, is eyeing bankruptcy. Cheap natural gas has replaced coal as the dominant energy source for U.S. electricity production.\But no one can say how long Colstrip might last, said Jason Thackston, Avista’s senior vice president of energy resources. He was speaking on Thursday to the Montana Public Service Commission, whose approval Avista needs for its $5.3 billion sale to Ontario, Canada, utility Hydro One. He promised not to leave the power plant's namesake community of 2,300 people holding the bag.\“This isn’t it, in terms of how were going to partner and come alongside the community and the affected employees,” Thackston said. “There will be a day, we don’t know when, Colstrip will be shut down, Units 3 and 4, and we’re committed as long as we’re one of the owners. We’re committed to be in dialogue with the community, with other affected people, including employees, with our other five owners and Talen as operator, or whoever the operator is in the future.”\Avista owns 15 percent of the Colstrip Units 3 and 4. The Spokane, Washington, utility relies on Colstrip for 10 percent of its power. And Colstrip has been a point of concern as Avista compels utility commissions in the five states to sign off on its sale. Each state has Avista customers, which is why regulators have a say about the sale.\In Washington and Idaho, Avista agreed to accelerate its depreciation schedule of Units 3 and 4 to reflect a December 2027 end to the units’ “remaining useful life.” It is the second of Colstrip Power Plant’s six utility owners to do so. Seattle-based Puget Sound Energy, Colstrip’s biggest stakeholder, made the same adjustment last year.\In Oregon, Colstrip co-owner Portland General Electric is winding down its coal use, with 2035 as its projected cut-off date. PacifiCorp, also a Colstrip owner, will stop selling coal power to Oregon customers in 2030. The Oregon citizenry, concerned about climate change, demanded utilities pull the plug on coal power.\Owners Talen, of Pennsylvania, and NorthWestern Energy, Montana's largest utility, haven't made similar adjustments.\Thackston and other Avista officials encouraged Montana’s utility commissioners not to get hung up on words like depreciation schedule and remaining useful life, arguing that the December date was just part of an accounting exercise, that although Avista’s share of the money to shutter Colstrip would be on hand in nine years, Units 3 and 4 could burn longer, so long as coal power remained economically viable.\Besides, Thackston said, all six Colstrip owners have to agree to shutting down the power plant.\“In isolation, the depreciation rate for Colstrip would be 2034 and 2035, respectively, just as it has been,” Thackston told the commission. In other words, Avista still suggests Units 3 and 4 without the changes in affordability or regulations, could burn 17 more years. In other Avista testimony, the 2027 end-of-useful-life date was described as something insignificant that was agreed to in order to placate Washington environmentalists who want Colstrip shut down.\But words do matter, said PSC Vice-Chairman Travis Kavulla. And words like depreciation have meaning in the utility business.\“This assertion that depreciation isn’t tied to remaining useful life is puzzling to me because, I think you’d agree with me, when you open the big utility regulator textbook, depreciation is by definition the expected remaining useful life of an asset, isn’t it?” Kavulla asked Thackston. “This novel view of depreciation as just sort of a choose-your-own-adventure novel doesn’t find a home in any of the literature about utility regulation, right?”\As a commissioner, Kavulla represents a swath of Eastern Montana from Great Falls to Glendive.\Ahead of the hearing, Montana’s Public Service Commission had asked Avista for examples of depreciation and end of useful life used in other cases with the same meaning Avista is suggesting applies now. Avista produced no examples. At the hearing, Thackston pointed to Puget using the terms similarly to Avista as a precedent.\The closing of Colstrip is a topic with which few, if any, Montana politicians will make eye contact. Kavulla described Colstrip’ fate as one of the top five political issues in the state.\However, most of the PSC was willing to minimize depreciation schedules, as Avista persuaded.\“The deprecation conversation quite frankly does not concern me a great amount, anywhere near the regulation side of it,” said Bob Lake, PSC commissioner for northwest Montana, including Missoula. Lake was more concerned about Washington State imposing a tax on carbon pollution that would make Colstrip power too expensive. Voters in that state will vote on a carbon pollution tax this November. “If a state imposes a state carbon tax, whatever you want to call it, a fee or whatever, that makes it appear to be non-economic to continue to run.”\Washington’s Utility and Transportation Commission is turning its attention to the affordability of Colstrip power. Three Colstrip Power Plant owners do business in Washington: Avista, Puget and PacifiCorp. The UTC wants all three to calculate at what point Colstrip power would no longer be affordable. The utilities have to report back next year. The request comes after the utilities were required to report in 2017 where they would get power to replace Colstrip electricity.\Thackston said the formula the utilities are being asked to use to calculate Colstrip affordability assumes a carbon pollution cost of $46 a ton. At that price, Colstrip would be priced out of the market quickly, he said.\Colstrip is one of the West’s biggest producers of greenhouse gases, churning out about 16 to 20 million metric tons of carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide annually, according to the Environmental Protection Agency."
29,"Editor's note: The deadline for Letters to the Editor about the Nov. 6 election is 5 p.m. Wednesday.\Supports Bullock\In contrast to Rick Hill, Steve Bullock will allow Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks to complete the already-begun environmental-impact statement to analyze proposals for restoring wild bison somewhere in Montana. Hill apparently would deny any restoration of wild bison and has chastised FWP and its commission for beginning the public analysis process.\Two recent polls indicate that almost 70 percent of Montana voters support restoration of wild bison in Montana, especially on the Charles M. Russell National Wildlife Refuge. Years ago, the Montana Legislature developed the Montana Environmental Protection Act to, among other goals, ""fulfill the responsibilities of each generation as trustee of the environment for succeeding generations."" MEPA mandates analysis of controversial environmental issues, public disclosure of good and bad impacts of management options, and subsequent public input regarding those options. It is the established way for Montanans to become informed and reason together on controversial issues.\Hill's positions on bison restoration and his criticism of FWP's mandated and orderly process for considering bison restoration are an attempt to gratify a minority of Montanans. Bullock disagrees, demonstrating his strong recognition of the democratic process in Montana.

I vividly remember looking at my wife and asking her, ""What now?""\I decided to walk into Rehberg's office in Billings.

Barack Obama will push hard for if he gets re-elected. The first is cap and trade, also known as cap and tax. This is a carbon-emissions tax that taxes energy and manufacturing with the end-payer being consumers.\The second tax is the carbon tax which is a tax on the carbon content of fuel. As 85 percent of America's energy needs are met by natural gas, coal and oil, this tax will directly raise the cost of gasoline, natural gas, electricity, diesel fuel and propane. Of course, as any business is hit with higher costs, they are passed on to the consumer.\The third tax is the value-added tax, also known as a national sales tax. It is levied on a product's value added at each stage of production with you, the consumer, being the end-payer.\These will not be temporary taxes; they will be permanent. It doesn't matter your politics or income level, you will be paying these taxes if enacted. Obama, though, will need the help of wasteful spenders, Sen.

When you rely on the predator to inform a life-or-death vote on its prey, the special interest predator is the only beneficiary.\Montanans, call the five lord high executioners of diminishing wildlife populations at the FWP and tell them to:\1) Repeal their uninformed vote allowing the trapping of five wolverines.\2) Stop pandering to trappers who regard the trapping of a wolverine ""the height of expertise in the trapping culture.""\3) Do their homework. There is hard, factual science out there from data published in peer-reviewed journals by field biologists. See the Petition to End the Trapping of Wolverine in Montana, www.westernlaw.org.\The wolverine is fighting for survival as climate change melts away nursery glaciers, as traps that don't discriminate ""catch"" are laid, as high-elevation recreationists drop from the skies into wolverine habitat and more roads divide the back country. Knowing this animal has been warranted for endangered species listing, don't our FWP commissioners owe its existence an informed vote?\?Pat Helvey,\East Helena\Bad employers don't deserve protective unbrella\I disagree with the Oct. 8 legal reform op/ed article, specifically the comment about Montana's wrongful-discharge laws and the role of trial attorneys in creating an adverse environment for Montana businesses.\I am a member of the Montana Chamber of Commerce, a transactional attorney and owner of multiple businesses for more than 36 years. I have employed countless employees and terminated numerous employees, or they left for their own reasons. I was sued once for wrongful termination. I won, and my business was not destroyed.\I have witnessed a close family member become the subject of wrongful termination. The employer's wrongful actions were financially devastating for the employee and her family and equally devastating to her sense of dignity. Bad employers in Montana do not deserve the same protective umbrella as the thousands of businesses who provide safe and dignified workplaces.\Wrongful-termination laws in Montana never fully compensate the employee no matter how good their case or their attorney's skills. There is no compensation for emotional distress. Statutory ""caps"" limit the employee to four years of lost wages and benefits. Income from a new job or income imputed to the employee offsets any recovery.\Thankfully, a Montana trial attorney is helping my family member regain some of her monetary loss and dignity. I hope anyone who finds themselves in a similar situation will have the benefit of a professional trial attorney to assist them.\?Max A. Hansen,\Dillon\God cares for us all\In her letter to the editor, Gloria Burrow asked how any thinking woman could support the Republican Party. Well, I am a thinking woman who seems to think that there are more important rights out there that women deserve and need rather than the choice to end the life of her child.\She states that Paul Ryan and other Republicans are against women and their rights. Since when did someone become a bad person because he or she believes taking a human life is wrong? To me, be they Republican or Democrat, those who believe in the sanctity of life are the modern-day Christians who suffer persecution for their beliefs.\In answer to Benny Potter's letter, there is someone in the voting booth with you, and God does care about us all.\?Karen Grove,\Great Falls\Support Glover\Tom Glover is an educator and a business owner. He is a community leader and an innovator. Most importantly, I know Tom Glover as my dad. I am so excited to support his race for House District 24. Great Falls could not ask for a more compassionate and forward-thinking candidate for the Montana House.\Despite the onslaught of money and negativity in this year's election season, I hope that Montanans look to values and leadership in making their vote. My dad taught my sister and me to listen first, talk later. He taught us patience, and he taught us to care about other people and look out for those less fortunate. He spent most of his career as a teacher working with students with special needs, and he has lived the ideals he taught us every day of his life.\Glover will represent his district because he will listen to his constituents, and he cares about their lives and the future of Great Falls. I have worked at a number of sessions with the Montana Legislature, and sadly, all too often money and power motivate many representatives, rather than values and hard work.\Residents of HD 24, a vote for Tom Glover is a vote for a candidate who will listen to you, represent you and work hard for you. He will take your ideas to Helena, and he will work with you to continually improve the community of Great Falls.\?Annie Glover,\Helena\Protect collective bargaining\Currently, collective bargaining is being attacked. It is my feeling that collective bargaining is how our nation was formed. If the 13 colonies had not come together collectively, they could not have escaped the tyranny of King George III. Bargaining separately, they would have been easily defeated.\So if you truly are American, vote to protect collective bargaining.\?Jerry Ferderer,\Great Falls\Obama, Tester need to go\I can't believe all the recent letters from whiny Democrat women focused solely on their reproductive organs. In the immortal words of Pres. Bill Clinton's adviser, James Carville, "" It's the economy, stupid."" If there is a war on women, its an economic war, and it's being waged against not just women but families. Under Pres. Barack Obama and his 95-percent-of-the-time sidekick, Sen. Jon Tester, family incomes have dropped by more than $4,000 per year.\Make no mistake about it, women are worried. And they're not just worried about themselves. They're worried about their children's future. They don't want them to be saddled with debt from our generation which has surpassed a record-high $16 trillion. The new women's issues are economic security, job growth, lower taxes and reasonable federal spending. I fail to see how dependence on food stamps and free birth control is a path to strength and independence. It's highly offensive that the Obama/ Tester campaigns think women either haven't noticed ? or just don't care ? how devastating this administration's failed economic policies have been for us.\Obama and Tester have been urging women to ""vote like their lady parts depend on it."" I will vote with my most important lady part, my brain. Obama and Tester need to go.\?Cyndi Baker,\Great Falls\Supports Loney\I am a neighbor of Jan Cahill, chairman of the board of trustees for Great Falls Public Schools. I noticed that several weeks ago, he put a Cleve Loney sign in his front yard. Obviously, he is supporting Loney over his opponent in the House District 25 race.\This kind of punches a hole in Dennis Granlie's recent letter stating that Loney is somehow anti-education. I would assume the chairman of the school board would be deeply interested and informed as to which candidate would be the better one with regard to education issues.\Letter-writers such as Granlie are entitled to their own opinions but not to their own facts. Loney supports our public education system. This is only one of the reasons he was awarded a ""Good Apple"" award by the district. Loney is proud of his award as well as his work on behalf of the Great Falls Public Schools. Vote to re-elect Cleve Loney in HD 25.\?Maria Acord,\Great Falls"

32,"WASHINGTON— Here's how area members of Congress voted on major issues in the week ending July 20.\HOUSE\* GOP STATEMENT AGAINST CARBON TAX: Voting 229 for and 180 against, the House on July 19 adopted a nonbinding GOP statement of opposition to proposals that would put a new tax on the use of coal, natural gas and petroleum products in order to discourage their use and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide. The measure (H Con Res 119) asserted that a carbon tax ""would be detrimental to American families and businesses and is not in the best interest of the United States."" Critics defended such a tax as a cost-efficient and equitable way to reduce toxic emissions while generating revenue to help those most affected by the higher cost of using fossil fuels.\A yes vote was to adopt the resolution.\MONTANA\Voting yes: Rep. Greg Gianforte, (R-Mont.)\WYOMING\Voting yes: Rep. Liz Cheney, (R-Wyo.)\* RESTORING ELECTION-SECURITY FUNDS FOR STATES: Voting 182 for and 232 against, the House on July 19 defeated a Democratic attempt to add funding for Election Assistance Commission (EAC) grants for states to a 2019 spending bill (HR 6147, below). The underlying bill ""zeroed out"" funding in the new fiscal year for these grants, which have been used since 2003 to help states upgrade voting machines and fortify electoral systems. On this vote, Democrats sought to restore funding to the 2018 level of $380 million. At least 40 states use outdated voting machines and 13 states employ machines that fail to generate paper backups to electronic voting files, according to debate.\A yes vote was to provide $380 million in electoral grants to states next fiscal year.\MONTANA\Voting no: Gianforte\WYOMING\Voting no: Cheney\* 2019 BUDGET FOR ENVIRONMENT, TREASURY, DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA: Voting 217 for and 199 against, the House on July 19 approved a $58.7 billion appropriations bill (HR 6147) for the Treasury and Interior departments, federal judiciary, District of Columbia and numerous related agencies in fiscal 2019. In part, the bill would cut the Environmental Protection Administration budget by $100 million to $7.96 billion; put Congress in control of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau budget; set aside $585 million that could not be spent until Congress eliminates annual deficits; increase the Internal Revenue Service budget by $186 million to $11.6 billion; prohibit the Securities and Exchange Commission from requiring disclosure of political contributions to shareholders and appropriate $3.9 billion for fighting and preventing forest fires. In addition, the bill would fund a $751 million federal payment to the District of Columbia while repealing the federal city`s Death With Dignity Act and providing $45 million for vouchers used by some D.C. students to transfer to private and parochial schools. The bill also would raise the Indian Health Service budget by $370 million to $5.9 billion; prohibit regulation of the lead content of ammunition and fishing tackle; scale back certain Clean Water Act and Endangered Species Act regulations and provide $21 million for developing an early warning system for West Coast earthquakes.\A yes vote was to pass the bill.\MONTANA\Voting yes: Gianforte\WYOMING\Voting yes: Cheney\* AGREEMENT WITH SPEAKER ON RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE: Voting 230 for and 183 against, the House on July 17 blocked a Democratic bid for floor debate on a measure (H Res 999) that would formally enshrine Speaker Paul Ryan`s written statement that there is ""no question"" that Russia intervened in the 2016 presidential campaign and continues to interfere with U.S. elections. Ryan commented after President Trump, in a news conference in Helsinki, sided with Russian President Vladimir Putin over U.S. intelligence agencies when asked about Russian interference in his contest against Hillary Clinton.

33,"We read with interest Public Service Commissioner Bob Raney's guest opinion appearing on the Dec. 2 Tribune editorial page. Commissioner Raney raised several questions about the city's participation in the Highwood Generating Station project and suggested that Great Falls citizens might ask these questions as well.\We appreciate Commissioner Raney's queries because it gives us an opportunity to clear up factual errors and misconceptions about the project. We will address the points Mr. Raney made more or less in the order he made them.\*How Many Years?First, Mr. Raney asserts throughout that HGS customers will be obligated ""to pay for the Highwood plant for about 60 years."" This is incorrect. The city's share of the plant will be financed for 30 years and the co-ops' share will be financed for 34 years. No contractual or service territory obligation will extend beyond these periods for city customers or co-op customers.\*Montana's Monopoly System: What Has It Wrought? Second, the Commissioner describes the Montana Default Supply system whereby NorthWestern Energy provides all transmission and distribution services, purchases electricity for customers, and does all the billing for most residential customers not served by rural electric cooperatives. The PSC oversees all of this and protects our interests.\Montana's system is unique in all eleven Western states, plus the Dakotas and Nebraska. Montana is the only state among these that has no provision in its laws for public municipal or public utility district power. Other states have the philosophy that a mixture of power agencies (including municipals and investor-owned utilities, or IOUs) provides incentive for all of them to keep their rates down.\Franklin Roosevelt once compared the option of having public power to having ""a birch rod in the cupboard,"" to be taken out and used when the child (IOU) gets beyond the point where a mere scolding does no good. Montana's default supply rates are among the highest in the region and will soon be higher. Why does Montana, like the proverbial horse, insist on running back into the burning barn of monopolistic electricity control? Is monopoly tempered by the paternalism of government regulation really such a good thing? Where has it got us?\*Electricity Surpluses and Deficiencies.Third, a number of questions are raised about plant operations, where excess electricity will be sold, where electricity will be obtained when the plant is down for maintenance, etc. A brief explanation of how the plant will function will help answer these questions.\By the time the plant comes on line in 2011, most of its electricity will be committed either to co-op customers or city customers. Mr. Raney is correct that there will be surpluses and deficiencies from time to time because electricity use is uneven throughout the day and differs by season. And the plant will have to shut down for periodic maintenance.\Southern Montana Electric, the plant's developer and operator, has reserved transmission capacity all the way to the West Coast so that it can sell its surpluses and buy its deficiencies in as large a marketplace as possible.\Moreover, it is negotiating an agreement with a West Coast utility to provide reserves for plant outages in exchange for recurring plant surpluses at other times. Therefore, the surplus/deficiency issue is being covered in more than one way and has been built into plant economics from the beginning.\*Plant Economics.Fourth, Commissioner Raney raises several questions about plant economics, inflationary cost increases, cost of electricity and so on. We could refute or elaborate on each of these things, but no one needs to take our word for it.\The city's share of the electricity from HGS will be sold to public, tax-supported agencies and to local industries that provide jobs for Great Falls residents. The cost of electricity from the plant must be economically attractive or customers will not contract to purchase it.\To demonstrate that the economics work and are favorable, and to sell its revenue bonds to provide financing, the city will have to hire an independent, third party, nationally recognized engineering firm to review and opine on plant technological and economic feasibility and practicality.\If they find that economic projections for the project are valid, then the advantages to purchasing its electricity will be self-evident. This study will be done over the next six weeks.\*Other Issues. Fifth, Mr. Raney labels HGS a ""pulverized coal plant."" It is not a pulverized coal plant. It is a state-of-the-art circulating fluidized bed coal-fired plant. It will burn small gravel-sized coal mixed with limestone to remove certain air pollutants. By the way, the independent, third-party engineer will also evaluate plant technology and its suitability for fulfilling the needs of the city and, by implication, the co-ops.\Sixth, Commissioner Raney raises the specter of future taxes on carbon dioxide emissions and their impact on the cost of Highwood produced electricity. Our independent engineer will look at this question also, but we believe the real question is: What will carbon taxes do to the overall market price of electricity?\Electricity prices are increasingly based on market pricing. Buyers try to even out volatile market fluctuations by locking in long-term contracts when prices are lower and/or by building their own generation. SME is doing both of these things as their cost-based U.S. government power is going away.\If you don't believe power cost is market-based, take a look at your power bills over the past few years and see if they have gone up. One of the reasons the default rate Montanans pay has increased so much is that NWE has been exposed to market purchases of electricity since the generation assets were sold off after deregulation.\With more than 50 percent of American electrical power based on coal, a carbon tax will simply raise all electricity prices. Can anyone imagine a commercial power generator selling electricity based on cost of production when everyone else is selling at market in an environment of rising prices? We think not.\The only way to beat an increase in market prices from carbon taxation, or at least to mitigate it, would be to produce cost-based power with something cheaper than coal for a more or less closed market.\SME will use coal as its base resource and then supplement it with wind and other sources to keep power costs as low as possible.\Unfortunately, there is very little anyone can do to avoid the price increases a carbon tax will place on the market price for electricity. There will be no more hydro projects, no more nuclear (at least for a while), gas is likely to continue to be higher cost relative to other energy, and renewables like wind will continue to be supplemental sources, not base load.\In short, we are all going to pay, especially in Montana where 60 percent of our electricity is coal based.\*Power for the People? Not. Finally, Public Service Commissioner Raney mentions ""the people of Great Falls"" and ""citizens of Great Falls"" as if they were going to receive and pay for Highwood electricity.\Mr. Raney well knows that according to Montana laws, the city could not offer electricity beyond its currently authorized 20-customer pilot program to residents generally, even if it were free. Nor can the city, by law, obligate its citizens for the revenue bonds that will be sold to finance the plant.\Except for certain large customers, as Great Falls citizens we must buy electricity from NorthWestern Energy, or whichever global entity ends up owning it, with the oversight of the PSC.\Even though we will not be able to sell electricity to most residential customers, the city is participating in the Highwood project to provide stable electrical rates to business and industrial customers that provide jobs and economic activity that benefit the community; and to public, tax supported agencies whose electric bills residents pay through their taxes.\In sum, all residents will benefit from a stronger economy and lower costs to their governmental agencies.\We have invited the Public Service Commission and its staff on more than one occasion to come to Great Falls and see what we are doing in the area of electrical energy.\We would like to extend the invitation again and believe it would be helpful for them to sit down with us and exchange views on our respective visions on the energy future of our community.\The above ""Counterpoint"" guest opinion was signed by Mayor Dona Stebbins and the four city commissioners, Bill Beecher, Diane Jovick Kuntz, John Rosenbaum and Sandy Hinz.\Online Extra\A lengthy letter from Southern Montana Electric Generation & Transmission Cooperative General Manager Tim Gregori, responding to Citzens for Clean Energy's comments on the Highwood Generating Station's draft environmental impact statement, can be found on the Tribune's Web site adjacent to this Counterpoint column in the Opinion section.\To see that PDF document, go to www.greatfallstribune.com, click on ""Opinion"" and follow the link there to ""SME response."""
34,"The Environmental Protection Agency and ""Climategate,"" cap-and-trade, cap-and-tax, carbon tax and emissions tax are all becoming synonymous and intertwined in speeches everywhere ? in debate, United Nations reports, data manipulation by climatologists and political chicanery. Who and what is the EPA?\The EPA is a bureau of non-elected officials ? bureaucrats ? whose chairperson, Lisa Jackson, was appointed by Pres. Barack Obama and, for all intents and purposes, observes the goals and objectives of the president. In December of 2009, the EPA declared that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are pollutants dangerous to public health because they are alleged to cause global warming. This finding gave the EPA the immense power to regulate CO2 emissions. This dangerous pollutant is what we exhale from our bodies every second.\For the ruling, the EPA relied primarily on data from a U.N. global warming report. Emails leaked in 2009 in the ""Climategate"" scandal showed that some of the world's prominent climatologists manipulated data to overstate the effects of carbon dioxide in the environment. The EPA and much of the U.N. report relied on that questionable data.\If the EPA is allowed to move forward with its regulation of CO2, costs to every American household are projected to increase by $3,000 a year due to higher prices for energy and any goods that require energy to manufacture or transport. Talk about taxing the poor! Contact your representative now. Our two elected senators voted for it in 2009. It is a big, important issue before Congress again.\? P.

35,"Wind and coal development, conservation and reducing peak demand are the keys to ensuring low-cost energy for the Northwest, according to the latest plan from the Northwest Power and Conservation Council.\""2000-2001 was the absence of planning,"" spokesman John Harrison said Tuesday at a meeting at the Doubletree Hotel in Missoula. ""This is a real plan. It's a risky world out there ... and we need to plan in a way to take into account that variability.""\The council held its first public meeting to hear comments on a draft of the fifth Northwest Power and Conservation Plan.\The NPCC was created by Congress in 1980 to develop longrange power and conservation plans in Idaho, Washington, Montana and Oregon.\Its draft plan takes a tiered approach to meeting future energy needs. The most immediate and significant in terms of kilowatt-hours is the advancement of conservation via a heavy reliance on compact florescent bulbs and other advancements in technology.\The second is to reduce peak demand by setting up agreements between utilities and customers, so utilities have the ability to cut power or buy power back from consumers at a predetermined price to mitigate demand.\Finally, the plan calls for the development of current proposed wind projects and to look for sites to build coalfired power plants slated to come online by 2010.\The idea of developing coal projects received mixed reactions from those there to comment.\Patrick Judge of the Montana Environmental Information Center was the first to speak out against the development of coal.\""Western Montana does not want to be the boiler room of the nation,"" he said. ""Our constitution ensures a citizens right to a clean and healthful environment.""\But Bill Pasco of Great Northern Power Development said he was disappointed the council's plan did not call for more coal development as Montana could easily supply a steady stream of coal for generations. He encouraged the council to not include the potential cost of a carbon tax in estimated cost of coal power, saying he did not believe such a tax would ever be put in place.\""Everyone is interested in this because it will affect how we produce power,"" Harrison said.\Montana council representatives Ed Bartlett and John Hines will make a detailed presentation about the plan Thursday from 8:30 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. in the morning at the Doubletree.\The Missoula meeting was the first of nine public meeting held throughout the Northwest, a complete list with times and dates is posted on the council's Web site at www.nwcouncil.org. The entire conservation plan is also available for viewing at that Web site."
36,"Following two of the most destructive years for climate catastrophes, President Obama is now calling for a ""wide-ranging"" conversation with scientists. Let's talk.\As scientists who've together spent decades studying how and why our climate is changing, we welcome that opportunity. ""Frankenstorm"" Sandy brought a message for you and all of us: climate change impacts are here now, right now.\Climate change clearly contributed to Hurricane Sandy, one of the most destructive superstorms in U.S. history. On the stretch of the Atlantic Coast where we call home, sea level is rising four times faster than the global average. Global warming is heating the Atlantic Ocean and increasing atmospheric water vapor loading, both of which contributed to Sandy's power and deluge.\Were Sandy just a single disaster, the story might end there. Unfortunately it is not. The insurance giant Munich Re reports annual weather-related loss events have quintupled in the United States, costing Americans more than a trillion dollars.\This year we have suffered through a string of record-breaking extreme weather events, all worsened by climate change. These included ""Summer in March,"" the hottest month in U.S. history (July 2012), the worst drought since the 1950s and a wildfire season that is rivaling the worst ever, a record set only six year ago. In 2011, the United States broke its record for the most billion-dollar weather disasters in a year: 14 totaling $47 billion. And this year's number of disasters puts it on track to be No. 2.\The last few years are part of a longer trend of climatic disruption that is impacting communities and the world here and now. Already, observations indicate that the ranges of more than a thousand species are shifting poleward and up mountainsides to escape the increasing heat; CO2-driven ocean acidification is starting to dissolve coral reefs; the number of regions experiencing drought have doubled since the 1970s; over the last 10 years, wildfires in the American West burned twice as much land area each year as they did just 40 years ago; twice as many new high temperature records have been set in the past decade compared to new record lows; and both the minimum area and minimum volume of Arctic sea ice each summer are well below their values of 30 years ago with new records set in 2012.\The danger of such large changes, accompanied by an increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather, loss of biodiversity, imperiled food systems, a 2-to-4-foot sea level rise, and myriad national security risks, will present enormous challenges to our nation's infrastructure and landscapes and to the well-being of people and communities around the globe.\An increasingly disruptive climate and a bankrupt nation could be the legacy we leave our children. According to projections presented to the U.S. Congress by Tufts University economist Frank Ackerman, inaction will cost our nation more than 1 percent of GDP by 2025 ? more than $200 billion a year. And costs will skyrocket from there to an estimated $1.8 trillion a year by 2100.\The next four years ? the second term of President Obama's administration ? will be critical. Faith Birol, chief economist for the usually conservative International Energy Agency, has repeatedly said that real progress toward a low-carbon economy needs to start very soon to avoid warming of 6 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century.\Patience and credence can no longer be given to those denying climate change. The delays that these so-called ""skeptics"" and vested fossil-fuel interests are causing in the face of convincing detection and attribution only increase the staggering costs of adaptation and relocation.\Having seen the impacts of Sandy, at least a few leaders in Washington seem poised to acknowledge what scientific analyses have clearly shown: human activities are causing climate disruption. Whether encouraged and forced by regulations, product standards, a cap-and-trade policy, or a carbon tax (possibly with a proportional dividend to every American), we need a national policy to initiate the transition to a low-carbon economy.\According to Bloomberg Finance, the best wind farms in the world already produce power as economically as coal, gas and nuclear generators, and solar energy is proving a good investment in many states. Iowa now generates nearly 20 percent of its electricity from wind energy and Colorado and Oregon more than 10 percent.\Clean energy is the fastest-growing industry in the U.S. today, growing at a rate of 8.3 percent, creating vital American jobs despite the depressed economy and the fact that over the past century fossil fuels have received subsidies 75 times the size of those for renewables since the mid-1990s.\We saw inspiring political leadership when Sandy struck. Now we need equally bold and visionary action that taps into the best in ingenuity and technology that our country has to offer. Encouraging both economic development and environmental well-being requires creation of a modern, clean energy system that protects both our nation and our environment.\The scientific community is eager to engage in the conversation the President seeks, but we all must recognize that the conversation must turn quickly from talk to action. This story can have an ending we can live with. It is up to us.\Michael MacCracken is chief scientist for Climate Change Programs at the Climate Institute in Washington. James J. McCarthy is a professor of ocean science at Harvard University and former president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.\ID_Code: G1-312080027"

This is going to be a column that praises President Obama's new charm offensive with congressional Republicans and suggests some useful background reading for the next get-together. First, though, I've got to get a bit of snark out of the way.
\
Such as: Isn't this the same Obama who decreed that playing nice with Washington wasn't working, so he'd be taking his case straight to The People? It's a false choice between the two approaches, but this tactical switcheroo is rather dizzying.
\
And, excuse me, if the White House thinks it's worth the try, couldn't Obama have attempted this a few months ago, before the sequester kicked in?
\
Still, let's look ahead. It is hard to imagine a breakthrough without intensive presidential involvement, which makes the new outreach so welcome. I know Republican senators, prospective members of Obama's common-sense caucus, who have waited in vain over the last few years for a call from the White House chief of staff, no less the president himself.
\
Meanwhile, there are a few incipient signs of thaw on the Republican side, indications that Obama's mealtime diplomacy may not be futile. Specifically, several Republican senators -- Arizona's John McCain, South Carolina's Lindsey Graham, New Hampshire's Kelly Ayotte -- have dared to say that they would, gasp!, consider raising revenue.
\
The senators attach two caveats: Revenue must come through fundamental tax reform (getting rid of loopholes, not raising rates) and be accompanied by reining in entitlement spending.
\
In theory, both sides agree on these approaches. In practice, the entitlement debate in particular has become mired in unnecessary partisan line-drawing. One side deems as essential proposals that the other has declared anathema. Two prime examples: turning Medicare into a premium support (scary version, ""voucher"" ) program, and raising the Medicare eligibility age. Endlessly arguing over those is not likely to accomplish anything in the current environment.
\
Hence this suggested reading: a new report from the Brookings Institution's Hamilton Project, ""15 Ways to Rethink the Federal Budget."" Granted, the Hamilton Project is associated with Democratic policymakers, albeit centrist ones such as its co-founder Robert Rubin; its animating vision of government is not the same as, say, Paul Ryan's. So proposals such as a carbon tax or value-added tax, however sensible, aren't likely to fly in the current climate.
\
But the Hamilton report contains several ideas that even Ryan could love -- or, at the very least, that the House Budget Committee chairman should not reject out of hand.
\
For example, where Ryan proposes giving Medicare beneficiaries a set amount with which to obtain insurance, Michael Chernew of Harvard Medical School and Dana Goldman of the University of Southern California propose giving Medicare providers a set amount to cover beneficiaries.
\
This ""global payment"" would replace the perverse incentives of the current fee-for-service system -- to bill for as many procedures and services as possible -- with a spur toward efficient, comprehensive care. This approach exists currently, in the form of the private Medicare Advantage programs that serve about a quarter of beneficiaries (and that, notably, have been a darling of Republicans) and in Accountable Care Organizations being established under Obamacare. Estimated savings: $100 billion over 10 years.
\
Another idea, from MIT's Jonathan Gruber, would attack Medicare costs from the consumer side. It would deal with the current risk of catastrophic costs by adding an out-of-pocket maximum tied to beneficiaries' incomes so that poorer seniors would face less risk.
\
But it would also heavily tax seniors' supplemental insurance plans that fail to impose adequate cost-sharing on beneficiaries. Again, this proposal could appeal to both sides: The Obama administration has suggested limiting Medigap policies, and the Ryan approach is all about giving consumers incentive to control costs. Estimated savings: $125 billion over 10 years.
\
On the tax side, Alan Viard of the American Enterprise Institute proposes replacing the home mortgage interest deduction with a tax credit worth 15 percent of annual interest on the first $300,000 of a mortgage -- spreading the tax benefits of homeownership more fairly and avoiding subsidizing everbigger homes. Estimated savings: $300 billion over 10 years.
\
Karen Dynan of Brookings proposes changing tax incentives to encourage low- and moderate-income households to save more for retirement and education, while reducing the subsidies for wealthier taxpayers. Estimated savings: $40 billion over 10 years.
\
The two sides are talking. That's good. Before the next meal, they might take a look at the Hamilton report. It could help the conversation move beyond ""no new taxes"" and ""please pass the salt.""

38,"Dust off the history books and clean your eyeglasses: It's time to look this coal plant ""gift horse"" in the mouth.\If Highwood Generating Station is such a boon, why was it wheeled in like a Trojan horse, with voters losing their right to reject its funding just weeks before city officials signed on? With no right to reject it, perhaps HGS proponents figured this costly, risky, unhealthy coal plant could be built without a fight.\Enter Citizens for Clean Energy, a diverse mix of concerned volunteers from many political parties and all walks of life. We're local farmers, doctors, engineers, business owners, teachers, homemakers and retirees, and we've spent hours exposing the many trap doors to the HGS Trojan horse and presenting testimony to federal, state and local officials.\City Commission and mayoral candidates need to give us honest answers before the election. Voters should ask:\*What each of the candidates has to say about our energy future.\*Why our current city manager is determined to seal this coal plant deal before he retires?\*Why our future city manager is required as a condition of employmentto take up this ill-fated cause?\*How the promised property tax revenue from the coal plant will actually be spent.\*How ""cost-based"" power from the coal plant will differ from mandated ""cost-based"" power from Northwestern Energy (which will continue to charge for transmission no matter who generates the electricity).\*How reliable the unregulated power supply from a single coal plant will be.\*Why HGS and Electric City Power ratepayers will not benefit from oversight by the Public Service Commission?\The coal plant is promoted here because we have millions of gallons of water to evaporate in the cooling towers each day, and plenty of Big Sky to contaminate (Great Falls currently boasts the fourth cleanest air of any metropolitan area in the country). In violation of our Growth Policy, the proposed coal plant is sited on prime agricultural land of statewide importance and located where it will destroy the integrity of the Lewis and Clark National Historic Landmark and obscure our most scenic vista.\The Environmental Impact Statement fails to consider that the coal plant would produce the annual greenhouse gas equivalent of more than 500,000 cars. The EIS clearly acknowledges adverse impacts on soils, water resources, air quality, biological resources, noise, recreation, cultural resources, visual impacts, traffic patterns, farmland and land use, waste management, and health and safety. For the EIS to conclude that these impacts would ""not be significant"" defies common sense and scientific reason. When I queried the contractor Mangi Environmental to provide references so that I could independently evaluate the data upon which these pronouncements of ""insignificance"" were based, I was told that ""such references are not specifically cited and are not available"" and that such determinations of significance are derived in a process that is ""an art as well as a science.""\It's sad to see this Trojan horse is being led by paid contractors in cheerleading outfits rather than independent governmental agencies.\Because of the limited 400-foot height of the proposed stack, variable local wind patterns, an upper air inversion cap that often prevents adequate dispersion of pollutants, and a baffling effect of the Highwood Mountains, a retired local meteorologist warned that we could expect the air in Great Falls to be degraded about 25 percent of the time.\Permitting agencies failed to take into consideration recently published studies that have demonstrated the serious health effects of exposure to microscopic particulates, laden with poisonous heavy metals such as mercury, lead, and arsenic. These germ-size particles not only impair pulmonary function, but also circulate in the blood.\I was told that it is doubtful that the latest information (such as the study of the adverse cardiovascular effects of fine particulate pollution published in Feb. 2007 New England Journal of Medicine) would be factored into the decision making process, because ""government doesn't work that fast.""\CCE feels so strongly about these issues that we have legally challenged both the air permit issued by the Montana Department of Environmental Quality and sued the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture and the Rural Utility Service.\It's not that there aren't other energy options. Gov. Brian Schweitzer has publicly called the proposed Highwood combustion coal plant ""dated technology,"" and has increasingly distanced himself from this project while promoting zero emissions coal gasification. Montana is on the threshold of further exploiting its vast coal reserves, and if this happens, we want to be sure it is only with the least polluting existing technology and with the proven ability to economically capture and sequester carbon.\Montanans have a constitutional right to a ""clean and healthful environment."" If coal must be used, gasification plants should be located at the mine mouth to avoid costly transport of coal by monopolistic railroads. Before we rend open old mines and new Superfund sites in nearby Belt and Centerville, remember that we are still paying the environmental and financial price for last century's mistakes just a coal lump's throw from Great Falls.\Because reason fails them, Southern Montana Electric's new scare-tactic advertisements show the lights going out in southeastern Montana if this plant isn't built. Rest assured that the plug will not be pulled for our neighbors: Montana is already a net exporter of electricity, and with new wind power and gas-fired turbines, we'll literally be drowning in megawatts. Other rural electric cooperatives, like the one serving nine co-ops in central Montana, have chosen not to participate in this costly, risky coal plant; they're not worried about their future ability to contract for power any more than we're worried about the electricity from Montana's default supplier.\Many of us went to fifth grade here in Montana, where we learned how the fur trade, the railroads and the mining industry all profited from the Treasure State at our expense. Didn't we learn our lesson again when Goldman Sachs made off with our dams? Now we learn that Bear Stearns, another high profile Wall Street company, will try to sell bonds for a handsome commission to hapless investors at a time when coal is in the dumps and the likelihood of a carbon tax looms on the horizon.\Our U.S. senators need constant reminders of our environmental and financial concerns. Great Falls doesn't deserve the last old technology coal plant to be built in America. HGS is clearly a merchant venture, far overbuilt beyond SME's modest needs. Taxpayers should not finance such a boondoggle through the USDA Rural Utility Service.\Let's harness our wind, capture the sun's energy from our blue skies, upgrade the dams, grow biofuels, use natural gas to firm wind power, and increase efficiency.\If we hitch our wagon to SME's Trojan horse, it will surely drag us all in the wrong direction.\Cheryl Reichert M.D., Ph.D., is a Great Falls native and graduate of Great Falls High, and she is one of the founders of Citizens for Clean Energy, Inc."
39,"\\\\President Donald Trump’s plan to replace Obama-era air pollution rules with coal-friendly policies got a mixed reception by Montana officials uncertain what the changes would mean for the Colstrip Power Plant.\Republicans praised Trump's plans to scrap former President Barrack Obama’s Clean Power Plan as good news for coal power. Though never carried out, the Obama rules called for dramatically cutting carbon dioxide, a major contributor to climate change.\Montanans had expected the Obama rules to finish off Colstrip Power Plant and likely its host community of 2,300 as well, as the state cut carbon dioxide emissions 47 percent to comply with federal law.\A new set of coal-friendly rules were rolled out by the EPA on Tuesday to replace the Obama policies. The “Affordable Clean Energy Rule” would allow states to ease up on pollution regulations when enforcing the rules might result in costly upgrades for coal-fired power plants. EPA officials said the new rules would force carbon dioxide levels down 34 percent nationally, but without shuttering power plants.\Colstrip has four generating units. The oldest two are scheduled for retirement no later than 2022 as part of a legal settlement with the Sierra Club and Montana Environmental Information Center over air pollution.\Its newer units are offline for failing to clear federal Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, or MATS. The shutdown will be two months long next week. The Affordable Clean Energy Rule does not address MATS.\“Montana would have been devastated by President Obama’s overreaching Clean Power Plan,"" said U.S. Sen. Steve Daines in an email. ""EPA’s new Affordable Clean Energy Rule will reduce emissions through innovation and incentivizing upgrades, instead of just shutting down coal plants at the expense of Montana's and the nation's families.""\The Montana Republican said “the new rule gives states and energy producers the flexibility and control they need to reduce emissions while also maintaining and growing high-paying energy jobs that will allow Montana and the U.S. to lead in affordable clean energy.”\Daines included clean coal technology upgrades at power plants as one of the perks of the Trump plan, which would ease regulations on adding equipment to power plants. He had spoken earlier in the day at the Senate Energy Committee about the importance of keeping Colstrip around for new, high-energy-consuming businesses like bitcoin mines.\Democratic Sen. Jon Tester said he wasn’t familiar with the details of the plan, but that with climate change threatening the planet, something has to be done to clean up coal power and keep it part of America’s future.\“Coal is an important part of our energy portfolio. We just need to figure out how to burn it without burning the planet up,” Tester said in a Tuesday press conference. “I think it’s going to take a public-private partnership to figure out how we can deal with the CO2. And I don’t think we’ve been nearly aggressive enough on that on the federal level to make sure that happens.”\In 2016, the Department of Energy estimated that converting Colstrip to a “clean coal” power plant would cost $1.2 billion. The analysis was requested by Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, a Democrat, who has also cited better technology as the key to keeping Colstrip and other coal-fired power plants in America’s energy mix.\Attempts to apply production scale clean-coal technology at U.S. power plants have cost billions and failed.\Montana’s Democrats were never strong supporters of the Clean Power Plan.Bullock blasted the Obama administration in 2015 for “moving the goalposts” on Montana after Obama’s EPA upped its prescription for carbon dioxide cuts in Montana.\Bullock didn’t respond to Lee Montana Newspaper’s requests for comment Tuesday. He was busy interviewing judges.\Like Daines, U.S. Rep. Greg Gianforte, a Montana Republican, applauded the change.\“For eight years, the Obama administration consistently worked to undermine Montana energy and waged a punitive war on Montana coal. The Obama administration’s so-called Clean Power Plan would have raised electricity prices for Montanans, harmed our economy, cost American jobs, and threatened our energy security,” Gianforte said.\“I welcome the Trump administration’s Affordable Clean Energy rule, which would replace the burdensome, costly Obama-era mandate with a rule designed to empower states, promote American energy dominance, and protect our environment.”\Challengers in the state’s 2018 congressional midterms issued the following statements.\""Jon Tester and President Obama worked together in support of disastrous job-killing regulations like their Clean Power Plan, that would have crippled Montana's coal industry and threatened the livelihoods of thousands of hard-working Montanans,” said Republican Matt Rosendale, Tester’s GOP challenger. “President Trump promised he would fight for our coal miners and workers — and he did. Unlike Jon Tester, I proudly stand alongside President Trump and together we will fight each and every day to protect Montana's coal miners, workers, their families and all the jobs supported by Montana's coal industry.""\Kathleen Williams, Democratic challenger to Gianforte said: “I’ve consistently been committed to protecting Montana job opportunities, public health, and clean air and water. As a legislator I worked to find new ways to use coal, and as a candidate I am working to find creative ways to address changing market forces that affect our communities and economy. I look forward to reviewing the president’s proposal to ensure it advances these goals.""\Talen Energy, which operates Colstrip Power Plant and has significant ownership share, did not respond to a requests for comment, which Lee Montana Newspapers made by phone and email Tuesday.\The change from Obama's coal pollution rules to Trump's coal pollution rules isn’t likely to help Colstrip as it struggles with multiple challenges, said Seth Feaster, energy data analyst for the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.\“In terms of the big picture, it doesn’t really change the underlying pressures on the utilities, and particularly Colstrip, that are facing things like customer calls to divest in coal and restructure assets,” Feaster said. “It’s one thing to set policies that try to help, but it’s not a bailout and it’s not going to make power plants any younger.”\Voters in Washington state, which uses a significant portion of Colstrip power, will decide in the general election whether to impose a carbon tax on coal power. Monday, the Spokane City Council voted to be 100 percent carbon-power free in 12 years. The city is in the territory of Avista Corp., a Colstrip owner attempting to merge with Hydro One, a Canadian energy customer that cut coal power from its supply several years ago.\Avista and Colstrip’s largest shareholder, Puget Sound Energy, have both agreed to be financially ready by 2027 to shutter Colstrip.\In Oregon, Colstrip co-owners Portland General Electric and PacifiCorp are required by law to stop supplying coal power to customers beginning in the 2030s. Public concern about climate change resulted in that mandate by the Oregon Legislature two years ago."

41,"HELENA ? Gov. Brian Schweitzer and Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall are turning to taxpayers to help fund a massive carbon sequestration demonstration project they say could be a major first step in solving the global carbon crisis.\""Almost 99.999 percent ... of the coal plants produce their electricity through a pulverized coal process, which means once the coal is burned, then lots of things go up the smokestack,"" said Schweitzer, one of the nation's most vocal proponents of so-called ""clean coal"" technology. ""Everybody who is studying this knows that if we want to decrease CO2 in a meaningful way, we have to attack those existing smokestacks.""\According to Schweitzer, here are the basics of what the proposed $250-million Canadian-Montana project would entail:\Capture about 1,000 tons of the CO2 emitted from SaskPower's Poplar River coal-fired generating station near Coronach, Saskatchewan.\Pipe the captured CO2 about 50 miles to northeastern Montana.\Inject the pressurized and liquefied CO2 about 6,000 feet deep into the earth into a geological formation called the Bowdoin Dome in northeastern Montana.\Monitor the CO2 once it's sequestered beneath the earth.\After scientists are satisfied that the CO2 will stay in place and not pollute groundwater or migrate to the surface, pump the CO2 back out of the ground and use it for advanced oil recovery in the Bakken oil fields. Injecting the CO2 into oil-bearing stratum would push oil into the piping network and up to the surface.\But some observers say Montana isn't ready for a project like this because Montana lacks the regulatory framework for dealing with the complexities of sequestration and it's extremely expensive to do.\""Sequestration might be an alternative, but it is going to be very expensive and the potential danger from doing it poorly could have a significant impact not only on public health and the environment, but also on property rights and water quality,"" says Anne Hedges of the Montana Environmental Information Center in Helena. ""If we're going to go down this path, we should do it with extreme caution and with our eyes wide open.""\Proponents of the idea say something has to be done now to address the millions of tons of CO2 pouring out of existing smokestacks around the globe.\Schweitzer says Canadian researchers at the University of Regina have developed technology that will separate ""pure CO2"" from other stack pollutants. He says the proposed project would benefit Montana while addressing the carbon crisis.\""Think of a big tank down there,"" Schweitzer says of the Bowdoin Dome.""We pump a lot of CO2 in and we keep it there for several years and we continue to measure it. After we have demonstrated that, yes, you can geologically store (CO2)...we will be able to now take that CO2 back out and pipe it over to the Bakken oil field where we will get enhanced oil recovery and we will increase oil production by hundreds of millions of barrels.""\Schweitzer says he wants to secure about $100 million for the project from the $3 billion set aside in the federal economic stimulus package for sequestration research. He says the Canadian government and private energy companies would partner in the project, though he wouldn't disclose the names of those companies because of ""proprietary agreements with the Saskatchewan government.""\Environmentalists caution that the state lacks the necessary regulatory framework for dealing with large-scale subterranean CO2 storage, and that it may not be a wise investment given global economic circumstances.\""I think that we have to look at all options for controlling carbon emissions, and I think that sequestration will be a part of the puzzle,"" says Hedges. ""But I think when we consider the issues, we have to consider the costs and the benefits. And we have to take a look at alternatives that may be more cost effective.""\Why sequestration?\Those who working to address the world's growing energy crisis realize that if humans want to continue to enjoy all of the conveniences of the modern industrialized world then we're going to need a lot more energy in the future.\The federal government estimates that world energy consumption will rise by nearly 50 percent from 2005 levels by 2030, and more than half of the electricity we consume in this country comes from coal, the United States'?and Montana's?most abundant fuel source.\But generating electricity from coal comes with serious drawbacks. Coal-fired power plant produce tremendous amounts of CO2, the greenhouse gas most scientists agree is responsible for global warming.\While scientists are debating the extent to which human-caused CO2 is impacting the globe, lawmakers in Washington, D.C., and Helena are preparing for what they say will be an inevitable regulatory cap on CO2 emissions.\Plans for new coal-fired power plants have stalled throughout the country as investors wait to see what kind of carbon regulations come out of Washington, D.C. and how costly it will be for polluters to pump CO2 into the atmosphere.\With Democratic President Barack Obama in the White House and Democrats in control of Congress, most observers say legislation that penalizes CO2 polluters is on the horizon, likely through a carbon tax or a cap and trade system whereby the biggest polluters buy carbon credits from smaller emitters.\The Legislature\If developers are going to burn coal, they're going to need to find a way to deal with the CO2 other than pumping into the air.\With that in mind, lawmakers in Helena are considering a bill by Sen. Keith Bales, R-Otter, that would put a state carbon sequestration program under the supervision of the state Board of Oil and Gas Conservation.\""Whether or not you believe in global warming being caused by CO2, I think it's inherent upon us to have a program in place to sequester CO2,"" Bales said about Senate Bill 498 earlier this month.\After initially vowing to veto the measure because it didn't define ownership of the ""pore space"" beneath the surface where the CO2 would be stored, Schweitzer now says he supports the bill. A compromise version of the measure gives surface owners the ownership rights to the pore space beneath their land, Schweitzer says.\Under the legislation, developers would have to get a permit from the Board of Oil and Gas before they drill and inject carbon into the earth. Twenty years after pumping is complete, the companies could hand off liability and ownership of the CO2 reservoir to the state.\The measure was approved by the Senate and awaits a hearing in the House energy committee.\A bill that would regulate CO2 pipelines is also in the works. Rep. Duane Ankney, R-Colstrip, has proposed a measure that would give ""common carrier"" status to CO2 pipelines similar to oil and gas pipelines. House Bill 338 would allow private companies to use eminent domain to take private property to build the CO2 pipelines.\That bill passed the House and on Saturday easily cleared a key vote in the Senate. A final Senate vote is expected this week and then the bill heads to the governor where it will likely be signed.\Hedges says lawmakers are hastily acting on sequestration legislation without considering the possible long-term drawbacks of their actions.\""The path we're on should be to proceed with caution,"" says Hedges. ""So often that gets lost in the heat of a legislative session where everybody is just thinking about today. That's unfortunate because these are long-term issues and you're potentially saddling the state with long-term consequences.""\And Hedges says those consequences could be catastrophic.\But Schweitzer says the time is now to begin testing the future of carbon sequestration, and Montana can be a leader.\""We have coal. We need to clean up the coal and get the CO2 out of it,"" Schweitzer says. ""We can demonstrate that we can use (CO2) for enhanced oil recovery and along the way we can develop the technology to for geologically storing CO2.""\But Hedges says the state would be wise to consider alternatives before embarking on costly sequestration projects. She cautions against foregoing other opportunities such as funding for consumers to make homes more efficient with ground source heat pumps, solar panels and wind mills.\""Ultimately, sequestration is just a bridge technology to a more efficient future that is more reliant on renewable energy,"" Hedges says. ""We can decide to make the enormous investment in sequestration and then move forward with these efficient and renewable technologies, or we can just move straight to efficiencies and renewables.""\Reach Tribune Capitol Bureau Chief John S.

PARIS (AP) -- Switzerland freezes plans to build new nuclear plants, Germany raises questions about its nuclear future, and opposition to atomic reactor construction mounts from Turkey to South Africa.
\
Will explosions and other worries at a tsunami-stricken Japanese nuclear plant halt what has come to be known as the nuclear renaissance?
\
Fears about nuclear safety that took a generation to overcome after the accidents at Chernobyl and Three-Mile Island are resurfacing around the globe. They are casting new doubt on a controversial energy source that has seen a resurgence in recent years, amid worries over volatile oil prices and global warming.
\
""Europe has to wake up from its Sleeping Beauty slumber"" about nuclear safety, Austria's Environment Minister Nikolaus Berlakovich told reporters in Brussels. He suggested an EU-wide stress test for nuclear plants, much like European banks have been tested for their ability to cope with financial shocks.
\
Yet some experts and officials say those fears are overblown, given the exceptional nature of Japan's earthquake and ensuing tsunami. The Japanese blasts may slow the push for more nuclear plants, but appear unlikely to stop it, given the world's fast-growing energy needs.
\
The governments of Russia, China and Poland said they are sticking to plans to build more reactors. Even earthquake-prone Chile says it won't discard a nuclear option. Spain warned against hasty decisions.
\
Japan's nuclear plant explosions come as the U.S. government looks to expand its nuclear energy industry by offering companies tens of billions in financial backing. Administration officials said the U.S. would seek lessons from the Japanese crisis but said the events in Japan would not diminish the United States commitment to nuclear power.
\
""It remains a part of the president's overall energy plan,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said. ""When we talk about reaching a clean energy standard, it is a vital part of that.""
\
In Atlanta, the CEO of Southern Co. said Monday he does not expect Japan's problems to delay construction of two more nuclear reactors in Georgia, at the first nuclear plant in the United States to break ground in a generation.
\
Elsewhere, governments began questioning their vision of a nuclear-energized future amid rising threats of a meltdown at one Japanese reactor.
\
Switzerland ordered a freeze on new plants or replacements ""until safety standards have been carefully reviewed and if necessary adapted,"" Energy Minister Doris Leuthard said. The decision put on hold the construction of nuclear power stations at three sites approved by Swiss regulatory authorities.
\
Switzerland now has five nuclear power reactors that produce about 40 percent of the country's energy needs. It also has nuclear research reactors.
\
In Germany, the government said it is suspending for three months a decision to extend the life of its nuclear power plants. That also means that two older nuclear power plants will be taken off the grid shortly -- at least for now -- pending a full safety investigation, Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters.
\
A previous government decided to shut all 17 German nuclear plants, but Merkel's administration last year moved to extend their lives by an average 12 years.
\
The European Union called a meeting Tuesday of nuclear safety authorities to assess Europe's preparedness in case of a nuclear emergency Individual. EU members including Britain, Bulgaria and Finland also urged a nuclear safety review.
\
Meanwhile, opposition voices rose up in Turkey and Sweden to renounce or scale back governments' nuclear expansion plans. And anti-nuclear groups staged rallies around France, the world's most nuclear-dependent country, as the government sought to reassure the public that the risks remain minimal.

43,"Few doubt that resource-rich Montana will play a role in the nation's energy picture for decades to come.\But experts who testified at a U.S. Senate Finance Committee hearing Friday in Billings gave widely divergent views on whether coal, natural gas, wind energy, conservation or a combination should contribute to future energy needs.\Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, called Friday's hearing to learn how the federal tax code can be used to help solve the nation's energy problems.\""Innovative tax policy may be a key to our long-term energy solutions,"" Baucus said. ""We all know that energy markets are driven by supply and demand. And the federal tax code can influence these market forces.""\Baucus said Montana's enormous coal reserves could be put to new uses with tax credits for clean-coal technology.

45,"Editor's note: The deadline for Letters to the Editor about the Nov. 6 election is 5 p.m. Wednesday.\Supports Bullock\In contrast to Rick Hill, Steve Bullock will allow Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks to complete the already-begun environmental-impact statement to analyze proposals for restoring wild bison somewhere in Montana. Hill apparently would deny any restoration of wild bison and has chastised FWP and its commission for beginning the public analysis process.\Two recent polls indicate that almost 70 percent of Montana voters support restoration of wild bison in Montana, especially on the Charles M. Russell National Wildlife Refuge. Years ago, the Montana Legislature developed the Montana Environmental Protection Act to, among other goals, ""fulfill the responsibilities of each generation as trustee of the environment for succeeding generations."" MEPA mandates analysis of controversial environmental issues, public disclosure of good and bad impacts of management options, and subsequent public input regarding those options. It is the established way for Montanans to become informed and reason together on controversial issues.\Hill's positions on bison restoration and his criticism of FWP's mandated and orderly process for considering bison restoration are an attempt to gratify a minority of Montanans. Bullock disagrees, demonstrating his strong recognition of the democratic process in Montana. Bullock deserves my vote.\?Jim Bailey,\Belgrade\Supports Glover\It is time for a change in representation of House District 24. We need better representation for our neighborhoods and someone who is willing to work cooperatively for Montana's future.\Tom Glover will better represent the people of HD24 with a balance of priorities. His priorities are not just business and quality job development in the state; they are also people, education, health care and forward-thinking ideas in energy development.\We need a change. Tom Glover has my support.\?Maranna Dean,\Great Falls\Supports Bucy\I am not a political person, nor do I necessarily endorse a party. My main concern is that kids and communities are safe in Montana. So when it comes to the race for attorney general, I have to look to who has the most experience ensuring that Montana remains a safe place for our kids.\Pam Bucy is the obvious choice for attorney general. I have had the honor to work with Bucy while I was an agent with the Montana Department of Justice, and I watched her work tirelessly to make sure child predators were held accountable. Recently, I have worked with Bucy on issues regarding Internet safety for kids and sex offender management.\Bucy is not political; she's approachable and knowledgeable. She is about getting things done for the citizens of Montana.\?Derek VanLuchene,\Helena\Opposes rezoning\As a new resident of Great Falls, I was surprised to see the refinery sitting on prime real estate. I realize when the city approved this, it was not in the heart of the city. I was horrified when it was revealed that the refinery had bought the Westgate Shopping Mall.\Now, I am furious to think that they are requesting rezoning to ""Heavy Industrial"" on the banks of the Missouri River ? the same river which is being developed with hiking trails, bike trails, wildlife viewing and as a centerpiece of tourism development.\I encourage the city to deny this polluting, smelly eyesore in the center of town any further permission to destroy what could be one of the most scenic parts of Great Falls.\?Ann Schneider,\Great Falls\Supports Rehberg\I have seen a question brought up multiple times by supporters of Sen. Jon Tester. They ask, ""What has Rep. Denny Rehberg done for you?""\While active duty in the military I incurred an injury which resulted in a severe limp; surgery was necessary. Tricare (military/veteran care) quickly began to deny appointments, and it became impossible to get any care for my injury. I spent a year trying to work with my unit, my military branch and Tricare with no success. I vividly remember looking at my wife and asking her, ""What now?""\I decided to walk into Rehberg's office in Billings. After having spent a year getting ignored, pushed around and abandoned by the government, I had no expectations. Upon walking in, I immediately knew this would be different. The office manager could just tell how upset and down-trodden I was. Before I could say much, she hugged me. After a year of the government telling me they would not help and after being forgotten in red tape and nonsense, I was literally welcomed with open arms. Rehberg, along with his staff, quickly resolved my situation.\Days later, someone at the Pentagon called me and apologized. Soon afterward, I had my surgery, and Rehberg's staff stayed with me during continued care to ensure it would not happen again. This year, I was able to wear the uniform of this great nation once again. What has Rehberg done for me? He gave me my life and dignity back.\?Brian Rauch,\Missoula\No Obama\I am puzzled! Why are there still some voters who think Pres.

Didn't he say he would ""fix"" the problem but make it worse than any other president? Is it because he has reduced our credit rating? Is it because he has told other countries we are ""ashamed"" for passed aggressions to keep dictators from taking control of other countries, or is it because you are proud that he has lowered our defense missiles from 5,000 to 1,500 and is aiming for 300? Maybe it is because he is going to cut billions from our defense budget, making us more vulnerable.\Is it because you support his stand on abortion or because he is devout Muslim? Have you supporters checked to see what religion has been killing Americans? Is it because you like his method of amnesty? Or is it because he has sealed all of his history?

Then I was disgusted. There are so many wrong things with this article, I am not sure where to begin.\My daughter is an honor student in Schreiner's science class. She has never liked science, but Schreiner, being the awesome teacher he is, has turned her attitude toward the class around, and she is getting an ""A"" in the class. I was also very disgusted with Paul's reference, ""Schreiner would leave his students."" My daughter is one of those students, and she does not feel abandoned by her teacher. She is very proud of Schreiner and that he will be representing them, as well. We have a citizens' Legislature with a great majority of legislators leaving their jobs to do their civic duty and representing all of us. This is short-sighted and a very ""below-the-belt"" comment. How dare Paul assume that we would be upset? He is wrong.\Schreiner is on a year-to-year contract with the school district, and last year, when my daughter found out he had to re-apply for his job and go through the interview process again, she was one of the first ones to make her positive feedback known as to the great job Schreiner does. The people of HD 22 would be proud Schreiner as their legislator. He views all issues evenly and will take all opinions into consideration.\?Sandra Lynne Pepos,\Great Falls\Obama should go\My hope is that those voting in this most important election are knowledgeable about the candidates' positions on abortion and same-sex marriage, as both are intrinsically evil.\Our nation was founded on Judeo, Christian values. The Ten Commandments are not suggestions but commandments. ""Thou shalt not kill"" is one of those commandments. Have you ever stopped to think that most people favoring birth control laws have been born already? Four years ago we voted in Pres. Barack Obama, who has endorsed abortion and same-sex marriage. In 2008, candidate Obama stated if he hadn't solved our nation's problems in one term, he shouldn't get another. I agree Obama should go!\When he was senator, he was one of the few to vote for infanticide, which means if an unborn baby survives the abortion, kill it. Nothing destroys life more than abortion. No baby is conceived without the hand of God; 3,000 unborn children are destroyed by abortion every day. Planned Parenthood's founder, Margaret Sanger, started a war on women. Planned Parenthood talks about health care for women ? what a falsehood. Abortion not only destroys an unborn person, but causes many mental and physical problems for women. Death and lies are bound to affect anyone.\There is a saying, ""God always forgives; man sometimes forgives but hatred never forgives."" I hope we vote for candidates who believe in liberty and justice for all, not only a few.\?Helen Mears,\Great Falls\Support Weber\When we hear all of the noise that's cluttering the political dialog these days, we rejoice at the opportunity to vote for a candidate who embraces and practices essential values and attributes that we hold dear ? mutual respect, active and intelligent listening, a committed work ethic and a true sense of community.\We've known Jane Weber for almost 20 years as a neighbor, community activist, facilitator and, above all, a stand-up individual of high moral and ethical values. Weber is a listener, and she strives to find common ground to solve community problems and achieve community growth.\We're voting for Jane Weber for Cascade County Commissioner.

A nurse even said he was ""playing them.""\This tragedy is another example that, in spite of our population, 65,000 First American voters in Montana and cultural awareness in the schools, some things never change. An inquest was held in Havre in March of 2012 by the ""judge and jury,"" and no one in the audience was allowed to seek answers. The atmosphere was oppressive, and we felt like we were all on trial. Of course, the police, jailers and medics were then declared innocent of any responsibility.\Some miles east of the agency is an abandoned church, and we stopped there to say goodbye to a special Indian boy who is now not able to shoot more baskets, get a college degree, join the military or have a family, for there he lies beneath a mound of dirt and his basketball.

Justice, finally?\?George P. Horse Capture Sr.,\Great Falls\These taxes are job killers\Montanans should be very concerned about three job-killing taxes that Pres. Barack Obama will push hard for if he gets re-elected. The first is cap and trade, also known as cap and tax. This is a carbon-emissions tax that taxes energy and manufacturing with the end-payer being consumers.\The second tax is the carbon tax which is a tax on the carbon content of fuel. As 85 percent of America's energy needs are met by natural gas, coal and oil, this tax will directly raise the cost of gasoline, natural gas, electricity, diesel fuel and propane. Of course, as any business is hit with higher costs, they are passed on to the consumer.\The third tax is the value-added tax, also known as a national sales tax. It is levied on a product's value added at each stage of production with you, the consumer, being the end-payer.\These will not be temporary taxes; they will be permanent. It doesn't matter your politics or income level, you will be paying these taxes if enacted. Obama, though, will need the help of wasteful spenders, Sen. John Tester and Kim Gillan, to enact these taxes. Don't fall for Tester's campaign diversions, as he really has voted with Obama 95 percent of the time.\Please vote for Rep. Denny Rehberg and Steve Daines who oppose these jobs-outsourcing taxes.\?Ron Hepp,\Great Falls\Protect wolverines\Minke whales and wolverines ? the Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks is right behind the Japanese in ""Alice in Wonderland"" convoluted reasoning that you have to kill threatened and endangered species in order to save them.\We all know that those ""researched"" minke whales land on Japanese dinner plates. We also know that those vanishing wolverines are mostly taken to stoke the egos of successful trappers. When you rely on the predator to inform a life-or-death vote on its prey, the special interest predator is the only beneficiary.\Montanans, call the five lord high executioners of diminishing wildlife populations at the FWP and tell them to:\1) Repeal their uninformed vote allowing the trapping of five wolverines.\2) Stop pandering to trappers who regard the trapping of a wolverine ""the height of expertise in the trapping culture.""\3) Do their homework. There is hard, factual science out there from data published in peer-reviewed journals by field biologists. See the Petition to End the Trapping of Wolverine in Montana, www.westernlaw.org.\The wolverine is fighting for survival as climate change melts away nursery glaciers, as traps that don't discriminate ""catch"" are laid, as high-elevation recreationists drop from the skies into wolverine habitat and more roads divide the back country. Knowing this animal has been warranted for endangered species listing, don't our FWP commissioners owe its existence an informed vote?\?Pat Helvey,\East Helena\Bad employers don't deserve protective unbrella\I disagree with the Oct. 8 legal reform op/ed article, specifically the comment about Montana's wrongful-discharge laws and the role of trial attorneys in creating an adverse environment for Montana businesses.\I am a member of the Montana Chamber of Commerce, a transactional attorney and owner of multiple businesses for more than 36 years. I have employed countless employees and terminated numerous employees, or they left for their own reasons. I was sued once for wrongful termination. I won, and my business was not destroyed.\I have witnessed a close family member become the subject of wrongful termination. The employer's wrongful actions were financially devastating for the employee and her family and equally devastating to her sense of dignity. Bad employers in Montana do not deserve the same protective umbrella as the thousands of businesses who provide safe and dignified workplaces.\Wrongful-termination laws in Montana never fully compensate the employee no matter how good their case or their attorney's skills. There is no compensation for emotional distress. Statutory ""caps"" limit the employee to four years of lost wages and benefits. Income from a new job or income imputed to the employee offsets any recovery.\Thankfully, a Montana trial attorney is helping my family member regain some of her monetary loss and dignity. I hope anyone who finds themselves in a similar situation will have the benefit of a professional trial attorney to assist them.\?Max A. Hansen,\Dillon\God cares for us all\In her letter to the editor, Gloria Burrow asked how any thinking woman could support the Republican Party. Well, I am a thinking woman who seems to think that there are more important rights out there that women deserve and need rather than the choice to end the life of her child.\She states that Paul Ryan and other Republicans are against women and their rights. Since when did someone become a bad person because he or she believes taking a human life is wrong? To me, be they Republican or Democrat, those who believe in the sanctity of life are the modern-day Christians who suffer persecution for their beliefs.\In answer to Benny Potter's letter, there is someone in the voting booth with you, and God does care about us all.\?Karen Grove,\Great Falls\Support Glover\Tom Glover is an educator and a business owner. He is a community leader and an innovator. Most importantly, I know Tom Glover as my dad. I am so excited to support his race for House District 24. Great Falls could not ask for a more compassionate and forward-thinking candidate for the Montana House.\Despite the onslaught of money and negativity in this year's election season, I hope that Montanans look to values and leadership in making their vote. My dad taught my sister and me to listen first, talk later. He taught us patience, and he taught us to care about other people and look out for those less fortunate. He spent most of his career as a teacher working with students with special needs, and he has lived the ideals he taught us every day of his life.\Glover will represent his district because he will listen to his constituents, and he cares about their lives and the future of Great Falls. I have worked at a number of sessions with the Montana Legislature, and sadly, all too often money and power motivate many representatives, rather than values and hard work.\Residents of HD 24, a vote for Tom Glover is a vote for a candidate who will listen to you, represent you and work hard for you. He will take your ideas to Helena, and he will work with you to continually improve the community of Great Falls.\?Annie Glover,\Helena\Protect collective bargaining\Currently, collective bargaining is being attacked. It is my feeling that collective bargaining is how our nation was formed. If the 13 colonies had not come together collectively, they could not have escaped the tyranny of King George III. Bargaining separately, they would have been easily defeated.\So if you truly are American, vote to protect collective bargaining.\?Jerry Ferderer,\Great Falls\Obama, Tester need to go\I can't believe all the recent letters from whiny Democrat women focused solely on their reproductive organs. In the immortal words of Pres. Bill Clinton's adviser, James Carville, "" It's the economy, stupid."" If there is a war on women, its an economic war, and it's being waged against not just women but families. Under Pres. Barack Obama and his 95-percent-of-the-time sidekick, Sen. Jon Tester, family incomes have dropped by more than $4,000 per year.\Make no mistake about it, women are worried. And they're not just worried about themselves. They're worried about their children's future. They don't want them to be saddled with debt from our generation which has surpassed a record-high $16 trillion. The new women's issues are economic security, job growth, lower taxes and reasonable federal spending. I fail to see how dependence on food stamps and free birth control is a path to strength and independence. It's highly offensive that the Obama/ Tester campaigns think women either haven't noticed ? or just don't care ? how devastating this administration's failed economic policies have been for us.\Obama and Tester have been urging women to ""vote like their lady parts depend on it."" I will vote with my most important lady part, my brain. Obama and Tester need to go.\?Cyndi Baker,\Great Falls\Supports Loney\I am a neighbor of Jan Cahill, chairman of the board of trustees for Great Falls Public Schools. I noticed that several weeks ago, he put a Cleve Loney sign in his front yard. Obviously, he is supporting Loney over his opponent in the House District 25 race.\This kind of punches a hole in Dennis Granlie's recent letter stating that Loney is somehow anti-education. I would assume the chairman of the school board would be deeply interested and informed as to which candidate would be the better one with regard to education issues.\Letter-writers such as Granlie are entitled to their own opinions but not to their own facts. Loney supports our public education system. This is only one of the reasons he was awarded a ""Good Apple"" award by the district. Loney is proud of his award as well as his work on behalf of the Great Falls Public Schools. Vote to re-elect Cleve Loney in HD 25.\?Maria Acord,\Great Falls"
46,"The Environmental Protection Agency and ""Climategate,"" cap-and-trade, cap-and-tax, carbon tax and emissions tax are all becoming synonymous and intertwined in speeches everywhere ? in debate, United Nations reports, data manipulation by climatologists and political chicanery. Who and what is the EPA?\The EPA is a bureau of non-elected officials ? bureaucrats ? whose chairperson, Lisa Jackson, was appointed by Pres. Barack Obama and, for all intents and purposes, observes the goals and objectives of the president. In December of 2009, the EPA declared that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are pollutants dangerous to public health because they are alleged to cause global warming. This finding gave the EPA the immense power to regulate CO2 emissions. This dangerous pollutant is what we exhale from our bodies every second.\For the ruling, the EPA relied primarily on data from a U.N. global warming report. Emails leaked in 2009 in the ""Climategate"" scandal showed that some of the world's prominent climatologists manipulated data to overstate the effects of carbon dioxide in the environment. The EPA and much of the U.N. report relied on that questionable data.\If the EPA is allowed to move forward with its regulation of CO2, costs to every American household are projected to increase by $3,000 a year due to higher prices for energy and any goods that require energy to manufacture or transport. Talk about taxing the poor! Contact your representative now. Our two elected senators voted for it in 2009. It is a big, important issue before Congress again.\? P.

47,"Supporters and opponents of a proposed countywide 2-cent gasoline tax voiced their opinions on the matter in front of Missoula County Commissioners on Thursday.\The county is taking public comment to decide whether to place the gas tax on the June 2 primary ballot in Missoula County. County voters would have to approve the tax. County staff have estimated the tax would raise about $1.1 million every year, with $400,000 coming from tourists. The money would be used for sorely-needed road maintenance and repair and would be split evenly between the city and the county.\Jeremy Keene, the city’s public works director, said a person who drives about 13,400 miles a year and gets 25 miles per gallon would end up paying about $11 per year. He noted the city’s roads are in bad shape in most areas, and estimated that the city and county road maintenance funds are underfunded by about $47 million per year and $34 million per year, respectively.\“We’re scarcely spending half of what we need to more cost-effectively maintain roads,” he said. “It is much more cost effective to maintain roads before they require major reconstruction.”\Commissioner Josh Slotnick said he’s heard “loud and clear” that raising property taxes is not an option.\Members of the public then gave their comments.\“Our infrastructure, particularly our transportation infrastructure, is in poor shape,” said Chris Anderson, president of DJ&A Engineering in Missoula. “A gasoline tax is one of the fairest taxes I know of. Those that use the roads pay for the maintenance of it and pay for it as they put gas in their vehicle.""\He noted that Missoula County sees about 1.5 million tourists every year.\""A huge part of this is when people come to visit from out of the county. When tourists come to visit, they pay (the gas tax) as well,"" he said. ""They use the roads, but they’re not paying property taxes. They’re not paying their fair share.”\Anderson noted that state law requires at least 1% of revenue from the gas tax to go to gas distributors to make up for losses, and he said that should be higher.\“We don’t have enough tools in our tool belt to keep up with rising demand,” he continued. “Investments now will pay tremendous dividends later. I see this as a tremendous opportunity to leverage federal dollars, to bring money to our county that would otherwise not be available. A good example is the federal $13 million BUILD Grant the county got. A lot of other funding is only available if you have a local match.”\Several representatives of petroleum distribution companies spoke against the proposed tax.\Dirk Cooper, the vice president of Hi-Noon Petroleum and president of the Montana Petroleum Marketers and Convenience Store Association, said small station operators next to the Missoula County line will lose business to competitors over the county line who can charge less for gas. He said many people will “drive 10 miles to save a penny on gas”, and that means they’ll buy fewer snacks and other products from the gas stations they’re avoiding.\“That creates a very anti-competitive environment for anybody who is close to the county line and an advantage for their competitor,” he said. “Don’t fool yourself, people driving up from the Bitterroot will stop for gas before they get into Missoula County, so I think the volume of fuel that will be sold in Missoula will probably decline based on that.”\He said his association has supported statewide gas taxes because they know roads need maintenance and property taxes are already a burden.\Earl Allen, a resident of Turah east of Missoula, said he feels like the wishes of city voters are being foisted upon county voters.\“My voice and my vote for legislature and other issues are often diluted and drowned out by the population of the folks in the city proper, and that’s my concern here,” Allen said. “By putting this on the county-wide ballot, my concern is you’ll allow the population of the city to overwhelm the folks outside the city to pass a regressive tax which will have a greater effect on the folks out where I live, folks who commute into town every day for work.”\Jim Bachand, the CEO of the Missoula Organization of Realtors, said they commissioned a survey that found 69 percent of respondents saw a need for increased road funding and 62 percent supported a gas tax.\“Realtors are very concerned about the property tax burden on property owners, and they’re also concerned about the condition of roads,” he said.\Anderson, the supporter of the tax from DJ&A Engineering, said he knows opponents will say the county and city need to be more efficient with the money they already have.\“But that’s only part of the problem, just like this gas tax is only part of the solution,” he said. “We need to find more revenue streams, and this presents us with the opportunity to do that locally here in Missoula.”\The commissioners took no action on Thursday. They’ll meet again on Thursday, March 5, at 2 p.m. in the Sophie Moiese Room of the County Courthouse to take more public comment before voting on whether to put the issue before voters."
48,"The May 24 Missoulian published bookend opinion pieces about both successes and failures in this year’s legislative session.\We wish to say thank you for the times legislators worked across the aisle to pass sound legislation for all Montanans. Like minds came together and agreed upon many issues, from public lands to suicide prevention.\Also, legislation was passed that addresses some of our crumbling infrastructure. Over $200 million in cash was approved for ongoing infrastructure projects, which qualify for federal matches, translating into hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of highway projects. With the gas tax, projected to provide $35 million-$45 million a year, soon we’re talking about real infrastructure progress!\Or are we? Here is where we say “a pox on both your houses.” Revenue that will be realized by these measures is but a fraction of the $13 billion worth of infrastructure needs that have accrued as a result of kicking the infrastructure can down the road each session. We call our legislators out on a few of their points:\1. The infrastructure bill that failed at the end of the session was a bonding, not infrastructure bill. Of course it was an infrastructure (as defined in the Merriam-Webster dictionary) bill. The bill sought bonding as a measure to pay for necessary infrastructure that does not otherwise have a source of revenue.\2. Campus building restoration and repair should be financed through a long-range building program; a valid point. However, this and other state programs have dried up, causing universities and public school advocates to push for having these restoration projects placed in an infrastructure bill. Legislators can point their fingers at the executive branch and scream poor fiscal management, but the fact is that revenue has declined while needs persist.\3. In order to ensure that the state does not “pit communities against each other,” the legislature must pass two infrastructure bills (one targeting urban projects, the other, rural) or neither at all. We understand that going for broke is an option, but these tactics were punitive and produced an additional cohort of “losers.” This approach is hardly the high road.\4. We are saddling our grandchildren with debt they didn't ask for. Yup. At the same time they will be driving on safer roads, attending schools and using public facilities that are safe, up-to-date and are important to businesses considering moving to Montana. These are pro-growth benefits for a debt payment on an $80 million plus interest infrastructure bond for 20 years that, on average, translates into approximately 50 cents per Montanan per month. Without this needed investment now, inflation will be working against us, and the same needs will cost our children twice as much in 20 years.\5. Bonding is appropriate for profit-generating business, but not for nonprofit-generating entities such as states; a ridiculous argument. Municipalities, school districts and families are not-profits, yet they engage in bonding when economic circumstances are favorable. Homeowners take out loans to repair crumbling infrastructure (an aging roof). Interest rates will never be lower. Bonding as a component of our fiscal mix makes smart business sense for addressing Montana’s citizens’ needs.\In the debate about unfunded but necessary infrastructure projects, both sides refused to recognize valid points by the other. This must be addressed. People/businesses move to areas with good infrastructure that provide a safe, stimulating environment to raise their family and conduct business. Our unparalleled landscape isn't enough draw when schools are run down and roads are bad.\We hear rumblings of a special session. Montana legislators must leave their animus behind and find common ground. Solve the infrastructure conundrum!"
49,"While the threat of invasive aquatic mussels has grabbed headlines in recent years, Montana may need comprehensive reforms to deal with all manner of invasive plants and animals.\The governor-appointed Montana Invasive Species Council has conducted a legal review of invasive species laws and regulations. The review covered federal, state, tribal and local jurisdictions and found a number of overlaps and gaps in funding and authority.\At the 2018 Montana Invasive Species Summit in Helena this week, the council will host experts and lawmakers in an effort to chart a path forward in Montana’s fight against the nonnatives.\“That’s one of the purposes of this summit is to gather information on an all-taxa invasive species act,” said Bryce Christiaens, chairman for the council. “We have strong legislation on aquatic invasive species, we’re strong on terrestrial weeds, but it’d be great if we could pull that together so that we’re making sure we’re talking about all invasive species threats.”\Major attention paid to invasive aquatic mussels following detection of larvae in 2016 has raised the attention paid to nonnative species and has overshadowed other potential threats, he said.\Christiaens pointed to the proliferation of weeds along with species not yet here, including Canadian feral hogs detected within a few miles of Montana and the emerald ash borer now as close as the Dakotas. Both of those species have caused costly environmental impacts in other states and would likely do the same here.\Development of a comprehensive list of invasive species as well as a framework for prioritizing them is one of the steps the council could undertake. That would help with practical management for species such as the emerald ash borer, where the review identifies an authority gap, or aquatic invasive plants, where authority remains ambiguous, Christiaens said.\“With a comprehensive framework, we can look at management and potential vectors in a way that encompasses all invasive species,” he said, providing the example of watercraft inspection stations also checking firewood for insect infestations.\The upcoming session of the Montana Legislature is fast approaching, with the first day Jan. 7, 2019. While Christiaens would like to see discussion of an all-encompassing Montana Invasive Species Act, the funding for the aquatic invasive species program looms as a priority.\Montana is particularly critical in the fight against invasive mussels when it comes to stopping them from going on to the Columbia River Basin and states to the east, such as Idaho, Washington and Oregon. Such an infestation could mean hundreds of millions in impacts if mussels clogged hydropower, irrigation and municipal water infrastructure plus it would degrade existing aquatic life.\Rep. Mike Cuffe, R-Libby, who was elected to the Montana Senate last week and carried the 2017 aquatic invasive species funding bill in the House, will appear on a panel Friday at the Helena summit along with a number of other legislators.\“The funding mechanism was a bridge between 2017 and 2019 and we were not that satisfied with it but something needed to be done,” he said. “It’s a pretty good program … and the threat continues.”\The 2017 legislation included raising fees for fishing licenses and taxes on hydropower. Both have drawn some pushback and lawmakers tackled a new bill through the legislative interim Environmental Quality Council. The council’s proposal eliminates hydropower as a funding source in favor of money from the state's general fund, a lower fee attached to fishing licenses, a gas tax already collected on watercraft and fees on motorized and nonmotorized watercraft.\Cuffe and others expect the Legislature to continue to refine a final funding bill, but agrees with spreading around the funding sources.\Rep. Janet Ellis, D-Helena, who won a Senate seat last week, also will serve on Friday’s panel. She has not had a chance to look in depth at potential legislation, but is interested in the legal review of invasive species laws and regulations and looking at ways to make Montana’s program more effective and efficient.\On the issue of funding the aquatic invasive species program, Ellis is open to new ideas for finding the money.\“I sat on the (Environmental Quality Council) and it was a priority to keep this program going,” she said. “The threat of quagga mussels is real and significant. A goal for me is making sure it is fully funded.”"
50,"HELENA - An oil-and-gas development impact fund, freezing college tuition in Montana and tax cuts for small business are among the ideas Democratic legislative candidates will be promoting this election - and, at the 2013 Legislature, they said Wednesday.\Montana Democrats, in the minority at the 2011 Legislature, unveiled a broad range of plans to boost Montana's economy, culled from a series of ""listening sessions"" with businesspeople and local officials across the state in the past several months.\""(People) didn't say the state needed to lay off thousands of public-service providers; they didn't say that we should give massive tax breaks to out-of-state corporations, many of whom are their competitors,"" said Senate Minority Leader Carol Williams, D-Missoula. ""They asked us to take a smart, middle-of-the-road approach to create a stable business environment in Montana.""\Williams, Rep. Chuck Hunter, D-Helena, and House candidate Jenny Eck of Helena said the plan will serve as a ""menu of options"" that Democratic legislative candidates can use in their campaigns if they choose.\Williams also said Democrats plan to pursue the goals whether they have majorities or not at the 2013 Legislature.\""If people are strongly supportive of these programs and want to go forward, then I think we can make a bipartisan connection,"" she said.\Republicans hold a 28-22 edge in the Montana Senate and a 68-32 majority in the House. The Nov. 6 elections will determine whether Republicans maintain their majorities.\Hunter said the most common theme they heard from businesspeople was the importance of education and its link to providing a skilled workforce to fill jobs.\""It's safe to say that there is no job creation that is independent of education,"" he said. ""They go hand-in-hand.""\Hunter said Democrats have always emphasized and supported state funding for education, but that Republicans weren't really serious about it during the last Legislature.\When asked how or where Democrats planned to find more funding for schools or the university system, Hunter said the state has a substantial surplus of cash in its treasury right now.\Bowen Greenwood, executive director of the Montana Republican Party, noted that Republican gubernatorial candidate Rick Hill has proposed a new school-funding plan, using natural-resource taxes to replace some property taxes as a funding source for schools.\""We're the ones who are talking about innovative solutions for education funding,"" Greenwood said.\Hunter also said the Democrats' plan is a diverse set of ideas that aims to develop many aspects of the economy, while ""what I seem to hear from Republicans at this point is that natural-resource development is the (only) answer.""\Other aspects of the Democrats' plan include:\* An oil-and-gas impact fund, perhaps financed by oiland-gas tax revenue, to help Montana communities react to effects of booming oil and gas development.\* Elimination of the property tax on up to $1 million of business equipment for any individual business.\* More workforce training, with consultation with business on where it's most needed.\* Development of all types of energy, including renewable power and conservation, and a possible expansion of the man-date for utilities to invest in renewable power."
51,"WASHINGTON ? Congress on Thursday sent President Bush an $8 billion rescue package for the federal highway trust fund. The infusion comes as the trust fund, which relies on declining revenues from the federal gas tax, verges on going broke, threatening road and bridge projects in every state.\The House passed the measure on a 376-29 vote Thursday, a day after the Senate overcame objections from conservative senators and passed it on a voice vote. The legislation transfers $8 billion from the Treasury's general fund to the highway fund, ensuring ongoing construction projects won't be interrupted.\That includes $98 million for Montana roads, said Sen. Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat who is chairman of the Finance Committee. Baucus also said the move will help protect 3,500 jobs in Montana.\The White House had previously threatened to veto the measure, calling it ""both a gimmick and a dangerous precedent that shifts costs from users to taxpayers at large.""\But the administration shifted positions after Transportation Secretary Mary Peters last week revealed that the trust fund would run out of money this month, which would delay payments to states for infrastructure projects and threaten the jobs of hundreds of thousands of construction workers.\It has long been anticipated that the 52-year-old trust fund would move into the red next year, a result of the reluctance of Congress to raise the gas tax, unchanged since 1993 despite inflation and soaring construction costs. The federal fuel tax is 18.4 cents a gallon, or 24.3 cents for diesel.\But the fund, which had a $10 billion surplus just three years ago, has had a rapid change in fiscal fortune as drivers, responding to higher gas prices, have curtailed their driving and switched to more fuel-efficient vehicles.\Peters on Wednesday commended the Senate for its swift action to address the immediate crisis but added in a statement that ""Congress must eliminate the billions in wasted spending, thousands of unneeded earmarks and hundreds of conflicting and contradictory special interest programs in order to make sure states don't face this situation again.""\Stephen E. Sandherr, chief executive director of the Associated General Contractors of America, expressed relief that Congress finally acted.\""We knew this shortfall was coming, and we have made this a priority for the last two years,"" he said. ""The money was set to run out, states were going to be left holding the bag and contractors would have been forced to lay people off.""\Montana Department of Transportation Director Jim Lynch watched the Senate floor debate on the bill Wednesday night on C-SPAN.\""This is so important for Montana; it allows us to continue the schedule of projects we have,"" Lynch said.\It would have been tough for Montana to make up the federal funding shortfall, he said.\""We (Montana) are also seeing declining fuel sales, about a 5 percent reduction,"" Lynch said. ""We are also seeing a decline in state gas-tax revenue, although we'll be able to match the federal highway construction dollars we receive.""\The Montana state tax on a gallon of gas is 27 cents.\The few opponents of the bill blamed the current crisis on the 6,300 earmarks ? lawmakers' pet projects ? worth some $24 billion, included in the $286 billion highway bill Congress passed in 2005. That bill expires next year.\""Part of the reason we are having to steal money from the general fund,"" said Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., is ""we just went hog wild in 2005. We've got to stop this earmarking process.""\Democrats in turn thanked the White House and Republicans for letting the stalled bill move forward. ""I'm glad the Republicans came to their senses ? you can't play politics with 300,000 jobs when we're in a recession,"" said Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calf., chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works.\The American Road and Transportation Builders Association, using Transportation Department figures, said that without the fix, federal highway aid to the states would drop from $35 billion in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30 to $24 billion in the next fiscal year 2009. It estimated that 379,000 jobs would be lost without congressional action.\The House first passed the $8 billion relief bill in July, but Senate Republicans have thwarted several Democratic efforts to move the legislation in the Senate, demanding they first get votes on issues such as the proliferation of earmarks in highway spending bills.\Because highway money is paid out over a number of years, postponement or delay in starting a project can have long-term ramifications. ""The urgency of this bill is very critical. We cannot delay it,"" said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash. Without the money, she said, next week federal reimbursements for state projects could drop to as little as 64 percent of promised funds."

The mineral deposits in Butte have been described as the ""richest hill on earth."" Hundreds of tons of gold and silver and other minerals were removed from the area, with the true wealth being in copper, which was in high demand for a world which was being wired for electricity. At today's values, the amount of money that flowed out of the Mining City was over $100 billion or over $100,000 for every person currently living in Montana. What does Butte have to show today for all that extracted wealth? Where did all that money go?
\
The fact is, the mineral deposits were acquired, mined, processed and sold by corporations which did exactly what were designed to do; make profits for it's (mostly) out-of-state investors. Corporations maximized their profits by controlling worker wages and they protected their economic position by controlling the Montana Legislature. Corruption in Montana was rampant. It was this messy period that inspired Montana to pass laws to limit corporate influence over state elections. It was these laws that the Supreme Court recently overturned in the Citizens United decision. It's why so many of us are passionate about corporate influence. We see history repeating itself.
\
But history shows us examples of successful development too.
\
Despite strong opposition, back in the 70s Montana established a trust fund for the coal severance tax which has proven to be a great idea. The way it was set up, the principal in this trust can not be spent without the consent of 3/4 of the Legislature. The coal trust fund currently has about $1 billion in it, with the interest from the principal contributing about $50 million (spendable) a year to our state budget. Our neighbor to the south, Wyoming, saw fit to create such trust funds years ago for oil and mineral development. Due to this foresight, Wyoming is collecting interest from trust funds in excess of $11 billion. They're in pretty good shape.
\
My reason for citing history is a belief that there are big changes coming to Montana, particularly in the eastern part of our state. Oil and natural gas deposits that were formerly unreachable can now be extracted through advances in drilling and extraction technology. Like many of my fellow Montanan's I'm deeply concerned about what this is going to do to our environment and our quality of life so I would just as soon leave the stuff in the ground. Unfortunately, I don't think that's the option we are going to choose. As such, our state needs to plan ways to protect ourselves environmentally and I firmly believe that this state needs to protect itself financially.
\
There are two important steps that our state needs to take. One is to repeal the gas tax holiday that currently allows oil companies to extract resources for 18 months free from state taxes. This overly generous program was implemented decades ago when oil prices were low in order to stimulate oil exploration and production. Do we really need to continue this giveaway? Do we really need to incentivize an already profitable industry? Are there other industries that receive this kind of largesse? I don't think so. Repeal of the gas tax holiday is long overdue. We tried to pass this in the last legislative session and we failed.
\
The other step we need to take is to create an oil and gas trust modeled on the fund we currently have for coal severance taxes. Put some of our oil money in the bank, leave the principal alone and use the interest to offset property and income taxes. It's the fiscally prudent thing to do, a successful strategy employed by other energy producing states and something that the Montana legislature once again failed to implement when we did not pass HB 589.
\
I'm hoping that the next Legislature can implement these common-sense policies but it's not likely to happen unless Montanans speak up and ask for them. Legislators are very sensitive to what their constituents have to say. Regardless of whether you believe that, it's certainly true that if our citizens stay silent only the voice of the lobbyists will be heard.
\
Let's learn from Butte's history. When it comes to resource development, our state should be treated like a partner, not a piggy bank.

53,"DEQ says 3rd Street Northwest may cost more than expected to fix \By SONJA LEE Tribune Staff Writer \Department of Environmental Quality and Cascade County officials are eager to move forward with a cleanup of groundwater and soil pollution that turned up at county-owned property on 3rd Street Northwest. \The costs of cleaning up the complex site, however, could be well over the $$@$!1 million the county has available in the state's petroleum cleanup fund, which is money generated from the federal gas tax. \DEQ officials Tuesday met with county commissioners to discuss the complexity of the site and to make sure both groups are on the same page in terms of assessing the scope and source of the petroleum contamination. \""It's no small, corner service station,"" said Jeff Kuhn, the DEQ's petroleum release section manager. ""We know it is going to take a lot of money to clean it up."" \County officials said they would like to find out about Brownsfields grants and other sources to help defray costs. Brownsfields grants are part of the funds the Environmental Protection Agency provides for cleanups. \DEQ officials said cleanup costs will become clearer after more testing provides a better understanding of the extent of the pollution, but probably will exceed the $$@$!1 million cap. \Tests to determine if the pollution has leaked into the Missouri or area utility lines still must be conducted. DEQ officials say they hope to wrap up those final assessments in April, so that cleanup can begin this summer. \The site, on the 300-400 block of 3rd, is home to several county offices, including the county road and bridge department, commonly called the county shop, its fueling station and the adjacent, privately owned Montana Specialty Mills. The pollution is also under the J Bar T property and West Bank Park. \Montana's largest gasoline refinery, the Sunburst Refining Co., was on the property until 1932, and the site already has been designated a medium-priority state Superfund site, one of 200 in Montana. \The DEQ has yet to place the blame for the pollution on any single party. But Montana Specialty Mills has sued the county in District Court, alleging that spills, leaks and other releases of hazardous substances have migrated to its property. \The county has hired Neil Consultant to investigate the matter. DEQ officials said they hope that, despite the litigation, the cleanup can get under way. \Because there are no drinking wells in the area, there are no serious health concerns, but officials are worried the petroleum leftovers are oozing into the nearby Missouri. \""Cleaning this site up is going to take a lot of resources,"" said Patrick Skibicki, a DEQ environmental specialist. \About @$!1 million in state money available for cleaning up the Road and Bridge area already has been spent. \There are multiple soil borings and about 20 permanent groundwater-monitoring wells on the various properties. \The DEQ wants to test the underground utility lines for pollution, because they sometimes can act as a conduit. It's not known if the storm lines under 3rd are providing a path for the pollution. \Kuhn and Skibicki said the county contributed to the problems at the site. If the former refinery was fully to blame, the pollutants would have been more widespread. \The gas and diesel pollution is from the county's old fueling sheds at the vehicle maintenance shop and from the underground pipelines between the maintenance shop and dispenser, the DEQ said. \Evidence of soil pollution at the county road and bridge department and solid waste district was found when a pump house and above-ground and underground petroleum piping was removed from the road and bridge department. \""The data seems to point that it came from the operation the county has had at that site,"" Kuhn said.

54,"HELENA ? Lawmakers closed the book on the 2009 legislative session Tuesday after sending nearly 600 bills to the governor for signing. As of Friday, Gov. Brian Schweitzer signed 382 of those bills into law and vetoed six others.\Legislators dealt with a broad spectrum of proposed bills this year, ranging from measures designating the state insect and state pancake, to far more serious bills dealing with issues such as abortion and the death penalty.\As with every session, the vast majority of proposals were killed on the House and Senate floors, or in various committee rooms.\This year, lawmakers requested 2,369 bills, introduced 1,316 of them, and passed 579 pieces of legislation to the governor.\With the 2009 legislative session in the books, here's a look at some of the bills that impact northcentral Montana, as well as a recap of what happened to some of the session's most controversial measures.\NORTHCENTRAL MONTANA\HB5\The measure contains a $1.6 million appropriation for the Montana State University-Great Falls College of Technology. About $1.1 million of the funds will be used to complete construction on a simulated hospital in the basement of the newly expanded area of the college. The remaining $500,000 will be spent designing and constructing a childcare facility on campus, MSU-Great Falls officials said.\The measure also contains $1.31 million to upgrade the state Department of Corrections' Great Falls Youth Transition Center, a prerelease-style program for juvenile offenders. According to DOC spokesman Bob Anez, the facility is a former private home that was converted into its current use. The state pays $36,500 a year to lease it. However, Anez said the facility doesn't meet local and state building regulations.\The upgrade work would replace the 3,600-square-foot existing outdated facility with a 4,600-square-foot state-owned building.\The bill is awaiting the governor's signature.\HB6 and HB11\Improvements for the Upper and Lower River Road Water and Sewer District and the Gore Hill County Water District in Great Falls will get a boost from funding contained in these two measures. HB6 includes $200,000 in renewable resource grants, and HB10 contains $750,300 in Treasure State Endowment grants.\The governor already signed HB6. HB11 awaits his signature.\HB7\This measure puts nearly $300,000 in reclamation and development grants toward a soil cleanup on county property on 3rd Street Northwest in Great Falls. It also includes $286,792 for research into a sustainable water supply from the Madison Aquifer for Cascade County.\The governor signed the measure.\HB9\The Great Falls Symphony, Paris Gibson Square Museum of Art, the Mansfield Center for the Performing Arts and the Great Falls History Museum will receive a total of $30,000 in grants through the Montana Arts Council as a result of this legislation.\The bill awaits the governor's signature.\SB8\Sponsored by Sen. Ken ""Kim"" Hansen, D-Harlem, this measure allows irrigators, municipalities, recreationists, tribes and other Milk River stakeholders to form a regional water resource authority to determine how water users should be charged to help foot the state's $38 million share of the $154 million repair bill for the St. Mary Diversion.\Schweitzer signed the bill.\SB222\Also sponsored by Hansen, this bill removes a requirement that the Montana Department of Transportation seek special federal funding for four-lane highway construction along U.S. Highway 2 between the North Dakota and Idaho borders.\The original 2001 ""4 for 2"" bill required MDT to seek federal funds that didn't require state matching funds. It also stated that MDT may not expend any resources on the Highway 2 project that would jeopardize any future highway projects.\SB222 removes that language, thereby ""leveling the playing field"" for Highway 2 construction, Hansen said.\Schweitzer signed the measure.\Nearly all sessions include a handful of heated debates over hot-button issues such as abortion, gun rights, the death penalty and the environment. The 2009 session was no different. While lawmakers generally got along far better than they did in 2007, the 2009 session wasn't free of controversy and partisan rancor.\Here's a rundown of some of the most talked about bills this session:\Abortion\SB46 and SB406\Laurel Republican Sen. Dan McGee introduced a pair of proposed constitutional amendments that brought droves of supporters and opponents to the Capitol for a series of highly charged debates.\SB46 proposed to modify the state constitution to declare the protection of unborn life as a compelling state interest. SB406 proposed amending the constitution to define a person as ""a human being at all stages of human development of life."" If passed, the proposals would have gone before voters on the November 2010 ballot.\Both measures cleared the Senate and died in a House committee.\HB661\Introduced by Rep. Joel Boniek, R-Livingston, HB661 would have prevented abortion facilities from operating without a state license.\The bill died in committee.\SB374\Manhattan Republican Sen. Gary Perry's bill would have required that parents be notified before a minor receives an abortion. The bill died in committee.\Agriculture\HB418\Winifred Republican Rep. Ed Butcher's bill authorizes the construction of horse-slaughter houses in the state and exempts their construction from environmental appeals. The bill passed the Legislature its first time through and then received an amendatory veto by Schweitzer that stripped language exempting slaughter plants from environmental appeals. Lawmakers in both houses rejected those amendments and sent the bill back to Schweitzer in its original form.\The governor refused to sign the bill in the allotted 10-day period, allowing it to become law.\HB445\This measure, by Rep. Betsy Hands, D-Missoula, would have laid out a legal framework by which seed companies would pursue accusations of seed piracy. It also would have limited the liability for farmers who unknowingly grew patented plants.\The bill cleared the House and then died in a Senate committee.\Death penalty\SB 236\Opponents of the death penalty came into the session believing this was the year the Legislature would ban the practice. SB 236, by Sen. Dave Wanzenried, D-Missoula, came close, passing the Republican-controlled Senate 27-23 before dying in the House Judiciary Committee.\Energy\HB307\Colstrip Republican Duane Ankney's bill gives ""common-carrier"" status to pipelines that move carbon dioxide from plants burning fossil fuels such as coal to locations where it would be injected into underground reservoirs. Common-carrier status will allow the use of eminent domain ? the taking of private property for the greater good ? to construct such pipelines.\The governor signed the bill.\HB575\This bill, by Rep. Bill McChesney, D-Miles City, would have allowed water that's pumped out of the ground during the production of coal-bed methane to be used for ""certain beneficial purposes,"" such as stock water or irrigation.\The bill passed both chambers before the governor vetoed the measure.\SB257\This bill, by Sen. Jim Keane, D-Butte, allows owners of hydroelectric dams to upgrade existing facilities to increase electricity output and classify the new energy as renewable.\The bill is awaiting the governor's signature.\SB258\Helena Democrat Sen. Christine Kaufmann's measure would have scaled back the oil and gas tax holiday to bring more energy tax revenue to the state.\The billed died in a Senate committee.\SB498\This measure, by Sen. Keith Bales, R-Otter, creates a carbon-sequestration law and puts the program under the purview of the state Board of Oil and Gas rather than environmental regulators, as Democrat-sponsored bills would have done.\The bill is awaiting the governor's signature.\Environment\HB483\Sponsored by Rep. Llew Jones, R-Conrad, HB483 speeds the permitting and appeals processes for major energy projects. The bill received a slew of amendments from the governor's office, some of which softened language that would have limited the public's ability to appeal environmental permits.\The governor signed the amended bill and the Legislature approved the amendment.\SB440\Sponsored by Sen. Kelly Gebhardt, R-Roundup, SB440 would have exempted air-quality permits from review under the Montana Environmental Policy Act.\The measure passed the Senate before dying in a House committee.\Gun laws\HB228\Laurel Republican Rep. Krayton Kerns' measure modifies the state's concealed weapons law.\The original bill, which would have allowed citizens to carry a firearm inside city limits without a permit, was opposed by the law enforcement community. The compromised measure passed by the Legislature stripped that language. The amended bill clarifies that people don't have an obligation to try to run away before using a gun in self defense. It also states that landlords can't limit tenants' gun rights.\The governor signed the bill."

""Even banning all guns won't end random gun violence,"" Wilmer said. ""We need to have a more open, rather than polarized, dialogue about the reality of gun control and gun rights because people tend to not listen to each other.""
\
Wilmer voted to reduce the business equipment tax for small businesses in the previous state Legislature and called state taxes fair.
\
She thinks the state has a limited role in supporting the creation of high-paying technology jobs that do not negatively impact the environment.
\
""Should we subsidize them?"" Wilmer said rhetorically. ""We subsidize oil development with the 18-month gas tax holiday. Give technology businesses an 18-month tax holiday? ""
\
On education, Wilmer said she would not support the creation of school-choice vouchers or legalizing charter schools.
\
""This is not Chicago. It's not New Orleans. They have really seriously failing schools, but we do not have failing schools,"" the university professor said. ""The notion that you can opt-out and take your tax money with you -- what about childless property owners who pay? ""
\
Wilmer said the state's constitution prevents public funding for private charter schools. She said our current schools are not lacking in innovation and that a high level of local control of public schools in Montana made more private schools unnecessary.

WASHINGTON -- In a sign of just how bad congressional dysfunction has gotten, Senate Republicans on Tuesday blocked the advancement of a transportation bill, a piece of legislation that traditionally has enjoyed broad bipartisan support.
\
The vote was 52-44, short of the 60 needed to take up the bill.
\
""I don't know why everything we do has to be a fight,"" lamented Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev.
\
Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said that the parties are close to an agreement on amendments that would be brought up for consideration.
\
Last week Republicans tried to tack on a measure that would have allowed employers to opt out of new federal rules requiring insurance companies to offer certain services, including contraceptive care, on religious grounds. It failed.
\
Advancing the legislation in the Senate was seen as a crucial step, as House Speaker John A. Boehner struggled to corral votes in that chamber in the face of a backlash against federal spending.
\
Democratic leaders are portraying the standoff as another showdown led by right-flank conservatives.
\
""What we're seeing on the highway bill is a repeat of the payroll tax cut debate,"" said Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., referring to the recent battle to extend the reduction in Social Security payroll taxes for the rest of 2012. ""It's time for Republicans to stop letting the far right call the shots.""
\
Transportation bills have traditionally been among the most popular pieces of legislation, often passing with strong bipartisan support.
\
This year's efforts have been seen by supporters as jobs legislation critical to boosting the nation's still-sluggish economy by saving or creating up to 3 million jobs. It includes a provision eagerly sought by Los Angeles officials to speed expansion of the region's public transit system and would fund politically popular traffic-easing projects.
\
But detractors, particularly conservatives, are resisting its costs at a time when lawmakers are focused on deficit reduction. Even though the legislation is a priority for Boehner, Republicans have been forced to rewrite their bill after a rebellion within their ranks over a variety of issues, including its fiveyear $260 billion price tag.
\
""The bill before the Senate spends more than we can afford,"" wrote Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., in an oped Tuesday in The Washington Post. ""If we fail this small test, how will we ever pass a sweeping agreement to cut the deficit? ""
\
Republicans in the Senate said Tuesday they had agreed to a ""reasonable"" list of amendments, according to a GOP leadership aide, but Democrats had not yet signed off on the deal.
\
Rejection of the legislation might spur both sides to come to the table.
\
A major challenge facing congressional leaders is trying to maintain the current level of funding for popular road projects without adding to the federal budget deficit.
\
Thanks to consumers buying more fuel-efficient cars, the 18.4-cent-pergallon federal gas tax isn't bringing in enough money to maintain the current level of funding, requiring lawmakers to find money elsewhere.
\
And with Congress ending the practice of lawmakers earmarking funds for pet projects, leaders have limited opportunities to dole out incentives to bring in votes. Earmarking helped win votes for bills in the past but sparked a public outcry after the last big transportation bill, in 2005, was filled with thousands of earmarks, including Alaska's ""bridge to nowhere.''
\
""Do any of you have any idea how difficult it is to do a transportation bill without earmarks?"" House Transportation Committee Chairman John Mica, RFla., said earlier this year.
\
""It's a lot harder to win votes when you don't have goodies to pass out,'' Boehner recently acknowledged.
\
Sen. Barbara Boxer, DCalif., who as chairwoman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee is leading the bill through the debate, recently told her colleagues that, with broad support from a range of organizations including labor unions and the Chamber of Commerce, ""There is no reason for us not to get this done.""

59,"HELENA - In western North Dakota, oil production has been steadily increasing the past 18 months, and new drilling permits may hit record highs this year.\Yet just across the border in Montana, despite sky-high prices for oil and natural gas, oil production has flattened, and the number of new drilling permits declined 20 percent last year.\State Sen. Roy Brown, the Republican challenging Democratic Gov. Brian Schweitzer this year, said this contrast indicates Montana is slipping when it comes to capitalizing on an oil and gas boom.\He also believes it shows that while Schweitzer talks up energy development, the reality doesn't always track.\""The business-friendly environment (Schweitzer) always talks about just does not exist in Montana,"" said Brown, a petroleum engineer and former owner of an oil production company.\Schweitzer tells a different story, and said the numbers back him up. Oil production in Montana, while falling off slightly the past 18 months, is up 40 percent since he took office in 2005, and natural gas production has steadily increased.\In fact, Montana ranks second nationally only to North Dakota in the percentage increase of oil production since 2004.\Leasing of state and federal lands in Montana for oil and gas exploration also has increased during the Schweitzer administration, indicating a healthy interest by the industry, he said.\""Clearly, when you increase the leasing by a great deal, you're nowhere near anti-business."" the governor said in a recent interview ""You've done something to bring business here.""\Regulatory climate OK\Folks in the industry also say that while Montana has some strict environmental laws and an active environmental community that sometimes Fights development, the tax and regulatory climate is pretty good.\""We don't see big permitting problems or regulatory problems,"" said Jenny Brumley, chief executive officer for Encore Operating, a Texas firm and the largest oil producer in Montana. ""We're able to get our work done in an orderly manner.""\Oil and gas production in Montana has increased greatly since Schweitzer took office in 2005, driven in large part by the run-up in price for both commodities.\In 2004, wells in Montana cranked out 25 million barrels of oil and 87 million mcf (thousand cubic feet) of natural gas. By 2007, those annual amounts had increased to 35 million barrels and 95 million mcf.\State and local tax revenue from oil and gas production has jumped as well, from $92 million in 2004 to a projected $324 million this year.\Reaching the potential?\The question framed by Brown is whether these numbers could and should be better - and whether policies promoted (or not) by Schweitzer are preventing an even bigger oil and gas boom in Montana.\Brown answers yes to both questions, and notes some other figures:\In Wyoming and North Dakota, natural gas production has increased at a greater rate than in Montana since 2004, as has oil production in North Dakota. The number of oil and gas drilling permits in Montana also has declined 40 percent from a record high in 2005, while the number of permits in North Dakota has shot up during that time.\Oil production in Montana also declined slightly from 2006 to 2007, and has been relatively flat this year - while production in North Dakota is going up.\One reason for Montana's oil production decline is simple geology, industry insiders say. Wells drilled in the Montana portion of the Bakken oil field, which straddles the Montana-North Dakota border, are older and leveling off, while strikes in North Dakota are more recent and coming in strong.\Yet Brown said if he's elected governor, he'll do more to encourage oil and gas development. He criticizes Schweitzer for opposing elimination of Montana's property tax on business equipment, said workers' compensation insurance is too expensive in Montana, and claims that state agencies and boards sometimes work against development.\One example he and others point to is a 2006 decision by the state Board of Environmental Review, whose members are appointed by Schweitzer.\The board, in response to a petition from irrigators in the Tongue River Valley, created new stricter standards for water discharged by operators of coalbed natural gas wells.\Restrictive standards\Mike Caskey, executive vice president and chief operating officer for Fidelity Exploration and Production Co, the largest producer of natural gas in Montana, said the company is ""making every effort to meet the most restrictive standards of any Western state."" But they don't exactly encourage development of new wells in Montana, he said.\Schweitzer doesn't apologize for the tougher standards.\The standards protect downstream water users, like irrigated farms, and with natural gas prices at record levels, production companies can well afford to treat water from wells so it doesn't harm other water users, he said.\""I do not believe that we should take from Peter to pay Paul,"" Schweitzer said. ""Peter is a ranch family that has lived along the Tongue or the Powder River for 130 years. Paul is a coalbed methane company that comes in and proposes to dump salty water into the river and walk away.""\Industry officials also note that state fish and game officials in 2007 officially protested some federal oil and gas leases in Montana. The protests said oil and- gas development could hurt sage grouse breeding, and suggested bigger buffer zones around breeding areas.\Industry officials feared the larger buffer zones could halt oil and gas development in large areas of the state.\Bird-watching\Again, Schweitzer sees no problem here. He said the Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks wants to ensure that sage grouse do not become an endangered species, which would mean more restrictions on all types of business activity, including oil and gas, farming and ranching.\As for Montana's tax structure, Schweitzer rejects the notion that the property tax on business equipment deters oil and gas development. The tax rate dropped by two-thirds earlier this decade, and Montana's overall tax structure doesn't penalize oil and gas producers, he said.\North Dakota and Wyoming both have sales taxes, while Montana does not, he adds.\""North Dakota's sales and use tax and Montana's business equipment tax basically cancel each other out,"" he said. ""And complete repeal of the business equipment tax would shift aneven larger share of (property) taxes to homeowners and Main Street businesses.""\Brumley, the CEO for Encore, agrees that Montana's tax burden for oil and gas producers is on a par with other states - which he regards as a good thing.\Who gets the credit?\Brown and industry officials, however, note that the major changes in Montana's oil and gas tax structure occurred in 1999, long before Schweitzer was governor.\Drilling in Montana started to increase after that change, and Schweitzer can't truly take credit for the boom in the past several years, which is a product of rising prices and policies put into place by Republicans before him, Brown said.\If Republicans had been in control since 2005, enacting more industry-friendly policies, Montana wouldn't be seeing a drop-off in production right now, Brown said.\Schweitzer said Brown can talk all he wants, but oil production during his administration is higher than under administrations of three prior Republican governors - and Montana is one of only several states where oil production has increased since 2004.\Schweitzer believes production will continue to be fairly strong in Montana, and that he deserves some credit for the increase under his administration Leasing of state lands for oil and gas has doubled under his administration, he said, and he's traveled to Canada to entice producers, put on seminars for producers about Montana's tax and regulatory structure, and pressed for more pipeline capacity to move Montana products.\""I love oil production, and I'm bragging about it,"" Schweitzer said. ""If I was on the other side, I wouldn't bring this issue up."""

61,"FWP commissioners propose banning snowmobile 'skipping' \Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks commissioners have proposed a permanent rule to ban the practice of ""skipping"" snowmobiles at high speed over open water. The proposed rule is open to public comment until Feb. 22. \""The agency recommended that the Commission take this action because the practice of 'water skipping' on public waters may be dangerous to the individual and to the general public, and harmful to the environment,"" said Beate Galda, chief of FWP's law enforcement division. ""The proposed ban would apply only to publicly accessible waters and would still allow snowmobiles to make short crossings over water in order to continue on winter trails."" \In water skipping, a rider takes a snowmobile down a bank or boat ramp into a large body of water at full speed, skimming across the water's surface. If the machine slows down or stalls, it quickly sinks.

The idea is to save some maintenance money.

62,"FWP commissioners propose banning snowmobile `skipping'\Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks commissioners have proposed a permanent rule to ban the practice of ""skipping"" snowmobiles at high speed over open water. The proposed rule is open to public comment until Feb. 22.\""The agency recommended that the Commission take this action because the practice of `water skipping' on public waters may be dangerous to the individual and to the general public, and harmful to the environment,"" said Beate Galda, chief of FWP's law enforcement division. ""The proposed ban would apply only to publicly accessible waters and would still allow snowmobiles to make short crossings over water in order to continue on winter trails.""\In water skipping, a rider takes a snowmobile down a bank or boat ramp into a large body of water at full speed, skimming across the water's surface.

63,"Missoula loves being sustainable. From locally grown produce to biking in almost any weather, we love to minimize our impact on the environment and preserve our clean lands. However, climate change is always looming, and NASA has reported 2016 as the warmest year on record globally. H\arnessing solar energy is one of the ways Montanans can reduce their footprint even further. Solar panels in this state can pay for themselves in about eight years, saving you money that would have gone to your NorthWestern Energy bill. And if your panels produce more energy than you consume, you can push that electricity back onto the grid for others to use. You receive fair compensation, and others can benefit from your clean energy. This process is called net metering.\However, utility companies are opposing net metering legislation. More than 60 percent of Montana’s energy consumption is still from coal, and forcing residents to purchase this energy results in higher profits for them. While net metering is allowed in Montana, the rate of solar-generated energy back to the grid is currently capped at 50 kilowatts. That’s just barely enough to power a small business.\Montanans want to produce their own, clean energy, and get fairly compensated for their peak-hour production. Our state legislature needs to raise the limit on net metering, allowing us to reduce carbon emissions together, as a community.\Michelle Nemetchek,\Missoula"
64,"
NorthWestern Energy's paid lobbyist, John Fitzpatrick, recently published a letter in the Helena Independent claiming that net metered renewable energy systems are expensive and inefficient. Not true!
\
Public Service Commissions across the country have analyzed net metering and found that it provides more benefits than costs to all consumers and the grid.
\
The price of solar has dropped by 50 percent over the past five years. And as costs have dropped, more people are making private investments in clean, renewable energy, taking control of their energy future and reducing their monthly utility bills. The law shouldn't be a barrier to citizens who want to make this wise choice.
\
Removing some of those artificial barriers is the goal of the large coalition of citizens from across Montana who want to expand our net metering laws. Our legislative proposals would allow more Montanans to access small-scale renewable energy, enable projects with greater economies of scale, and ensure the lowest cost for everyone involved consumers, utilities, and taxpayers.
\
Large utilities like North-Western Energy see individual investment in renewable energy as a threat to their monopoly control over customer power choices. But the freedom to choose our energy source is really energy democracy and our right as citizens.
\
The recent crude oil contamination of the Yellowstone (and the resulting harm to both humans and the ecosystem ) once again highlights our need to transition away from fossil fuels and into the multiple benefits of renewables
\
Net metering favors innovation and choice over a monopoly business model that is slow to change no wonder they're protesting. But should the interests of a few corporations outweigh the benefits to all Montanans and our environment? Definitely not!

65,"A silver inverter box in the basement of First United Methodist Church in Great Falls will take direct current from electricity generated by photovoltaic solar panels on the roof and turn them into alternating currents suitable for the power grid and powering the church.\Excess energy the system generates will cause the meter to spin backward, and NorthWestern Energy, the state's largest utility, will purchase it from the church. Ken Thornton, an early backer of solar energy and the church's building manager, led the project, with the PV panels installed in the summer. It will begin working next month.\""It's funny, this is where they used to store the coal,"" said Thornton one day last week, pointing out a nearby room where circles still remain on the ceiling indicating manholes where coal from wagons was once dropped into the facility and burned in boilers.\Power generation at the church is evolving thanks in part to net metering, a billing system in which surplus energy generated by a customer's solar, wind or hydro-power system goes back on NorthWestern's electric system with the customer receiving credit at retail rates. The 8-kilowatt rooftop solar system at First United will save an estimated $1,500 a year in energy costs.\Net metering has been around in Montana since 1999. It's designed to encourage rooftop solar and other small renewable power generators that are easier on the environment. In Montana, customers of investor-owned utilities, such as the church can take advantage of it.\Expanding it to spur even more solar, wind and hydro projects at residences, farms and ranches, housing, businesses and even neighborhoods is a hot topic at the 2015 Legislature, spurred in part by the plummeting cost of solar.\""Renewable energy standards are kind of old hat,"" said Kyla Maki, clean energy program director for the Montana Environmental Information Center, of the green power standards that dominated past energy policy discussions at the Capitol. ""We're now talking rooftop solar.""\The benefits of increasing net metering, Maki added, will go to the increasing number of people who are interested in investing in renewable energy systems on their property.\Some Republicans are joining conservation groups and companies in the renewable energy business in supporting an expansion of net metering in Montana.\""This is a freedom bill,"" said Rep. Art Wittich, R-Bozeman. ""It would allow for energy freedom, so you don't have to buy power from a monopoly utility that decides how they are going to generate it. You can decided how you are going to generate your own power.""\Wittich is sponsoring a bill that would increase the allowable output of a renewable energy system eligible for net metering credits from the current 50 kilowatts to 1 megawatt.\Businesses that sell solar and wind systems see an opportunity to boost their businesses, create jobs and install more renewable systems at farms and ranches and multi-unit housing.\""You have to strike while the iron is hot,"" said John Foster, a community wind specialist for Moodie Wind Energy in Great Falls, a subset of Moodie Implement, who sells wind and solar systems. ""That's really it. And net metering hasn't been upgraded here in Montana since its inception.""\The legislation would provide incentive for farmers and ranchers to install larger systems that generate more power, making upfront investments more economical, Foster said. And allowing larger turbines will open up new geographic markets for him because they are more cost-effective even in areas with less wind, he said.\Foster also is a big supporter of a bill that would allow a customer generator participating in net metering to carry forward remaining unused kilowatt-hour credits from a solar or wind system and apply excess credits to separately metered accounts.\This bill is important to farmers and ranchers who often have several meters on their land for their home, out-buildings or water pumps for irrigation and stock water, Foster said. Right now, only a single meter can receive credits.\Efforts to expand net metering were shot down in 2013, Foster noted, but the ""political climate is right"" this session with more conservatives on board.\NorthWestern Energy, which has 345,000 electricity customers in Montana, sees the expansion as corporate welfare, said John Fitzpatrick, chief lobbyist for NorthWestern Energy.\Last week, Fitzpatrick told a legislative committee that net metering had grown to industrial proportions in other states with big box stores such as Walmart becoming the largest beneficiaries.\""Net metering is not a business plan,"" Fitzpatrick said. 'It's a welfare program, and it's the worst kind of welfare Democrats hate.""\About 1,200 residential and small business customers of NorthWestern currently have net meters, and the utility has been instrumental in the installation of net-metered systems in Montana over the past two decades, NorthWestern spokesman Butch Larcombe said.\""If anybody says we're opposed to net metering, that just isn't accurate,"" he said.\Each customer of the utility pays a universal system benefits (USB) charge as a result of the original net metering legislation in 1999, he said, and that funding is used for a number of programs, including providing grants to those who install renewable energy systems, he said.\As a result, many of the people who have installed solar panels on their roof, or a wind turbine, are being subsidized by other NorthWestern customers, Larcombe said. Moreover, he added, when they use the electricity they generate to get a credit, it reduces what they pay to maintain the power grid even though they continue to use it, shifting the costs to other customers.\He also noted that NorthWestern is overpaying net metered customers because it buys the power at retail, which is a higher cost than the cost the utility would pay for the power on the market or the cost of generation.\A broader conversation is in order about the state's net metering policy to make sure it's fair to everybody, and that's why NorthWestern opposes the legislation, Larcombe said.\Gary Wiens of the Montana Rural Cooperatives' Association also brought up concerns about cost shift to a legislative committee last week.\Wittich doesn't buy the cost shift argument.\Increasing the net meting cap means people could build larger renewable systems and get credit for them, he said. And ore people want to use solar at business, apartments, neighborhoods and residences, yet the criteria to take advantage of the credits is arbitrary, Wittich said. Right now, he said, only a fraction of the electricity produced in the state is ""homegrown energy,"" and that's low compared to other states.\Wittich's bill increasing the cap on the size of the home grown energy systems that could receive credits is just one of 10 or so bills aimed at expanding net metering in one form or another.\Based on lobbying for and against the bills, Wittich says net metering is among the top 10 issues of the legislative session.\The bill that would allow credits to be applied to separate meters is sponsored by Sen. Jennifer Fielder, R-Thompson Falls.\Fielder told members of the Senate Energy and Telecommunications Committee that she had taken an interest in homegrown renewable energy systems because they help Montanans become self-reliant.\""It promotes self-realization and energy independence for the little guy,"" she said.\Mike Huber, a 45-year-old rancher who lives south of Great Falls, said he's investigated putting up a wind turbine. But he's refrained because right now he could only receive credits for one meter if he invested in a renewable system. But he has six meters alone at one address and ""obviously I can't afford to put a solar or wind generator at each one.""\He supports legislation allowing excess credits to be applied to additional meters.\Rep. Randy Pinocci, R-Sun River, is sponsoring legislation that also would increase the cap on the size of renewable systems that could receive credits in territories served by rural electric cooperatives.\Pinocci said he decided to take action in the Legislature because he wanted to put a larger wind turbine on his property, but couldn't because of a cap under the current rules. He called the cap ""a joke"" because smaller turbines do not produce enough energy for farming and ranching operations to justify the investment.\""The bigger your wind turbine, the easier it is to pay for it, and the more money you make,"" he said.\Renewable energy has been seen a Democratic issue, Pinocci said, but Republicans are getting involved now and he doesn't care whether it's a Republican of Democratic issue. In his view, limits on the size of renewable energy projects in areas served by rural electric cooperatives is discouraging investment in renewable projects in rural areas. Pinocci, a freshman, said lawmakers shouldn't be influenced by lobbying from NorthWestern or rural cooperatives.\""If any representative votes against my bill, I believe the constituents are going to say, 'No way, what you did was a mistake,'"" said Pinocci.\Conservation groups such as MEIC, the Northern Plains Resources Council and renewable energy organizations are rallying the troops in support of the legislation. The Helena-based Alternative Energy Resources Organization, or AERO, put out an ""action alert"" about a hearing today in the Senate Energy and Telecommunications Committee about a bill from Sen. Mike Phillips, D-Bozeman.\The Montana Neighborhood Net Metering Act would allowed neighborhood energy facilities to connect to a utility's distribution system. Businesses and individuals could then buy into the system.\First United Methodist Church installed the 8-kilowatt PV panels this past summer . In the future, Thornton hopes to put more panels up to increase the output to 25 to 30 kilowatts, which would cover the church's yearly electricity bill of $5,000. The cost of the first phase was $15,000.\Over the past five years, the price of solar panels has dropped 80 percent as the result of the recession and competition from China, Thornton said. That and innovations in the manufacturing processes has resulted in less expensive and more efficient solar panels, he said.\""I've been doing this for 30 years,"" said Thornton, 60, who holds a mechanical engineering technology degree from Montana State University.

LOS ANGELES (MCT) -- Crowned with three gables and painted in hues of gray and white, the suburban home in Lake Forest, Calif., doesn't look much like the domicile of the future.
\
But as summer heat radiates off the fresh asphalt outside, the home runs comfortably at full tilt indoors. Recessed lights shine, radios blare and air-conditioned splendor greets hot skin. Despite all systems going, the property is producing more electricity than it can consume on a warm summer day -- and that's the goal.
\
Unveiled late last year, the ZeroHouse model by Los Angeles builder KB Home embodies the industry's bid to move beyond the one-of-a-kind vanity project and make subdivision building a green practice. Net-zero homes such as the one KB Home has built are highly efficient properties paired with renewable energy technology such as solar panel systems, resulting in homes so green they produce at least as much juice as they consume.
\
California has had expansive policies mandating and incentivizing the development of greener new homes for years, but the implementation of those goals has been slowed by the weak housing market and the dearth of new construction.
\
With the market healing, and with builders trying to distinguish their products from homes they built as recently as six years ago, companies such as KB Home, Lennar Corp. and others are rolling out more options for consumers and increasingly making energy efficiency part of the basic package.
\
""For new homes, it is becoming more of a standard feature, and the reason is that builders need a compelling reason that somebody should buy a new home rather than a resale,"" said Patrick Duffy, principal for research firm MetroIntelligence Real Estate Advisors.
\
In coming years, California guidelines will call for ever more energy-efficient homes, with the goal of having all homes built in 2020 being net zero. For now, net zero remains more of an aspiration for the industry, though experts say builders are increasingly making standard some of the fundamental elements of green design, including more efficient appliances, lighting and solar panel systems.
\
In Southern California, KB Home has made solar systems standard. Lennar, Pulte Homes and Pardee Homes offer solar home projects. ABC Green Home of Newport Beach, Calif., will be building a net-zero home to showcase green technology for consumers. Clarum Homes in Palo Alto, Calif., is a custom builder that has gained praise for incorporating energy efficiency and passive solar features into homes with modernist flourishes.
\
Moving to Southern California from Maryland, Ray and Linda Frilot wanted to buy a new home because the resales needed too much work, from $20,000 to $50,000 worth of remodeling. They were attracted to the solar offerings at KB Home's Fox Hollow at the Crown Valley Village development in Murrieta, Calif., said Ray Frilot, a retired government worker and former military man.
\
Aside from a 2.25-kilowatt solar system, the home has a tankless hot water heater, some LED lighting and Energy Star appliances. Although the home wasn't advertised as a net-zero property when they bought it, he and his wife conserve so much energy from habits picked up while living in Germany that the electricity bill from Southern California Edison Co. is close to zero.
\
""The energy that I don't use Edison buys from me,"" he said. ""It looks like I may not have an electric bill next year, because the electricity, all of it is going to keep on adding to that credit. I still have to pay delivery and handling charges, but that is just a couple of bucks a month.""
\
Net-zero homes couldn't exist without this type of subsidization, called net metering. Net-zero homeowners rely on power from utilities at night but get credit for the energy they produce during the day that they don't consume.
\
Net metering allows homeowners to get credit for the power they produce at a retail rate rather than a wholesale rate. There is currently a cap on net metering programs for that reason. Although the cap won't be hit any time soon, experts said, the future of net metering is uncertain.
\
Environmentalists began pushing for California to mandate that new homes come with renewable energy systems in the early 2000s, as the technology became more scalable and available.
\
The effort to get builders to build green morphed into California state law SB 1, which focused on incentives and created the Million Solar Roofs Initiative, calling for the creation of 3,000 megawatts of new, solar-generated electricity by 2016.
\
Gov. Jerry Brown has increased that goal to 12,000 megawatts, or roughly the equivalent of 12 nuclear power plants, according to the group Environment California. A thousand megawatts of solar energy could power about 250,000 homes.
\
Also created as part of the law was the California Solar Initiative, which uses rebates to promote renewable energy use in previously owned homes, as well as commercial, agricultural, government and nonprofit buildings. The similar New Solar Homes Partnership targets new houses.
\
""Unfortunately, as soon as the bill was passed, we had the housing market collapse, so everything stopped,"" said Bernadette Del Chiaro, director of clean energy and global warming programs at Environment California. ""As the housing market ticks back up again, I would expect solar to pick back up again.""
\
In 2008, California energy regulators adopted a long-term plan that called for having all new residential buildings achieve zero net energy use by 2020 and having all commercial buildings achieve zero net energy use by 2030.
\
Regulators now mandate solar-ready roofs, more efficient lights and betterinsulated hot water pipes, among a variety of other requirements. Despite the rebates that California provides, the tightening of requirements could make new homes more costly.
\
""It is kind of a doubleedged sword because the construction costs of these new homes get passed on to the new home builder,"" said Christopher G. Cardinale, an attorney at Alvarez-Glasman & Colvin, a firm that specializes in real estate. ""In a tough economy, there is always that risk-reward for new environmental standards.""
\
There is evidence that consumers are growing increasingly interested in green features as an investment. A recent study by economists at the University of California-Los Angeles and the University of California-Berkeley found that a green label on a single-family California home provides a premium to a comparable home that isn't identified as using energy efficiently.
\
The researchers found that homes certified as energy efficient by Energy Star, LEED for Homes or GreenPoint Rated sold for about 9 percent more than other homes.
\
Researchers estimate that premium at about $34,800, based on the average $400,000 price of a standard home in California. The premium was significantly more than the cost of making a home energy efficient, estimated at about $4,000 to $10,000 for a 2,000-squarefoot house. The premium also was bigger than the average $700 in annual utility-bill savings for owners of green homes.

67,"
Caron Cooper, 56, is running on the Democratic ticket in 2016 for the Region 3 seat now held by Bozeman Republican Roger Koopman, 65, who was elected in 2012.
\
Pledging to be an ""independent decision-maker "" by focusing on energy conservation and consumer's pocketbooks instead of utility interests, Caron Cooper, a former Livingston city commissioner, announced on Thursday that she was entering the race to become southwest Montana's next Public Service Commissioner.
\
The commission, commonly known as the PSC, supervises and regulates the operations of electric, gas, telephone, water and private sewer utilities, including CenturyLink and North-Western Energy.
\
Cooper, 56, is running on the Democratic ticket in 2016 for the Region 3 seat now held by Bozeman Republican Roger Koopman, 65, who was elected in 2012. Her early campaign strategy is to avoid self-funding and reach donors through online social media.
\
""I've been watching the PSC over the years. I first thought about running 18 years ago but I also had a child,"" Cooper told the Chronicle. ""He's at college now and I have time to focus my energy on this.""
\
In addition to her education and work in the energy field, being a single mother is a viewpoint the all-male PSC could benefit from, she said.
\
Cooper's schedule lists a trip to UC Berkeley next month for an event by the Energy and Resources Group, the program that awarded her a doctorate in 1993. Her dissertation, ""Fuel use and emissions in the USSR : factors influencing CO[bullet] and SO[bullet]"" was finished from Livingston. She moved there and bought a home in 1992. Prior to that she had been an engineer for Unocal Geysers and drilled a geothermal field near Santa Rosa, California.
\
She worries industrybacked outside groups will attack her for her academic association with John Holdren, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, who was her adviser at Berkeley.
\
After earning her doctorate, Cooper worked as an energy production and consumption analyst for the World Bank and USAID in Moscow.
\
More recently, she founded Livingston's Community Closet Thrift Store in 2005.
\
On net metering, Cooper partially agreed with NorthWestern Energy's argument that net-metering benefits the few who can afford alternative energy production at home.
\
""But everyone is tired of a large monopoly running our state,"" she said. ""But I'm interested in speaking with the cities and the counties in District 3 and ask them if they want to generate energy.... I want to explore net metering for small producers like municipalities and businesses.""
\
""I'm really frustrated that the PSC has become a finishing school for termed-out politicians,"" Cooper said. She gives the current commission a Cminus grade. It would be a D but for Commissioner Travis Kavulla, whom she respects, she said.
\
The seat Cooper is seeking represents Beaverhead, Broadwater, Deer Lodge, Gallatin, Golden Valley, Jefferson, Madison, Meagher, Musselshell, Park, Silver Bow, Stillwater, Sweet Grass, and Wheatland counties.
\
""I grew up in a polluted area,"" she said, noting that she was born in Ontario, California. ""I ran around the playground with stagethree smog alerts. I do believe man can influence the environment because I grew up with that influence. I think a lot of the folks here in Montana that are leading discussions about global climate change and don't believe in it simply have never lived a life where they've seen it.""

68,"When Legislature talks energy, wind power likely key part of the discussion\By MIKE DENNISON Tribune Capitol Bureau\HELENA - A blast of wind is blowing through Helena this Legislature - but it's not just the winter weather.\Wind power, long the province of energy wonks and environmentalists, is attempting to seize a central role in the energy debate unfolding before the 2005 Legislature.\From tax credits to mandates for using more ""renewable"" energy, bills to encourage wind-power generation in Montana are in the pipeline in Helena.\""We just finally have that critical mass of awareness and interest, combined with advances in technology, that have opened this window of opportunity,"" says Pat Judge, energy program manager for the Montana Environmental Information Center.\It also hasn't hurt to have Montana's first major wind-power project win a multimillion-dollar contract during the second week of the Legislature.\Last Tuesday, NorthWestern Energy announced it will buy up to 150 megawatts of electricity from a wind farm near Judith Gap, to help serve its 300,000 Montana customers.\Invenergy Wind of Colorado plans to build the project this year, taking over from a Big Sandy firm that has spent more than five years on the development.\But even without the Invenergy contract, wind power would be a hot topic in Helena this legislative session.\Proposals on the drawing board include:\- A bill lowering property taxes on wind-production equipment. Senate President Jon Tester, D-Big Sandy, is sponsoring SB115, which had its first hearing last week.\Supporters say it will make Montana more attractive for wind-power development.\- A measure mandating that utilities in Montana buy a certain amount of ""renewable"" power by certain dates.\The initial draft says 5 percent of power sold in Montana must be from ""renewable"" sources by 2008 and 15 percent by 2015.\Gov. Brian Schweitzer is behind the proposal, and says the existence of the Judith Gap project means the first target will be met already, for NorthWestern Energy customers.\A final version of the bill hasn't been introduced yet.\Judge says it's likely that wind power would be the ""renewable"" power used to meet any minimum requirements.\- A bill to expand the use of ""net metering,"" which allows individual customers to generate their own power - such as wind power - and sell it back to the power company when it exceeds their power needs.\Wind-power enthusiasts, including Schweitzer, say Montana should do what it can to create a market for this clean power that can provide an economic boost for rural areas.\""We have some of the greatest resource of wind of any place in the Great Plains, yet we've developed almost none,"" Schweitzer says. ""It's good economic development.""\Some battles ahead\Yet some wind-power legislation won't come without a political fight.\Republican legislative leaders say they'll be introducing a bill requiring utilities to provide the lowest-cost power for consumers - regardless of the source.\They say they're not opposed to wind power, but that Montanans shouldn't be forced to buy it unless it's the lowest-cost power available.\Mandating that utilities buy a certain amount of renewable power, like wind, isn't a good idea, says Senate Minority Leader Bob Keenan, R-Bigfork.\""That just crosses the line,"" he says. ""It has to be economically feasible.""\There also could be a fight over whether the mandate will apply only to NorthWestern Energy, which serves about half of Montana, or other electricity providers, such as rural electric cooperatives or Montana-Dakota Utilities.\MDU expects to be exempt from any such mandate, said John Alke, a Helena attorney representing the company, and so do the co-ops.\Dave Wheelihan, general manager for the Montana Electric Cooperatives Association, says the individual co-ops don't want to be included in any renewable-power mandate unless their member-customers choose to do so.\Wheelihan said he's visited with the boards of the 26 rural co-ops in Montana, which serve some 400,000 customers.\""Nobody said we want a mandated renewable portfolio standard,"" he says. ""Not one.""\Utility opposition\Judge says he expects utilities to line up against the bill, but that he'll argue that wind power is not only good for the environment, but good for rural economic development.\That argument was heard again and again in last week's hearing on the tax-cut bill, which had no opponents.\But, as supporters of the SB115 pointed out, the tax-cut bill doesn't really cost anyone a penny, because it's cutting taxes that so far no one is paying.\Any property taxes paid by the Judith Gap project will be new revenue, and Wheatland County residents said they're eager to see wind-power development.\""Everyone in our community is excited,"" says Lorraine Peterson, owner of the Judith Gap Mercantile. ""Anything that can be done to help our community will benefit all of Montana.""\Conference\The Harvesting Clean Energy Conference will be held in Great Falls on Thursday and Friday in conjunction with the Montana Agriculture and Industrial Exhibit, or MAGIE.\The clean energy conference, which takes place at the Heritage Inn, is an annual event held in the Pacific Northwest to bring together agriculture and energy industries to advance clean energy opportunities for rural communities and agricultural producers.\For more information or to register for the conference, visit www.har vestcleanenergy.org/hce.html.\PHOTO CAPTION\Seven wind turbines are generating power near Two Dot.

69,"Whether motivated by concerns about penguins on the melting polar icecaps or frustration with the prices at the pump, Montanans are tweaking their lifestyles to decrease their imprint on the environment.\The average American adds about 19,000 kilograms of carbon dioxide into the environment each year - 8,000 more than the average for industrial nations.\The world-wide average is 4,000 KG per year. Experts say to combat climate change, the average needs to be half that.\To accomplish that, we need to reduce or stop using fossil fuels like coal and oil, and we need to plant trees and shrubs that suck carbon dioxide out of the air.\With the help of tax breaks and corporate incentives, Montanans have many opportunities to reduce their carbon footprints.\Ryan Smith, an architect with L'Heureux Page Werner, is one of three Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design-accredited professionals in Great Falls.\He's currently working on designs for three ""green"" buildings, including the new fitness center at Malmstrom Air Force Base. The designs use a mix of the latest technology and simple changes like planting trees to provide shade in the summer and block wind.\Smith said one of the latest trends is to bury large tubing where the temperature stays 55 degrees no matter how hot or cold the air is outside. Water from the tubing is circulated throughout the house, keeping the house cool in the summer and warmer in the winter.\Investing in solar panels and rain water collection systems may cost a chunk of money up front, but in the long run, it amounts to free energy and water.\""It takes a lot of convincing, but 10 years from now, they'll be thanking themselves,"" Smith said.\In 2006, 35 people in Cascade County and northcentral Montana installed solar panels or wind turbines in their homes.\While that number is encouraging, the area is still behind the rest of the state, said John Campbell, Northwestern Energy's renewable energy program manager.\Northwestern Energy offers $7,000 grants to people who want to add renewable energy generators to their homes. As much as $2,500 in tax credits are available from state and federal government, making the $15,000 price tag to install a two kilowatt solar system less of a financial strain.\Mark Gray, who owns Alternative Energy Systems, has seen the price drop and the options expand for home and business renewable energy generators.\""We're still three or four years away before the demand is really going to take off,"" he said. ""I've seen a growth in the last six years, but it's still a snowball on a snail's pace.""\For people who are less ambitious, reducing your carbon footprint can be as easy as planting a tree or changing your light bulbs.\City Forester Jon Thompson said between 42,000 and 44,000 trees grow in Great Falls parks, golf courses and boulevards. He estimates equally as many are in people's yards.\Each year, Great Falls spends $350,000 maintaining and replacing the 200 trees it loses to disease or weather. The effort is motivated as much by wanting to beautify the city and improve the quality of life.\""The off-shoot of that is we're improving the environment at the same time,"" he said.\Switching from a standard bulb to a compact fluorescent one may cost you a few dollars more at the store, but will save $35 in electricity.\""If everyone puts compact fluorescent lighting in their high use places, they will see a big difference in their power bills,"" said Deb Young, program manager for Northwestern Energy's E-plus program.\To get a bulb that is as bright as you're used to, pay attention to the lumens it emits, not the watts it uses. It's also important to buy light bulbs with the energy star rating on it.\Northwestern offers $2 rebates when people buy between five and 15 compact fluorescent light bulbs. The program is one of eight available for homeowners to help reduce their energy usage.\Young said for the company, investing in saving energy is cheaper than buying the energy it sells to customers.\Fortunately for Montana customers interested in reducing their carbon footprint, most of the energy zipping through our homes isn't generated by fossil fuels.\Thanks in large part to the wind farm at Judith Gap, Montana uses the highest percentage of renewable energy in the country, Campbell said. Of the energy Northwestern Energy buys, 8 percent is wind energy.\The majority of Montana is powered by hydroelectricity. While state law doesn't consider it renewable energy, hydropower is carbon free.\Roughly 400,000 Montanans get their power from rural cooperatives. In western Montana, almost 80 percent of the power is supplied by hydroelectric dams, with wind and nuclear power making up the rest.\Eastern Montana cooperatives use more wind power, but also rely on coal-fired plants to supply half of their electricity.\""There is clearly more interest in buying alternative and renewable energy,"" said Gary Wiens, general manager of the Montana Electric Cooperatives Association. ""Cost is clearly a factor. If it gets too much, customers are reluctant to buy it.""\Both Northwestern Energy and the cooperatives offer net metering for people who install solar or wind generators. Those home and business owners get credit on their accounts when they are generating energy, but are not home to use it.\They also have what's called green tags that allow people to pay power companies to invest in renewable energy and environmentally friendly technology.\To learn more go montanagreenpower.com or to www.northwesternenergy.com and then follow the links to the Energy Savings Center and E-plus program.\Earth Day events\Earth Day events\Great Falls\The city of Great Falls, Malmstrom Air Force Base, Pacific Recycling and Montana Waste Systems are sponsoring Earth Day activities Saturday from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. at the Civic Center.

70,"Republicans might be known as the party of light regulation. But all three GOP candidates running for the District 4 Public Service Commission seat say this agency plays an important role by keeping the state’s utilities in check.\The five-member Commission is a quasi-judicial body that the Legislature created to balance a monopoly utility’s right to a fixed return on investment with consumers’ rights to a reasonable price and reliable service.\District 4’s current commissioner, Republican Bob Lake of Hamilton, is termed out. This spring’s primary will see three Republicans and two Democrats running to represent the district, which covers Lincoln, Sanders, Mineral, Granite, Powell, Missoula and Ravalli Counties.\State Sen. Jennifer Fielder, former State Rep. Richard “Champ” Edmunds, and former Montana GOP Chair Will Deschamps are running for the seat.\“It's kind of a tough position for a free market advocate to wrap their mind around,” Fielder acknowledged. “... But these companies aren't operating in a free market environment, because they don't have competition, and so that's where the representation of the people's interests come into play, and I think that's an important role.”\Montana’s two investor-owned utilities, NorthWestern Energy and Montana-Dakota Utilities, operate to make a profit off their ratepayers. But because only one power company serves a given area, they don’t face the same competitive pressures that other companies do. It instead falls to the Public Service Commission to keep their electric rates reasonable, and to set the rates and contract lengths at which they buy power from some types of facilities.\Fielder, who has represented Thompson Falls in the State Senate since 2013, says her work in the legislature has prepared her for this role. “Being a lawmaker has given me a lot of experience with assessing and analyzing different policies and different legal procedures,” she said.\During her time in the Senate, Fielder has been an outspoken proponent of states’ rights. She joined the Bundy family, which led two armed standoffs against federal land managers, at their visit to Paradise in 2018, and currently heads the American Lands Council, which advocates the transfer of federal lands to states.\She considers public lands to be “a fairly unrelated issue” from the Commission’s workload, and intends to step down from the American Lands Council if elected. But Fielder does plan to view the Commission’s decisions through a “federalism filter.”\“I'm not planning to go in and stir the pot between federal and state jurisdiction, but I certainly will be a guardian of the state's rights to govern itself and its resources.”\Neither of her two opponents, Fielder argued, is up to the task. “Frankly, one's not very bright, and the other one's not very honest, and neither one has a strong work ethic.” She didn't elaborate on her criticism.\But both Deschamps and Edmunds say they’ll bring analytic rigor to the Commission.\Deschamps pointed out that he would be the only person on the committee with a bachelor’s of science in business management and finance. He also served as vice-chairman of the board of the Montana Unified School Trust, which provides health insurance for state school district employees. That experience, he predicts, will guide him on the Commission.\“When energy companies come to you, their big push...is they need a rate increase, so they need to provide financials,” he said. “There’s a lot of financial paperwork that comes through, and that’s why I’m suited for it.”\His experience, he continued, has also made him keen to balance short-term savings with long-term certainty. “You can always find somebody that’s going to do something very inexpensively. That’s what I’ve learned...but are they going to be here and be stable to provide the services necessary down the road?”\In his interview, Deschamps expressed more enthusiasm about renewable energy than either of his opponents. He noted that he drives an all-electric car, and predicted that “there will be a day when coal will no longer be used.”\For now, though, he believes that “every source of energy needs to have a place at the table. The Public Service Commission is mandated to make sure the ratepayer pays the least amount possible...while making sure the energy supply is stable.”\The Commission has been accused of suppressing renewable energy projects by setting rates and contract lengths too low for them to compete, while giving fossil-fuel projects insufficient scrutiny. Several renewable-energy companies recently won a lawsuit over their rate cases, a decision the PSC and NorthWestern Energy have appealed to the Montana Supreme Court.\Deschamps said he was unsure whether renewables were priced fairly, but stressed that the Commission’s work “has to be strictly a business-oriented association.”\“I want to make sure that there’s an environment that’s transparent, stable and predictable...not ignore or try to change existing laws because of my personal beliefs.”\Edmunds, too, wants to bring an ethical eye to the commission.\“The Commissioners have to keep in mind that it's the consumer that we work for, we don't work for anyone else,” he said. “We don't work for NorthWestern Energy, we don't work for any of these entities that come before us, we work for the consumer.”\All of the current commissioners are Republicans, but they've done their share of infighting. In February, the Billings Gazette reported that Commissioner Randy Pinocci had obtained the emails of Commissioner Roger Koopman — a dissenting voice on the Commission — and posted them on a far-right political blog. Squabbling like this, Edmunds argued, doesn’t reflect well on the body. “The biggest thing I disagree with on the commission right now is all the fussing and fighting that they've been doing among each other publicly. I think that reflects badly on the commissioners, it reflects badly on the Republican Party.\“I think we ought to be able to handle our differences in a better way than what they've done,” Edmunds said.\Edmunds boasts both a degree in business administration and service on the Legislature’s Appropriations Committee. He’s also served on submarines with the Navy and worked in business — roles that he says have prepared him for the work of analyzing electric rates. “My experience for years now has made me the best candidate for this position,” he said.\All three candidates voiced some degree of support for net metering, enabling residents to generate their own electricity for use or sale back to the grid. In Edmunds’ view, it fits right into a free market.\“I think that we should encourage people to generate their own electricity,” he said. “If they're able to generate their own electricity...then NorthWestern Energy should buy and sell it on the open market, or sell it to some other consumer. That, to me, is capitalism at its finest.”"
71,"HELENA ? Lawmakers dropped the gavel on the 2011 session at the end of April, and now legislative staffers are busy with the work of putting the new laws on the books.\The 150 members of the 62nd Legislature collectively introduced a total of 1,075 bills during the session, not counting the 55 resolutions lawmakers adopted, which don't carry the weight of law.\Of those, 362 bills are on their way to becoming law. They've either been signed by Gov. Brian Schweitzer, or he let them become law without his signature.\Schweitzer outright vetoed another 79 bills, which shattered the record he set in 2007, when he vetoed 20 bills. Prior to Schweitzer's term as governor, Republican Gov. Stan Stephens held the veto record for a single legislative session, when he vetoed 19 bills in 1991. Schweitzer issued line-item vetoes on four spending bills.\Some of the approximately 30 percent of introduced bills that will be codified will noticeably effect Montanans as soon as they become law. And some high-profile bills, such as the overhaul of the state's medical marijuana act, will result in sweeping changes for thousands of Montanans.\Senate Bill 423 will essentially eliminate the state's profitable medical marijuana industry and replace it with a system that requires patients to grow their own marijuana or have a family member do it for them. Under the bill, growers can only give marijuana to patients free of charge on compassionate grounds, and providers can only supply up to three patients. Caregivers currently can have an unlimited number of patients.\Other bills got decidedly less attention this session, but nonetheless will have immediate impacts.\For instance, House Bill 621 will require boaters to go to greater lengths to ensure their vessels aren't transporting aquatic invasive species between waterways. That means starting July 1 boaters will not only have to pull weeds from their boats and trailers and clean the hull to prevent the spread of invasive species such as zebra mussels, but in some parts of the state agriculture and wildlife officials will conduct mandatory inspections of bilges, live wells and bait containers.\Other bills dealing with the way the state spends money will affect individuals and businesses in some ways, but their effects will go unnoticed by most.\Here's a rundown of the fate of some of the most-debated bills brought before the Montana House of Representatives this session, organized alphabetically by topic.\Abortion\HB167, Rep. Keith Regier, R-Kalispell\Criminalize offense involving death to an unborn child\Vetoed by the governor.\HB280, Rep. Pat Ingraham, R-Thompson Falls\Require ultrasound prior to an abortion\Dead; missed deadline for revenue bill transmittal.\HB490, Rep.

Democratic legislators came to Helena at the beginning of this legislative session and announced their commitment to create jobs, invest in education, and responsible government.
\
Democrats have introduced several jobcreating bills this legislative session that make sense for our state financially. Rep. Hollenbaugh from Helena is sponsoring the JOBS bill, House Bill 14, which I am proud to support. It will authorize nearly $90 million in construction projects on our college campuses. In Bozeman, these dollars would not only create a high-quality learning environment for the MSU students, but would also create high-paying construction jobs and those wages would be spent in our community. It's a good time for Montana to make this investment in our colleges -- our state has managed its money well the past eight years and we are able to borrow money at historically low interest rates.
\
A second major jobs bill is the proposed increased access to Medicaid. This proposal is good for Montana's economy in many ways. It creates good-paying jobs, helps small businesses, and reduces healthcare costs for everyone by bringing down the costs of uncompensated care which are passed on to all healthcare consumers.
\
Finally, I proposed a jobs bill that would have supported green energy jobs without any financial cost to the state. Senate Bill 247 would increase the cap for net metered projects from 50 kilowatts to 100 kilowatts. Net metering allows homeowners to install solar panels or small wind turbines that provide electricity to their homes, then get credit for the extra energy they send back to the grid. A growing industry has sprung up to meet the demand of homeowners who are interested in clean, Montana-made energy that saves money on their energy bills. Unfortunately, my bill was tabled in committee and never made it onto the Senate floor.
\
Adequately funding public education is a smart investment for Montana, and Montana has remained committed to that investment in both good times and bad. Despite identifying student achievement as a priority, only three out of 33 Republican priority bills focus on education. While these three bills received bipartisan support, not one of them is one of the three school funding bills introduced this session -- and one of those funding bills, Senate Bill 175, was introduced by a Republican. Democrats have made passing a responsible, adequate school funding bill a priority of their work this session.
\
Republicans, it would seem, would be interested in bills that support Montana businesses and create a highly educated workforce to attract new business, yet none of the major job-creating bills of the session made it to their priorities list. As a member of the Senate Taxation committee, I've seen a series of expensive Republican bills come before our committee that would give tax breaks to the largest corporations and wealthiest individuals. Now I agree that Montana should give some money back -- Gov. Bullock proposed a healthy $300 million ending fund balance and I think we can afford to give some money back to hardworking taxpayers. But I think tax relief should go first to hardworking Montana families, not those in our highest tax bracket or out-of-state corporations.
\
Republicans have lost sight of what's really important to Montanans this legislative session. Montanans expect us to pass a balanced budget and be responsible with key investments that will move our state forward. Republicans have gotten off-track by proposing bills that interfere with fish and wildlife management, make government more inefficient, and hand out big tax breaks to out-of-state corporations. I'm looking forward to the returning for the second half of the session, and I hope Republicans will join us in working together on legislation that makes a difference in the lives of Montanans.

73,"BOYD--Mike Kananen hadn't planned on breaking new ground. The Boyd man just wanted to slash his electricity bill.\Now in the midst of his cutting-edge project, he hasn't lost faith in his primary objective.\""We're learning as we go,"" he said. ""It's an education I didn't really want. But that's what happens when you are the first to do anything.""\Vertical-axis wind\Kananen may be the first in the area to install a vertical-axis wind turbine. He's been told he's the first in the nation to test the particular 10-kilowatt model he installed near his home. In fact, it's supposedly only the second in the world, the other having been erected in Canada.\The ""reluctant pioneer"" is sold on the theory of the vertical-axis wind turbine, or VAWT, design. What sets his apart from a standard wind turbine is the way its five air foil panels rotate around the main shaft. Each blade is shaped like an airplane wing, with push from the front and lift in the back.\Giant egg beater\Rising roughly 60 feet into the air, it resembles a giant egg beater.\Overall, VAWTS are typically smaller and considered less of an eyesore than their horizontal counterparts. They're also touted as being more efficient, particularly at low levels, and much quieter, if not silent.\""It's a hell of a design--really simple, nothing complicated at all,"" Kananen said. ""They're going to be the wave of the future.""\Unfortunately, Kananen's ""wave of the future"" has encountered a glitch. Erected in August, it's still not producing as advertised. Kananen has yet to determine the source of the problem, but he thinks it originates from one of three factors: the inverters, the generator or, less likely, his connection to Beartooth Electric Co-op.\He's sent the inverters back to be reprogrammed, and he expects he'll be sending the generator back for a replacement. Both are under warranty.\Rate increase\Kananen's quest for alternative power began last January when Beartooth raised rates and his power bill skyrocketed to $900.\Heat for the family's home was already supplied by a geothermal unit, but the Boyd family's electricity usage--between home, shop and agricultural operation--averages 3,500 kilowatts each month. That's more than double the typical residential requirement.\After researching options, he narrowed his focus on wind energy.\""Solar was too expensive, based on what I was trying to accomplish,"" he said.\At first, even wind turbines seemed out of the question. He couldn't find anything to meet his needs for less than $1 million. Then he stumbled onto the 10-kilowatt vertical axis model manufactured by Shanghai Aeolus Windpower Technology.\In March, he ordered the unit through Andy Richards, owner of the Cody, Wyo.-based Advanced Energy Technology and the local distributor for the SAWT turbines. By midsummer, all the pieces and parts had arrived.\Kananen and Richards poured the 4-foot-thick concrete pad, erected the pole and manipulated two cranes to hold the pole steady as they lifted the generator and turbine in place.\""Finding a nonwindy day to do it was tough,"" Kananen said.\All told, he figures he has $42,000 into the equipment and another $8,000 in the ""do-it-yourself"" installation. Between federal and state tax credits totaling 40 percent, he calculates his cost at about $30,000.\""My thinking is, if this thing works and it catches on, for the price of a car it'll produce more than my house uses,"" he said.\Despite the snafus, it's apparent that Richards of Cody is sold on the vertical axis design, although he also deals in traditional wind turbines. Working doggedly with Kananen to resolve the problem, Richards admits it's not been a moneymaker.\""It's like tuning an engine to get to its most productive {level),"" he said. ""It's a bit of a challenge, but, once we get it there, it'll be a hugely producing machine.""\Within a few days, depending on delivery and weather, Richards will install three 4-kilowatt vertical-axis units on a property in the Billings area. Unlike Kananen's five-panel unit, these wind turbines are a helix design that evolved from a 1920s helicopter prototype.\The helix design works on a shorter pole, which makes it more acceptable in areas zoned with height restrictions. The turbines are powered by three skewed blades that capture just about any breeze, he said.\Power credits\While Kananen continues tinkering on the turbine, he's also hoping for changes in Beartooth Co-op's net-metering policy.\Once he begins producing more electricity than he needs, he is eligible for credit at the end of each month. But, as policy stands now, he would lose any excess credit at the end of the year, credit he'd rather apply toward his electricity bill or donate to the Roberts School.\Kananen also speaks of another concern. He figures that without the do-it-yourself installation, the total cost could easily run in the $100,000 range. And to operate entirely off the grid would mean another $10,000 in batteries.\""The problem I see with this unit, the average guy just can't afford it,"" he said.\But, according to his calculations, it should ultimately pencil out for him.\When, or if, the turbine produces as advertised, it will take six to seven years for him to break even. Considering the turbine has a 20-year life, that's 13 years of electricity at no cost, he said. At this point, he'd like nothing better than to begin recouping that benefit.\""Note to self: Unless you're really into learning, never be the first guy to try something,"" he said, laughing.\Reports vary on 'new' design\The Internet abounds with information on vertical-axis wind turbines, including a brief video of a working VAWT in Iran that supposedly dates back to the 7th century AD.\The reports, however, aren't all favorable.\An article on Cleantechnica.com notes how VAWTs have made a splash in the world of wind energy, particularly for small applications. It also claims that they produce 50 percent more electricity per year than conventional turbines, that they can generate electricity at much lower wind speeds and that they will not harm bats and birds as standard turbines can.\But an article on Motherearthnews.com takes a more skeptical view. It disputes claims that VAWTS are less noisy and more efficient than their horizontal counterparts. The article also argues that turbulent wind at low levels--the environment at which proponents claim VAWTs enjoy an advantage--is just chaotic motion that translates not into energy but wear and tear on equipment.\The 2008 article does, however, offer one bit of good news. It speculates that ""in a year or two, we may see a commercial product that actually works for 20 years or so like it should."""
74,"Anyone considering going to the Jordan World Circus should know that this notorious outfit has been cited for a host of animal welfare violations.\Jordan World Circus and the animal exhibitors it features have repeatedly endangered the public, including when an elephant attacked her trainer while giving rides, allowing an elephant to escape and a bear to get loose, and failing to protect the public during photo-ops with bears.\There's no excuse for animal abuse and public endangerment, and numerous Shrine circuses are turning away from using wild animals in their shows. Indeed, Jordan World Circus put on a show without exotic animals just this past weekend in Missoula. It's past time for all of the circus's shows to feature only consenting human performers.\—Delcianna J. Winders, Animal Law & Policy Fellow, Harvard Law School\Cambridge, Mass.\It's no surprise that Gov. Bullock keeps the pathway open for Shariah law in Montana. Several Montana tribes are actively engaged, even contractually, with countries such as Turkey and Saudi Arabia. The Montana Governor would do nothing to disturb Middle Eastern collaborations with the Assiniboine-Sioux Tribes, the Crow and the Confederated Salish-Kootenai Tribes thus far.\A Wikileaks memorandum verified relationships with these Montana and other tribes on Nov. 11, 2011 even before Congress passed the Hearth Act of 2012 facilitating governmental relationships between American Indian tribes and Middle Eastern countries.\The CSKT tribe has been conducting leadership and student exchanges with Turkey for many years, and has had contractual relationships with Turkey and Saudi Arabia, at least since 2009.\Tribal governments may now long-term lease their private Indian ""trust"" lands to Middle Eastern countries, with no prior Bureau of Indian Affairs approval or continuous oversight. Governor Bullock will protect Shariah law so as not to disturb relations between Montana tribes and Middle Eastern countries. This should be a concern to all Montanans, most particularly, to tribal members themselves.\—Elaine Willman\Ronan\Senate Bill 7 would discriminate against people in Montana that have opted to use clean energy, by not allowing for subsidies. While the power companies allow subsidies for all other forms of electricity, they want to disallow these for net-metering customers.\Not only would this bill alienate customers who want to make the transfer to clean, renewable energy, it would alienate new businesses wanting to set up operations in Montana. Without incentives, and a lack of customers, this could drive many businesses away. I for one believe that our people have the right to work in a clean environment which renewable energy affords them.\In a time when we should be divesting from our dying fossil fuel industries, and investing in renewable which are the economic drivers of the future, do we really want to eliminate incentives to customers and viable businesses?\If you believe that you have the right to choose how you get your electricity, and that the power companies do not have the right to tell you what power options you can use, then I urge you to call or write to Governor Bullock before the end of this week, and urge him to veto this bill.\—Kelly Williamson\Missoula\I take it upon myself to research the claims made by candidates. The GOP candidate for our vacated House seat, Greg Gianforte, started with campaign ads before Zinke was even appointed to the Interior post! He couldn't buy the governor's seat, so now is attempting to buy a seat in Congress, with the help of his super PACs. Greg states that he was the recipient of endless ""lies and mudslinging."" However, as I recall, Greg was the one telling the lies and doing the mudslinging!\Another observation: Steve Daines has been taken to task for his failure to listen to a large number of his constituents who opposed his approval of unqualified Betsy DeVos. Not listening is an ongoing issue with Daines. Electing Greg Gianforte to be Montana's representative in the House will be to give another billionaire elitist a vote to go along with Daines' vote. Once these guys get in office, you can't get rid of them, due to the GOP dark money. Anyone out there really think Gianforte cares about ordinary working folks in Montana? These two are really out of touch with most non-wealthy Montanans.\Let's show them that they can't buy our votes, not now - not ever!\—Dora White\Great Falls\What is the American Dream? It is the opportunity to roll up your sleeves and go to work pursuing your dreams unencumbered by burdensome regulations and being on equal footing with the whole country. This is what draws immigrants. If we could vet those immigrating to Montana, what might we ask?\Perhaps the following: They must choose to live in Montana of their own volition, be law abiding, must subscribe to the American dream, and roll up their sleeves and work. In return we'd accept them as neighbors and fellow citizens. We would judge them as we judge ourselves, by content of character. If one of these immigrants dreamed big and became wealthy we would continue to judge them as we do ourselves, by content of character. A few years ago, a law-abiding New Jersey family chose to move and immigrate to Montana. They weren't millionaires, but they had a dream. As a result, Greg Gianforte became a Montana millionaire. Years ago, we accepted Greg and his family as neighbors and fellow Montanans. Though Greg is a self-made Montana millionaire we continue to judge him by the content of his character. We are fortunate to have a man of Greg's character choosing to represent Montana in D.C.\—TJ Smith\Billings\Two things stand out in the race for US representative to replace Zinke: public lands and health insurance.\It's interesting to watch commercials slamming Rob Quist saying he is unfit to be a representative due to financial problems dating back several years. His response: it stemmed from medical bills. My response is ""But for the grace of God so go I.""\All of us that call ourselves Montanans have donated to individuals experiencing overwhelming medical bills. With the introduction of the ACA, 78,000 additional Montanans obtained health insurance. Somehow I am lead to believe that Rob Quist will be a fighter to improve the ACA, not destroy it. Out of dozens of commercials paid for by out-of-state interests supporting Gianforte, I've not seen one that even mentions the ACA. Don't 78,000 Montanans count? The problems that Rob Quist experienced leads me to believe that he would make an effort to fix the problems associated with the ACA rather than pretend it's a program that doesn't work.\Gianforte ignores the fact that he sued to stop access to public lands while Rob Quist fights for greater access for all of us.\—David Torgerson\Whitehall\Bullying, they tell us, is a big problem in our schools. Let's take a look at one clear example of bullying in schools.\The NCAA forced (bullied) the University of North Dakota into changing their mascot from ""Fighting Sioux,"" the name requested by Sioux living in the area then, to something ""less offensive."" The bullying tactic used was threatening loss of opportunity for financial gain. They did this bullying to UND, but to date I haven't heard of any other coerced/forced name changes.\Now that the NCAA has taken on mascots, successfully, they have elevated their bullying to the point making law. Behold the state of North Carolina.\Having made a law that protects people from gender offense, the NCAA has, again by threatening loss of opportunity for financial gain, brought North Carolina to its knees. The state is opting to reverse their decision to protect their citizens from sexual offense so that the NCAA won't cause threatened financial loss.\So what will the NCAA say and whom will they support when at some college or university a male student feels his female side expressing herself and insists on being on a women's basketball or volleyball team?\Who, in the final consideration, is the bully?\—The Rev. Mark Nicolaus, Ph.D.\Sidney\In following our current congressional contest closely one must question: Is this Montana office for sale to the highest bidder?\Rob Quist's opponent and backers are once again spending millions trying to buy another Montana leadership post with clever corporate TV ads filled with falsity attempting to smear Mr. Quist. Gianforte boasts he cannot be bought because of his personal wealth.\For more than 40 years I have observed the way Rob Quist treats his family, friends and neighbors — always with courage, honesty, dignity and respect. Despite family health setbacks, Mr. Quist, in the tradition of a true Montanan (and Harry S. Truman), refused to declare bankruptcy and continued to pay his creditors. How many of us would choose the same course? It only deepens my faith in his courage and integrity. Actions speak louder than words.\Rob Quist will fight for Montana. Together let's send this good man to Washington.\—Richard Syverson\Bigfork\After 30 years in public service management, I have a broad perspective regarding government. We always hear that government is a big business and it should be run accordingly.\Greg Gianforte has an extremely successful business career. He is an advocate for the changes we need to see in the federal architecture. Greg wants to ""drain the swamp"" in D.C. by changing the architectural landscape and ensure Montana's voice is heard.\Greg will strive for accountability in Congress and bring tough issues to the table. He believes a balanced budget is paramount. He's not afraid to address term limits and fight to make sure members of Congress do not become lobbyists. Greg will fight for senior citizen rights to Social Security and Medicare, prioritize veterans' issues, and develop real health care solutions that work.\Montana's economy is a critical issue. Over regulation has stifled our economy. Greg wants to see more success and greater prosperity. He wants to capitalize on coal and timber industries. And, Greg's committed to reaching out to Montanans and stakeholders to develop collaborative solutions on the issues we face.\Greg has a strong business acumen, has Montana's interests at heart, and he is running for the right reasons. Greg Gianforte deserves our vote.\—Dan McGowan\Helena\Let's hear what new Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch thinks about the coup Mitch McConnell and a few Senate Republicans pulled off, holding the Supreme Court hostage for 10 months so that President Obama could not fill Antonin Scalia's vacant seat. Instead of a moderate jurist, Donald Trump and the anti-abortion wing of the Republican Party has stuck America with a lifetime office holder, anti-abortionist Neil Gorsuch. From the start, Mitch and his Republican roadies had only one thing in mind: steal the presidential election and insert a Republican as president who would select another anti-abortionist for the Roberts Supreme Court. Donald Trump came through.\—Ron Lowe\Nevada City, Calif.\I believe the quickest way to fix health care is to put Congress under the same plan all Americans are under. Congress votes their own health care, salaries and days off. They are only employees of the taxpayers. How many employees do you know that can dictate all of that to the employer? Not even with the most aggressive union in America!\Insurance companies are built on premiums collected, not on benefits paid. The industry hires actuaries to determine risk of having to pay benefits and design packages of coverage based on that information. Major considerations for risk are: old age, pregnancy, and pre-existing conditions. After more than 20 years in the business, I can tell you that including this in all coverage is going to drive increased premiums.\I believe the current ""I don't care"" was designed to put Americans under single-payer option and that was government health care.\The government is very good at being involved in everything except what they are supposed to be doing. Being covered under health care that pays limited benefits is like owning a car with no motor. The car looks good in the driveway, but it isn't going to take you very far.\—Britt Davis\Sand Coulee\Back in the early 90s I was a student at North Middle School. I remember using my first computer ever and it was a big deal. Computers were not common and no one dreamed of ""personal"" computers. Those computers where monstrous, the monitors' type was green and white, and the commands rudimentary. It was a big deal to have access to a computer.\Now, fast forward 20 plus years, computers are fixtures in our everyday lives. We use computers at the grocery store, the bank, and in our jobs, whether it is coding in a medical setting or ordering office supplies.\Many of us have hand held computers that slip into our front pockets. We must admit we live in technology driven world that is continually evolving on a monthly to yearly basis; computers from the early 2000s no longer cut it in our everyday lives. Understanding computers and technology is an absolute life skill that, we, as a community, need to provide to our students to provide successful futures.\The upcoming GFPS ""Technology Levy"" will ensure our students' education will be enhanced with up-to-date, current advances in technology while preparing them to live in a technology world.\—Katie Bailey\Great Falls"

However, as I recall, Greg was the one telling the lies and doing the mudslinging!\Another observation: Steve Daines has been taken to task for his failure to listen to a large number of his constituents who opposed his approval of unqualified Betsy DeVos. Not listening is an ongoing issue with Daines. Electing Greg Gianforte to be Montana's representative in the House will be to give another billionaire elitist a vote to go along with Daines' vote. Once these guys get in office, you can't get rid of them, due to the GOP dark money. Anyone out there really think Gianforte cares about ordinary working folks in Montana? These two are really out of touch with most non-wealthy Montanans.\Let's show them that they can't buy our votes, not now - not ever!\--Dora White\Great Falls\Fortunate to have Gianforte\What is the American Dream? It is the opportunity to roll up your sleeves and go to work pursuing your dreams unencumbered by burdensome regulations and being on equal footing with the whole country. This is what draws immigrants. If we could vet those immigrating to Montana, what might we ask?\Perhaps the following: They must choose to live in Montana of their own volition, be law abiding, must subscribe to the American dream, and roll up their sleeves and work. In return we'd accept them as neighbors and fellow citizens. We would judge them as we judge ourselves, by content of character. If one of these immigrants dreamed big and became wealthy we would continue to judge them as we do ourselves, by content of character. A few years ago, a law-abiding New Jersey family chose to move and immigrate to Montana. They weren't millionaires, but they had a dream. As a result, Greg Gianforte became a Montana millionaire. Years ago, we accepted Greg and his family as neighbors and fellow Montanans. Though Greg is a self-made Montana millionaire we continue to judge him by the content of his character. We are fortunate to have a man of Greg's character choosing to represent Montana in D.C.\--TJ Smith\Billings\Quist would fix health care\Two things stand out in the race for US representative to replace Zinke: public lands and health insurance.\It's interesting to watch commercials slamming Rob Quist saying he is unfit to be a representative due to financial problems dating back several years. His response: it stemmed from medical bills. My response is ""But for the grace of God so go I.""\All of us that call ourselves Montanans have donated to individuals experiencing overwhelming medical bills. With the introduction of the ACA, 78,000 additional Montanans obtained health insurance. Somehow I am lead to believe that Rob Quist will be a fighter to improve the ACA, not destroy it. Out of dozens of commercials paid for by out-of-state interests supporting Gianforte, I've not seen one that even mentions the ACA. Don't 78,000 Montanans count? The problems that Rob Quist experienced leads me to believe that he would make an effort to fix the problems associated with the ACA rather than pretend it's a program that doesn't work.\Gianforte ignores the fact that he sued to stop access to public lands while Rob Quist fights for greater access for all of us.\--David Torgerson\Whitehall\Bullying in schools and the NCAA\Bullying, they tell us, is a big problem in our schools. Let's take a look at one clear example of bullying in schools.\The NCAA forced (bullied) the University of North Dakota into changing their mascot from ""Fighting Sioux,"" the name requested by Sioux living in the area then, to something ""less offensive."" The bullying tactic used was threatening loss of opportunity for financial gain. They did this bullying to UND, but to date I haven't heard of any other coerced/forced name changes.\Now that the NCAA has taken on mascots, successfully, they have elevated their bullying to the point making law. Behold the state of North Carolina.\Having made a law that protects people from gender offense, the NCAA has, again by threatening loss of opportunity for financial gain, brought North Carolina to its knees. The state is opting to reverse their decision to protect their citizens from sexual offense so that the NCAA won't cause threatened financial loss.\So what will the NCAA say and whom will they support when at some college or university a male student feels his female side expressing herself and insists on being on a women's basketball or volleyball team?\Who, in the final consideration, is the bully?\--The Rev. Mark Nicolaus, Ph.D.\Sidney\Actions speak louder than words\In following our current congressional contest closely one must question: Is this Montana office for sale to the highest bidder?\Rob Quist's opponent and backers are once again spending millions trying to buy another Montana leadership post with clever corporate TV ads filled with falsity attempting to smear Mr. Quist. Gianforte boasts he cannot be bought because of his personal wealth.\For more than 40 years I have observed the way Rob Quist treats his family, friends and neighbors -- always with courage, honesty, dignity and respect. Despite family health setbacks, Mr. Quist, in the tradition of a true Montanan (and Harry S. Truman), refused to declare bankruptcy and continued to pay his creditors. How many of us would choose the same course? It only deepens my faith in his courage and integrity. Actions speak louder than words.\Rob Quist will fight for Montana. Together let's send this good man to Washington.\--Richard Syverson\Bigfork\Gianforte deserves our vote\After 30 years in public service management, I have a broad perspective regarding government. We always hear that government is a big business and it should be run accordingly.\Greg Gianforte has an extremely successful business career. He is an advocate for the changes we need to see in the federal architecture. Greg wants to ""drain the swamp"" in D.C. by changing the architectural landscape and ensure Montana's voice is heard.\Greg will strive for accountability in Congress and bring tough issues to the table. He believes a balanced budget is paramount. He's not afraid to address term limits and fight to make sure members of Congress do not become lobbyists. Greg will fight for senior citizen rights to Social Security and Medicare, prioritize veterans' issues, and develop real health care solutions that work.\Montana's economy is a critical issue. Over regulation has stifled our economy. Greg wants to see more success and greater prosperity. He wants to capitalize on coal and timber industries. And, Greg's committed to reaching out to Montanans and stakeholders to develop collaborative solutions on the issues we face.\Greg has a strong business acumen, has Montana's interests at heart, and he is running for the right reasons. Greg Gianforte deserves our vote.\--Dan McGowan\Helena\What would Gorsuch think?\Let's hear what new Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch thinks about the coup Mitch McConnell and a few Senate Republicans pulled off, holding the Supreme Court hostage for 10 months so that President Obama could not fill Antonin Scalia's vacant seat. Instead of a moderate jurist, Donald Trump and the anti-abortion wing of the Republican Party has stuck America with a lifetime office holder, anti-abortionist Neil Gorsuch. From the start, Mitch and his Republican roadies had only one thing in mind: steal the presidential election and insert a Republican as president who would select another anti-abortionist for the Roberts Supreme Court. Donald Trump came through.\--Ron Lowe\Nevada City, Calif.\Thoughts regarding health care\I believe the quickest way to fix health care is to put Congress under the same plan all Americans are under. Congress votes their own health care, salaries and days off. They are only employees of the taxpayers. How many employees do you know that can dictate all of that to the employer? Not even with the most aggressive union in America!\Insurance companies are built on premiums collected, not on benefits paid. The industry hires actuaries to determine risk of having to pay benefits and design packages of coverage based on that information. Major considerations for risk are: old age, pregnancy, and pre-existing conditions. After more than 20 years in the business, I can tell you that including this in all coverage is going to drive increased premiums.\I believe the current ""I don't care"" was designed to put Americans under single-payer option and that was government health care.\The government is very good at being involved in everything except what they are supposed to be doing. Being covered under health care that pays limited benefits is like owning a car with no motor. The car looks good in the driveway, but it isn't going to take you very far.\--Britt Davis\Sand Coulee\Supports technology levy\Back in the early 90s I was a student at North Middle School. I remember using my first computer ever and it was a big deal. Computers were not common and no one dreamed of ""personal"" computers. Those computers where monstrous, the monitors' type was green and white, and the commands rudimentary. It was a big deal to have access to a computer.\Now, fast forward 20 plus years, computers are fixtures in our everyday lives. We use computers at the grocery store, the bank, and in our jobs, whether it is coding in a medical setting or ordering office supplies.\Many of us have hand held computers that slip into our front pockets. We must admit we live in technology driven world that is continually evolving on a monthly to yearly basis; computers from the early 2000s no longer cut it in our everyday lives. Understanding computers and technology is an absolute life skill that, we, as a community, need to provide to our students to provide successful futures.\The upcoming GFPS ""Technology Levy"" will ensure our students' education will be enhanced with up-to-date, current advances in technology while preparing them to live in a technology world.\--Katie Bailey\Great Falls"
76,"Montana should keep requiring utilities to procure 15 percent of their power from renewable sources such as wind by 2015 -- no more or no less -- members of an interim committee of the Legislature decided Monday.\""We believe our standard of 15 and 15 is a good number,"" said Sen. Cliff Larson, D-Missoula, chairman of the Energy and Telecommunications Interim Committee.\The committee, made up of four Democrats and four Republicans, voted 8-0 at a meeting in Helena to give final approval to a study of the effectiveness of the Renewable Portfolio Standard completed with the help of the Legislature Services Division.\The standard requires public utilities to obtain 15 percent of their retail customer sales from renewable resources by 2015, and it should remain unchanged, according to a recommendation in the report that Sen. Ed Buttrey, a Republican committee member from Great Falls, called the most significant in the study.\""As a Legislature, as we make data-driven decisions, I think it will have a large impact on the Legislature,"" Buttrey said of the committee's decision approving the report and the decision affirming the current renewable standard.\The study, Buttrey added, will provide solid data for keeping the current standard to those who supported increasing the standard, and those who supported a decrease.\""I think it will go a long way to the standard remaining as-is in the next session,"" he said.\In a state where extraction of coal and other carbon-based products is a large part of the economy, it's notable that Montana achieved the 15-renewable percent standard in 2013, Larson said.\""We've struck a balance that I think takes a lot of sting out of the arguments that we had in the beginning, that this was an unknown standard,"" Larson said. ""We beat the deadline, and met the standard two years early.""\The 2013 Montana Legislature asked the interim committee to analyze the Montana Renewable Power Production and Rural Economic Development Act, focusing on the economic impacts of the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS), the environmental impacts of the standard and the impacts the RPS has had on Montana consumers. The act was passed in 2005.\At the time, proponents of the legislation argued that additional renewable resources were needed to diversify electricity supply, reduce greenhouse gases and other air emissions to improve public health, and to support jobs- and revenue-creating local renewable projects, according to committee's study. The first compliance requirement, 5 percent, began in 2008.\The study found that the renewable energy standard has contributed to new electric generation in Montana and has had a positive economic impact on rural communities during construction and beyond. Property taxes have increased in those communities where development has occurred, it says.\For example, the 90-turbine Judith Gap wind farm pays about $1.5 million to Wheatland County in yearly property taxes and more than $400,000 in annual lease payments to landowners, the report says.\The renewable portfolio standard, while beneficial, has not led to the replacement of existing power generation facilities, the study found.\Kyla Maki, clean energy director at the Montana Environmental Information Center, was pleased with the vote.\""We're happy they recognized the economic benefit of renewable energy,"" Maki said.\Maki added that committee members missed an opportunity to recommend an increase in the requirement beyond 15 percent, especially considering the economic benefits noted in the report and another finding that the standards have had a negligible impact on ratepayers.\""Based on that, it's puzzling they didn't then proceed to say more of a good thing is a great thing,"" Maki said.\Sen. Alan Olson, R-Roundup, said the wind industry has grown on its own and saw no reason to decrease or increase the standard.\""On the flip side of that, if the federal government continues to clamp down on coal and coal-fire generation, there won't be any other opportunity but to go to wind generation,"" Olson said. ""The federal government is going to pick who the winners are and who the losers are.""\There was disagreement on the committee about the renewable energy standard's contribution to air quality, according to the study.\Some members felt strongly that renewable energy projects offset the use of fossil-fuel based energy and contribute to cleaner air. But others argued that the review of air quality impacts was inconclusive or negligible.\Committee members also couldn't agree on another issue involving energy and the environment.\Olson recommended that the committee write a letter to the EPA explaining how the agency's proposed rule requiring emissions reductions from electricity generating plants would affect ratepayers, jobs and government revenue in Montana. EPA's clean power plan would require a 21 percent reduction in emissions by 2030.\""Where the EPA is looking at curtailing coal use by one-third across the country, that's going to have a tremendous impact on Montana as well,"" Olson said.\The proposal failed on a 4-4 party-line vote, with Republicans supporting the letter and Democrats voting no.\""I think the Democrats believed we didn't need to respond to a preliminary comment period, and the Republicans thought we did,"" Larson said.\Reach Tribune Staff Writer Karl Puckett at 406-791-1471, 800-438-6600 or kpuckett@greatfallstribune.com.

77,"
Montana's promising future as a producer of renewable energy remains bright, thanks in part to Gov. Steve Bullock and his success in defending energy standards and development policies that put people to work while improving our energy supply.
\
The recently concluded 2013 legislative session saw a flurry of bills dealing with -- and sometimes attacking -- renewable energy development. The governor vetoed three misguided measures that could have stifled new, renewable energy development. He also signed two helpful bills into law -- one that he greatly improved and with amendments he wanted.
\
The net effect is that Montana remains fertile ground for new energy development that diversifies our energy supply and brings good jobs and sustainable economic activity to rural areas.
\
Montana's Legislature in 2005 passed a law requiring large utilities to obtain 15 percent of the power they sell in the state from renewable sources by 2015. Twentyeight other U.S. states have adopted similar laws, often called ""Renewable Energy Standards"" or RES, and these standards have helped bring our power supply into the 21st century.
\
One of the bills Gov. Bullock just vetoed -- Senate Bill 31 -- would have watered down Montana's RES by declaring future large-scale hydroelectric plants possibly located in Canada as eligible to meet our Montana standard. Former Gov. Brian Schweitzer vetoed a bill nearly identical to SB 31 two years ago.
\
Legislators also tried undermining a complex but successful program that encourages development of small-scale renewable energy projects, often in rural communities. Gov. Bullock vetoed that measure -- House Bill 188 -- noting that the issue is better handled by the state Public Service Commission.
\
Some lawmakers attempted to weaken a 2005 law that requires utilities to obtain a portion of the renewable energy they sell from small, community-owned projects. The governor expressed a desire to find a compromise, but SB 125 arrived on his desk after the Legislature adjourned, so he vetoed the measure. His action will allow at least one new 25-megawatt community project to move forward in rural Montana.
\
The Legislature and governor found common ground on some renewableenergy bills. They enacted SB 45, revising the RES to include power from incremental upgrades at hydroelectric dams. Initially written to apply retroactively to past dam improvements -- contrary to the spirit of Montana's RES and the goal of adding new renewable-energy resources -- legislators reworked the bill at the governor's insistence to apply it only to new projects.
\
So, after a long, sometimes grueling session, Montana's renewable-energy policies remain much as they were -- supportive of new development. And there's good reason to hope they will stay that way. That's because lawmakers also approved a resolution calling for a study of the impacts of Montana's Renewable Energy Standard.
\
Renewable-energy advocates embraced the study, seeing it as an opportunity to provide the next Legislature with hard facts to replace the ideological opinions too often injected into debate over energy policy. A balanced examination of the RES and its broad benefits is likely to confirm that it's good energy policy and smart economic-development policy.
\
Indeed, Montana's RES already has helped support some $1.6 billion in new investment, diversifying our power supply with 650 new megawatts of renewable generating capacity. The RPS has supported 1,500 high-paying construction jobs and more than 100 good, permanent jobs in rural communities. And the leastexpensive sources of long-term power for NorthWestern Energy customers today comes from wind turbines.
\
The pace of additional renewableenergy development in the years ahead is tough to predict. Much depends on the economy, market conditions and improvements to transmission lines. But our democratic process has once again affirmed Montana's welcoming environment for renewable energy.
\
Renewable energy is working for Montana, and our state is poised to make the most of new opportunities under Gov. Bullock's leadership.
