0,"When the dust settles from the end-of-the-session bill-passing frenzy, environmental groups said yesterday, they believe that the legislature's action on some issues - and inaction on others - will mean mixed results for the state's environment.\Sailing through the legislature were an energy bill hailed as a landmark for requiring utilities to buy some of their electricity from alternative-energy sources and a controversial measure to provide funding to rebuild and repair aging sewer and water systems.\But Gov. Rendell's proposed Growing Greener II program was not acted on. The $800 million program was designed to provide dedicated funding for hazardous-waste cleanup and watershed improvements and expand open space and farmland protection.\The bill failed to move because Republicans and industry groups remain staunchly opposed to Rendell's plan to fund the program by imposing fees on polluters and increasing landfill fees.\But Kathleen McGinty, secretary of the Department of Environmental Protection, said in an interview yesterday that failure to approve the funding would have an impact on public health.\With funds rapidly dwindling, she said, her agency has already been forced to scale back its effort to clean up dozens of polluted sites, including wells in East Norriton Township in Montgomery County contaminated with a chemical used in dry cleaning.\The renewable energy bill, which caused a rare division among the state's leading environmental groups, would require that utilities buy 18 percent of their electricity from environmentally friendly sources within 15 years.\Under the bill, the state will have eight times more so-called ""green"" energy - most of it wind power - than it does now, said John Hanger, president of the environmental group PennFuture.\Almost half of that amount would come from wind turbines, solar panels and methane gas emitted by decomposing trash in landfills. The rest would come from a second ""tier"" that includes garbage incinerators, ""waste"" coal and energy efficiency.\Supporters, including Rendell - who said he would sign the bill - believe the green energy would not cost consumers any more than traditional sources and would be a plus for the state's economy and the environment.\Philadelphia-based Peco Energy Co. was among the supporters, after its analysis showed that the bill would not raise rates for customers at least through 2010, spokesman Michael Wood said.\The state already comes close to meeting the target for the second-tier sources - most of it from waste coal, said John Hanger, a former member of the Public Utility Commission.\The bill sparked a rare schism among the environmental movement. Hanger praised it as ""revolutionary,"" while several groups decried the inclusion of incinerators and waste coal.\""These are just inherently dirty resources and they shouldn't be included in an alternative energy standard,"" said Nathan Willcox, an energy advocate at the group PennEnvironment.\Waste coal is the term for coal that is not pure enough to be burned in typical power plants. As of December 2003, at least 258 million tons of waste coal sat in unsightly piles across the state, threatening water quality, according to the Department of Environmental Protection.\Environmentalists also are concerned about the effects of a bill authorizing the spending of $250 million for sewer and water projects, which was approved by voters last May. They say amendments added to the authorization bill will encourage sprawl, rather than prevent it as originally intended.\""The conditions for eligibility for funding have changed, and the language directing money toward fixing what's broken has been removed,"" said Robin Mann, water chairwoman for the Sierra Club, Pennsylvania Chapter.\But McGinty said she was confident the money would go toward its intended purpose: to rebuild and repair aging infrastructure in cities, towns and boroughs.\Meanwhile, Republican leaders yesterday said the legislature would not take up Growing Greener II until the General Assembly returned to work in January.\Rendell, seeking to compel lawmakers back to work this week because their session does not officially end until Nov. 30, has accused the Republican leadership of breaking its promise to advance the Growing Greener II initiative before the end of the session.\But Republicans say there was no such agreement.\Contact staff writer Amy Worden at 717-783-2584 or aworden@phillynews.com.\ \Credit: By Amy Worden and Tom Avril INQUIRER STAFF WRITERS"
1,"Two important and interrelated events occurred recently that mean bad news for tens of thousands of Pennsylvania workers and families.\On Oct. 15, the federal government announced that Pennsylvania had lost another 10,300 jobs in September, pushing the state's unemployment rate to 8.8 percent. Our state has lost nearly 200,000 jobs since September 2008.\The last time Pennsylvania saw unemployment this high was 1984. And there doesn't seem to be a sign of relief on the horizon. Economists are predicting more job losses to come, with the national unemployment rate climbing over 10 percent.\Given these numbers, the last thing Washington politicians should do is introduce legislation that would cost thousands more jobs. But that is exactly what the U.S. Senate did two weeks ago.\With Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's blessing, California Sen. Barbara Boxer and Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry introduced a 923-page draft of legislation to set up a so-called cap-and-trade program. The program would impose an onerous indirect tax on the production and consumption of carbon-based energy. It would cap the amount of carbon dioxide businesses could emit, imposing a penalty when they exceed the cap, and would require that carbon emissions be cut by 20 percent of 2005 levels by 2020.\Independent studies have found that this would cost the country millions of jobs, but in an industrial state like Pennsylvania, the cap-and-trade tax would be even more harmful than elsewhere. Our state's coal, natural gas and manufacturing industries would be especially hard hit.\Pennsylvania is the fourth-largest coal-producing state in the country and coal plays a major part in the commonwealth's economy and electricity production. Coal accounts for more than half of all electricity produced in Pennsylvania. According to a National Association of Manufacturers' study, coal production would fall by about 85 percent and electricity production by about 21 percent as a result of a similar cap-and-trade bill passed in the House.\Pennsylvania is also home to the Marcellus Shale, one of the largest unconventional natural gas reserves in the world. It has the potential to turn our state into a major producer of clean energy and create thousands of jobs. But the new energy tax could doom this budding industry before it has a chance to develop.\The manufacturers' study finds the House cap-and trade bill would cost Pennsylvania more than 70,000 jobs in the years ahead. But that's not all. In just six years, it would increase gasoline prices by 6 percent to 8 percent, oil prices by 6 percent to 12 percent and natural gas prices by 14 percent to 21 percent.\Over time, this surge would accelerate. President Barack Obama admitted as much in a March interview, saying, ""Under my plan ... electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket."" The increased electricity and gas prices alone would be especially difficult on low-income Pennsylvania families who spend a larger portion of their income on energy.\As the cost of energy increases, Pennsylvania's energy-intensive manufacturing industry would slow significantly. The manufacturers' association predicts Pennsylvania manufacturing would experience decreases in output ranging between 4.9 percent and 5.5 percent, with high-energy industries suffering output losses as high as 9.2 percent. That can only mean one thing: lots more jobs lost in Pennsylvania.\The cap-and-trade proposal is so harmful to Pennsylvania it has garnered bipartisan opposition across the state. When a version of the bill passed the House of Representatives last June, one third of Pennsylvania Democratic congressmen joined all Pennsylvania Republicans in voting against it. In all, 44 House Democrats across the country opposed the bill in a truly bipartisan effort to stop this massive job-killer.\Sadly, that bipartisan group does not include Pennsylvania Rep. Joe Sestak, against whom I am running for the U.S. Senate, who voted for the bill and even expressed regret that it did not go far enough.\We can and must support commonsense policies that protect our environment, but that goal can be achieved without abandoning 70,000 or more Pennsylvania jobs and imposing higher gas and electricity prices on all Pennsylvanians. A focus on renewable energy, conservation, low-carbon energy like natural gas, nuclear energy and cleaner-coal technology are all part of the solution. But as unemployment climbs toward 10 percent, protecting our hard-working families must be our first priority."
2,"HARRISBURG - Gov. Tom Wolf plans to join a coalition of states to set a mandatory, shrinking cap on the amount of carbon dioxide that can be released from Pennsylvania's fossil fuel power plants.\Mr. Wolf issued an executive order Thursday directing the state Department of Environmental Protection to draft regulations to join the nine-state Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a carbon cap-and-trade program with a shared market that has netted its member states $3.2 billion since it took effect in 2009.\Owners of carbon-emitting power plants would pay hundreds of millions of dollars a year at current prices that Pennsylvania could direct toward energy efficiency, renewable energy and other projects designed to reduce the release of climate-warming gases.\The move would hasten Pennsylvania's shift away from dirtier fuels like coal and vastly expand the scope of the nation's first mandatory market-based carbon-cutting initiative.\Pennsylvania has the fifth-highest power sector carbon emissions in the country, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Power plants in the Keystone State emit more greenhouse gases than those in all of the initiative's current member states combined.\""We are in a climate crisis,"" Mr. Wolf said at a news conference, where he referred to hundreds of millions of dollars in property damage caused by record rains in Pennsylvania in 2018. ""Someone has to pay to fix the destroyed houses, roads and bridges and that's going to be all of us.""\""While setting goals and targets is absolutely important we cannot delay any longer in taking action.""\Mr. Wolf, a Democrat, had sought authorization from the Republican-controlled Legislature to start the process of joining the initiative during budget negotiations this spring but did not reach an agreement in time for the final spending deal.\Now, administration officials say Mr. Wolf has the authority under the state's existing air pollution law to join the program without the Legislature's approval, although they say the go-it-alone approach would limit the uses of the funds to state programs designed to curb air pollution.\Some Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative states have used proceeds from their carbon auctions for broader initiatives, like directly reducing consumer energy bills or making transfers to state general funds.\Mr. Wolf said he intends to work with the General Assembly and other stakeholders to help design the program and decide how to spend its revenues.\""We know that this cannot be done in a vacuum,"" he said.\Legislative pushback\Several state lawmakers are trying to block the Wolf administration's approach. Bills being drafted in the House and Senate would prohibit the governor from joining Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative or otherwise establishing a carbon price without the Legislature's approval.\House Republican leaders vowed on Thursday to use ""the fullest extent of our legislative power"" to demonstrate that the governor does not have the power to enlist Pennsylvania in a binding, multi-state agreement without the General Assembly's support.\""Our state is not an autocracy,"" they said in a statement, ""and one-sided decisions as significant as this leave out the important voices of Pennsylvania workers, communities and families whose livelihood is built upon important sectors of our energy economy.""\Senate Republican leaders named four factors that must be included in any carbon-cutting plan, including maintaining the diversity of Pennsylvania's energy portfolio - which is currently dominated by gas, coal and nuclear - and requiring that RGGI's other member states ""utilize all aspects"" of that portfolio.\They also called for keeping energy prices affordable and implementing the plan in ""an appropriate legal manner.""\The debate over a carbon price is not neatly partisan in Pennsylvania.\Some Republicans who want to preserve the state's existing fleet of nuclear plants support the idea because it would benefit electricity sources, like nuclear and solar, that don't have smokestack emissions of greenhouse gases. Some Democrats from areas that mine or burn coal oppose it out of concern that it may force power plants and mines to shut down.\Mr. Wolf may face a legal challenge either way.\A group of environmental, citizens and faith groups petitioned the state's environmental rule-making board last year to adopt an economy-wide carbon cap-and-trade program that would be much more sweeping than participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. One of the lead attorneys on the petition said Tuesday that he will sue the commonwealth if regulators reject the petition without offering a viable alternative.\How it works\The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative currently includes Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont. New Jersey is rejoining the coalition in January after leaving in 2012 and Virginia may begin participating in 2021.\Each member state designs its own carbon budget and trading program - either through law or regulation - based on the coalition's model rule, but they agree to share broad goals and market infrastructure, Franz Litz, a consultant on cap-and-trade programs, told the state's climate change advisory committee on Tuesday.\Coal-, gas- and oil-fired power plants with a capacity of 25 megawatts or more must buy a credit for every ton of carbon they emit. The price for each carbon credit - or ""allowance"" - sold at the most recent auction in September was $5.20.\The regional emissions cap will shrink by about 3% a year from 2021 to 2030.\Mr. Wolf's executive order says Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative states have collectively reduced their power sector carbon emissions by over 45% since 2005.\Pennsylvania's power sector had a 28% reduction over the same time period, largely because lower-emitting natural gas plants are displacing coal plants in the competitive power market while improved energy efficiency has kept demand relatively flat.\'Modest program'\Members of the climate advisory committee questioned how much of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative states' reductions could be attributed to the cap-and-trade program.\Mr. Litz said an important feature of the program is that it ensures emissions keep declining.\""It's a fairly modest program that has managed to lock in reductions - whatever their cause,"" he said. ""It would seem to be a tool that could get a state, or a group of states, to where the electricity sector needs to be by mid-century.""\The United Nation's climate science coalition reported last year that global greenhouse gas emissions need to be cut to net zero by 2050 in order to avoid devastating increases in global temperatures.\Mr. Wolf's executive order is the beginning of a process that he estimated will take two years to complete. He directed DEP to present a draft rule to the state Environmental Quality Board by July 31, 2020.\He said the process of crafting the rule should include ""a robust public outreach effort"" to ensure that it ""results in reduced emissions, economic gains and consumer savings.""\Environmental groups praised the governor for what they called the most significant step Pennsylvania has ever taken to cut carbon pollution.\Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto said that by moving to join the initiative, Mr. Wolf ""is helping to further innovation, create green jobs and respond strongly to the challenge of climate change.""\Business and energy interests indicated they want to see how the process unfolds.\Pennsylvania Chamber of Business and Industry CEO Gene Barr said his association supports market-based approaches to achieving environmental goals, but it also encourages legislative input in the process of developing greenhouse gas rules and an analysis of its impact on ratepayers.\A significant part of the review process will involve modeling the environmental and economic impacts of different policy paths, like what sources will be included in Pennsylvania's carbon budget.\Some states, for example, have exempted particular types of generators from their budgets. Power plants that burn waste coal piles in Pennsylvania are likely to seek such an exemption.\Regulators must also work with the existing Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative states, which will assess whether Pennsylvania's proposal is stringent enough, among other factors, before agreeing to accept a new partner.\CAPTION: \CREDIT: By Laura Legere, Harrisburg Bureau"
3,"The following CORRECTION/CLARIFICATION appeared on April 30, 2009.The April 27 letter ""Cap-and-Trade Is a Good Place for Us to Start"" should have said Pennsylvania's population is less than one-fifth of 1 percent of the world's population. The letter used an incorrect figure** This story has been modified to correct Pennsylvania's population. **.\Regarding ""Forget 'Cap and Trade' "" (April 15 Perspectives), we are simply running out of time to ""continue the climate-change discussion."" With signs of global warming at our doorstep -- severe weather and flooding, unhealthy air days and heat-related deaths, threats to Pennsylvania's agriculture and economy -- our state's environment and economy cannot afford anything less than immediate action. \Our reliance on fossil fuels like coal and oil contributes to global warming emissions more than anything else. Pennsylvania produces 1 percent of the entire world's global warming pollution, though our population is less than 1/5 of 1 percent of the world's population. Studies tell us that left unchecked, global warming will result in Pennsylvania's climate resembling that of present-day Alabama and Georgia. \A federal cap-and-trade program is a viable means to cutting down on these emissions. It employs the ""polluter pays"" principle, holding that the polluters should pay the costs imposed by their pollution on others. It would create a source of revenue we can apply to other smart emission-reduction programs, like making our homes, businesses and vehicles vastly more efficient and moving to clean, renewable energy. \Not only is cap-and-trade a promising approach, it is also the approach on the table. President Obama has called for Congress to pass comprehensive energy and global warming legislation this year, part of which is cap-and-trade. A crucial vote is expected within weeks. \Cap-and-trade may not be a global warming panacea, but it, coupled with other smart energy policies, is a very good start. And we cannot afford to rule out any option any longer."
4,"Robert L. Wichterman, Special to the Sunday News\What would the economic ramifications be if President Obama's ""cap and trade"" legislation were to become the law of the land?\Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., attended the Copenhagen, Denmark, global warming conference, and reported on it to the Senate's Environment and Public Works Committee. This meeting was a follow-up to the 1997 Kyoto, Japan, meeting, where goals were set for nations to reduce their carbon dioxide emissions.\However, China, India and other smaller ""developing nations"" would not commit to any binding emission cuts. In addition, China is also opposed to the mandatory verification rule.\(Inspectors would be checking to certify that they were reducing emissions, as per their agreement.) A spokesman for China's foreign ministry remarked, ""It is not possible to accept a binding or compulsory target.""\India's environment minister was equally blunt. ""India will not accept any emission reduction target - period. This is a non-negotiable stand.""\When the Kyoto Treaty was completed in July 1997, the Senate told President Clinton not to submit it to them for approval. In 2003, the Byrd-Hagel resolution was approved 95-0, warning President Bush not to even consider presenting it to them; he accepted their judgment.\In Copenhagen though, President Obama offered the developing nations $1.3 billion, if they would endeavor to comply with the treaty's limits. He was told that that amount of money was insufficient.\Approaching the end of the Copenhagen meeting, China offered to reduce the amount of their CO2 increase by 40-45 percent, and India indicated they would aim for a 20-25 percent decrease of their projected growth. Yet, if China were to successfully cut their expansion 45 percent by 2020, their emissions would still be 250 percent larger than they were in 2009.\Even though a Rasmussen poll found that 59 percent of Americans are against any global warming legislation, the House passed and forwarded to the Senate the Waxman-Markey bill. It meets the Kyoto treaty requirements. Further, recent statements by Todd Stern, the special envoy on climate change, suggests that negotiations to commit America to an emission reduction program are planned.\However, Senate approval is needed to pass any proposed legislation. Sen. Inhofe, joined by Sen. Jim Webb, D-Va., does not believe any global warming measures will come before them ""anytime soon."" Their assessment is that the Copenhagen conference failed.\If that ""turkey"" is ever imposed on us though, it would precipitate an economic disaster in our country. Even the government's Energy Information Administration calculated it would eliminate 2.3 million jobs by 2030, and cost every family $1,700 per year. In addition, the Wharton Economic Forecasting Associates found that if the Kyoto Treaty were implemented here, it would lower our GDP by 3.2 percent ($300 billion annually). This is more than the federal government spends on primary and secondary education. Plus, food prices would rise 11 percent, medicine would go up 14 percent, housing would grow about 7 percent, and the average yearly income of a family of four would decline by $2,700 in the first year.\In 2009, it was disclosed that a group of climate scientists in a British university, who were providing the United Nations with global warming data, were ""cooking"" (falsifying) those figures and statistics, to have them prove their preconceived theories: Global warming is a human-caused phenomenon, known as anthropogenic. But other experts have testified that climate changes are natural, not man-made.\The Earth's average global temperature may be rising slightly. However, when I was in college 55 years ago, it was declining, and some observers feared a new ice age was coming. Thus, due to the economic damage these proposed regulations would inflict upon us, if they were passed, we must convince our senators to vote ""no"" if any of these global warming proposals are put forth.\Robert L.

Pennsylvania and 14 other states scored a major victory for environmental and public health Friday, when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit overturned a dangerous Bush administration policy on regulating mercury.
\
The states had adopted rules mandating reductions in mercury emissions by coal-fired power plants, the chief source of the emissions. The Bush administration imposed a ""cap and trade"" rule, by which plants that emit mercury beyond the standards may buy credits from plants with emissions below the standard. That might work for some other types of emissions, but not for mercury, a dangerous neurotoxin. The problem with the cap and trade system is that it could have precluded any actual reductions of mercury pollution, allowing further contamination of waterways.
\
Power plants nationwide spew about 48 tons of mercury into the environment each year. That doesn't sound like much until you consider that a fraction of a teaspoon of mercury is enough to render fish in a 25-acre lake to be unfit for human consumption.
\
Pennsylvania and the other states were correct to insist on actual reductions of mercury emissions from every power plant. The administration should accept the court's decision.
"
6,"Like the climate itself, Gov. Tom Wolf’s decision to include the state in a regional effort to curb greenhouse gas emissions is not a purely partisan matter.\The order directs executive branch agencies to lay the regulatory foundation for the state to join the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. That coalition of nine states operates a “cap-and-trade” program, under which fossil fuel-powered utilities and other industrial polluters are allowed to meet emission caps by buying credits. Governments use the revenue to promote clean energy and develop clean-energy infrastructure. Over time, the amount of available credits declines, creating pressure for higher energy efficiency and fewer emissions.\Members of the RGGI are Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont. New Jersey, an original member that withdrew, is expected to rejoin.\Pennsylvania is unique among those states because, as the nation’s second-leading natural gas producer and third-leading coal producer, it would be the only major fossil-fuel producer in the group. It also would be the only state in the group to be a net exporter of electricity, a majority of which is produced by fossil fuels.\So the economic stakes are higher for Pennsylvania than for the other members.\Although the political fault lines on the issue generally divide pro-environment Democrats and pro-industry Republicans, those lines are not distinct. Many Republican legislators, for example, are proponents of the state’s nuclear power industry, the second largest nationally. Since nuclear power generation does not produce carbon emissions, the industry would be among the foremost beneficiaries of a cap-and-trade pact. Likewise, some legislative Democrats represent districts heavily invested in coal and gas production, and power production dependent upon those fuels.\The cap-and-trade concept has a long bipartisan pedigree. President Ronald Reagan embraced it in the 1980s to help phase out leaded gasoline. In 1989, President George H.W. Bush convinced a Democratic Congress to use it to help reduce sulfur emissions to fight acid rain. President George W. Bush used it in 2005’s Clean Air Interstate Rule to increase Clean Air Act pollution standards.\Wolf’s order is the beginning of a process. Lawmakers of all stripes should find ways to make the idea work within the vast, complex web of Pennsylvania’s energy production and consumption.\Crédito: Opinion"

Gov. Christie said Thursday that New Jersey would withdraw from the nation's first regional cap-and-trade program for greenhouse gases - an announcement that left environmentalists fuming and political observers speculating over the whether the governor was appealing to the national conservative base.
\
The governor acknowledged there was ""undeniable data"" that levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases were increasing and affecting the climate.
\
""When you have over 90 percent of the world's scientists who have studied this stating that climate change is occurring and that humans play a contributing role, it's time to defer to the experts. . . . We know enough to know that we are at least a part of the problem,"" he said.
\
But he rejected the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative - an agreement among New Jersey and nine other Northeast states - as an effective solution.
\
The program aims to reduce carbon emissions, which are linked to global warming, by 10 percent in participating states by 2018. Under a system known as cap-and-trade, fossil-fuel-burning power plants essentially pay a price for polluting by buying allowances for the carbon they emit. The proceeds are invested in renewable energy and energy efficiency.
\
The price of allowances per ton has fallen from $3.07 at the first auction three years ago to $1.89 at the last event in March. Christie said the allowances ""were never expensive enough to change behavior as they were intended to and ultimately fuel different choices.""
\
""The whole system is not working as it was intended to work,"" he said. ""It's a failure.""
\
A number of the state's environmentalists disagreed.
\
Christie should be working with other states to strengthen the program instead of giving up, said Matt Elliott, a global-warming and clean-energy advocate for Environment New Jersey.
\
""It was always understood that the states agreed, 'Let's try this for a couple years; let's get it working, and we'll review it and make it stronger.' . . . Christie is just throwing up his hands and quitting, which is entirely the wrong approach,"" Elliott said.
\
Some political observers viewed the GOP governor's move as an effort to appeal to a national conservative agenda, similar to his controversial fiscal decisions to halt a commuter tunnel to New York and eliminate state funding for family planning centers.
\
""He's making sure that his stance on cap-and-trade is consistent with the conservative wing of the Republican Party because this really is a key issue,"" said Brigid Harrison, a political science professor at Montclair State University.
\
The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative has delivered $789.3 million in revenue to the participating states from Maine to Maryland through December, and $102.2 million to New Jersey since the state joined in 2008 during the administration of former Gov. Jon S. Corzine.
\
""Those investments are saving energy consumers money, making businesses more competitive, and creating jobs in our state economies,"" Emilee Pierce, a spokeswoman for RGGI Inc., said in an e-mail.
\
The organization said in a statement that it would continue with an auction planned for June 8.
\
Participating states include New Hampshire, Vermont, Connecticut, Delaware, New York, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island.
\
The Garden State's investments include more than $29 million for 12 large-scale commercial and industrial renewable-energy and energy-efficiency projects. A report from RGGI said the projects were expected to generate enough electricity annually to power more than 19,600 typical New Jersey households each year.
\
Environment New Jersey estimates that households in the state pay $3.24 on average toward RGGI on their utility bills.
\
Last year, the state diverted $65 million from its RGGI fund to help plug the $11 billion state budget deficit. Other participants raided their greenhouse-gas funds as well.
\
Controversy over the program has been mounting. The New Hampshire Senate voted this month to maintain the state's involvement after the House voted to withdraw. A bill to pull Delaware from the agreement also was recently voted down.
\
On Thursday, the governors of Vermont and Massachusetts pledged their support of RGGI.
\
""It is disappointing that New Jersey has decided not to be part of the solution, but we will continue to work with the RGGI states to tackle this critical issue,"" Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick said in a statement.
\
Christie cited a report released by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection that said the state's carbon emissions already had fallen below the state limit set for 2020, a trend that the governor attributed to increased consumption of natural gas and reduced use of coal.
\
He also said the state had created a number of incentives for wind, solar, and natural gas generation, making any benefits from RGGI ""minuscule.""
\
""We're not going to participate anymore in something that doesn't work, but that is not an abandonment of our commitment to continue to work toward more renewable energy,"" Christie said.
\
The withdrawal will make New Jersey more competitive with Pennsylvania, which chose not participate in the cap-and-trade agreement, he said.
\
""This program has put New Jersey on an unequal footing as compared to our neighbors, and I applaud Gov. Christie's newest commitment to improving our business and jobs climate in New Jersey,"" Sen. Diane Allen (R., Burlington) said in a statement.
\
Other environmental advocates said the withdrawal from RGGI would cost the state jobs and undermine renewable-energy causes.
\
""He's destroying the environment, and in New Jersey we have a responsibility for New Jerseyans to have clean air,"" said Assemblyman Upendra Chivukula (D., Somerset), who has sponsored laws to curb greenhouse gas emissions.
\
Michael Drewniak, a spokesman for the governor, said in an e-mail that New Jersey's RGGI fund would have $6.3 million by the end of the fiscal year. And $18 million is expected to come in from recent auctions. There is no provision yet in the fiscal 2012 budget allowing for another transfer, he said.

8,"THE ISSUE\Gov. Tom Wolf is “working to bring Pennsylvania into a regional consortium that sets a price and caps on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, part of the Democrat’s agenda to fight climate change,” The Associated Press reported in the Oct. 3 LNP. Pennsylvania is the nation’s fourth-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, and environmental activists long have pushed for the state to join the consortium.\We applaud this move by Gov. Wolf and wish it hadn’t been necessary for him to, as state Republicans lamented, “go it alone.”\Some background: In states that are part of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, “owners of power plants fueled by coal, oil or natural gas with a capacity of 25 megawatts must buy a credit for every ton of carbon dioxide they emit,” the AP reported. “That gives them an incentive to lower their emissions while making non-emitting plants — such as nuclear power plants, wind turbines and solar installations — more cost competitive in power markets.”\Pennsylvania’s power plants emit about 92 million tons of greenhouse gases per year, according to the AP, which far exceeds the consortium's 2019 cap of 80.2 million tons. Thus, plant owners “could be required to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to the state annually,” the AP reported.\This is known as cap and trade, and Franz Litz, a consultant on those programs, said they can be effective in keeping emissions on a continual decline.\“It’s a fairly modest program that has managed to lock in reductions — whatever their cause,” Litz said, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. “It would seem to be a tool that could get a state, or a group of states, to where the electricity sector needs to be by mid-century.”\The primary goals, of course, are not to penalize power plant owners or make them pay out millions.\The goal is to encourage, firmly, the reduction of carbon emissions throughout a state’s or region’s energy infrastructure. It is vital to do this as our governments work to aggressively counteract the man-made aspects of global warming.\“Climate change is the most critical environmental threat confronting the world, and power generation is one of the biggest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions,” Wolf stated Oct. 3.\We lauded Wolf’s January executive order calling for Pennsylvania to achieve a 26% reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions by 2025 and an 80% reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. But those goals cannot be achieved through wishful thinking; they require governmental intervention.\Wolf’s push to get Pennsylvania into the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative is part of that needed movement.\It came, as the AP noted, in the face of potential “pushback from the Republican-controlled Legislature” and the state’s influential coal and natural gas industries.\We agree with Republicans that Wolf shouldn’t (and truly can’t) act alone to guide Pennsylvania into the regional consortium. But Wolf’s big nudge was needed, we believe, to spur timely action by the Legislature. We cannot keep waiting for Harrisburg to take significant action to reduce carbon emissions within the state’s energy sector. Other states — including Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts and New York — have accomplished this. Pennsylvania can — and must — too.\In their response to Wolf’s executive action, state House Republican leaders cautioned that all stakeholders must have their voices heard on this topic: “The regulation of carbon dioxide presents significant impacts on our economy, the environment and on the bottom line for Pennsylvania families. ... Our state is not an autocracy, and one-sided decisions as significant as this leave out the important voices of Pennsylvania workers, communities and families whose livelihood is built upon important sectors of our energy economy.”\We understand that. As does Wolf. “This is the beginning of this,” the governor told PennLive, “and I’m looking forward to a robust conversation with the General Assembly, with environmental advocates, with Pennsylvanians all across the state to figure out how we do this right.”\That’s good. But Harrisburg cannot drag its feet. Lawmakers must seek input from stakeholders and then work in purposeful — and bipartisan — fashion to integrate our state into the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative in a way that reasonably addresses as many concerns as possible.\Ultimately, though, the biggest concern is our environment. Pennsylvania must significantly lower its annual greenhouse gas emissions.\------------\ Bold steps \Related to this topic, Penn State University is exhibiting leadership with its steps to reduce carbon emissions.\In a story published Oct. 4, NPR detailed how “Penn State’s greenhouse emissions are now down by a third, compared with the peak in 2004.” And within a few years, as a new 500-acre solar farm in Franklin County comes online, Penn State’s emissions will be down by almost 50%.\“Perhaps most amazing: Those reductions have paid for themselves,” NPR noted.\Myriad decisions, large and small, have paved the way for these reductions. They include fine-tuning heating and air conditioning systems, switching from coal to natural gas, installing new energy-saving motors and, as mentioned, the new contract with a solar farm, which is expected to provide 25% of Penn State’s purchased electricity over the next quarter-century.\A combination of activism, smart analysis and purposeful leadership has driven these positive changes by Penn State.\We would like to think it’s an example that Harrisburg can take to heart as it tackles this vital issue for the entire state.\Crédito: THE LNP EDITORIAL BOARD"

As global warming continues to instill fear in many people, America is on the right track in preventing future climate change. President Barack Obama's environmental policy plan of a market-based cap-and-trade system seems to be a logical and possible solution.
\
When the Clean Air Act of 1990 was in effect, a cap-and-trade system was designed to reduce sulfur emissions, which cause acid rain. As a result, sulfur emissions were reduced 22 percent lower than the mandated levels -- a perfect example of how a cap-and-trade system can work.
\
A cap-and-trade system is necessary to reduce the world's newest environmental concern -- carbon emissions. America should be excited for a cleaner environment and having a helping hand in the process.

10,"The Pittsburgh region was lifted by the broad shoulders of steel and coal, there is no doubt. Our industrial heritage is a rich one.\Then came the eds-and-meds revitalization, which was needed as our fossil-fuel foundations rusted with disuse and wear.\Now, the region moves forward with plans that recognize the economic value of our existing power sector as well as the need to modernize it and adjust it such that it fits with our concurrent concern for our environment.\Pennsylvania has taken a step toward reducing our climate-warming pollution with what is known colloquially as a carbon cap-and-trade program. It's a step that requires fossil fuel power plants to pay to emit carbon dioxide. The state's Environmental Quality Board voted to advance a final regulation that will establish a price and declining cap on carbon emissions and allow Pennsylvania to join the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. The RGGI is an 11-state consortium that has promised to reduce power plant CO2 emissions by 30% by 2030.\This is a move supported by Gov. Tom Wolf who contends he has authority by virtue of the state's Air Pollution Control Act to limit carbon emissions and levy a fee for pollution.\Nonetheless, a battle is brewing with the Republican-led Legislature as well as some power plants that will be impacted by the new rules. The state Senate passed a bill in June that would block DEP from implementing the new rule without express permission from the General Assembly. More action is certain come this fall when the legislative session resumes.\Cap-and-trade is not a perfect solution for industry or the environment. But it is a tool that threads the needle. It moves Pennsylvania toward needed climate change measures and, at the same time, gives the power sector the means to continue operations while its methods evolve.\The state Department of Environmental Protection anticipates that this program will forestall the emission of between 97 million and 227 million tons of CO2 that would otherwise be released in Pennsylvania by 2030. Air pollutants contribute to asthma and other respiratory illnesses.\Revenue from the cap-and-trade program is projected to range from $131 million to $187 million annually. This money should be used in three ways: to further reduce carbon emissions; to fund programs that help the disadvantaged to pay for home heating costs as residential electric bills are expected to rise in 2022 if the new plan is implemented at the start of next year; and job retraining and economic development programs for people and communities impacted by the new rules - if they are implemented. The state's Independent Regulatory Review Commission and legislative committees will get a look.\And while there may be some serious concerns about economic impact, DEP received more than 14,000 public comments on the proposed initiatives and the majority were in favor.\This is not to dismiss the worry of communities that are home to coal-fired power plants and the employees of the plants. But, the health benefits of decreasing CO2 are undeniable and will be realized by those same people and communities. Also, it is worth noting that there are just six remaining conventional coal-fired power plants in the state and half have committed to retiring or transitioning to other fuel sources within the decade. DEP predicts ""most if not all"" power generation from conventional coal plants will end by 2025 whether Pennsylvania establishes a carbon price or not because it will continue to lose out to cleaner, inexpensive natural gas in the competitive market.\People like state Rep. Daryl Metcalfe, R-Cranberry, should seal their lips unless they have something intelligent to say. He commented during a public session that climate change is ""nonsense."" Is there any intelligent person who actually still believes that?\The facts are that climate change cannot be denied; change is hard but necessary; and participation in the RGGI - and adopting cap-and-trade rules - are sensible ways to manage an evolution that already is underway."
11," On March 15, the EPA and the Bush administration decreased the amount of mercury being released into our environment. Mercury has been identified as a cause of nerve damage in fetuses and newborns. The administration went against environmentalists' recommendations and adopted a more industry-friendly policy called ""cap-and-trade.""\ This allows companies to trade mercury release allowances with each other. A company with high emissions can purchase allowances from a low-emitting company and thus not reduce its emissions. This is all supposed to result in lower mercury emissions.\ Cap-and-trade is a very interesting approach. In fact, it was the same type of policy that this administration used as one of the reasons not to sign the Kyoto treaty for reducing global greenhouse emissions.\ Mike Koziel\ Upper Macungie Township\ ***"
12,"Half a century ago America awakened to learn that the Soviet Union had launched a satellite into space. Although this little silver globe called Sputnik did not do much on its own, its impact on America was huge. It shook our country out of its postwar complacency, helping us realize that if we sat back and did nothing, other countries could quickly overtake us with superior scientific technology.\America launched its own space program. The Apollo project, the most ambitious program in our history, achieved the goal of putting a man on the moon and returning him safely. Ten years later, through hard work and innovation, the success of our Apollo project inspired a new generation of scientists, engineers, and workers of every stripe to put America on top.\We are now challenged to meet a new global demand: create the energy our nation needs, but do so in a way that does not destroy our earth.\Last week, climate change policy, known as the ""cap and trade"" legislation, moved through the House Energy and Commerce Committee, of which I'm a member. The bill has ignited controversy, not because of an opposition to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, but because the cap and trade plan would not achieve that goal. Instead, it would simply raise energy prices during a national recession without putting any money into cleaning up power plants -- many of which were designed in the days of slide rule era technology without pollution reducing scrubbers.\The cap and trade regime mandates a nationwide limit on carbon emissions, bringing it to 83 percent below current levels by 2050. This limit is very strict, arguably impossible to meet, bringing the U.S. carbon emissions level to the same level of Somalia or Haiti.\If any company is unable to meet the new emission requirements, it could purchase carbon ""credits"" from the government, essentially allowing them to pay a tax to continue emitting carbon at higher levels. On the other hand, if a company meets the emission standard, it could trade or sell ""credits"" to other companies that have not reached the emissions goal. Essentially, cap and trade becomes a pollution tax and trade scheme.\Estimates show such a plan would increase taxes. According to a Massachusetts Institute of Technology study, cap and trade could add $3,100 in costs to each family's annual energy bill by 2016. Factories would face even steeper increases. Manufacturing would grow in foreign countries that do not have America's strict emission standards, such as China or Brazil, because products made there would be cheaper.\U.S. companies, unable to compete internationally would be forced to shut down or ship jobs overseas. Even the Environmental Protection Agency said the bill would lead to a loss of 3 million American manufacturing jobs. On top of this, none of the tax money raised from the bill would go to support clean coal, nuclear energy, or build clean energy needs of the future.\Although many still debate the causes and impact of climate change, we must be responsible stewards of the environment for the sake of public health. We all want clean air, water, and land.\I believe we can cut emissions and create clean energy without raising taxes. It is time for an energy renaissance that uses America's energy resources to create American jobs and a cleaner America.\This is why Rep. Neil Abercrombie, D-Hawaii, and I formed a bipartisan Energy Working Group with members from both sides of the aisle that want to set America on a path to clean energy independence without raising taxes or shipping jobs overseas. After several months of deliberation, we introduced ""The American Conservation and Clean Energy Independence Act of 2009"" (H.R. 2227), which will move America toward energy independence, invest in renewable energy and clean up the environment while creating American jobs.\Our bill pays for itself by using the revenue from offshore drilling of oil and natural gas to fund the transition to clean energy. While the money raised as taxes under cap and trade just goes into the federal Treasury for Congress to spend on any pet project, the American Conservation and Clean Energy Independence Act directs the hundreds of billions in revenues to replace old power plants with clean coal technology; expand nuclear power; repairing our aging sewer systems; and fund environmental restoration and clean water projects\Our bill will clean up our air, land and water; dramatically improve energy efficiency and conservation; create over a million new jobs; and fuel our economy in unprecedented ways -- all of this without raising taxes or crippling our manufacturing base.\Clean energy is the Apollo project of our generation, and we can meet this goal with the same determination as we did a generation ago."

Both Sen. Arlen Specter and Robert Casey have supported Cap and Trade even though they know it will cost jobs, weaken an already failing economy, and we could never get out of it. This is not about the environment, because if it were we would not need an international treaty. We could tax our pollution's sources and use that money to fund environmentally friendly projects here in the United States. That would create new jobs. But the bankers and Al Gore would not get richer by doing that. This is all about money and control as is the mandatory health insurance bill these thugs supported.

14,"More than 60 Pennsylvania environmental lawyers, businesses, faith groups and local governments are petitioning the state to adopt a cap-and-trade program that would gradually reduce, and eventually eliminate, emissions of greenhouse gases from large sources across the Pennsylvania economy over the next three decades.\In a petition submitted to the state's environmental rule-making board late Tuesday, the coalition led by the Philadelphia-based Clean Air Council argues that Pennsylvania is required by its constitution and air pollution law to reduce emissions of climate-warming gases to levels that limit their threat to people and the environment.\Pennsylvania is the third-largest U.S. emitter of carbon dioxide, the most common greenhouse gas.\The petition comes in the wake of major new national and international assessments detailing the devastating and costly repercussions of a warming planet, including powerful storms, heat waves, rising seas and crop failures. There is broad scientific consensus that the changes are being driven by human actions, especially burning coal, oil and natural gas.\""The proposed regulation would create a measured and foreseeable path for the commonwealth and its industry to do what is necessary to avoid the worst consequences of climate disruption,"" the petitioners wrote to the secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection.\A trading market created by the regulation would help nearly all of the state's financially struggling nuclear plants stay open, they said.\It would also have the side-benefit of generating enough revenue to ""solve Pennsylvania's chronic budget deficits for decades to come.""\The proposal is an ambitious strategy in a major fossil fuel- and electricity-producing state where the oil, gas and coal industries enjoy bipartisan support.\Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf's spokesman J.J. Abbott said in response to the petition that the governor ""believes that climate change is real, and that we need to continue to take steps to address this issue, while at the same time preserving and creating good paying jobs in the energy sector and growing our economy.""\Kevin Sunday, director of government affairs for the Pennsylvania Chamber of Business and Industry, the state's largest business organization, said existing case law does not support the petition's interpretation of the constitution's Environmental Rights Amendment. He also said the proposal intrudes on the General Assembly's power to craft laws.\""Certainly, a broad government action like this should involve the legislative branch,"" he said.\A market-based approach\Cap and trade is seen as a compelling but controversial mechanism for curbing greenhouse gas emissions.\It is a market-based approach that both sets a shrinking limit on how much pollution can be released and offers economic incentives for companies to make further reductions and to earn valuable allowances they can sell to others.\A national cap-and-trade program for sulfur dioxide pollution that was started in the 1990s is credited with lessening the problem of acid rain.\Attorney Robert B. McKinstry Jr., the petition's lead author, said the proposed Pennsylvania greenhouse gas cap-and-trade program is based on California's, but he adapted it for this region.\The Pennsylvania proposal would cover power plants; industrial plants that make things like steel, cement and glass; coal mines; natural gas suppliers; and fuel distributors.\The amount of allowable emissions would decline each year by 3 percent of the levels as they were in 2016 until they reach zero in 2052.\Most of the covered companies would buy allowances at auction, starting with a base price of $10 per metric ton of carbon in 2020 and rising each year by 10 percent plus inflation.\Not driving business away?\Mr. McKinstry said he designed the program to avoid the pitfalls that have made other cap-and-trade regimes weak - such as high caps that create a glut of allowances or low prices that don't keep carbon-free nuclear plants afloat or encourage companies to invest in technologies for capturing their emissions.\He also included provisions that aim to keep Pennsylvania economically competitive, so businesses do not flee to states with looser rules.\""I've been practicing law representing industry for almost 40 years,"" he said. ""I can design things with the marketplace in mind.""\If the petition is successful, Pennsylvania's program would send price signals to other regional cap-and-trade programs, potentially pushing all of them toward the commonwealth's more rigorous system.\But first, Pennsylvania would have to sign on to the plan.\The legal process\The state's environmental rule-making body, called the Environmental Quality Board, must review the petition and decide whether to adopt, reject or modify it. The 20-member board is made up of the heads of 11 state agencies, five members of a citizens advisory council and four members of the state Senate and House.\Its decision would be appealable to state courts including, if necessary, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.\In a ruling last year, the high court revived the state's Environmental Rights Amendment and reinforced the Pennsylvania government's obligation to act as a trustee of the commonwealth's natural resources for current and future generations.\That case provided the key legal precedent for this effort, the petitioners said.\A petition with a similar goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions was rejected by the Environmental Quality Board in 2014 - a decision that was later upheld by state courts.\But Joseph Otis Minott, executive director of the Clean Air Council, said this effort is ""fundamentally different.""\""We're very specific about what we're asking the (Department of Environmental Protection) to do,"" he said. The package presented to the board includes a 400-page petition with a 260-page draft regulation - everything that the board needs to move forward with publishing a proposed rule.\The regulatory process presents a clearer, quicker, more flexible path for action than asking the Republican-controlled Legislature to write a new law, he said.\The recent national and international reports confirm that ""climate change is an emergency,"" Mr. Minott said. ""Going slow and not taking decisive action to protect us from climate change is just no longer acceptable.""\CAPTION: PHOTO: Darrell Sapp/Post-Gazette: The Beaver Valley Nuclear Plant in Shippingport.\CREDIT: By Laura Legere, Harrisburg Bureau"
15,"Whether in air, on land, or at sea, the evidence of climate change is, well, evident.\The rising level of the oceans, shrinking glacial ice caps, decreasing wildlife species, damaging storms, scorching heat waves - the impacts are undeniable by any rational standard. Yet parochial interests have been a barrier to reaching a plan forward for the United States and the global community.\Pennsylvania has the dubious distinction of being the third-largest emitter of carbon dioxide in America.\Gov. Tom Wolf announced Tuesday he intends to do something about it.\He signed an executive order setting a first-ever statewide goal to slash greenhouse gas emissions: by 26 percent by the year 2025 and by 80 percent by the year 2050 (compared to 2005 levels).\A group of some five dozen stakeholders is ready to help him achieve his goals with a market-driven solution that makes sense.\The Clean Air Council - a coalition of businesses and lawyers, ministers and municipal officials - proposes to gradually reduce to the point of elimination the greenhouse gases generated by the biggest sources. And they propose to do it within 30 years.\The council argues that Pennsylvania is required by its own constitution as well as its air pollution laws to do this. Not everyone agrees on that legal interpretation. But that's irrelevant, especially in light of the governor's executive order.\The need for a better environment is not debatable.\The Clean Air Council has a logical plan and it has been submitted by petition to the state Department of Environmental Protection, sparing the agency the task of crafting regulation.\The council's plan keys on support for the state's struggling nuclear plants -""clean"" producers of power - and contains incentives for business to jump on the bandwagon. A trading market -known as cap and trade -would help the state's nuclear plants keep the lights on and generate buying andselling in private industry -always a good thing with side benefits for the state. It would work like this: Limits (caps) would be set on industrial plants (power, steel, glass) that generate pollution. But, plants can buy or sell (trade) emission allowances through a government-operated auction, which could generate a slice of pie for Harrisburg, too. The Clean Air Council also has proposed additional economic incentives to reduce emissions or earn more allowances that can be sold.\Sounds a lot like capitalism ... and it's been done before and with success. Sulfur dioxide pollution, which causes acid rain, was reduced by a national cap-and-trade program in the 1990s. The greenhouse cap-and-trade proposal put forth now in Pennsylvania is similar to one that has been operating successfully in California since 2013.\The cap-and-trade program being peddled in Harrisburg currently calls for allowable emissions to decline by 3 percent from 2016 levels until they reach zero in 2052. This is more aggressive than the governor's executive order but why not shoot for the stars (through an unpolluted sky).\It's up to Pennsylvania's Environmental Quality Board, which sets environmental rules and regulations, to embrace the proposal. The 20-member board is made up of the leaders of nearly a dozen state agencies, a citizens advisory council and four members of the state Senate and House.\Everyone agrees there is a problem. The governor has made the solution a priority. The Clean Air Council has come up with a market-driven way to get from here to there."
16,"It's a scary economy we're living in. People are worried about putting food on the table, making this month's rent or mortgage payment, and hoping just maybe they'll have a little extra cash to see a movie this weekend.\Given our economic situation, President Barack Obama's aspiration to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through a carbon cap-and-trade system is misplaced. Focusing on jobs and economic recovery should be priority No. 1.\The state of the environment is not something to take lightly. My enthusiasm for environmental stewardship goes back to my college days when I started my campus' first recycling program. This sophisticated effort involved me sifting through classroom trash and taking the recyclables to a recycling plant. And now, as a father, I want my daughter to grow up breathing clean air and not worrying about pollution.\So agreed, we need to address carbon emissions, but a cap-and-trade system where the federal government sells a capped number of credits for emitting greenhouse gases (chiefly carbon dioxide) is the wrong way to go. For the most part, the problems begin when we get to the ""trade"" part of cap and trade.\All those carbon emission credits could be bought and sold among companies in a complex market run by the same Wall Street speculators at the root of our current economic blight. Such a market would handle millions of trades a day, in a system so complicated it would make hedge-fund speculation seem like simple barter. A cap-and-trade market would be ripe for manipulation by inside players. Prices of emissions credits could be cranked up or down for quick profits -- leading to violent swings in energy prices.\While a cap-and-trade market is too huge and complex for meaningful government safeguards, taxpayers would be stuck footing the bill to create a new bureaucracy to regulate it. In practice, cap-and-trade systems also come down hard on coal-dependent states like ours.\But by far the biggest weakness of cap and trade is that it simply doesn't cut greenhouse gas emissions -- as our friends in the European Union have discovered.\If we want to lower greenhouse gas emissions, and it seems clear by now that America does, there are simpler, more effective ways to accomplish this.\Conservation is one, and Pennsylvania already has a head start. For obvious reasons, our state is aggressively exploring clean-coal technology. And we're right up there with California and New Jersey in supporting tighter limits on motor-vehicle exhaust, which accounts for one third of Pennsylvania's air pollution.\The supposed benefit of cap and trade is that it would apply a financial sanction to carbon emissions and encourage industries to invest in ""green"" energy and cleaner forms of fossil-fuel use. That benefit would be much better delivered by a straightforward tax on all carbon emissions.\A carbon tax is simple -- it applies a set fee per each ton of carbon dioxide a company emits. The tax could be set up almost immediately -- without creating a new trading market or regulatory agency. \Additionally, the carbon tax concept would have 90 percent of generated revenue being returned as tax relief to the people and businesses who use the energy and pay the tax in their utility bills. (Or how about using the revenue to beef up Social Security?) The remaining 10 percent of revenue would be dedicated to climate research and clean-energy technology.\Given the state of our economy, Pennsylvania families and businesses can't afford to suffer the unacceptable costs of an expensive and ineffective cap-and-trade program. But that's not to say that other proposals to deal with climate change should be off the table. Solutions to reduce carbon emissions that don't further weaken the economy, such as a carbon tax, are where we need to shift this conversation.\So, before rushing into cap and trade, let's continue the climate-change discussion. And in the meantime, with the money we're saving by not paying for a reckless climate-change program, maybe check out a movie this weekend."
17,"There is much in the House cap-and-trade energy bill that just passed that I absolutely hate. It is too weak in key areas and way too complicated in others. A simple, straightforward carbon tax would have made much more sense than this Rube Goldberg contraption. It is pathetic that we couldn't do better. It is appalling that so much had to be given away to polluters. It stinks. It's a mess. I detest it.\Now let's get it passed in the Senate and make it law.\Why? Because, for all its flaws, this bill is the first comprehensive attempt by America to mitigate climate change by putting a price on carbon emissions. Rejecting this bill would be read in the world as America voting against the reality and urgency of climate change and would undermine clean energy initiatives everywhere.\More important, my gut tells me that if the U.S. government puts a price on carbon, even a weak one, it will usher in a new mind-set among consumers, investors, farmers, innovators and entrepreneurs that in time will make a big difference -- much like the first warnings that cigarettes could cause cancer. The morning after that warning no one ever looked at smoking the same again.\Ditto if this bill passes. Henceforth, every investment decision made in America -- about how homes are built, products manufactured or electricity generated -- will look for the least-cost, low-carbon option. And weaving carbon emissions into every business decision will drive innovation and deployment of clean technologies to a whole new level and make energy efficiency much more affordable. That ain't beanbag.\Now that the bill is heading for the Senate, though, we must, ideally, try to improve it, but, at a minimum, guard against diluting it any further. To do that we need the help of the three parties most responsible for how weak the bill already is: the Republican Party, President Barack Obama and We the People.\This bill is not weak because its framers, Reps. Henry Waxman and Ed Markey, wanted it this way. ""They had to make the compromises they did,"" said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign, ""because almost every House Republican voted against the bill and did nothing to try to improve it. So to get it passed, they needed every coal-state Democrat, and that meant they had to water it down to bring them on board.""\What are Republicans thinking? It is not as if they put forward a different strategy, like a carbon tax. Does the GOP want to be the party of sex scandals and polluters or does it want to be a partner in helping America dominate the next great global industry: ET -- energy technology? How could Republicans become so anti-environment, just when the country is going green?\Historically speaking, ""Republicans can claim as much credit for America's environmental leadership as Democrats,"" noted Glenn Prickett, senior vice president at Conservation International. ""The two greatest environmental presidents in American history were Teddy Roosevelt, who created our national park system, and Richard Nixon, whose administration gave us the Clean Air Act and the Environmental Protection Agency."" The elder George Bush signed the 1993 Rio Treaty, to preserve biodiversity.\Yes, this bill's goal of reducing U.S. carbon emissions to 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 is nowhere near what science tells us we need to mitigate climate change. But it also contains significant provisions to prevent new buildings from becoming energy hogs, to make our appliances the most energy efficient in the world and to help preserve carbon-absorbing forests in places like the Amazon.\We need Republicans who believe in fiscal conservatism and conservation joining this legislation in the Senate. We want a bill that transforms the whole country not one that just threads a political needle. I hope they start listening to green Republicans like Dick Lugar, George Shultz and Arnold Schwarzenegger.\I also hope we will hear more from Barack Obama. Something feels very calculating in how he has approached this bill, as if he doesn't quite want to get his hands dirty, as if he is ready to twist arms in private, but not so much that if the bill goes down he will get tarnished.\That is no way to fight this war. Mr. Obama is going to have to mobilize the whole country to pressure the Senate -- by educating Americans, with speech after speech, about the opportunities and necessities of a serious climate/energy bill. If he is not ready to risk failure by going all out, failure will be the most likely result.\And then there is We the People. Attention all young Americans: Your climate future is being decided right now in the cloakrooms of the Capitol, where the coal lobby holds huge sway. You want to make a difference? Then get out of Facebook and into somebody's face. Get a million people on the Washington Mall calling for a price on carbon. That will get the Senate's attention. Play hardball or don't play at all."
18,"Staff writer M. Ferguson Tinsley contributed. Don Hopey can be reached at dhopey@post-gazette.com or 412-263-1983.\ U.S. Environmental Protection Administrator Mike Leavitt came to Pittsburgh yesterday on a public relations tour to roll out parts of the agency's 2005 budget in election battleground states. He defended the Bush administration's market-based approach to environmental regulation.\ The former Utah governor, who replaced embattled EPA administrator Christine Todd Whitman in August, said the administration is finding the ""productive center"" between environmental and industry extremes.\ He rejected long-standing complaints by environmental groups, municipal air quality enforcement officials and many Eastern states, including Pennsylvania, that the administration is weakening some environmental laws to accommodate the president's political supporters and not enforcing others.\ ""The objective of the administration is to have cleaner air and water and purify the land in brownfield sites, but not compromise us economically,"" Leavitt said. ""Some have suggested we are stepping back, but this is the political season.""\ Leavitt began the day at North Allegheny School District's McKnight Elementary School in McCandless to announce that the administration is asking for $60 million to reduce unhealthy school bus exhaust in 220 school districts nationwide.\ North Allegheny, which transports more than 9,000 students to schools each day, received $125,000 in October to install exhaust reduction devices on all 100 of its full-sized buses.\ It is one of 17 districts across the country to participate in the program's pilot year projects.\ Earlier this week, Leavitt was in Maryland and Michigan to announce Chesapeake Bay and Great Lakes cleanup projects.\ Environmental groups criticized the announcements as too little from the administration of a president who failed to mention the environment in his State of the Union address.\ ""Everyone supports efforts to clean up school bus pollution, but this announcement should be seen within a bigger picture,"" said Arthur Stamoulis, policy analyst for Clean Air Council, a Philadelphia-based environmental organization. ""The Bush administration is funding environmental programs in swing states as part of a cynical attempt to deflect attention away from its abysmal environmental record nationwide.""\ Leavitt told the Post-Gazette editorial board that the administration's new rule for reducing mercury emissions from power plants will achieve the best reductions possible with present technology. The rule, published in the Federal Register yesterday, requires the nation's 1,100 coal- and oil-fired electric power plants to reduce mercury emissions by 70 percent by 2018.\ Although Leavitt said the mercury reduction goal is ""an aggressive target,"" the administration's proposal falls short of the 90 percent reduction in mercury emissions by 2008 proposed by the Clinton administration and endorsed in December 2001 by Whitman.\ Environmental groups, including Physicians for Social Responsibility, the Environmental Integrity Project and the Sierra Club, yesterday were quick to criticize the rule, which allows utilities to use a cap-and-trade system that will allow some power plants to make larger emissions reductions while others reduce mercury emissions by lesser amounts or not at all.\ Angela Ledford, director of Clear the Air, an environmental lobbying organization, cited a recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that found mercury emissions could be endangering the learning ability of 322,000 children every year.\ ""That is an extraordinary public health threat, but it is not being taken seriously in Washington,"" Ledford said.\ Leavitt, who repeatedly said he is ""in the enforcement business,"" dismissed recent published reports that show the agency's law enforcement rate is 58 percent lower than during the Clinton administration. He said his first obligation is achieving compliance with environmental laws, not ""running up the score on fines.""\ ""We use enforcement to achieve the desired environmental outcomes,"" he said, noting that the EPA has nine air pollution cases pending against utilities. ""I use the term 'smart enforcement.' We make decisions on which cases to pursue and we choose them very carefully.""\ On climate change and the Kyoto Protocol that the United States has refused to sign, Leavitt said it is clear that the surface temperature of the Earth is rising and that human activity has contributed substantially to that rise, but it is unclear what the country's policy response should be."
19,"After years as a holdout, Pennsylvania is poised to join the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative and implement a cap-and-trade program for carbon dioxide emissions from power plants.\Gov. Tom Wolf signed an executive order Thursday directing the Department of Environmental Protection to join the initiative as a step to combat climate change; regulators have through July 2020 to develop proposed rules for Pennsylvania's sign-on.\Pennsylvania was one of two states among the 11 in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic that has never joined RGGI, and environmentalists have long called on the legislature to sign on.\""Given the urgency of the climate crisis facing Pennsylvania and the entire planet, the commonwealth must continue to take concrete, economically sound and immediate steps to reduce emissions,"" Wolf said in a statement. ""Joining RGGI will give us that opportunity to better protect the health and safety of our citizens.""\Wolf used authority under the Air Pollution Control Act to order the step, but House Republicans on Thursday called it illegal. Their dispute over whether the air-pollution law gives the governor proper authority could set the state up for a court fight if the DEP moves ahead.\Just two weeks ago, Wolf's office said that he wanted to do RGGI with the legislature and that he was waiting to hear whether lawmakers would support it before looking at other options.\""Gov. Wolf clearly does not have the authority to take this reckless action, which will cost average Pennsylvanians more of their hard-earned money through their energy bills, without legislative approval,"" said Rep. Daryl Metcalfe (R., Butler), chair of the House committee on energy and environment.\Joining the initiative, known as RGGI, will mean the Keystone State will make a carbon dioxide budget that limits emissions. After the state sets a cap on carbon dioxide emissions from electric power generators, power plants go to auctions to purchase allowances for their emissions.\Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont are members of the initiative. Pennsylvania and Virginia are not members; New Jersey, which was a founding member but pulled out during Gov. Chris Christie's administration, is in the process of rejoining.\Pennsylvania produces 0.5% of all global carbon emissions, and the largest share of the state's emissions come from the energy sector. DEP Secretary Patrick McDonnell said the state has a ""significant opportunity"" to reduce emissions through RGGI.\The RGGI states reported in 2015 that they had reduced power-sector carbon dioxide pollution by 45% since 2005. The region's economy has grown and in the first six years, RGGI investments returned $2.31 billion in lifetime energy-bill savings to more than 161,000 households and 6,000 businesses that participated in programs funded by RGGI proceeds, the group reported.\Environmental advocates praised Wolf's step.\""RGGI has a proven track record of success for limiting carbon emissions from participating states' power sectors and we are excited that Pennsylvania will be joining its ranks,"" said a statement from the advocacy group Clean Power PA Coalition. ""We must begin the transition away from fossil fuel energy here in Pennsylvania right now, and we must do so in a manner that protects Pennsylvania ratepayers and ensures a just transition for workers.""\jmcdaniel@inquirer.com\215-854-4549\McDanielJustine\ \Credit: By Justine McDaniel STAFF WRITER"
20,"First in a series of four. Tomorrow: The United States at war.\ When President Bush gives the annual State of the Union address to Congress in a few weeks, he is likely to be upbeat in the traditional manner, provided that terrorist threats remain unfulfilled. The economy is on the rebound and the president's optimism won't be entirely prompted by the 2004 election.\ But beneath the good feeling in some quarters, disquiet, even anger, is abroad in America, because not everyone is enjoying the fruits of the economic uplift. Beyond pocketbook issues, there is also a sense that the Bush administration has been overly friendly to special interests at the expense of the American people, especially in areas such as the environment and energy policy.\ If Mr. Bush is concerned with his legacy as well as his re- election, he will make adjustments to his domestic policies. He came to office with the promise to be a president who would unite the country, but much that the administration has undertaken since has had the opposite effect. The following are two major areas in which the administration can do more in 2004 to improve its record:\ * National security has a domestic component that needs further attention. Airports now have a new federalized force at security gates. While the system isn't perfect, it has become smoother and some of the initial idiocies and delays have been eliminated. Overall, the new arrangements inspire more confidence.\ That said, the system of color-coded alerts -- we are currently in orange -- prompts more alarm than anything else. It is anybody's guess whether they work to deter terrorists or are merely an exercise in official posterior covering. It's time to rethink the process, perhaps making heightened security states permanent and obvious but less alarmist.\ In the hunt for terrorists in this country, the federal government has gone too far in abusing the rights guaranteed by the Constitution. It shouldn't have taken the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in December to tell the president that the government lacks the legal authority to seize a U.S. citizen on American soil and hold him indefinitely as an ""enemy combatant"" -- as occurred with Jose Padilla. Under such a theory, no American citizen is truly safe.\ This overreach plays into the popular distrust of the Patriot Act. To be sure, some of these fears are exaggerated, and in the hands of a good steward of the public trust -- a conservative for whom civil liberties were a bedrock principle of his beliefs -- a balancing act of sorts might be achieved between security and liberty. Instead, the nation must endure Attorney General John Ashcroft, who is the bull in the china shop of constitutional principles. President Bush ought to corral Mr. Ashcroft permanently in 2004 and do himself and the nation a favor.\ * The environment is the other domestic area of concern. The Environmental Protection Agency is now in the hands of Mike Leavitt following the resignation of Christine Whitman, whose relative moderation was not appreciated.\ Mr. Leavitt comes with a good reputation as a consensus builder but obviously trusts corporations to do right by the environment. Mr. Bush described him as someone who ""rejects the old ways of command and control from above."" But human nature being what it is, a strong hand above is often needed to protect the public good from the temptation to make profits from environmental harm.\ Already the signs are not auspicious. On proposed rules to limit mercury emissions by utilities for the first time, Mr. Leavitt has proposed a ""market-based cap-and-trade approach"" that would allow hot spots to remain. This, unfortunately, is a business-driven approach reminiscent of an earlier regulatory change to the Clean Air Act that exempted older coal-fired power plants, refineries and other industrial sites from requirements to install new pollution controls when the facilities are upgraded.\ But it's not just the EPA that is worth watching. Just before Christmas, when perhaps it thought all the environmentalists would be snug in their beds, the U.S. Forest Service announced that some 300,000 acres of the Tongass National Forest in Alaska would be opened to road-building, which could lead to logging and other development.\ Perhaps it is unrealistic to expect a major change in the administration's philosophy at this late date, but we remain optimistic. Dr. Samuel Johnson once said the prospect of a hanging concentrates the intended victim's mind wonderfully. Fortunately, so does the prospect of a general election."

ENVIRONMENTAL legislation has taken a back seat over the last decade. But with the new decade, America has an opportunity for progress - 2010 needs to be the year in which Congress passes a global-warming bill.
\
Such legislation would accelerate positive changes in both the economy and national energy security. The key to putting the wheels in motion is a cap-and-trade program.
\
While Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., is seeking to pass a bipartisan climate bill with cap-and-trade programs that price carbon, many GOP senators are opposed, claiming the economy is too fragile to be tampered with. But a cap-and-trade program is necessary for the creation of clean-energy jobs, and to promote energy- and cost-efficient solutions for industry and consumers.
\
After a decade of political atrophy, further delay on global warming isn't an option. Global warming legislation without a cap-and-trade program would not create the markets necessary for green technologies to grow and compete globally. If global warming legislation advances in Congress, the U.S. can be a leader in the race to a global green economy.

Hardy Williams' legacy
\
In the stories about the death of Hardy Williams, he was said to have been a good representative for African-Americans. I read of the good he did for upcoming black politicians, but isn't it an elected official's job to represent all people, regardless of race?
\
I can only imagine the outrage if a white representative was tagged as a pro-white politician. We would have Al Sharpton grandstanding with the local chapter of the NAACP at his side. We might even get a phone call from President Obama to talk about it over a beer. I think white people are being subjected to a double standard.

Cap'n Trade: The breakfast of tax and spenders. Sounds like the morning mealtime special at the White House. Okay, so I'm not sold on Obama's plan of cap-and-trade. Are you?
\
Here's the gist of it: Cap-and-Trade is designed to cap the amount of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere by what's left of America's industry. The government would then issue credits for industries that are able to hold the line on emissions. Those companies then would be able to trade those credits to companies that cannot.
\
But what about those industries that have trouble complying? Do they move to Mexico? And who do you think will bear the cost of such a policy, regardless of success? Take a hard look the next time you stare into that bathroom mirror.
\
As you reflect, keep this in mind: Last month, the World Meteorological Organization produced a surplus of statistics saying there has not been a warmer year on record since 1998.
\
That is only the tip of the melting iceberg.
\
Distinguished atmospheric physicist S. Fred Singer produced a white paper on how 30 percent of climatologists surveyed were ""skeptical"" of claims about global warming caused by humans. The operative phrase here is ""caused by humans."" ""More than 31,000 scientists"" have signed a petition questioning the U.N.'s stance while opposing the recent ""cap-and-trade"" legislation in Congress.
\
For argument's sake, suppose we cut emissions by 20 percent. Such an accomplishment would be wildly successful, but at the same time won't mean squat, provided China does nothing. Many reports have China averaging two coal-burning power plants coming on-line monthly. China has already clinched the title as the world's leading carbon producer. Rather than reducing their lead, they are adding to it -- daily.
\
India is in the same carbon boat with China. India is not as aggressive with their coal plant construction, but emits nearly as much carbon as we do. Getting both countries to play cap-the-carbon game would be like trying to get them to rebuild the Great Wall of China from the top down. The planet is not a series of eco-systems. We are one.
\
Then there are the unknown variables of the carbon equation that are difficult to quantify but exist: Acts of God. Case in point: Mount Redoubt in Alaska. Its recent cluster of eruptions has spewed millions of tons of carbon into the atmosphere. How are we supposed to reduce greenhouse gases if the Earth won't cooperate?
\
The second variable is us, human beings. Like it or not, if there is one thing all humans have in common is that we are all a walking, talking, gas-emitting people. The more people there are, the more energy is consumed and gas emitted. Over the next 30 years, the world's population will increase from six-and-a-half billion to nine billion. That's a lot of hot air.
\
Many will argue that the climate change assemblage is pure politics, not science; a guise to implement a political agenda of change, be it social or otherwise, through ""junk"" science.
\
While campaigning last summer, Obama admitted, ""Under my plan of a cap-and-trade, electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket."" Keep in mind that PPL's rates are scheduled to increase regardless of any cap-and-trade legislation come New Year's Eve.
\
Our needs are elementary but the solutions are not. What we need is clean and cheap energy. Expensive clean energy would be an enormous tax on the American people, and one that China and India will certainly not pay.
\
Human Nature says that if a system can be manipulated, it will be. A cap-and-trade system is inherently a barter, and like any arrangement, the system would be played like a trumpet. The financial derivatives associated with cap-and-trade credits would be traded in a new, complex multi-trillion dollar carbon market. So, if you liked what traders did to our financial system with mortgage backed securities and credit default swaps, than you will love what these traders will do to our environment, not too mention our economy.
\
In a vote last Wednesday, 26 Democrats joined 41 Republican senators on insisting that any new cap-and-tax on carbon would require at least 60 votes.
\
The issue is dead for now, but come next year, this carbonic monster will surely be resurrected.

23,"Despite some recent setbacks, the push to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions is alive and well. Members of the Senate are forging ahead with cap-and-trade legislation, President Barack Obama offered emissions cuts at the Copenhagen climate-change conference, and the Environmental Protection Agency is busy drafting reams of regulations.\Never mind that in our view the Earth has been cooling for the last decade. Who cares if unemployment is over 10 percent for the first time in 26 years? Or that global warming is at the bottom of the public's priority list? The cap-and-trade crowd keeps trudging forward.\They even think they can prevail over ""climategate."" They keep trying to explain the emergence of leaked e-mails and other documents from some of the world's leading climate scientists -- e-mails detailing how they refused to share data, plotted to keep dissenting scientists from getting published in leading journals and discarded original data, all to protect the facade of scientific consensus.\In spite of all this, enforcing carbon-dioxide emissions cuts remains a top priority for many in Congress and the administration. Indeed, they have developed a three-headed plan to ensure victory.\The primary option is to pass a cap-and-trade bill in Congress. The House of Representatives has already passed its version; now the Senate is working on its companion. A draft bill written by Sens. John Kerry, D-Mass., and Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., has already been introduced. Now Mr. Kerry, along with Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., are working on a new bill for early 2010. They released a framework of their proposal in time to be presented at the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference.\Which brings us to option No. 2: signing a treaty to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. Mr. Obama's role was to tell the Copenhagen conferees that he will commit the United States to drastic emissions cuts. Though such an agreement would require Senate consent before being legally binding, it demonstrates the ongoing commitment by the administration to their agenda.\The third option: a back-door, nontransparent effort that involves calling on the Environmental Protection Agency to enforce carbon-dioxide emissions cuts through massive regulations. No legislation required. The EPA could bypass elected officials with regulations that would force businesses to shed jobs, move overseas or disappear entirely. EPA bureaucrats could micromanage nearly every aspect of the U.S. economy.\This is not some empty threat. The EPA is aggressively moving forward. A 570-page draft of burdensome regulations has already come out.\This belt-and-suspenders approach is necessary because the public is becoming increasingly aware that the global-warming crisis is no crisis at all, and that the most commonly discussed approaches to reduce carbon emissions won't work and would be prohibitively costly. \The green stimulus being advertised is fallacious and multiple analyses debunk the claim that capping carbon can save the economy and the environment at once.\All the major studies of cap and trade -- from the National Black Chamber of Commerce, the Brookings Institution and the Energy Information Administration, to the Congressional Budget Office, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Massachusetts Institute for Technology and The Heritage Foundation project job and income losses from cap and trade. The studies differ only on the magnitude of these losses.\A recent report by CBO states that cap and trade would hurt the economy by ""reducing households' income ... by reducing real (inflation-adjusted) wages and, thereby, the supply of labor; and by discouraging investment."" In English: It would shrink our wallets and kill our jobs.\What about the environmental benefit? According to climatologist Paul C. Knappenberger, cap and trade would reduce temperatures between 0.1 and 0.2 degrees Celsius by 2100 -- a difference almost too small to measure.\Despite all these setbacks, the carbon-dioxide emissions cutters haven't packed up and gone home. Some went to Copenhagen. Meanwhile, EPA regulators are hard at work and the Senate will again attempt to market cap and trade as a clean-jobs and pollution-reduction bill next year. \Changing the calendar year, though, won't change the adverse economic effects of this environmental clunker."
24,"As an issue in the presidential campaign, the environment is a multi-headed monster, with climate change and energy policy two of its faces. As most environmentalists will tell you, the years of the Bush administration have not been kind to their cause.\This is an administration, after all, led by former oil industry executives. Its energy policy was formed in a secret meeting convened by Vice President Dick Cheney with energy company executives. In the face of changing public opinion, it has moved from being obstructionist on efforts to curb global warming to paying lip service to its reality and the need to meet its challenges.\* * *\But actions speak louder than words. When California wanted to go beyond federal standards in limiting vehicle emissions to cut greenhouse gases, the Environmental Protection Agency refused permission (which stymied the efforts of other states, including Pennsylvania).\This decision confounded a core conservative belief that states should be free to make their own decisions, but it also underscored a defining value of this administration: When it comes to the environment, the conserve in conservative means protecting business interests first.\For the major candidates seeking their party's nomination for president, the environment is another issue that reflects an ideological divide.\* Barack Obama, now the Democratic frontrunner, is a true believer in global warming and he pledges to make combating it one of the top priorities of his administration.\On his Web site, which links energy and the environment, he cites a speech he gave in Des Moines last October in which he called climate change ""one of the greatest moral challenges of our generation."" He supports a market-based cap-and-trade system to reduce carbon emissions 80 percent below 1990 levels by the year 2050.\The senator from Illinois calls for investing $150 billion over 10 years in clean energy, including focusing on the next generation of biofuels and investing in low-emission coal plants. He would seek to change the cars Americans drive and the fossil fuels they burn, encouraging hybrid vehicles and raising fuel efficiency standards. He would require that 25 percent of the energy used in the United States by 2025 comes from clean, sustainable sources such as wind, solar and geothermal.\* Hillary Clinton is very much in tune with her Democratic rival. She too favors a cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions, stronger energy and auto fuel standards and a large increase in funding for green research. She would set up a $50 billion Strategic Energy Fund (to be paid for partly by oil companies) in order to make investments in alternative energy.\She too wants to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent by 2050. She favors renewable energy generating 25 percent of electricity by 2025 and she supports a drive to reduce electricity consumption 20 percent from projected levels by 2020.\The senator from New York is not to be out-wonked on any issue, especially energy and the environment. Her list of goals seems to incorporate every conceivable idea. For example, she would require that all federal buildings designed after Jan. 20, 2009, be zero-emission buildings.\* John McCain is not the darling of conservative elements in his Republican Party -- and his attitude on global warming is one reason. He is not afraid to say that he thinks it is real.\His Web site has a section titled ""Stewards of Our Nation's Rich Natural Heritage"" -- itself an encouraging sign -- which lauds his ""proud record of common sense stewardship"" and ""his commitment to clean air and water and to conserving open space.""\He believes that ""America's economic and environmental interests are not mutually exclusive, but rather inextricably linked. Our economic prospects depend greatly upon the sustainable use of ample and unspoiled natural resources. A clean and healthy environment is well served by a strong economy. History shows that poverty is a poor steward.""\Encouraging stuff, but it is longer on noble intentions than practical details. It's an open question whether the senator from Arizona, as a self-proclaimed conservative, would crack the whip on industries when it needs to be cracked. He supports a market-based cap-and-trade system to achieve limits on greenhouse gas emissions and stands for energy efficiency in general.\* Mike Huckabee clearly isn't worried about global warming, although he does acknowledge a duty for humans to be stewards of the planet. The former governor of Arkansas sees energy independence as a global security issue. He would support oil drilling in some of America's most vulnerable places while at the same time promoting alternative energy sources.\* * *\The environment, in its attendant guises of energy policy and climate change, may not capture as many daily headlines as the war in Iraq and the withering economy. But in the long run a warming planet and a deteriorating environment threaten major trouble.\The Post-Gazette favors bold, aggressive steps to correct past follies and decades of denial. Fortunately, it seems that whoever wins in November will do better than the Bush administration in facing up to the problem."

The Environmental Protection Agency on Monday submitted new standards aimed at reforming the coal industry and curtailing its toxic emissions. As expected, critics of the plan said it will hurt Pennsylvania's coal-related economy, while proponents cheered the positive environmental impacts of the newly proposed standards.
\
According to the EPA, the proposed state-specific emission guidelines are to be followed when states develop plans to address greenhouse gas emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired electric generating units.
\
Pennsylvania is one of the states in the east central region targeted for developing a ""best practices"" Renewal Portfolio Standard via a formula which the EPA quantified the amount of renewable generation in each state, and then summing these amounts for all states in each region to determine a regional starting level of renewable generation prior to implementation of the best practices scenario.
\
That means for Pennsylvania, the EPA would like to set at 1,053 the state's Adjusted Output-Weighted-Average Pounds of carbon dioxide per net kilowatt-hour from all affected fossil fuel-fired electric-generating units. In plainer numbers, the EPA's plan would reduce the state's emissions by 30 percent from 2005 levels, and reduce particle pollution, nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide by 25 percent.
\
Both the Republican Party of Pennsylvania and Gov. Tom Corbett's re-election campaign roundly criticized the proposal, with Pa. GOP Executive Director Rob Gleason terming the proposal ""the latest attack in the war on coal.""
\
""[President] BarackObama and [Democratic Gubernatorial candidate] Tom Wolf will put Pennsylvania's coal jobs at risk no matter the impact on Pennsylvania,"" Gleason said. ""After Washington Democrats failed in their attempt to pass a cap-and-trade law through Congress, President Obama decided to crush one of Pennsylvania's greatest job creators through back-door regulations that will drive up energy costs and threaten jobs....[Monday's] announcement is just the latest sign that Democrats are more concerned about appeasing their liberal special interest groups than fighting for jobs.""
\
The Corbett re-election campaign alleged the cap-and-trade tax is a benchmark of Wolf's agenda.
\
""I'm alarmed that President Obama and Tom Wolf would both support a cap-and-trade tax on our energy sector that would jeopardize over 62,000 Pennsylvania coal jobs,"" Corbett said. ""Pennsylvania is the country's fourth-leading coal producer, and if President Obama and Tom Wolf had their way, they would be handing out pink slips to 62,000 Pennsylvanians.""
\
If a company releases more than the allowed emissions, they could be forced to purchase costly emissions credits, install expensive upgrades, or install a host of other carbon reducing measures all on the backs of consumers.
\
Pennsylvania Coal Alliance CEO John Pippy also voiced stern opposition to the EPA's proposal, predicting the loss of ""thousands"" of direct coal jobs.
\
""This proposal is bad for the economy. We think it's bad for Pennsylvania, and we think it does not achieve any of the environmental goals the president said it would,"" Pippy said in published reports. ""There really isn't any way to [achieve a 30 percent reduction in emissions] with available technology for the current coal fleet to meet that standard, so it's a defacto ban on the existing coal fleet with no way to replace that in a cost-effective manner.""
\
Others aren't so sure. Cliff Majersik, executive director of national energy efficiency think tank Institute for Market Transformation, said coal reform will add efficiency to the sector and would thusly create more jobs driven by cleaner energy.
\
""As President Obama and the EPA recognize, there is great untapped potential in America's buildings to save money, create jobs and improve the economy by reducing energy waste,"" Majersik said. ""Energy efficient policies and technologies are already proven and are deployable now. The new EPA rule can significantly reduce the carbon emissions that contribute to climate change while boosting our economy, creating jobs and securing the freedom for states to manage their own energy portfolios.""
\
State Rep. Steve McCarter, D-154th, member of the state House environmental resources and energy committee, welcomed the EPA's proposal, remarking on the safety and environmental advantages of coal extraction reform.
\
""This announcement by the EPA is an important step toward meaningful action on warming. With the obvious dangers presented by continuing to pump carbon pollution into the atmosphere, I applaud the Obama Administration's attempt to safeguard our environment for us and future generations,"" McCarter said. ""We've made outstanding strides in developing clean energy, and it's time we put more of that innovation to use. By using cleaner energy sources and cutting waste on current energy sources, we can protect the environment four our grandchildren and many more generations to come.""
\
Mayor Michael Nutter, a strong advocate of greening initiatives who has embarked on an ambitious plan to make Philadelphia the greenest city in America, agreed with the Obama Administration and the EPA.
\
""I applaud President Obama and the EPA for taking this important, common-sense approach to reducing carbon pollution nationwide, mitigating harmful greenhouse gas emissions and, ultimately, moving toward a cleaner environment,"" Nutter said. ""The proposal presents states and utilities with flexible compliance options, which will allow states to create a plan that works best for them.
\
""It is my hope that Pennsylvania will develop a strong, tailored approach to meet the new standards by utilizing energy efficiency and clean energy technologies.""
"
26," There has been a great deal of misinformation generated recently about President Bush's Clear Skies Initiative (""Environmentalists Criticize Bush's Plan to Clear the Air,"" Feb. 15). While our administration certainly welcomes a debate over the best way to reach our goal of cleaner air for all Americans, we respectfully suggest that this issue is too important to be decided on anything other than the facts. So here they are:\ * President Bush's Clear Skies Initiative will, over the next decade, achieve substantially greater reductions in air pollution from power plants than are attainable under current law.\ * Clear Skies will reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide by 73 percent, of nitrogen oxides by 67 percent, and of mercury by 69 percent over today's levels.\ * Clear Skies will achieve these reductions more quickly and with greater certainty than under current law.\ * Clear Skies will bring much better results than the current Clean Air Act for nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxides and mercury over the next decade.\ * Clear Skies' mandatory cap and trade approach is modeled on the Acid Rain Trading Program, the most successful clean air program in history, having achieved more tons of pollution reduction than all other 1990 Clean Air Act programs combined.\ * Compliance with the Acid Rain Trading Program is at virtually 100 percent, without the need for litigation that delays results.\ * The Clear Skies' cap and trade approach will not harm air quality in your city or in any other part of the country. In fact, the Clear Skies' stringent caps will improve air quality in every region affected by pollution from power plants.\ * Clear Skies will allow us to achieve historic reductions in air pollution from power plants without causing disruptions to the power supply or sending electricity prices sky-high.\ President Bush's Clear Skies Initiative is a clear winner for all Americans. It will help prevent tens of thousands of asthma attacks, save thousands of lives, and it will again reveal the scenic vistas in our national parks that have been shrouded in haze for too long.\ Clear Skies also recognizes that we don't have to stop progress to stop pollution. Given advances in pollution-controlling technologies, we can protect the health of our environment while also protecting America's economic health.\ I am confident the Congress -- and your readers -- will see the wisdom in the president's Clear Skies Initiative once they see the facts.\ The simple truth is that America's air will be cleaner, sooner and at less cost to consumers under Clear Skies than under the current Clean Air Act. What's at stake is nothing less than a healthy future for us and for our children and grandchildren.\ CHRISTINE TODD WHITMAN\ Administrator\ U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\ Washington, D.C."
27,"
Four years ago, environmental groups hoped Jon Corzine would put the environment high on his list of priorities.
\
Today, many of the same groups say Corzine, now seeking a second term as governor, has failed to live up to his promises and has disappointed them on a range of environmental issues, including open-space preservation and toxic-waste cleanups.
\
His fall from grace in the eyes of environmentalists is in many ways surprising: As a U.S. senator, Corzine won unstinting praise from many advocates, including the League of Conservation Voters, for his voting record and leadership on environmental issues.
\
In addition, Corzine's commissioner at the Department of Environmental Protection, Lisa Jackson, was picked by President Obama to lead the Environmental Protection Agency. And Democrats are traditionally seen as friends of the environment.
\
But it's clear that in 3 1/2 years, Corzine has frustrated environmental advocates.
\
""We think, even after discounting the economic and budget problems that weren't his doing, his record has been overall very disappointing,"" said David Pringle, campaign director of the New Jersey Environmental Federation.
\
In just one sign of environmentalists' displeasure, the New Jersey chapter of the Sierra Club is endorsing independent candidate Chris Daggett in the governor's race, the first time it has backed an independent candidate (although some years the group has not endorsed anyone).
\
""Going in, we had high hopes for this administration, given Gov. Corzine's record as a senator and based on campaign commitments,"" said Jeff Tittel, the group's director. ""We've seen many of those commitments broken. Not only have environmental protections been weakened, but it seems like we're turning the state over to developers and development interests. Unfortunately, Gov. Corzine has not lived up to our expectations.""
\
Critics say Corzine has failed to take the lead on the environmental issues.
\
Four years ago, his environmental platform was praised as one of the most comprehensive ever offered by a gubernatorial candidate in New Jersey; today, the campaign's Web site describes no plan for the environment for the next four years, although one brief page touts what it calls the governor's accomplishments in reducing greenhouse emissions, safeguarding the water supply, and creating a green economy.
\
Asked about its accomplishments for this article, the Corzine administration noted that New Jersey had become the third state to set greenhouse-gas-reduction goals and had enacted the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a cap-and-trade program to reduce carbon emissions.
\
Corzine also counts among his chief achievements a new state energy master plan, whose goals include reducing overall energy use 20 percent by 2020 and having 30 percent of the state's energy consumption come from renewable sources by 2020.
\
Other environmental successes cited by supporters include stopping bear hunting and banning horseshoe crabbing to aid red knots, shorebirds that rely on horseshoe-crab eggs for food during their long migrations.
\
Matt Elliott, clean-energy advocate for Environment New Jersey, said the goals in the energy master plan put New Jersey at the nation's forefront. He praised Corzine for developing the plan but said that, ideally, the plan would include more mandates rather than unenforceable goals.
\
Four years ago, Corzine's Republican opponent, Doug Forrester, accused him of being too close to politically connected developers. For example, Corzine angered some environmentalists when he hired former Cherry Hill Mayor Susan Bass Levin, who was viewed as favoring developers, to lead his first gubernatorial campaign. But environmentalists were won over by Corzine's promises.
\
Today, environmental advocates seem to agree that Corzine has sometimes sided with developers over the environment.
\
One top concern of environmentalists is Corzine's failure to secure a permanent and stable source of funding for open-space preservation. Instead, he has relied on voter approval for borrowing money in bond referendums. Some environmental groups worry that a $400 million bond proposal on the ballot in November could fail because the economy is so bad, jeopardizing the state's open-space programs.
\
Pringle, of the New Jersey Environmental Federation, said several pieces of legislation signed into law by Corzine favored development interests at the expense of the environment.
\
The 2008 Permit Extension Act, for example, extended state and municipal development permits for two extra years, even if they had already expired, to respond to the slowdown in the economy. An ""economic stimulus"" bill approved this year allows developers to receive up to 75 percent of tax revenue created by their projects for up to 20 years, and places a moratorium on a nonresidential-development fee intended to build affordable housing. Critics called both provisions giveaways to developers.
\
Another bill Pringle pointed to would allow polluters to select and pay for private consultants to oversee and clean up contaminated-waste sites. The bill was intended to speed up cleanups, but environmentalists worry it gives polluters and developers too much control.
\
Corzine praises the law as an example of making the DEP more efficient, ""allowing the DEP to focus its resources on sites that pose the greatest risk.""
\
Environmentalists also say Corzine should have taken a stronger stand on the preservation of Petty's Island in the Delaware River. Whereas Forrester called for the 392-acre island, once used by Citgo Petroleum to refine and store petroleum, to be cleaned up and preserved, Corzine refused to come out against development, urging that the island be cleaned up before any decisions were made about its final use.
\
After a proposed development fell through because of the softening real estate market, the state eventually voted to accept the island to be used as a natural preserve.
\
While environmentalists praised the Corzine administration for its work behind the scenes to ink the deal, they argued the governor should have pushed harder for preservation before the development plans fell through.
\
The bottom line, some environmental advocates say, is that Corzine has failed to be an environmental leader.
\
""What we were looking for was leadership, a governor who would take the reins, who would say, 'I will be the one to drive,' "" said Elliott, or Environment New Jersey. ""Instead, it felt more like he took a back seat. The onus was on the environmental community to make things happen.""

28,"As a person with a background in the waste industry, I will be the first to agree that we need to take better care of our planet. I struggle with the fact that the Copenhagen Climate Conference seemed to focus on industrial change, without the commensurate personal habit improvement we so desperately require.\Let's examine the TV ads for all the plastic ""must-have"" widgets that include some ""free bonus item,"" all for just $19.95, or so. They must be selling millions of them to pay for the ads.\Last time I inquired, one could not produce these items using wind and solar. So, pump oil, make plastic and throw it in the landfill -- and then be upset with the landfill guy. I know, as I was one of them.\If what I read about obesity is remotely accurate, the average American is about 30 percent overweight. Using a mass-balance approach (no pun intended), it follows that what results is a 30 percent increase in acreage to grow crops and feed us and the animals we eat, along with the same commensurate consumption of fuel, tires, fertilizer, transportation, processing, packaging, etc. The list seems to be endless. Then, presuming we eat all that extra food, we create 30 percent more human waste and even food scraps. None of this takes into account the consumption of more fuel to haul us around and the early-in-life and frequent doctor and hospital visits that follow. No, one cannot be an overweight environmentalist.\Then scrutinize our desire to purchase things cheaply rather than opt to wait until we can buy something more durable. For example, examine the 15-year roofing shingle. Affordable? Yes. But where does it end up in 15 years, if it lasts that long? Back in the landfill, that's where.\If the material is recycled into asphalt, the replacement function still requires trucks and fuel to transport the old and the new, along with the requisite replacement of the trim, spouting, etc. What would result if we standardized terra cotta and realized a 150-year life span?\Now, open your eyes and visualize the net result over all purchases spread out across the globe, or at least the structures and goods in the developed world. Moreover, with enough pride and discipline, what we are currently building as the standard would last a lot longer with appropriate maintenance. In the alternative, things like ""cap and trade"" and other complicated and clumsy approaches are being touted as the answer. I suggest that these will turn into fertile fields for the legal system, generating loads of paperwork (think cut-down trees) that will somehow attempt to meld science and law, increasing the demand for scientists and engineers that we suffer a shortage of in the first place. My belief is that in the end, this will become a game to be played, justifying some grotesque and little understood series of calculations and computations, with loads of effort expended attempting to shoehorn an industry's plan into some kind of economic benefit. Then, the same industries will necessarily submit these plans to some government agency for review, which will necessarily be followed by incessant revisions to attempt to attain the ghost of compliance. Don't believe me? Then, let's look at what happens with everything we apply for to a government office presently.\My last example is an article about the difference in Great Britain between a popular diesel-powered sedan or small wagon that is slated to come to the U.S. The U.S. version will have 35 additional horsepower to offset the inefficiencies of the automatic transmission and reduce the fuel from 49 MPG to 44. That amounts to an 11.36 percent fuel inefficiency that we can eliminate by teaching at least the new drivers to drive standard shift cars.\Is anybody home? We need not fret about alien invasion as, if they are watching, they will opine, ""Don't waste any ammo. They will self-extinguish!""\Nolan A.

29,"Gov. Tom Wolf recently signed into law a package of commonwealth budget bills for the 2019-2020 fiscal year. These bills are reflective of a governor and legislative leaders who do not prioritize environmental protection. The budget shortchanges the environment in four important areas.\Most importantly, the budget failed to address the chronic understaffing of the Pennsylvania Department of Environment Protection - the state agency charged with enforcing environmental laws. The DEP has suffered almost a 30% reduction in staff since 2002, losing more than 900 positions.\This understaffing has compromised its ability to reduce air and water pollution, regulate oil and gas development, combat climate change, plug abandoned oil and gas wells and protect the Chesapeake Bay.\Consistent with Wolf's budget proposal in February, money was taken from three important environmental funds to pay for general governmental operations in the upcoming fiscal year.\Over $16 million was taken from the Environmental Stewardship Fund - commonly known as the growing greener program. This fund provides monies for farmland preservation, open space protection, abandoned mine reclamation, watershed protection and restoration, water and sewer infrastructure and community parks and recreational facilities.\Ten million dollars was taken from the recycling fund, which supports municipal recycling programs by helping to pay for recycling trucks, processing equipment, staff salaries, composting programs and consumer education.\Almost $70 million was taken from the Oil and Gas Lease Fund, which was created to finance conservation, recreation, dams and flood control projects. A 2017 Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision prohibits using revenue from this fund for any purpose other than conservation. This budget transfer appears blatantly unconstitutional.\None of the above three programs comes anywhere near meeting current demand.\To make matters worse, authority was given to the Legislature to take monies from the Environmental Stewardship Fund and Recycling Fund on a continuing basis and was not limited to just this fiscal year.\The budget also failed to provide Pennsylvania's fair share of funding for the Delaware River Basin Commission. DRBC is an interstate agency charged with, among other things, making sure there is enough clean drinking water for more than 15 million people. The commonwealth's fair share contribution is $893,000 this year, according to the DRBC. The budget provided only $217,000. \Republican legislators have blocked full funding of the DRBC since the Corbett administration in retaliation for the commission's refusal to allow fracking in the Delaware River Basin.\A last-minute provision added by Senate Majority Leader Jake Corman (R-Centre) prohibits the commonwealth and its local governments from regulating plastic bags for one year (just enough time to block it again in next year's budget). Sen. Corman's district includes a plastic bag manufacturing plant owned by Novolex, the world's largest manufacturer of single-use plastic bags. Gov. Wolf vetoed a similar provision in 2017, calling it a violation of the Environmental Rights Amendment to the state constitution. There was no veto this time.\There was some hope that this budget might include legislative authorization for Pennsylvania to join the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. RGGI is a 10-state cap-and-trade program designed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from the electric power sector. Pennsylvania is a major greenhouse gas emitter, and joining RGGI would be perhaps the most important thing the commonwealth could do to curb its emissions. The final budget contained no RGGI language.\Environmental protection fared very poorly in this budget but it was not due to tight fiscal times. Pennsylvania's Independent Fiscal Office recently projected an $866 million budget surplus for the fiscal year that just ended. Moreover this budget will deposit almost $300 million into Pennsylvania's rainy day fund.\Most of these damaging environmental provisions were demanded by Republican budget negotiators and, in the end, Gov. Wolf was not willing to fight hard enough to keep them from happening. For too long, environmental protection has been the bargaining chip Democrats in Pennsylvania have traded to get other things.\It's easy to pay lip service to environmental protection but the critical environmental problems facing our commonwealth won't be addressed in any meaningful way until more people are elected on both sides of the aisle that are truly committed to environmental protection.\State Rep. Greg Vitali (D-Delaware, Montgomery) represents the 166th Legislative District.\Credit: Greg;Vitali - State Rep.

30,"In taking President Barack Obama to task for a lack of leadership on climate change, former Vice President Al Gore has expressed the frustration of many who care about the environment. His comments were largely on target, but in Mr. Obama's defense, parsing the blame isn't easy. The situation is complicated.\Mr. Gore seems to understands that. His criticism, made deep into a long article in Rolling Stone magazine, was prefaced by an expression of ""enormous empathy"" for the president who came to office amid ""incredible challenges."" He acknowledged that the president has tried to lessen the nation's dependence on fossil fuels and understands the link between environmental security, economic security and national security.\Then came the sting: ""... in spite of these and other achievements, President Obama has thus far failed to use the bully pulpit to make the case for bold action on climate change,"" he wrote. ""After successfully passing his green stimulus package, he did nothing to defend it when Congress decimated its funding. After the House passed cap-and-trade, he did little to make passage in the Senate a priority.""\This criticism could also be leveled at the general management style of a president who has been passionate and assertive at times and cool and detached at others, an unhelpful tendency seen in the health care debate.\But is the political antipathy to action on climate change all Mr. Obama's fault? Or has the silence of the bully pulpit been merely a reflection of changed political realities, mirroring the verdict of the American people in the midterm elections?\Mr. Gore is himself not immune to charges of poor leadership. He did not become president, of course, but he has had his own bully pulpit, thanks to winning a share of the Nobel Peace Prize for pushing the climate change cause. Yet for all his advocacy, he has become more useful to his critics as a risible stock character who serves to personify the alleged deficiencies of the scientific argument for climate change -- and never mind that the scientific consensus is overwhelmingly on his side.\In the Rolling Stone article, Mr. Gore concedes the political difficulties and the effectiveness of the massed opposition to doing anything about climate change, even to the extent of denying the problem.\That the environmental cause has lost the argument on climate change is clear from what is happening in Congress, where the Republican Party has repeatedly mounted radical attacks against the Environmental Protection Agency (founded under a Republican president, Richard M. Nixon, and as vital now to combating greenhouse gases and other pollution as it was when Americans were shocked to see Ohio's Cuyahoga River catch on fire).\Just last week, the Republican-led House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee advanced a bill -- HR 2018 -- to gut the EPA's power to regulate states under the federal Clean Water Act, a witch's brew that blends states' rights and environmental contempt. But it's not just Republicans who are to blame; to his shame, Rep. Jason Altmire, D-McCandless, is one of the bill's co-sponsors and voted for it in committee.\Whether or not Mr. Obama created the vacuum that invites such assaults, this hot-and-cold-running president should take Mr. Gore's friendly criticism seriously. The climate deniers and pollution enablers have seriously overplayed their hand. At a time when something weird is clearly going on with the weather, Americans may now be in the mood to cheer if the president mounts the bully pulpit anew to give the environmental bullies heck."
31,"Lock Haven has enrolled a 5,200-acre parcel of its forested watershed in a fledgling Nature Conservancy program that provides landowners with sustainable forestry certification and revenue from carbon offset markets.\The Clinton County property in north-central Pennsylvania, which contains native brook trout streams in a large swath of contiguous hardwood forest in a ridge and valley landscape, is the second property in the state to enroll in the conservancy's Working Woodlands program.\The first was Bethlehem, in Northampton and Lehigh counties near Pennsylvania's eastern border, which agreed April 2011 to protect 22,000 acres of forest in the watershed where it gets its drinking water.\The conservancy program is designed to pay property owners' up-front costs for certification and forest management planning while providing financial benefits from sale of Forest Stewardship Council-certified forest products and carbon offsets. Only forests larger than 250 acres are eligible.\Wood from FSC-certified forests brings higher prices than noncertified wood. And owners of forests that sequester carbon can receive payments from carbon emitting industries.\Josh Parrish, director of land conservation for the conservancy's Pennsylvania chapter, said carbon credit market prices vary by forest type, condition and size but Bethlehem and Lock Haven will get $10 to $20 per acre annually. The carbon credit sales are handled by Blue Source, a program partner and international broker of greenhouse gas offset credits.\""Basically the property owner is getting a reward for managing their forests in a manner that is beneficial to the environment, wildlife and forest health, and for sequestration of greenhouse gases,"" Mr. Parrish said.\Forests can sequester and store carbon by absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through the photosynthesis. Emissions of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, contribute to man-made climate change.\Mr. Parrish said buyers of carbon credits now are voluntarily offsetting their businesses' carbon footprint, but California is about to begin a carbon cap-and-trade program in which Pennsylvania forest owners, as well as those from other states, can participate.\He said discussions are under way with owners of approximately 100,000 acres about participation in the Working Woodlands program. The conservancy eventually hopes to expand it to cover 300,000 acres throughout Pennsylvania and has targeted public water suppliers, family forests and social and hunting clubs as likely participants because they own large tracts of forest land.\The agreement announced last week will help protect the public water source for Lock Haven and surrounding communities while improving forest management, said June Houser, chair of the Lock Haven City Authority.\""Our primary mission is to supply the highest quality drinking water to the customers,"" said Ms. Houser, quoted in a Nature Conservancy news release. ""Preserving the pristine quality of our watershed properties supports this mission.""\Bill Kunze, state director of the conservancy's Pennsylvania chapter, said it supports ""working forests"" in Pennsylvania and around the world.\""Harnessing the power of markets,"" Mr. Kunze said, ""in service to the long-term ecological and economic health of our forests can yield so much benefit for both people and nature."""

The United States is the only modern nation to not have a formal energy policy. We, unlike a leader of the world, have been going willy-nilly on issues related to our energy needs, which also affect our environmental conditions. Since the uplifting of the Environmental Protection Agency by the Nixon administration, we have been debating, accusing and falsely predicting what should be done and what has happened. Is there climate change?
\
Of course, something is changing. All things have changed, but just what that change is becomes the big mystery and controversy. One of the earliest government officials to talk about climate change was Thomas Jefferson when he noted the shortness of Virginia winters replete with shorter ice jams in the rivers and smaller and fewer blizzards. He seriously wondered about this.
\
We could be further along In this if we would stop the accusatory discussions and threats of destruction. The environmental extremists want us to relinquish our manufacturing prowess and become a service economy. They want us to transfer all of our industry abroad like that isn't going to have a negative impact on our economy or our national security. Remember it was our manufacturing clout (thanks to great entrepreneurs like Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, etc.) that saved us in World War II. We out-built Germany and Japan to create more weapons and our access to oil sealed our victory.
\
In the end, our foes ran out of gas - literally - and we were victorious. From that experience we became the leader of the world and I find no reason to relinquish that title. If we come together and designed a great energy policy that will address climate change we can maintain our leadership and security. I say let's get it on.
\
A good energy policy model is the nation of Brazil. Our board of directors had the privilege to visit Brazil back in 1999 and get a thorough briefing and demonstration on their strategy. We visited Electrobras, Petrobras, coal and steel plants, professors, universities and government and elected officials. Brazil was taking all forms of energy into its arsenal and developing them under the goal of self-sufficiency and national security.
\
Today, after 10 years, this nation is clearly independent and self-sufficient. If they don't import a drop of oil, they can last on their own reserves for at least 12 years. They have developed the most successful ethanol production in the world through the use of sugar cane and the technology of our own Ford Motor Co. They have three nuclear facilities now with nine more in the process. Keep in mind that nuclear energy is the safest and cleanest (zero carbon emissions).
\
Their partnership with Angola and other off-shore drilling brings in much natural gas and oil. Their coal and steel facilities operate and somehow generate very little carbon emissions. Their steel and coal cities have clear skies above them.
\
What this nation of 170 million people (48 percent Black) has done is just an example of what we can do if our Congressional participants and the White House got their act together. Right now we have a 1,100-page document known as the Waxman/Markey Energy Bill that doesn't even mention nuclear facilities or offshore exploration. It is concentrating on Wall Street hustles, taxations and disabling our manufacturing prowess. It is more concerned about making money and not addressing our energy needs and cleaning up the world environment. Why?
\
A big disappointment is the avarice in the goals of General Electric and other Wall Street entities. GE builds windmills, which would play a role in alternative energy. This is fine but it is also limited to certain areas of the nation (Rocky Mountain States and New England) and cannot cover our energy needs by itself. Still, GE supports this stupid bill simply for its own balance sheet and personal revenue.
\
Also, it joins with Wall Street speculators to seize the opportunity of ""Cap and Trade."" This style of swaps, derivatives and arbitrage was actually invented by Ken Lay and his Enron cronies. They made billions when Europe tried the ""Cap and Trade"" mess. Today, Europe suffers from less manufacturing and no improvement to its or the world's environment.
\
Finally, there is the big myth of ""green jobs."" Listen, there are no green jobs, and whenever I ask an authority to explain what green jobs are, they cannot give me an answer. It is just hyperbole. The former green jobs czar Van Jones would Just astound me with all that rhetoric and not an ounce of substance in explaining green jobs. ""Good paying green jobs?""
\
Maybe they are at a nuclear facility where the average salary is $150,000 per year. Let's put that in Cleveland, St. Louis, etc. That would be for real. We don't have to destroy ourselves to improve the world, just plan better.

33,"
With his political party firmly in control of Congress, President Obama devoted his first two years in office to several massive regulatory schemes that would bring whole sectors of the economy under the control of the federal government for the first time in history.
\
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which passed only after several reluctant lawmakers were plied with giveaways to their states, placed fully 17 percent of the US economy in the hands of the Department of Health and Senior Services.
\
Not only does Obamacare mandate that every single American purchase health insurance, an exotic notion that recently was ruled unconstitutional, but it regulates out of existence basic plans that now cover millions of Americans. It mandates expensive new coverages. It regulates doctors, hospitals and insurers. It fines and regulates employers. And it establishes a board of un-elected functionaries who now have the power to ration medical care.
\
Is it any wonder that barely a year after the law was passed more than a thousand companies and unions, including some of the president's biggest supporters, have applied for and received waivers?
\
The public backlash against Obamacare was so intense that Congress quickly abandoned another of the president's goals -- a vast expansion of environmental regulations. The proposal, called Cap and Trade, would have imposed a complicated system of penalties and credits aimed at driving up the cost of energy. Why do that, in heaven's name?
\
It is a central doctrine of environmentalism that energy from fossil fuels, like Pennsylvania coal and natural gas, is a danger to the world. Despite that carbon emissions have dropped sharply in the past two decades because of technology, and despite that carbon is a natural element found everywhere in the environment, the academic left from which President Obama comes is fervently devoted to the proposition that our entire energy system must be replaced by new, ""green"" technologies even if they don't yet exist. Cap and Trade is explicitly designed to force Americans to use less energy.
\
But with the economy on the ropes and energy prices soaring, the president's allies in Congress were willing to go no farther. No matter. The president would merely regulate what he was unable to legislate. So last year, the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) declared that carbon emissions were a dangerous substance that could be regulated by the federal government.
\
It's the first time in history that a federal agency has been able to assume so much power over the economy without congressional approval. Since then the rules have been tumbling out of the EPA as fast as it can write them, and they make virtually every function of life, from running a small business to turning on a light switch, more expensive for every American. Indeed, there are currently 330 new regulations under consideration right now in the EPA, and every one of them would have an impact of $100 million or more on the economy.
\
But there's more. The other agencies of the Obama administration are also busy writing new rules affecting nearly every commercial activity. They would affect our food choices, our financial lives, our farmers and even the basic renovations that we make to our homes. Nothing is beyond the reach of the federal government.
\
Small businesses pay the heaviest price to comply with these rules. According to the Small Business Administration (SBA), mom-and-pop businesses pay 60 percent more to meet federal standards than larger corporations. In fact, according to the SBA, the cost exceeds $10,500 per year, per employee. It's no surprise, then, that small businesses are extremely reluctant to hire new workers even if they can because of the cloud of uncertainty that billows out of Washington these days.
\
The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), which is the country's largest advocate for small businesses with more than 14,000 members in Pennsylvania, has embarked on a nationwide campaign to educate Americans on the effects of regulations. It is joined by dozens of other groups representing important industries that are also concerned about the country's direction.
\
It's important for Pennsylvanians to consider that every new rule from Washington comes with a cost.
\
Those costs destroy jobs, raise prices and encourage lawsuits. What's worse, the regulations very often fail completely to improve public health, the environment, workplace safety or anything else. Our representatives in Washington should be reminded that Pennsylvania's economic future depends on a healthy, efficient private sector, and that before they approve new burdens, they should ensure that the rules are actually necessary and founded in science.
\

36,"By Rep. Joe Pitts / Special to the Sunday News\About 8.8 percent of Pennsylvania's workforce is unemployed. Nationally, nearly one in ten workers is unemployed. All of us know people who have lost their jobs and are struggling to pay their bills. This is the real face of the recession, and Congress has done a poor job addressing it.\At the start of the year, Congress passed a $787 billion ""stimulus"" bill, which President Obama promised would create or save 3 million jobs. I doubted it at the time, and I'm sorry to say that I was right. For that amount of money, the government could simply have given 3 million people $262,000 each. It is indeed a huge amount of money. If you spent $1 million every day, seven days a week, it would take more than 2,000 years to reach the price of the ""stimulus"" bill. Sadly, much of that colossal sum has been spent on corporate welfare, state government bailouts and pet projects. Apparently forgotten, the unemployed are still out of work. Unemployment has only increased, and is projected to keep climbing.\If the ""stimulus"" didn't work, what should we have done? That's a fair question to me and other critics of the president's spending. To answer that, we have to be clear about where jobs come from in the first place and why they disappear when times get bad.\Frame's Motor Freight is a 140-year-old trucking company in Chester County. It was founded in 1870 when freight was still hauled in wagons pulled by horses. Frame's announced in September that it was going out of business. The reason? West Chester's Daily Local News reported that Bud Temple, Frame's owner, said the sour economy was ""part"" of the reason, ""as well as the rising cost of insurance, the cost of fuel and the overcapacity of the trucking companies compared to the amount of freight that needs to be hauled.""\Running a successful business is difficult. Every business wants to grow and add jobs, but to do so they must first navigate a long list of obstacles: taxes, liability insurance, regulation, the costs of things like fuel and raw materials and competition.\Short of hiring more postal workers and park rangers, the government cannot simply ""create"" new jobs. What it can do is make it easier, or harder, for businesses to prosper and hire. I'm sorry to say the actions of Congress and the White House this year have provided a strong disincentive to adding jobs.\The national energy tax or ""cap-and-trade"" bill passed by the House; the current push for federally run, regulated, and mandated health insurance; and the expiration of the 2001 tax cuts are the political equivalents of standing on Main Street with a bullhorn shouting: ""Do not hire!"" Each throws gasoline on the fire of unemployment.\When the ""cap-and-trade"" bill was introduced, a bipartisan majority of the Pennsylvania Utilities Commission sent a memo to Congress warning, ""We are far from convinced that the negative impacts this legislation could have on our state's economy are fully understood."" They predicted the bill could cost the Commonwealth 66,000 jobs as the price of electricity shoots up. (Go to www.house.gov/pitts to see my ideas for protecting the environment through clean energy.)\The health ""reform"" bill the House may soon pass would give struggling businesses a Hobson's choice between offering a benefit they can't presently afford or paying an 8 percent payroll tax they can't afford either. Either way, many will be forced to lay off workers to comply. (H.R. 859, which I introduced with New York Democrat Nydia Velazquez, provides a better way for small employers to provide insurance.) The bill also does absolutely nothing to reign in frivolous and excessive litigation, keeping insurance costs high and preventing job creation.\In 2001, Congress reduced taxes for every American -including those wealthy enough to start and expand businesses and create jobs. Eager for more money to spend, Congress and the president plan to let those tax cuts expire next year. This will amount to the largest single tax increase in American history and create yet another strong disincentive to entrepreneurship and job creation.\Jobs are not created by government. Prosperity isn't either. Jobs and prosperity are created by risk-taking entrepreneurs, successful businesses and hardworking Americans who take pride in what they do.

When people want jobs done, I'll be ready. When the upswing comes, I'll be there.""\That's the kind of optimism and risk taking that made America into an economic powerhouse. That's also the kind of forward-thinking entrepreneurship that will lead us out of recession and back to full employment.

37,"Left-wing advocacy group MoveOn.org recently launched a new effort to oppose innovations that are propelling states like Pennsylvania toward a new abundance of locally produced energy. Not only is this helping to fuel America's manufacturing renaissance, but it is also helping to make the United States more competitive in the international energy market, advancing our nation's energy independence and keeping Pennsylvania residents warm in the recent harsh winter weather.\Unfortunately, this anti-development group is pushing activists to work to ban fracking in their local communities, without regard for the benefits that this critical energy resource is doing to help consumers across Pennsylvania and the nation. What are the benefits that would be taken away if Marcellus Shale production was threatened?\Let's start with the environment. According to the International Energy Agency, the United States is leading all developed nations in reducing our carbon footprint since 2006. In fact, increased use of natural gas for electricity generation has led to a 20-year low in U.S. carbon emissions -- without a federal or international carbon tax or cap and trade scheme. While it is important to understand that every energy source, including natural gas, has an impact on the environment, it is increasingly clear that our nation's shale revolution is improving our environment while bolstering our economy.\Speaking of the economy, according to the state Department of Labor, Marcellus Shale development supports over 239,000 Pennsylvania jobs across a range of sectors, from construction and manufacturing to real estate and hospitality. Even more importantly, these are good-paying jobs that are supporting middle-class families in our communities.\But shale development provides more than work for Pennsylvania residents; it also has spurred investment in our communities and families. Gov. Corbett's recently unveiled Energy = Jobs Energy Plan estimates that the oil and gas industries will inject more than $14 billion in investment into the Keystone State's economy by 2020.\Last year, the natural gas industry sent Pennsylvania landowners $1.2 billion in royalty payments, and the state's largest natural gas utilities have saved ratepayers $3,200 each over the past four years through rate reductions. In addition, legislation that Gov. Corbett signed into law in 2012 authorizing impact fees for shale development has resulted in $400 million in revenue in the last two years -- on top of the $1.8 billion in state taxes that the natural gas industry has paid since 2008.\These opportunities are transforming lives for people across the state. Reversing this investment into our communities could be devastating to families across the state and region.\Finally, there is benefit to Pennsylvania's consumers. Recently, The Associated Press found that about two-thirds of Pennsylvanians who heat their homes with natural gas went into the winter season paying the lowest prices in a decade for this time of year, according to rate information from the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission.\Utilities credit the huge volume of gas being produced from the Marcellus Shale formation underneath Pennsylvania for pushing down prices. In most cases, prices this past December were less than half of what they were in December 2008, when the shale boom was just beginning.\Consumer Energy Alliance has long supported expanded use of natural gas as part of a comprehensive energy policy. It is clear that the use of natural gas has helped lower consumer prices and significantly reduced greenhouse gas emissions. For these reasons, the alliance supports the safe production of natural gas through sound development of the Marcellus Shale formation's abundant resources. The Keystone State is uniquely positioned for economic growth for many future generations, and its future should not hang in the balance of potential fracking bans or moratoriums.\That's why we recently asked the co-sponsors of the Statewide Natural Gas Drilling Moratorium Act to withdraw their support for the bill. As a co-sponsor of this potentially harmful legislation, we ask that Sen. Lisa Boscola, D-Northampton, abandon her support of any moratorium legislation or proposals that would ban Marcellus Shale development.\We can all agree that the benefits of properly regulated shale development are too great to sacrifice. These resources can be developed responsibly, so we do not need to choose between either the environment or energy development -- we can have both. Our children deserve a beautiful environment and good economic opportunities. Pennsylvania shale development can bring both! Sen. Boscola, please join CEA and a majority of Pennsylvanians who, according to a recent Franklin Marshall College poll, support the safe development of shale resources in the state.\Mike Butler is executive director of the Consumer Energy Alliance-Mid Atlantic.\Credit: Mike Butler Special to The Morning Call - Freelance\Credit: Mike Butler Special to The Morning Call - Freelance"
38,"WASHINGTON -- In the aftermath of what President Barack Obama called a ""shellacking"" for Democrats, focus Wednesday turned to what the end of one-party rule means for the nation.\With many observers forecasting gridlock, as the Republicans will take control of the House and pick up at least six Senate seats come January, leaders from both parties cast themselves as bipartisan.\""On the policy front, I think the most important thing is to say that we're not going to rule out ideas because they're Democrat or Republican; we want to just see what works,"" Mr. Obama said at a White House news conference. ""And ultimately, I'll be judged as president as to the bottom line: results.""\Mr. Obama singled out an earmarks ban proposed by Virginia Rep. Eric Cantor, who's in line to become the House Majority Leader behind Speaker-in-waiting John Boehner of Ohio, as one area of agreement for the parties. Mr. Cantor himself struck a tone of humility on CBS's ""Early Show.""\""It isn't necessarily a vote of confidence for Republican leadership,"" he said. ""So we've got a job to do. We've been given a second chance and a golden opportunity to prove that we, as Republicans, are committed to a constitutionally limited government.""\But neither side was willing to cede much ground. Mr. Obama refused to back down from the major policies of his first two years in office, saying that the unsteady economy drove so many Democrats out of office.\""If right now we had 5 percent unemployment instead of 9.6 percent unemployment, then people would have more confidence in those policy choices,"" the president said.\Mr. Boehner, meanwhile, in his election night speech, maintained his insistence on repealing the health care law -- an exercise that would face a sure veto from the president.\Rep. Tim Murphy, R-Upper St. Clair, said a ""realistic approach"" would not be a repeal but a series of changes for the health care law, which Mr. Murphy criticizes for its expensive price tag and heavy burden on businesses.\""The success of this, of any agenda, is going to depend on people working together,"" said Mr. Murphy, who touted his own bipartisan record that includes a recent bill authorizing the administration to penalize China for its apparently devalued currency.\""If it just becomes standing on a soapbox and making speeches, then it gets no results.""\Rep. Jason Altmire, D-McCandless, a centrist who narrowly survived the anti-incumbent wave in part by voting against the health care bill and other Democratic priorities, said the new Republican House caucus will have a choice to make between the more conservative, tea party-favored members and the rest of the caucus.\""It will take some time just because this is a group of people who are coming in who are incredibly diverse politically,"" Mr. Altmire said. ""They're going to have a civil war. They're going to have to figure out what they're going to do as a party.""\He compared this election to 1994, when Republicans took control of Congress and ended up working with then-President Bill Clinton on such initiatives as welfare reform.\""It took about a year to break from the partisanship,"" said Mr. Altmire, a congressional staffer at the time. ""But once they did, they did some good things.""\An early test will come before most of the new members have taken their seats. In a lame-duck session set to begin next week, Congress is scheduled to take up an extension of the Bush tax cuts, which are set to expire at year's end. Mr. Obama and Democratic leaders want to extend them for households making less than $250,000; Republicans want them extended for everyone.\In his news conference, Mr. Obama said he was ""absolutely"" willing to negotiate the terms of the extension.\Other possible areas of common ground next year include education and energy policy. Mr. Altmire said the cap-and-trade bill to put a price on carbon emissions failed because it became more focused on areas of disagreement between the two parties -- global warming and the environment -- rather than the universally recognized need for energy independence.\Mr. Altmire -- a member of the Blue Dog Democratic caucus that is all but dead now, having lost half its members and with its party in the minority -- also said there was a lot to agree on in the Republicans' platform of fiscal restraint.\""I think everyone agrees: Reduce spending and cut the deficit,"" he said. ""They don't get into a whole lot of specifics on how to do that, but I think we can find a whole lot of common ground on that issue, as a lot of us did.""\In the Senate, Democrats will retain a slimmer majority, and a slew of new members -- including Pennsylvania Republican Pat Toomey -- will shift the institution to the right.\Sen. Bob Casey, a Democrat who was not on the ballot this year, said he had played phone tag with Mr. Toomey on Wednesday, but their staffs were already discussing a transition, and he looked forward to working with Mr. Toomey on issues of importance to the state.\Mr. Casey, who campaigned hard in the final days for Pennsylvania's Democrats, most of whom ended up losing, said the problem with the party's agenda was not one of substance, but one of messaging: Democrats didn't communicate well enough, he said, about the benefits of their policies, which are still being implemented, and voters weren't seeing a difference amid a sputtering economy.\And with two-party rule now a fact of life, Mr. Casey said Democrats and Republicans will work together because, in order to address voters' paramount concerns, they must.\""A lot of things changed [Tuesday] night with the shift in power,"" he said.\""But there's one thing that didn't change, and that's the job situation and the economic situation that we face. And that's a bipartisan obligation, to take every step you can to create and preserve jobs and incentivize the creation of jobs. And whether you're Democrat or Republican, I think that's the case."""

Early in December. the United Nations hosted a climate change conference in Copenhagen. The global summit was held as a follow-up to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol in Japan.
\
Recognizing that not everyone believes global warming is a reality despite the science that has been gathered to support such theories, the question arises: Why have so many countries pledged their support to prevent global warming?
\
Nations around the globe have come together to discuss this topic and identify what alternatives are available for our planet as global temperatures continue to rise. The U.N. is demonstrating its commitment by setting up an operating fund for richer nations to contribute billions of dollars to help poorer countries deal with the effects of global warming.
\
The United States led the U.N. conference in developing a global accord that not only acknowledges the issue of global warming but develops a key framework on how to proceed so carbon emissions can be reduced and global warming prevented.
\
Although much evidence and scientific data have been gathered, people disagree on whether global warming is an issue or not. Ultimately, time will tell.
\
Those who believe global warming is real and man-made have advanced strong scientific arguments that climate change is endangering our planet and humans as a species. Others believe that mankind cannot have an effect on the environment that is permanent or lasting, especially on a global level. Each side has its dyed-in-the-wool advocates.
\
As much as this may be a philosophical discussion for the hosey or local club, it has nevertheless become a real concern for 193 countries that were represented at the Copenhagen conference. Rather than try to resolve the debate, a more appropriate response for all would be to reflect more profoundly on how it may impact us at the local level. A primary example on whether or not human activity can have an effect on the environment is clearly demonstrated on a regional level here in the anthracite region.
\
Anthracite mining clearly validates the fact that man can have a major impact on the environment and our planet. In looking at the area comprised of Carbon, Columbia, Dauphin, Luzerne, Lackawanna, Northumberland and Schuylkill counties, one need only look to the devastation of our rivers, streams and tributaries to see what type of impact man can have on his own environment.
\
Many regulatory controls are now in place to prevent such environmental impacts due to mining, and these controls have limited the negative impact. Those of us who live in this region can attest to the impact our activities have had on the environment.
\
One need only look at the nearest orange stream, high walls and waste coal banks for the answers. Global warming is a result of man's continuing activities on a planetary level which, along with natural events, contribute to the overall warming of the planet.
\
It will be another 20 to 40 years until we know who is right. By that time, we may be past the tipping point if the global warming theorists are correct. If they are not correct, then we continue on without concern for the future of the world. Climate change is like the proverbial Sword of Damocles hanging over our generation's head with impending and ever-present danger for believers and non-believers alike.
\
What consequences can we expect at local levels? How may we benefit or lose from the scenarios now being promulgated by a worldwide scientific body? Can our area actually take advantage of the current set of circumstances being promulgated on climate diplomacy by the U.N.?
\
These are very complex questions, and they require a fundamental understanding of the political forces that are now driving the Copenhagen Accord. A good basis for this understanding can be found in a recent discussion by leading climatologist Dr. James Hansen on Democracy NOW. Dr. Hansen, considered one of our nation's leading climate scientists, heads the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies.
\
Hansen's interview is a thoughtful and insightful discussion on global warming, the science behind it and what the outcomes of the Copenhagen Accord mean. Hansen is not totally in agreement with the U.S. approach currently circulating through Congress on a cap-and-trade carbon emissions policy. He believes that a tax on carbon would be a better policy that would have a more immediate and lasting impact.
\
Cap-and-trade is essentially an environmental policy tool. In its simplest form, it requires a mandatory cap on the amount of carbon dioxide that can be released into the atmosphere by power plants and other entities that emit carbon into the atmosphere. The trade component is based on permits issued to each company or generator of carbon with an allowable limit.
\
Companies that exceed limits must buy emission credits from other companies or sources that pollute less and have excess credits to trade or sell. A carbon tax would require that any generator of carbon be taxed for each metric ton of carbon generated by the polluter. As any casual observer can see, either policy is going to have major impact on companies that emit pollutants into the atmosphere and the U.S. economy.
\
Anyone who is interested should consider taking a few moments to go to Democracy NOW to view Hansen's interview and discussion on this very thorny subject. The video can be found at:http://www.democracynow.org/2009/12/22/leading_climate_scientist_james_hansen_on.

CLEARING THE RECORD, PUBLISHED SEPTEMBER 1, 2009, FOLLOWS: A story Friday about Carbon Finite, a new company in Wayne, incorrectly stated the job title of Sean Carney, who is vice president of carbon finance.
\
Scott Nissenbaum doesn't consider himself a tree hugger. But his appreciation for a leafy canopy goes well beyond shade.
\
In the stands of elms, cottonwoods, maples, birches, and pines that help form the 747 million acres of U.S. forestland, he sees profit.
\
Not in helping landowners cut trees down for sale as lumber. But in helping them continue to nurture their woods and make money off the carbon sequestered there - the carbon dioxide taken up through photosynthesis and stored in the trees' trunks, branches, foliage, and roots.
\
The national push for climate-change initiatives, coupled with falling timber prices and a growing demand for protecting and regenerating forests for the good of the environment, has helped create ""a tidal wave of momentum"" in the forest-carbon market, Nissenbaum said.
\
He hopes to ride that wave to profitability while doing something good for the environment through Finite Carbon, the Wayne company Nissenbaum, formerly with Novitas Capital, founded in February with another venture capitalist, Robert Verratti.
\
Until April 2007, Verratti headed Wayne-based Traffic.com Inc., a commercial supplier of digitally gathered traffic data. He is Finite Carbon's chief executive officer; Nissenbaum is its president.
\
The company helps owners of forestland determine the carbon-capture value, if any, of their towering assets and provides the capital to finance the expensive, complex, and time-consuming process of evaluating, registering, marketing, and selling those carbon offsets.
\
That cost is typically close to $200,000, but could exceed $1 million on tracts of more than 100,000 acres, Nissenbaum said.
\
Largely untested in the United States, forest-carbon offsets are a source of concern among environmentalists. They worry offsets will be overused or abused, with credits going to owners who were not considering clear-cutting or whose land does not matter much in the overall national carbon footprint.
\
There is also concern that trading carbon credits will supplant what environmentalists really want - a full-scale assault on greenhouse-gas emissions.
\
""It can't be looked at as a silver bullet,"" said Nathan Willcox, an energy and clean-air expert for PennEnvironment, a nonprofit advocacy group. ""We need to be cutting global-warming pollution at its source, versus just finding new places to put the pollution once it's created.""
\
Finite Carbon is believed to be the first company of its kind, in that it offers one-stop forest-carbon shopping - from conducting property inventories, project design, and verification management to funding tree measuring and carbon modeling; paying transfer, registration, and brokerage fees; and hiring any other experts needed to convert captured carbon into revenue for the property owner.
\
Not that forest carbon is a monster-size industry.
\
In the carbon-offset market, forestry ""is either small or, in people's minds, doesn't exist,"" Nissenbaum said. So far, Finite Carbon reports having evaluated nearly two million acres for ""several dozen"" owners throughout the United States, including in Maine, Alaska, and Texas.
\
A few years from now, Nissenbaum said, forest-carbon trading could reach more than $1 trillion - especially if U.S. cap-and-trade legislation is passed, establishing a mandatory national market.
\
In a cap-and-trade system, government sets a limit on the release of certain pollutants, allowing companies that would have difficulty reducing emissions to buy credits from those that can.
\
Citing confidentiality provisions, Finite Carbon would not disclose whether its work had resulted in sales of carbon credits.
\
Europe has had a cap-and-trade system since 2005. Its entire traded-carbon market was $120 billion in 2008, Nissenbaum said. ""The world has really made a determination that climate change is real, that it's a true hazard to the population.""
\
Sequestration is considered among the least expensive ways of limiting carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. That, along with weak demand for timber, has prompted owners to pursue monetizing their forestland's carbon-sequestration value, especially in the United States.
\
The European carbon market ""has really ignored forestry,"" Nissenbaum said.
\
At least 1,000 acres, preferably more than 5,000, are considered necessary to make carbon sequestration ""financially feasible,"" he said.
\
Tree sizes and types also are factors.
\
On Finite Carbon's staff of seven is Matt Delaney, a 10-year veteran of forest-carbon monitoring, who ""spends a lot of time . . . measuring the trees,"" Nissenbaum said. The data are fed to Sterling Griffin, a professional forester, who creates models of the land's carbon-sequestration potential for third-party verification and regulatory approval.
\
Large utilities are often buyers, looking to snap up carbon credits in anticipation of cap-and-trade legislation's passage and a rise in the cost of credits, said Sean Carney, Finite Carbon's vice president of project development.
\
Hedge funds and multinational firms also view carbon credits as promising investments, he said.
\
What's missing is a national market that would put a price on carbon. The American Clean Energy and Security Act, which the U.S. House passed in June and is awaiting Senate action, would do that.
\
Currently, prices on voluntary-compliance markets such as the national Climate Action Reserve and regional markets such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative vary widely, from 40 cents per ton of carbon offsets to nearly $6.50 per ton.
\
""While the presence of a mandatory national market would create the greatest opportunity for Finite Carbon, the company's success is not dependent on it,"" Nissenbaum said.
\
Worth noting, he said, is that the interests of Finite Carbon and its clients are aligned. Rather than charge a fee, the company gets a percentage of the forest-carbon offsets after a project is registered and approved. The cut is based on such things as the number of acres and their location, the carbon stocks, and the type and number of landowners.
\
""Not only do we have a vested interest in the success of the project, our compensation comes from monetization at the end,"" Nissenbaum said.
\
In the environmental community, meaningful payoff is reducing global warming. At PennEnvironment, Willcox's reaction to credits granted in any cap-and-trade system is decidedly mixed.
\
""How do you ensure that the forest-carbon industry doesn't become another Wall Street, whereby forest owners are getting credit for pollution reductions not actually achieved, due to loopholes in the system?"" he asked.
\
Carney, a former broker at CantorCO2e, an emissions-brokerage subsidiary of Cantor Fitzgerald L.P., insisted Finite Carbon's motives are as much about protecting the environment as they are about making money.
\
""We're here to do well, by doing good,"" he said.

\
A Primer on Cap-and-Trade
\
""Cap-and-trade"" is another name for emissions trading - a method of controlling greenhouse gases by creating a market for permits to pollute.
\
The government sets
\
a hard limit - the cap - on emissions and grants allowances to regulated emitters of gases such
\
as carbon dioxide. Industries that need more allowances trade for them from companies that have an excess.
\
Under legislation passed by the U.S. House and awaiting action in the Senate, the cap would gradually be reduced to achieve a 3 percent reduction of 2005 emissions levels by 2012 and an 83 percent reduction by 2050.

"
41,"WASHINGTON -- Senate climate change legislation took a step forward yesterday, but a move by Democrats to bypass Republicans in the environment committee could result in a political setback.\Environment and Public Works Committee Chair Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., called for a vote to move the bill from committee despite a Republican boycott of the process. By committee rules, senators could not amend the bill, but Senate rules allow a majority of members to move a bill out of committee.\Republicans have called the move ""the nuclear option.""\Led by Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., they boycotted committee meetings this week and demanded more analysis of the economic impacts of the bill by the Environmental Protection Agency. They said the agency's projections were too optimistic and did not consider enough scenarios.\EPA said a more complete analysis would take five weeks. Democrats said the request was a stall tactic, promising a full analysis before the bill gets to the Senate floor.\The controversial bill would require the U.S. to reduce emissions 20 percent by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050, and would create a cap-and-trade market in which companies could swap pollution credits.\The bill's supporters say it's imperative to act now to slow or reverse global warming, while also creating so-called ""green jobs"" and reducing America's dependence on foreign oil. Its opponents say it would kill manufacturing and raise energy prices at a time the country can ill afford it -- and it wouldn't make a global warming impact without the cooperation of developing nations.\The House has passed similar legislation, but the Senate is not expected to make significant headway on the bill until next year.\Given the reservations of Democrats from energy-producing states, Democratic leaders likely will need Republicans to help reach the 60-vote threshold needed to end debate in the Senate. Some have shown a willingness to make a deal on climate change -- Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., has joined Sens. John Kerry, D-Mass., and Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., in behind-the-scenes negotiations on a bill that could earn bipartisan support.\But Mr. Graham and moderate New England Republicans Olympia Snowe, Susan Collins and Judd Gregg wrote a letter to EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson this week siding with EPW committee Republicans in asking the agency for additional analysis. Ranking Republicans in other committees that will consider the bill expressed similar sentiments.\Sen. Arlen Specter, D-Pa., a member of the EPW committee who has his own concerns about the bill but still voted for it yesterday, said he doesn't think the move kills the potential for Republican support.\""This bill is going to be changed, markedly, when you move down the road, so they will get substantively what they want,"" Mr. Specter said.\Mr. Inhofe, meanwhile, denounced both the bill and Ms. Boxer's tactics.\""I am deeply disappointed by Chairman Boxer's decision to violate the rules and longstanding precedent of the committee,"" he said in a statement.\Committee Democrats voted 11-1 in favor of reporting the bill, with Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., the only ""no."" Mr. Baucus, who as chair of the Senate Finance Committee will wield sizable influence over the bill, said he is still committed to passing the legislation and will work to find 60 votes for it in the Senate. But he would like to see several alterations, including the reduction of the 20 percent emissions target by 2020 to 17 percent, unless developing countries follow suit."
42,"WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration might agree to postpone auctioning off 100 percent of emissions allowances under a cap-and-trade system to limit greenhouse gas pollution, White House science adviser John Holdren said yesterday, a move that would please electricity providers and manufacturers but could anger environmentalists.\In one of his first interviews since being confirmed March 20 as director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, Mr. Holdren said a group of Cabinet-level officials are trying to establish a set of principles to guide the climate legislation that has just begun to move in Congress.\During the presidential campaign, Mr. Obama called for auctioning off all greenhouse gas emissions permits at the outset, rather than just a portion of them. Many industry leaders say a phase-in will be essential to easing the transition to a low-carbon economy.\""The idea, obviously, is to end up with a bill that reflects both the thinking of Congress and the administration, a bill that the president can sign,"" Mr. Holdren said, adding that when it comes to a 100 percent auction, ""Whether you get to start with that or get there over a period of time is something that's being discussed.""\Mr. Holdren's comments shed light on the administration's behind-the-scenes effort to shape national climate policy, an issue that Mr. Obama has identified as a top priority, but has so far left largely to lawmakers to flesh out.\Last week, House Energy and Commerce Committee Henry Waxman, D-Calif., and Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., who chairs the panel's energy and environment subcommittee, released a draft climate bill that they have vowed to send to the full House by Memorial Day. The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which has primary jurisdiction over the issue in the upper chamber, has yet to take up a bill.\In an e-mail, White House spokesman Ben LaBolt wrote that Mr. Obama has asked Congress to deliver ""comprehensive energy legislation that would spur a transition to a clean-energy economy, create thousands of green jobs and wean us of our dependence on foreign oil.""\""He said during the campaign that his preferred approach was 100 percent auction to create incentives for companies to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions,"" Mr. LaBolt wrote. ""Members of Congress are looking at a variety of policy options to help us make that transition, and the administration will be flexible during the policymaking process as long as those larger goals are met.""\For weeks, the president's assistant on energy and climate change, Carol M. Browner, has convened regular meetings with roughly a dozen key administration officials to develop national energy and climate policy. They include Mr. Holdren; the secretaries of Agriculture, Commerce, Energy, Housing and Urban Development, Interior and Transportation; and the heads of the Environmental Protection Agency and the White House Council on Environmental Quality, National Economic Council, Council of Economic Advisers and Office of Management and Budget.\The group, whose deputies meet at least once a week if not more, have explored questions ranging from how to pursue offshore wind energy to agricultural practices and a new national greenhouse gas emissions standard for vehicles.\Keith Trent, chief strategy, policy and regulatory officer for Duke Energy Corp., said utility executives are hoping for a 10-year transition to a 100 percent auction, so they can install pollution controls without raising electricity costs too high. He added that emitters would still have an incentive to cut carbon dioxide because of the overall federal cap on carbon emissions: ""The cap is what makes the system's environmental integrity, and you can't exceed that cap because you need an allowance to do it.""\But environmental advocate Erich Pica, director of domestic programs for Friends of the Earth, said giving utility providers free allowances would be less efficient than rebating the revenue from auctions directly to taxpayers. A 100 percent auction, Mr. Pica said, ""forces the polluters from Day One to pay for the transition to a clean-energy economy, and keeps low- and middle-income consumers whole during the transition."""

Allegheny County Executive Dan Onorato is going to have to overcome his abysmal musical taste if he's going to be elected Pennsylvania's next governor.
\
Don't take our word for it. Take the word of Chicago Sun-Times rock critic Jim DeRogatis.
\
John Micek, a reporter-blogger for The Morning Call of Allentown, had a clever idea while waiting for Onorato to formally declare his gubernatorial candidacy in Harrisburg on Tuesday.
\
He wrote down the first seven songs played over the public address system before Onorato took the podium and then asked the respected DeRogatis to critique the choices.
\
DeRogatis wasn't impressed. ""I know nothing about Mr. Onorato's politics, but his musical choices couldn't be more conservative -- or boring,"" he told Micek.
\
His review of the individual songs:
\
""Ain't No Stoppin' Us Now,"" McFadden & Whitehead -- ""Well, there's just a hint of enormous hubris, isn't there? To say nothing of a fascistic bent.""
\
""What I Like About You,"" The Romantics -- ""Why should we care if (Onorato) likes us? Shouldn't it be the other way around?""
\
""Motown Philly,"" Boyz II Men -- ""Boyz II Men is just embarrassing, period.""
\
""A Little Less Conversation,"" Elvis Presley -- ""Hardly a good message for a would-be (governor) to put out there. He or she should be willing to talk with and listen to each and every constituent.""
\
""Life is a Highway,"" Rascal Flatts -- ""Just invites bad jokes about speeding or getting off at the wrong ramp.""
\
""You Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet,"" Bachman-Turner Overdrive -- ""If you haven't done much in public service to date, why should we think you'll deliver more if elected now?""
\

\
KERRY: 'GREEN' GAINS IN RECESSION. John Kerry apparently loves the fact that the national unemployment rate is hovering perilously close to 10 percent.
\
That's because the Democrat senator from Massachusetts believes the worst recession in decades has been good for the environment.
\
As reported by the North Star National Web site, Kerry made that startling observation during a recent hearing on the controversial cap-and-trade bill.
\
Said Kerry: ""Let me emphasize something strongly. ... The United States has already this year alone achieved a 6 percent reduction in emissions simply because of the downturn in the economy, so we are effectively saying we need to go another 14 percent.""
\
As the Web site's Dan Calabrese observed, Kerry ""made the astounding statement that the recession is the environment's best friend and he couldn't be happier about it.""
\
Calabrese added: ""Kerry unwittingly admitted that cap-and-trade advocates and like-minded global warming believers see economic prosperity as a huge source of the supposed problem. That's why they're proposing the perfect solution -- from their perspective -- in the form of a massive tax increase directly on industry.""
\
Kerry, the husband of Pittsburgh ketchup heiress Teresa Heinz, obviously can't identify with people who have suffered through the recession. The Washington, D.C.-based newspaper Roll Call recently estimated his net worth at $230 million, making him the richest member of Congress.
\
DECORUM ON THE FLOOR? NEVERMORE. Tensions exploded on the state House floor Wednesday, with two Democrat legislators clashing after a contentious tax bill was approved.
\
Rep. Joe Petrarca, D-Vandergrift, and Rep. Mike Gerber, D-Montgomery County, got into it over their votes on the legislation. Gerber apparently didn't like Petrarca being one of only two Democrats who voted against the legislation.
\
According to accounts, there was some contact and pushing between the two men, but no blows were exchanged.
\
Downplaying the incident after it occurred, Petrarca said: ""We had a disagreement. We are good friends. It was no big deal and things are fine.""
\
TALKIN' TURNCOAT. In case Pennsylvania voters might have forgotten, U.S. Rep. Joe Sestak has this helpful reminder: U.S. Sen. Arlen Specter used to be a Republican.
\
Sestak, who is challenging the former GOP senator in next year's Democrat primary, has launched a new Web site, The Real Arlen Specter (therealspecter2010.com/real).
\
Sestak, of Delaware County, notes that before Specter decided to hang out on a different political street corner, he hung out with the likes of George Bush, Dick Cheney, John McCain, Sarah Palin and Rick Santorum -- people highly unlikely ever to be enshrined in the Democrat Hall of Fame, primarily because they are Republicans.
\
IF AT FIRST YOU DON'T SUCCEED ... Having failed to take down one prominent Allegheny County Democrat via the legal system, Mary Beth Buchanan reportedly is considering trying to take down another at the ballot box.
\
Buchanan, who is expected to be replaced soon as the U.S. attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania, is considering taking on U.S. Rep. Jason Altmire, D-McCandless.
\
Buchanan would join attorney Keith Rothfus of Edgeworth as another Republican challenger to the two-term incumbent.
\
If Buchanan enters the race, she can only hope she fares better politically against Altmire than she did legally against former Allegheny County Coroner Dr. Cyril Wecht.
\
Mucho egg remains on Buchanan's face for her protracted -- and wildly unsuccessful -- attempts to convict Wecht of public corruption charges.
\
OOPS. Bryan Kline, the Republican candidate for Westmoreland County clerk of courts, raised the ire of incumbent Democrat David Patterson when Kline lobbed allegations that Patterson was ""moonlighting"" at another job.
\
Patterson said it's not true. He said Kline apparently misinterpreted Patterson's statement of financial interest, where he listed his wife's employer as a source of income.
\
""Mr. Kline's information is wrong. I have one job and only one job and that is clerk of courts,"" Patterson said.
\
He then turned the tables on Kline.
\
""Positions of responsibility such as the Clerk of Courts Office should be occupied by individuals who verify information before they act,"" Patterson said.
\
LORDY, LORDY. That line outside the First Presbyterian Church in Murrysville was not for a special service. Well, maybe it was -- for Penguins fans.
\
Mayoral candidate Robert J. Brooks, a member of the church who is a part-owner of the Pittsburgh Penguins, brought the Stanley Cup to be enjoyed by fellow church members.
\
Judging by the long line of people outside the church -- most wearing Penguins gear -- a lot of others in the community enjoyed looking at the trophy, too.
\
The event is featured in a YouTube video. Brooks, a Republican who formerly served as a councilman, is running against Democrat Mark R. Kennedy.
\
SRO. The Hempfield Area School Board may have to move its meeting Monday to a larger room.
\
Superintendent Terry Foriska and several school directors say they expect a big turnout to see who the board appoints to replace former director Tim Miller, who resigned in September.
\
Members of the Hempfield Area Education Association, bus drivers and maintenance, custodial and food workers, along with the public, are expected to turn out in droves to see who gets the position.
\
Foriska said if a large crowd shows up, he will recommend moving the meeting from the administration building to one of the two auditoriums at the nearby high school.

44,"Concerning the article by George Ellis, president of the Pennsylvania Coal Association (""Hot Air About Alternatives: Coal Remains a Mainstay of the Pennsylvania Economy,"" July 13 Perspectives): Putting aside his failure to address global warming and the health and environmental impact of both mining and burning coal, we can agree on a couple of matters. \I share his concern about the impact of the current cap-and-trade legislation on taxpayers and consumers and the special status given to alternative energy sources still in their infancy, which ""clearly have not been practical, reliable or affordable."" \In that spirit, I suggest that the coal industry, which has been around for more than 200 years and has long had a dominant position in the energy market, advise Congress that it does not seek and will not accept the billions of taxpayers' dollars provided in the same cap-and-trade legislation for clean coal technology, which clearly is not ""practical, reliable or affordable."" It would truly be irresponsible for the coal industry, which has seen the price of coal soar in recent years, due in part to the demand in China, to accept such a subsidy which ""would impose an enormous financial burden on taxpayers"" at a time of ""an overall unsettled economy."" \Perhaps while they are at it, the coal industry lobbyists also can seek the repeal of those special laws that benefit the coal industry, such as allowing coal producers access to property owners' land and holding the producers harmless for mine subsidence damage. \On second thought, maybe we can't agree. I guess I do see the rationale for subsidizing the new alternative energy industry, which at least holds out the potential to improve health and the environment. I just don't see the need to subsidize a fully developed and highly profitable industry that undermines health and the environment.\MICHAEL C. JOYCE \Mt. Lebanon"
45,"It was déjà vu' all over again. Sometimes big government gets too big for reality. It over steps. Such was the way when the Obama Administration first came into power. It decided to become an environmentalist zealot. They began to implement a plan known as ""Cap and Trade.""\Cap and Trade reminded us of the old Kyoto Treaty protocol. This was implemented back in 1992 and it was going to ""bulldoze"" environmental regulation at the expense of our general economy. The economic efficient population would decrease their overall economy and the lower income populations such as Hispanics, Blacks and fixed income lower class would suffer.\We proved Cap and Trade to be a clone of the Kyoto Protocol and since have proven the Clean Power Plan to be a clone of Cap and Trade. The ""bullheaded"" environmentalists don't seem to understand that people will not desire to live impoverished and unemployed while nations on the other side of the world continue to maintain their lifestyle and at the expense of ours. The ironic thing about the Kyoto Protocol was that the United States, despite refusing to adopt the plan achieved better environment improvement than those nations that professed to believe in the plan. It is our improving technology that is working to make our environment better - not adverse regulation.\So, as we continued to improve the quality of our environment at a reasonable pace, the extremists were demanding unreasonable demands that could not find a ""happy medium"" in the improvement of our environment. Such was the case of the Clean Power Plan.\The following information is an actual timeline on the ongoing debate and parts of a study by ""Climate Wire"". President Obama decided to give his unrealistic environmental goals another last try. ""On August 3, 2015 the Obama administration released the final Clean Power Plan. The U.S. EPA would cut carbon emissions 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. Each state must achieve a specific level or rate of emissions. States decide how much to ramp up natural gas, renewable power or energy savings and how much to reduce coal use. Companies can buy and sell allowances to balance their carbon emissions.""\All hell broke loose. Just like Cap and Trade reasonable industry leaders, state governments, etc. began resisting with a vengeance. 27 states opposed this plan while 18 others approved it. States and business groups sued in federal court. Hence, the Supreme Court has halted implementation of the Clean Power Plan. A federal court is weighing the rule and the Supreme Court could take it up shortly. President Trump had directed the EPA to review and possibly rescind the rule. It is in his' campaign platform to stop this onerous rule. At last, the Clean Power Plan is being rewritten. On Dec. 6, the ""Rewrite"" will be announced to the public.\Nations in Asia are importing our coal production at record pace. Job growth will be steady in our coal industry. Thus, all the threats of making the Clean Power Plan a reality are stopped. African American and Hispanic employment levels do not have to be sacrificed. America will continue to grow, and the latest records are showing a great increase in Black employment and home ownership. The nation's gross domestic product is growing at a record pace of 3 percent and will reach 4 percent shortly. The stock market is more robust than ever before.\There is no need for the Clean Power Plan. It is wasteful and unnecessary. Despite its absence, America is becoming great again! Victory is ours!"

Cautious on shale
\
Editor: U.S. Rep. Joe Sestak is the best choice for senator in the November elections, especially because of his work on natural gas drilling in the Marcellus Shale.
\
Because of gas drilling, our community is facing tremendous economic opportunity, and our community is also facing tremendous potential for natural disasters.
\
Natural gas drilling is happening and there is no stopping it. But, that doesn't mean we should not be smart about it. Ever since Mr. Sestak toured the counties in northeast Pennsylvania, he has been an advocate for study of natural gas drilling and an advocate for oversight and appropriate control. He has cosponsored the FRAC Act (the House companion to a Senate bill sponsored by Sen. Bob Casey) that would require gas companions to disclose the chemicals used in fracking. He has either attended or sent representatives to informational and scientific meetings studying natural gas drilling.
\
Pat Toomey has consistently opposed proposals to expand federal or local oversight of drilling in our communities. In fact, Toomey's lifetime score on votes on environmental issues is 11 percent while Sestak's is 96 percent, according to the League of Conservation voters. During his career Mr. Toomey has accepted $294,000 in contributions from energy interests including $123,800 specifically from the oil and gas industry. Toomey has had the dubious honor of being selected for the ""Dirty Dozen"" list compiled by the League of Conservation.

Editor: Rep. Joe Sestak, Democratic candidate for Senate, is not the ""moderate, Washington outsider"" he purports to be. Mr. Sestak professes to be for ""working families,"" but working families cannot afford his ""yes"" votes on such colossal spending bills as cap and trade, Obamacare, stimulus, and TARP.
\
Incredibly, he has even stated that he feels the cap and trade bill didn't go far enough. He irresponsibly votes for bills that will leave future generations with insurmountable debts?
\
As a resident of Mr. Sestak's 7th district, I have observed him in a variety of venues and have found him to be a master at spinning the truth. This is illustrated by his persistent, erroneous commentary on the health care bill. He has insisted that, under the government's bill, ""if you like your current plan, you can keep it."" We are discovering that this is untrue.
\
Either Mr. Sestak misled the public to persuade voters to accept his unyielding support of this massive governmental takeover of our medical care, or he did not understand the consequences of regulations within the bill upon employers, employees and the insurance industry. Neither of these options is acceptable for Pennsylvania's next senator.
\
Fortunately, Pennsylvania has a clear-cut choice for Senate: a true fiscal conservative, Pat Toomey, or the far-left ideologue, Joe Sestak, who has voted with House Speaker Pelosi 97 percent of the time, and who strongly supports the economically destructive policies of the current administration.

\
Editor: Teachers, educators, and students in Northeast Pennsylvania should get involved in the Paul Kanjorski campaign and do not vote for Lou Barletta.
\
This year, Mr. Barletta claimed that a Temple University course, taught by highly respected professors and based on solid academic research, was biased and untrue merely because he did not agree with the study's results or the course's offering. It is clear that Mr. Barletta does not understand the purpose of academic discussion.
\
Mr. Kanjorski has provided strong support for education. In 2009, the congressman helped to secure $2 million over five years for LCCC. Also in 2009, the congressman secured more than $300,000 to the Center of Community Engagement and Learning at King's College. In 2004, the congressman secured $ 1.4 million for Wilkes University to strengthen its student advising process.
\
Mr. Kanjorski has secured funding for partnerships between Schott Glass and the University of Scranton to research and develop the Exawatt Lazer. Most recently, Mr. Kanjorski created an academic partnership bringing $1 million in funding to Wilkes University and Kings College to study natural gas drilling in the Marcellus Shale and protecting the environment in NEPA.

Editor: In his 13 terms in Congress, Paul Kanjorski has learned to follow the leader. In the current term he has voted with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her team of liberal Democrats more than 97 percent of the time. That's pretty remarkable when you consider that Pennsylvania's 11th District is really pretty moderate.
\
His recent record in Congress demonstrates a blind spot for the wishes of the voters. His record is tarnished with votes for liberal policies that are bad for the area's seniors and small business owners.
\
The worst is the one that allowed the government takeover of health care. The Obama-Pelosi health plan is bad medicine and bad economics.
\
Kanjorski also stuck it to small business owners by voting to increase their costs of energy. Kanjorski and the liberal Democrats have voted to institute an energy tax known as cap and trade. The liberals say it will protect the environment but the jury is still out on that. It will, however, is cause electricity, gasoline and heating oil prices to rise for small businesses, which are the nation's best hope for economic recovery.
\
Certainly, Mr. Kanjorski has done some good for the people of his district in 26 years, but you can't lean on your past. People are scared, jobs are scarce and expenses are mounting. Voters are frustrated by the status quo and want elected leaders to give them straight facts and meaningful action. Voters expect the truth and won't support a candidate just because he has a long tenure. What have you done for me lately? That's the key question to ask this year.

47,"As Pennsylvania rolls toward budget crunch season, it’s interesting to note Gov. Tom Wolf’s pivot toward radical environmental policies. A recent executive order by the governor committed Pennsylvania as the 24th state in the US to join the U.S. Climate Alliance — essentially pledging to align our state’s policies with those of the Paris climate accord. The consequences of such a drastic reduction in emissions in such a short period of time will fall hard on Pennsylvania’s small businesses, on jobs and on the state economy.\A second back-door push by the Wolf administration is to move Pennsylvania into a carbon dioxide emissions cap-and-trade system through agency fiat, rather than through a vote of the General Assembly.\The state Department of Environmental Protection’s appointed Environmental Quality Board recently voted to move forward with consideration of such a plan. The stated goal is the elimination of all human-originated releases of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.\In times when the details in U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s dystopian Green New Deal are touted by elected officials who may have political or campaign goals, we see our governor — Pennsylvania’s personally well-liked chief executive — wading into the muck.\Perhaps it is a concession to the reality that his tax-and-spend agenda never got off the ground and that, on balance, his views are not on par with most Pennsylvanians — including a sizeable percentage in his own party.\His “fifth time’s a charm” natural gas severance tax proposal is taking on water, even as the strength of the national economy and its related benefits to our state government coffers resolve the structural imbalances that Wolf has used as the basis for broad-based tax hike proposals.\Members of both parties have a vested interested in clean air and clean water. Within the zone of making progress on such quality-of-life concerns, amazing advances have been made, and we can look forward to further advances in the years ahead. Mandating extreme environmental regulations with no regard to the cost or benefit to the public will crush businesses of all sizes and land with particular force on those small businesses that provide two-thirds of the jobs in our communities.\I’m sure these recent moves by our governor will make him the toast of environmental lobbyists, but there are consequences for actions and costs to be borne.\Hopefully, in reflective moments, Wolf will weigh the negative impacts of his policies on jobs and job creators. Our small business owners and the people they employ must be given high priority as environmental policies are weighed in the balance.\Gordon Denlinger served as Republican state Representative for the 99th District in eastern Lancaster County from 2003 to 2014.

Every business in the state needs low energy prices in order to compete and keep our economy strong. Unfortunately, despite the fact that we are creating cleaner and more affordable electricity than ever before, the overreaching Environmental Protection Agency continues to put many jobs at risk.
\
The EPA's newest carbon rules appear to ignore the steps our state has already taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, as emissions are down 14 percent since 2005. In fact, over the past decade, the United States has led the world in reducing carbon emissions, and this was done without cap and trade.
\
Pennsylvania's wholesale electricity prices also continue to fall, alongside the unemployment rate -- now at a five-year low. Further unnecessary government intrusion threatens to reverse these historic trends.
\
The EPA's new greenhouse gas plan is effectively a forced and expensive reconfiguration of the entire grid. Worse, even the EPA has admitted this new plan will do little to reduce global emissions while raising electric bills.
\
The Keystone State is taking the right steps to balance the needs of the environment and the economy, and our residents are reaping the benefits. Let's not allow an overly aggressive EPA to tip this balance.

New EPA regulations are driving some people cuckoo, many wondering when the flood of new regulations will end.
\
A study recently found the wealthy benefit the most from tax credits for plug-in cars and even simple home insulation upgrades. Makes one wonder if a different approach would be better.
\
Carbon emissions cap and trade programs have been developed and implemented for many years now, complete with emissions credit trading on Wall Street.
\
There's something about all of this that makes my head want to explode.
\
It seems all way, way too complicated, especially our supporting of both fossil fuels and renewables simultaneously.
\
Half of Congress wants utterance of ""carbon tax"" on the floor banned. The idea of a fully refunded to households version, which therefor isn't even a tax, is buried from view perhaps because it's so simple it could work really well.
\
Rep. Perry's D.C. staff seems to not understand its simplicity, with an aide declaring ""more oppose EPA regulations than there are climate change people."" He totally missed the boat -- fully refunded carbon fee and dividend 1) isn't regulations and 2) helps the economy and the environment simultaneously according to REMI's authoritative study of it, which meshes with how it's working in British Columbia.
\
We were decreasing our carbon intensity (carbon pollution per unit of energy produced) until the 1990s. Fully refunded carbon fee and dividend just helps us return to that trend via whatever works. Just let the market do its thing. Increases in costs get fully refunded simply to households, with two-thirds expected to come out ahead, including the poor.
\
Carbon fee and dividend could help as Pennsylvania's implementation of the Clean Power Plan, although a national implementation would be simply better.

Democrats need to heed the commonsense argument against their long-held dream of a carbon tax -- and for American prosperity -- that Heritage Foundation chief economist Stephen Moore laid out in a recent Senate hearing.
\
Writing in The Washington Times, Mr. Moore recounts what he told the Committee on Environment and Public Works. In response to a question from Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., he said he'd consider a carbon tax only if its Democrat proponents were willing to implement a flat tax of 17 or 18 percent on income and end double taxation of savings and investments.
\
Moore doubts that's what carbon-taxing Dems have in mind. He says they want to end fossil-fuel production -- despite the shale-energy boom lowering gasoline prices, cutting dependence on foreign oil and ""producing more jobs on net than all other industries combined from 2009 to 2013"" -- and fund ""green"" boondoggles like Solyndra that even Google scientists now say hold out ""false hope"" of staving off ""catastrophic climate change.""

A carbon tax, cap and trade, environmental regulations targeting power plants -- all Democrat ideas -- ""would do severe damage to the economy"" during the slowest recovery since the Great Depression, according to Moore. He says America's top priority ""must be to accelerate economic growth and raise incomes"" -- which a carbon tax would prevent.

Democrats need to heed the commonsense argument against their long-held dream of a carbon tax -- and for American prosperity -- that Heritage Foundation chief economist Stephen Moore laid out in a recent Senate hearing.
\
Writing in The Washington Times, Mr. Moore recounts what he told the Committee on Environment and Public Works. In response to a question from Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., he said he'd consider a carbon tax only if its Democrat proponents were willing to implement a flat tax of 17 or 18 percent on income and end double taxation of savings and investments.
\
Moore doubts that's what carbon-taxing Dems have in mind. He says they want to end fossil-fuel production -- despite the shale-energy boom lowering gasoline prices, cutting dependence on foreign oil and ""producing more jobs on net than all other industries combined from 2009 to 2013"" -- and fund ""green"" boondoggles like Solyndra that even Google scientists now say hold out ""false hope"" of staving off ""catastrophic climate change.""

53,"TO THE EDITOR:\Joe Heller's letter (8/3) complaining that the current cap-and-trade bill coming before the Senate will do nothing to improve our environment, is filled with untrustworthy arguments.\He writes that carbon dioxide, the major greenhouse gas of concern, is essential to the earth's food and oxygen supply system. This is true. Salt is important to kidney function, but too much will spike your blood pressure and way too much will eventually kill you. So it is a matter of having the right balance of carbon in the atmosphere to keep our climate within a livable range.\I find it hard to believe that in a traditional farming area such as this, more people are not sounding the alarm of what climate change means for food production and the farm economy. Everyone seems to focus on what harm the cap-and-trade energy pricing will do to our wallets, without realizing that the bill for climate change, if we don't act, will be huge. \We think so much about our wallets now, but just think what our children and grandchildren will be paying in 30 years if we do not start to put the brakes on now.\Claudia Kirk\Paradise"
54,"Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell was right. President George W. Bush was wrong. At least, that's what a federal circuit court ruled in regard to each official's clean air standards for mercury.\Last week, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit tossed out the Bush administration's mercury-control plan. Three years ago, the Environmental Protection Agency established a ""cap-and-trade"" policy to help control mercury emissions. This program allowed polluters, mainly coal-fired power plants, to avoid installing costly mercury control technology by purchasing pollution credits from lower-polluting plants. The plan envisioned reducing mercury emissions by 70 percent by 2018.\However, the court found that the Bush administration policy, implemented in 2005, violated the Clean Air Act mercury-reduction rules established in 2000. Those rules set the goal of reducing mercury pollution by 90 percent.\Pennsylvania joined 16 other states and environmental groups in challenging the less-stringent Bush administration standards. Their concern was that the Bush administration policy would foster the creation of ""hot spots"" around power plants, poisoning water supplies and fish and work its way into the food chain. The National Academy of Sciences estimates that mercury, a neurotoxin, puts 60,000 newborns a year at risk of learning disabilities because their mothers might be exposed to it. In other words, the Bush EPA policy wasn't about protecting the environment, it protected utility company bottom lines.\Because of this, Gov. Rendell and state Environmental Protection Secretary Kathleen McGinty proposed stricter standards for Pennsylvania. The EPA allowed this, and last summer Pennsylvania adopted tougher rules that disallowed cap-and-trade practices and required coal-fired power plants to reduce their mercury emissions by 90 percent by 2015. Considering that Pennsylvania trailed only Texas and Ohio in mercury pollution, the stricter approach was warranted.\This is the second court reversal of Bush administration environmental policies. Last year, the Supreme Court chastised the administration for not regulating greenhouse gasses. This time, the judges caustically compared the EPA's cap-and-trade rule to the capricious Queen of Hearts in ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,"" who substituted her own wishes for those written in law.\The court's decision essentially sends the EPA back to the drawing board. Environmentalists worry that this will mean that 600 unregulated power plants across the country won't be subjected to mercury emission limits for another five years. That won't be the case for about half the states around the nation who, like Pennsylvania, enacted tougher rules. Good for them.\Credit: The Morning Call\Credit: The Morning Call"

Republican allegations that U.S. Rep. Ed Markey violated House ethics rules by intimidating a key witness -- who testified against the lawmaker's cap-and-trade scheme -- demands an investigation.
\
But even at that, the damage already is done.
\
MidAmerican Energy Holding Co. CEO David L. Sokol testified before Mr. Markey's subcommittee on Energy and the Environment that the consumer-punishing, energy-sapping cap-and-trade emissions bill would be entirely ineffective.
\
Markey, D-Mass, who co-sponsored the measure with Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., then ordered an investigation into past statements by Mr. Sokol and Warren Buffett, who is MidAmerican's largest stakeholder.
\
House Republicans accused Markey of ""retaliating and bullying"" a witness in violation of House rules. Markey denies the charge and says his call for an investigation was in the pipeline before Sokol's testimony.
\
Except that Markey's letter requesting the investigation was dated the same day as the hearing.
\
Whatever the outcome, this ugly episode could chill future expert testimony to the truth: that cap and trade feeds the government's tax lust, exponentially drives up energy costs and does virtually nothing to reduce carbon emissions. A Heritage Foundation analysis finds it would increase electricity rates by 90 percent.
\
Candid congressional testimony that's followed up with a witch hunt only reinforces the fraud that is cap and trade.

56,"Arizona Sen. John McCain broke with the Bush administration and Republican Party orthodoxy yesterday as he not only declared global warming real, but also reached out to Democrats and independents with a free-market solution that includes capping carbon-fuel emissions.\The GOP presidential contender also prodded China and India -- two major emitters of greenhouse gases blamed for the planet's warming -- to join the effort, although he muted planned talk of tariffs against them in favor of ""effective diplomacy"" to encourage their compliance. An aide later said the senator didn't want to be interpreted as being ""at odds with his commitment to open trade.""\Mr. McCain was less restrained in his approach to President Bush, who broke a 2000 campaign pledge to regulate carbon-dioxide emissions, and who also backed off signing the Kyoto global warming protocols shortly after taking office.\""I will not shirk the mantle of leadership that the United States bears. I will not permit eight long years to pass without serious action on serious challenges. I will not accept the same dead-end of failed diplomacy that claimed Kyoto. The United States will lead and will lead with a different approach, an approach that speaks to the interests and obligation of every nation,"" he declared.\The language highlighted the political stakes for Mr. McCain, the Republicans' presumed presidential nominee. His visit to Oregon came days after the leading Democratic contenders, Sens. Barack Obama of Illinois and Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, campaigned in the state.\Oregon is viewed by some as a general-election battleground, and its Columbia Gorge and Mount Hood National Wilderness are playgrounds for many outdoorsmen and environmentalists.\Among those attending Mr. McCain's speech was Oregon Gov. Ted Kulongoski, a Democrat. The senator heaped praise on him, despite mangling the pronunciation of his name, and said, ""As president of the United States, I will sit down with Governor Ted Kulongoski and all other governors of this country, whether they be Democrat or Republican, and work for the betterment of this nation.""\Global warming also stands with abortion rights and an array of social causes as key issues to the evangelicals and Christian conservatives who Mr. McCain hopes will bolster his political base this fall.\Democrats derided Mr. McCain's record on the issue, noting contributions to his campaign from energy lobbyists, his recent proposal to temporarily suspend the federal gasoline tax as a means of making driving cheaper and some votes against alternate energy sources.\""It is truly breathtaking for John McCain to talk about combating climate change while voting against virtually every recent effort to actually invest in clean energy,"" Mr. Obama said in a statement.\Mr. Clinton said, ""While Senator McCain's proposals may be improvement on President Bush's, that's not saying much.""\Mr. McCain has long expressed a belief in global warming, arguing that even if he is wrong, acting as if the planet's temperature were increasing would only benefit the environment if scientists subsequently proved that he was mistaken.\The main solution he outlined yesterday is to implement a cap-and-trade program on carbon-fuel emissions, like a similar program in the Clean Air Act used to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions that triggered acid rain.\Industries would be given emission targets, and those coming in under their limit could sell their surplus polluting capacity to companies unable to meet their target.\Mr. McCain wants the country to return to 2005 emission levels by 2012; 1990 levels by 2020; and to a level 60 percent below that by 2050."
57,"The 2008 election ended the reign of junk science in our nation's capital, and the chances of meaningful action on climate change, probably through a cap-and-trade system on emissions, have risen sharply.\But the opponents of action claim that limiting emissions would have devastating effects on the U.S. economy. So it's important to understand that just as denials that climate change is happening are junk science, predictions of economic disaster if we try to do anything about climate change are junk economics.\Yes, limiting emissions would have its costs. As a card-carrying economist, I cringe when ""green economy"" enthusiasts insist that protecting the environment would be all gain, no pain.\But the best available estimates suggest that the costs of an emissions-limitation program would be modest, as long as it's implemented gradually. And committing ourselves now might actually help the economy recover from its current slump.\Let's talk first about those costs.\A cap-and-trade system would raise the price of anything that, directly or indirectly, leads to the burning of fossil fuels. Electricity, in particular, would become more expensive, because so much generation takes place in coal-fired plants.\Electric utilities could reduce their need to purchase permits by limiting their emissions of carbon dioxide -- and the whole point of cap-and-trade is, of course, to give them an incentive to do just that. But the steps they would take to limit emissions, such as shifting to other energy sources or capturing and sequestering much of the carbon dioxide they emit, would without question raise their costs.\If emission permits were auctioned off -- as they should be -- the revenue thus raised could be used to give consumers rebates or reduce other taxes, partially offsetting the higher prices. But the offset wouldn't be complete. Consumers would end up poorer than they would have been without a climate-change policy.\But how much poorer? Not much, say careful researchers, like those at the Environmental Protection Agency or the Emissions Prediction and Policy Analysis Group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Even with stringent limits, says the MIT group, Americans would consume only 2 percent less in 2050 than they would have in the absence of emission limits. That would still leave room for a large rise in the standard of living, shaving only one-twentieth of a percentage point off the average annual growth rate.\To be sure, there are many who insist that the costs would be much higher. Strange to say, however, such assertions nearly always come from people who claim to believe that free-market economies are wonderfully flexible and innovative, that they can easily transcend any constraints imposed by the world's limited resources of crude oil, arable land or fresh water.\So why don't they think the economy can cope with limits on greenhouse gas emissions? Under cap-and-trade, emission rights would just be another scarce resource, no different in economic terms from the supply of arable land.\People like Newt Gingrich, who says that cap-and-trade would ""punish the American people,"" aren't thinking that way. They're just thinking ""capitalism good, government bad."" But if you really believe in the magic of the marketplace, you should also believe that the economy can handle emission limits just fine.\So we can afford a strong climate change policy. And committing ourselves to such a policy might actually help us in our current economic predicament.\Right now, the biggest problem facing our economy is plunging business investment. Businesses see no reason to invest, since they're awash in excess capacity, thanks to the housing bust and weak consumer demand.\But suppose that Congress were to mandate gradually tightening emission limits, starting two or three years from now. This would have no immediate effect on prices. It would, however, create major incentives for new investment -- investment in low-emission power plants, in energy-efficient factories and more.\To put it another way, a commitment to greenhouse gas reduction would, in the short-to-medium run, have the same economic effects as a major technological innovation: It would give businesses a reason to invest in new equipment and facilities even in the face of excess capacity. And given the current state of the economy, that's just what the doctor ordered.\This short-run economic boost isn't the main reason to move on climate-change policy. The important thing is that the planet is in danger, and the longer we wait the worse it gets. But it is an extra reason to move quickly.\So can we afford to save the planet? Yes, we can. And now would be a very good time to get started."
58,"Your June 22 editorial criticizing Rep. Tim Murphy's views on the cap-and-trade bill just passed by the U.S. House of Representatives is off the mark (""Climactic Vote""). Rep. Murphy supports the development of clean energy resources and dedicated funding toward research and development of renewable and alternative energy. \What he is concerned about, as are we in the steel industry, is the unintended consequences that would come with the cap-and-trade plan as currently written, especially the high increase in energy costs to every consumer and the potential loss of thousands of manufacturing jobs. Climate change is a global issue that requires global solutions. Successful climate legislation must not send manufacturing jobs overseas to countries with lax environmental enforcement. \It is particularly disappointing that with such an important issue, that the House leadership rushed a 1,200-page bill on a fast track to a vote. A common-sense approach, such as Rep. Murphy advocates, is needed to give all sides the opportunity to be heard and in the end produce real improvements for the environment while also balancing the economic impact. We will push for this type of approach as the bill now moves to the Senate."
59,"WASHINGTON -- Democrats on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee yesterday unveiled principles to guide the crafting of legislation to slow global warming -- an opening salvo in what is likely to be one of the year's central legislative debates.\The document released by Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., who chairs the panel, was short on details but sets a goal of creating a cap-and-trade system designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions ""to levels guided by science to avoid dangerous climate change.""\""We know that we have to act, and we intend to act,"" Ms. Boxer s aid, adding that she and her Democratic colleagues were answering President Barack Obama's ""call to action.""\Newly appointed Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lisa Jackson welcomed the move and said the administration would help shape the bill. Yesterday's announcement highlighted how much Washington's political ground has shifted on climate change. Ms. Boxer, alluding to last year's failed cap-and-trade bill, said, ""A lot of those who voted against us are no longer here, and they have been replaced by some of the people behind me.""\But it also underscored the challenge lawmakers face in enacting a federal carbon cap. Ms. Boxer would not specify exact emissions reduction targets she'll seek, identify which Republicans might support her panel's eventual proposal or say when the full Senate would take it up for a vote.\Oklahoma Sen. James Inhofe, the panel's top Republican, said in a statement that the Democrats' proposal ""will impose a long-term multi-trillion-dollar energy tax on families and workers. As demonstrated last year, when it comes to drafting comprehensive climate legislation, the devil is in the details."""

Pennsylvania and 14 other states scored a major victory for environmental and public health Friday, when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit overturned a dangerous Bush administration policy on regulating mercury.
\
The states had adopted rules mandating reductions in mercury emissions by coal-fired power plants, the chief source of the emissions. The Bush administration imposed a ""cap and trade"" rule, by which plants that emit mercury beyond the standards may buy credits from plants with emissions below the standard.
\
That might work for some other types of emissions, but not for mercury, a dangerous neurotoxin. The problem with the cap and trade system is that it could have precluded any actual reductions of mercury pollution, allowing further contamination of waterways.
\
Power plants nationwide spew about 48 tons of mercury into the environment each year. That doesn't sound like much until you consider that a fraction of a teaspoon of mercury is enough to render fish in a 25-acre lake to be unfit for human consumption.
\
Pennsylvania and the other states were correct to insist on actual reductions of mercury emissions from every power plant. The administration should accept the court's decision.

61," An April 12 letter called on Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., to sponsor legislation to regulate greenhouse gases (""Local Congressmen Need to Heed Global Warming""). Sen. Specter shares letter writer Dr. Bill Wood's concern regarding climate change and, to that end, is making serious efforts to craft meaningful federal legislation to deal with global warming.\ The president of the World Resources Institute -- the same organization Dr. Wood cites in his letter -- recently testified before the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works and called for ""targets that slow, stop and reverse the growth of U.S. emissions.""\ Sen. Specter is crafting a bill with Senate Energy Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., that would do just that. While still in the discussion stage, the bill seeks to implement a mandatory, economy-wide cap-and-trade program to control U.S. emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. The draft bill provides a rational approach to global climate change by starting our nation on a market-based system, while attempting to limit its cost to U.S. consumers, encourage innovation through the development of clean technologies and recognize that the United States cannot solve this global issue alone.\ Rather than insist upon passage of one particular piece of legislation, which Dr. Wood suggests, Sen. Specter is attempting to find a solution that can pass both houses of Congress and reach the president's desk with some hope for his signature. Otherwise, we will continue debating this issue for months and years to come.\ SCOTT HOEFLICH\ Press Secretary\ U.S. Sen. Arlen Specter\ Washington, D.C."
62," The White House plans to push Congress to retool the nation's air quality laws early next year, according to administration and industry officials.\ The move has alarmed environmentalists, who fear that President Bush's ""Clear Skies"" proposal -- which has not moved in Congress since he unveiled it in 2002 -- would undercut existing federal standards more than the administration's pending plan to revise pollution controls through regulation.\ Over the weekend, administration officials told Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Mike Leavitt to delay issuing the Clean Air Interstate Rule, a proposal to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide in 28 states that either fail to meet national air quality standards or produce pollution that ends up in other states. Leavitt, whom Bush chose Monday to head the Department of Health and Human Services, had promised to issue the rules this month, with the goal of cutting nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide pollution by 70 percent sometime after 2015.\ In March, the EPA expects to finalize proposed regulations to curb mercury emissions by 70 percent over the same time period.\ Now Bush hopes to focus his attention on Congress, which has been deadlocked for years on the question of air quality. Bolstered by a larger Senate GOP majority, the administration is hoping it can pass legislation to establish a nationwide cap-and-trade system that would allow companies to buy and sell pollution credits.\ James Connaughton, who chairs the White House Council on Environmental Quality, said passing Clear Skies represents one of Bush' s ""top clean-air, clean-energy priorities for next year."" Although the EPA will continue to work on new air quality rules, Connaughton said, the administration would prefer legislation because ""it applies nationwide and will have greater overall reductions and benefits.""\ Electric utility operators, who are responsible for 22 percent of the nation's nitrogen oxide and 68 percent of its sulfur dioxide pollution, said Monday that they prefer a legislative approach over a new set of federal rules.\ ""No set of regulations, no matter how well crafted, can provide the same degree of certainty for business and the environment as sensible legislation,"" said Thomas Kuhn, president of the Edison Electric Institute. ""Unfortunately, any new regulations almost inevitably will be delayed by litigation, perpetuating uncertainty for power companies and hindering air quality improvements.""\ But several environmental advocates said the administration is undermining public health by delaying the interstate rule and pressing for legislation that, they said, would make it easier for companies to continue polluting. Clear Skies would represent the most sweeping changes in the Clean Air Act since 1990.\ ""The Clean Air Act is now under a great threat from Congress, and delaying the interstate rule will fuel the fire that Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Chairman James Inhofe is trying to light under Congress to go after the law,"" said Clean Air Watch President Frank O'Donnell, referring to the Oklahoma Republican.\ In contrast to the ""interstate"" rule, which mainly affects states east of the Mississippi River and sets tighter controls on the two pollutants, the Clear Skies bill makes more sweeping changes to air quality enforcement and regulates mercury as well. The bill, which Inhofe hopes to put to a committee vote in February, would postpone deadlines for meeting public health standards on smog and fine- particle soot from 2009 to 2015 and would exempt affected smokestacks from ""new source review"" requirements that require plants to install stricter pollution controls when they upgrade their equipment.\ Clear Skies still faces significant Democratic opposition: Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who serves on an Appropriations panel overseeing the EPA's budget, said in an interview that Clear Skies is ""a polluting bill"" that is worse than current law. Rep. Rick Boucher, D-Va., the top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee's subcommittee on energy and air quality, said he would ""think long and hard"" about whether a cap-and-trade system is appropriate for regulating mercury and nitrogen oxide.\ Sens. Thomas Carper, D-Del., and Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., have filed bills that would go further than Clear Skies by curbing carbon dioxide emissions and achieving steeper and faster reductions in the other three pollutants."

Despite progress in recent years to reduce pollution and spend more on renewable energy sources, more has to be done to clean up the environment, former Environmental Protection Agency administrator Christine Todd Whitman said Thursday.
\
""Congress and the president, whomever the next president will be, will enact mandatory caps on greenhouse gases. I'm convinced of it,"" Whitman told more than 800 people yesterday at the Air & Waste Management Association's 100th annual conference, held this year at the David L. Lawrence Convention Center, Downtown.
\
Whitman, who served as the EPA chief from January 2001 to May 2003, said she does not know whether a reduction in greenhouse gases will be accomplished through a tax on fuels, or a ""cap and trade"" system to eliminate emissions of sulfur dioxide. The cap sets standards lower than current pollution levels, then allows companies that create less pollution to sell permits to other polluters that might exceed air quality standards.
\
""If you get a 'reasonable' cap (on emissions) in the future, that can help the private sector"" find new ways to reduce pollution, Whitman said.
\
Politics is what stands in the way of setting new pollution standards, she said.
\
""It won't happen until the 2008 elections are over,"" said Whitman, who fought political battles in Washington and in New Jersey as that state's governor.
\
The Bush administration's decision several years ago to bow to pressure to relax standards on greenhouse gases ""has seriously undermined the U.S. credibility on emissions"" in the eyes of the world, she said.
\
But Whitman, 60, owner of a consulting and lobbying firm, credited the Bush administration for the investment of $12 billion in research to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases and for encouraging voluntary compliance among 130 U.S. companies to reduce pollution. The planned reduction of emissions from those companies is the equivalent of removing 7 million cars from the highways, she said.
\
While the need to eliminate air pollution captures much of the nation's attention, lakes and streams are seriously compromised, with 40 percent of those waterways falling below acceptable standards for water quality, Whitman said.

66,"The spotlight on energy issues, from the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf to the debate over development of Marcellus Shale gas wells, illuminates the clear philosophical differences between Pennsylvania's Senate candidates.\From drilling to the overall debate on global warming, Republican Pat Toomey and Democrat Joe Sestak take contrasting positions.\In keeping with his general hostility toward big government, Mr. Toomey is skeptical of proposals to expand federal oversight of drilling in the Marcellus Shale fields. He opposes open-ended moratoriums on new ocean drilling, arguing that the nation needs the oil from deep water wells and that the Gulf spill, however disastrous and worthy of investigation, is an exception to a track record of generally safe operations by the industry.\He is a sharp critic of the cap-and-trade bill supported by his opponent, contending that it would have disastrous consequences for Pennsylvania businesses.\Mr. Sestak counters that Mr. Toomey's aversion to government regulation poses short- and long-term threats to the environment and the economy.\The Delaware County Democrat has endorsed legislation proposed by his colleague, Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., that would bring Marcellus Shale drilling under the oversight of the Safe Drinking Water Act. He has echoed President Barack Obama's call for a strict moratorium on offshore drilling.\Before the Deepwater Horizon spill, he expressed reservations about the administration's decision to expand the areas available for offshore drilling. Mr. Sestak championed the House version of cap-and-trade legislation designed to use market forces to increase the costs of carbon emissions.\Those overlapping issues have provided ammunition for persistent sniping between the campaigns. ""Toomey sides with Big Oil in the wake of BP disaster,"" the Democrat charged in one of the dueling press statements that the campaigns have exchanged in recent days. ""On energy, Sestak to the left of many Democrats,"" a Toomey statement contended.\While the contrasts in their positions are for the most part fairly clear, the contenders have argued over where that leaves them on the overall political spectrum.\In a state with a significant Democratic registration edge, Mr. Sestak argues that Mr. Toomey's strict conservatism and aversion to government regulation -- on the environment as well as on the economy -- makes him the ideological outlier.\Mr. Toomey, on the other hand, characterizes Mr. Sestak's voting record as more liberal than the views of his state on energy as on other issues. On cap and trade, for example, the Republican notes that four of Mr. Sestak's colleagues in the House Democratic delegation voted against the bill. All of those Democratic ""no"" votes came from districts carried by Sen. John McCain in the 2008 presidential race.\In Congress and later as president of the Club for Growth, Mr. Toomey argued that a major solution to the nation's energy problems was in increasing the supply of domestically produced oil, whether from the ocean floor or from such currently protected areas as the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\In contrast to Mr. Sestak, he welcomed Mr. Obama's decision earlier this year to expand the areas where offshore drilling would be permitted, a step he had long advocated.\Mr. Sestak has been more outspoken in assailing BP's actions in response to the spill. He wrote a letter to BP executives last week urging the corporation to suspend their corporate dividend and direct the revenue to cleanup efforts.\Mr. Toomey has argued that congressional efforts to curtail carbon emissions pose a severe threat to the state's coal industry and to consumers in general. In an interview this week, he pointed to an energy industry estimate, also cited by several PUC commissioners in a 2009 letter to Pennsylvania lawmakers, that the measure would cost as many as 66,000 Pennsylvania jobs over the next decade.\Defending his vote in favor of the cap-and-trade bill, Mr. Sestak counters that it would actually increase the number of jobs in the state in the longer term. Mr. Sestak invokes a projection from a 2009 paper written by scholars at Yale, the University of California and the University of Illinois that estimates that the House version of the bill would add more than 70,000 jobs in Pennsylvania.\Mr. Sestak also maintains that the carbon curbs would help protect the state's $4.7 billion agriculture industry. He concedes its emissions controls could lead to residential electricity price increases in the short term, but says that consumers would realize savings in the longer term as new and cleaner fuel sources become available.\The candidates also differ on the core issue of global warming, and whether climate legislation would do anything to alleviate it. Unlike some conservative figures, Mr. Toomey acknowledges that global warming exists but he is an agnostic on the crucial question of whether it is a product of human activity.\""There's no question that the Earth's surface temperature has increased,"" he said in a statement. ""There is much debate in the scientific community as to the precise sources of global warming. There is no doubt that the proposed cap-and-trade 'solution' would do nothing to stop global warming but would be devastating to jobs and the economy in Pennsylvania.""\Mr. Sestak said global warming is principally man-made, citing a series of scientific findings on the matter. ""I know Congressman Toomey is quite extreme, quite radical, but the vast majority of the mainstream says yes, it is [man-made],"" he said.\In keeping with those positions, the opponents split this week on a closely watched Senate bill, sponsored by Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, that would have stripped the EPA of the ability to regulate carbon dioxide emissions.\Mr. Sestak's campaign said he would have opposed the measure. Mr. Toomey supported the bill, calling the EPA's regulatory proposals a back-door effort to institute a cap-and-trade system, which is stalled in the Senate.\While describing the Marcellus Shale as ""a boon to our economy,"" Mr. Sestak has called for state taxes on the natural gas. Mr. Toomey is averse to new taxes in general.\The Democrat has also endorsed a proposal from Mr. Casey and New York Democratic Sen. Charles E. Schumer that is designed to increase federal oversight of gas drilling.\Asked about the measure last week, Mr. Toomey warned that overlapping bureaucracies pose threats of inefficiency and rising costs. He pointed with approval to the regulatory steps taken by Pennsylvania's environmental officials in response to a Clearfield County gas blowout last week.\To justify the new federal oversight, Mr. Toomey said, ""the burden is on Mr. Sestak"" and other supporters of the Casey-Schumer bill to demonstrate that Pennsylvania's environmental officials are somehow derelict in their oversight.\Mr. Sestak tied his opponent's position to his business and finance background and his general opposition to government regulation. Mr. Toomey worked as an investment banker and then founded a restaurant business before being elected to Congress.\""We're fortunate we haven't had any deaths or anything like that [in Pennsylvania gas drilling] but part of good leadership is about preventing a crisis from occurring,"" Mr. Sestak said. ""Congressman Toomey will always side with big business, Wall Street, big corporations. Recklessness is what causes joblessness."""
67,"WASHINGTON -- By brokering a climate deal in Copenhagen a week ago, President Barack Obama has committed himself to a more daunting task: pushing for comprehensive climate legislation in the Senate next year.\Although many senators, especially key Republicans, have shown little appetite for backing yet another ambitious bill in the aftermath of the polarizing health care debate, it is clear that enacting legislation to cap the U.S. carbon dioxide output and allow polluters to trade emission permits is essential to delivering on the pledges that Mr. Obama made to other world leaders.\In an interview with The Washington Post last week, Mr. Obama said, ""There is no doubt that energy legislation is going to be tough, but I feel very confident about making an argument to the American people that we should be a leader in clean energy technology -- that that will be one of the key engines that drives economic growth for decades to come.""\White House spokesman Ben LaBolt said the fact that ""countries like China and India set carbon-intensity targets for the first time in history"" should bolster the administration's legislative effort.\Since taking office in January, Mr. Obama and his deputies have regarded international climate talks as a way to get the sort of commitments from major emerging economies that would allow them to sell a cap-and-trade bill to skeptical lawmakers back home. As part of last week's accord, the four biggest greenhouse gas emitters in the developing world -- China, India, Brazil and South Africa -- agreed to list voluntary climate targets as part of an international registry and to allow third-party countries to scrutinize whether the four are making the emission cuts they say they are.\""That was the strategy all along,"" said Mark Helmke, a senior adviser to Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., whose vote could be critical to passing a climate bill. ""In that context, it was a home run.""\But it is unclear whether that achievement -- which came at the expense of getting more ambitious overall climate targets and a clear deadline for a legally binding treating next year -- will translate into passage of the bill the administration is seeking.\Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, the top Republican on the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and another swing vote, called language in the Copenhagen deal allowing for verification of developing countries' carbon cuts ""a very small step forward.""\""Right now, the big question is whether the Senate, as a whole, can sit down and craft real bipartisan legislation that protects both the economy and the environment,"" she added. ""We need to find ways to move forward in a bipartisan effort that makes sense for America, regardless of whether the rest of the world follows through or not.""\In the wake of the health care debate, winning Republican support for such a bill is crucial, even if it might mean adding provisions favored by the nuclear and oil industry, or scaling back the legislation's scope."
68,"U.S. Rep. Bill Shuster, R- Hollidaysburg, is seeking his sixth full term representing the 9th District. \The 49-year-old former car dealer was first elected in a 2001 special election to the seat held previously by his father Bud Shuster. \His campaign has more than $260,000 after spending $547,287 this election cycle to Oct. 22, according to OpenSecrets.org. He has raised just half of what the average congressman has raised for reelection. His top contributors are railroads, electric utilities, building materials, construction services and lawyers. \Shuster responded to a reporter's questions by e-mail. What are the greatest challenges before Congress? \The biggest challenges facing the next Congress are the economy, job creation, and spending. \To get our economy back on track, we must put an end to the massive uncertainty that has kept business holding back billions of dollars that could be invested in creating jobs. Unprecedented government intervention in our economy, out of control spending, the threat of massive tax increases, a government takeover of our health care system, and the potential of a crippling national energy tax in the form of ""cap and trade"" have all contributed to our current problems. \It is vital to restore confidence back into the American economy. As a first step we must extend the tax relief of 2001 and 2003 and take the looming threat of giant tax hikes off the table. We must eliminate bureaucratic red tape, end lawsuit abuse, promote innovation and investment, and invest in education. \We also need to put the brakes on runaway federal spending. Since President Obama was elected to office, our national debt has grown by over $2.4 trillion and now stands at over $13 trillion. We must stop this insane spending and stop it now. These two important steps will put us back on the path to fiscal sanity and will restore confidence in our economy and the way we govern. \The impacts of the Democrats' health care law will also need to be addressed. I am committed to repealing ""Obamacare"" and the devastating mandates it has placed on America's employers and replacing it with common sense reforms that protect the doctor-patient relationship, curb costs, and reform out of control lawsuit abuse. \Have federal stimulus packages helped the national and local economies? \I opposed the ""stimulus"" that has failed to help our economy recover. President Obama promised the American people that his stimulus plan would hold unemployment below 8 percent. That promise was broken and the national unemployment rate continues to hover around 10 percent. President Obama and congressional Democrats promised that the stimulus would be focused on ""shovel ready"" infrastructure projects to create jobs and economic output. In reality, only 7 percent of the $862 billion slated for the stimulus actually went to transportation and infrastructure projects and much of that money has still yet to be spent. The remainder of the stimulus funds were not directed at fixing the economy, but was spent to create hundreds of new federal government entities and became a grab-bag for special interests, not American jobs. \Would you vote for more federal money being pumped into the economy in that way? \The simple fact is that under the leadership of President Obama and Speaker Pelosi, our government taxes too much, spends too much, and borrows too much. It is impossible to spend our way to prosperity. What we need are pro-growth policies that instill confidence back into our economy and allow the private sector to spur investment and create jobs. We also need to focus on letting families keep more of their hard earned dollars at home instead of sending them to Washington. With families across the 9th district forced to tighten their budgets, the federal government must do the same. More wasteful spending is not the answer. \What impact do you intend to make in Congress? \I am focused on fostering economic development for our region. I am proud of our accomplishments and plan to continue working with state, local, and community leaders to pursue opportunities for job creation and economic growth. \As a former small business owner, I know first hand the importance of maintaining a business friendly environment to spur job creation and economic development. To spur economic growth we need to keep taxes low. The best thing we can do to help grow Pennsylvania's economy is to expand pro-growth policies. \Investing in our infrastructure will also be vital to our success. Improving existing infrastructure and investing in new projects is vital to stimulating growth and providing access and opportunity to economic development. \In addition, as the 9th district's primary customer service representative to the federal government, I am proud of the thousands of constituents my office has helped and remained focused on providing the highest level of constituent service to families in central and western Pennsylvania. \How closely aligned to your party values do you perceive yourself to be? \As a strong conservative I have long stood for the cornerstone values of limited government, individual freedom, and a strong national defense. Like Ronald Reagan, I believe bigger, more intrusive government is not the answer to America's challenges and that more government is not the answer to our problems and more often than not can be the cause of them. I am also proud of my 100 percent pro-life record and staunch support for our Second Amendment rights. \Moving forward, I am proud to be a supporter of the House Republicans' ""Pledge to America"" -- an outline for how House Republicans plan to create jobs, end economic uncertainty, make American more competitive, reduce spending, repeal and replace the government takeover of health care reform, restore trust, and keep our nation secure at home and abroad. \If the tea party were a political party, would you still consider yourself a Republican or would you belong to the Tea Party? Why? \The Tea Party is a significant movement for limited, constitutional government that is a direct response to the massive growth of government we have seen under the leadership of President Obama and the Democrat controlled Congress. One of the Tea Party's greatest strengths is its independence as a true grassroots movement. I am proud to be a strong conservative and have always focused on standing for our shared central Pennsylvania values. I share many of the Tea Party's goals and ideas and believe they correspond with many of the same values and philosophies represented by the Republican Party. \How is your voting record in line with the voters of the 9th District? \I have always been proud to stand for our shared central Pennsylvania values. I am focused on keeping America safe, lowering taxes, growing jobs, and protecting family values, and I am proud of our successes in these areas. \I have spent numerous hours traveling our district. As a life-long resident of Pennsylvania, I know our region well and I am proud to raise my family here. As I regularly make my way across the district, meeting with constituents in forums as varied as one-on-one encounters at the grocery store, town hall meetings, speaking in our children's classrooms, open office hours, and even online interactions through new technologies, I keep in close communication with families in the 9th District and welcome their input and feedback on what they expect of me as their representative in Congress. \I share the commonsense conservative values held by those of us living in central and western Pennsylvania. I am committed to these values and my votes in Congress reflect my strong convictions and the values of the people I am so proud to represent. \What is unique about your district? \One of the most unique aspects of the 9th congressional district is its size. The 9th district stretches across a wide swath of some of the most beautiful countryside Pennsylvania and our nation has to offer. In total, the district includes all or parts of 15 counties from Fayette County in the west to the Susquehanna River near Harrisburg in the east, and from the Maryland border north to Clearfield County. The breadth of the district encompasses constituents with wide ranging needs and interests with a mixture of rural, urban, and suburban areas. This sets the 9th district apart from other congressional districts in Pennsylvania that are smaller and have more concentrated populations in areas like Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. \When the House is not in session, I spend my time traveling from county to county meeting with community leaders, elected officials, farmers, small business owners, school groups, and Pennsylvania families. A typical day can easily have me starting in Blair County to meet on economic development issues, then to Bedford country for constituent office hours, and ending in Franklin County to meet with dairy farmers. Covering this wide area is a unique, but greatly rewarding challenge. \William ""Bill"" Shuster \Party: Republican \Seeking: sixth term in Congress, representing Pennsylvania's 9th District \Family: wife, Rebecca, and two children, Ali and Garrett \From: Hollidaysburg\Credit: Public Opinion Online"
69,"WASHINGTON -- As a pair of senators introduced their long-awaited climate-change legislation yesterday to a cheering crowd on the front lawn of the Capitol, Pennsylvania's senatorial delegation said it is not yet on board with the effort.\Sens. Arlen Specter and Bob Casey, both Democrats, yesterday said the bill doesn't address their concerns about coal and other Pennsylvania industries that could be harmed by cap-and-trade legislation. Combined with a stiff Republican front, any Democratic defections would be enough to kill legislation in a chamber where 60 votes are needed to avoid a filibuster.\The Clean Energy Jobs and American Power Act, introduced by Sens. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., and John Kerry, D-Mass., imposes tougher greenhouse-gas emissions reductions than its House counterpart, a bill that squeaked through in June. It mandates a 20 percent reduction in greenhouse gases by 2020 and an 83 percent reduction by 2050.\Ms. Boxer boasted of a stronger coalition of business interests on board with the Senate bill. It does make more concessions to industry by providing funding and incentives for carbon capture and storage technology, natural gas and nuclear power. The bill also leaves a crucial question open for debate: how to allocate emissions permits, which constitute the basis for the cap-and-trade market.\Mr. Kerry and Ms. Boxer touted the bill as a deficit-neutral mechanism to create so-called green jobs -- which they estimated at 2 million nationwide -- while reducing funding for America's enemies through oil profits, in addition to environmental gains.\They were joined by 10 other senators at the rally, but not by Mr. Casey or Mr. Specter. A spokeswoman for Mr. Specter -- who sits on the Environment and Public Works Committee, which will weigh the bill -- said the senator had planned on attending, but that the event conflicted with a National Institutes of Health funding announcement in Maryland that also drew President Barack Obama.\Mr. Specter issued a statement expressing his general support for fighting climate change ""in a way that is economically responsible, environmentally effective and encourages action by other countries to achieve these goals.""\But he listed a few provisions in the bill that he feels need to be strengthened during his committee's deliberations, including more funding for carbon capture and sequestration (the bill now provides $10 billion) and more protection for steel and other heavy industry against foreign competition.\Ms. Boxer read Mr. Specter's positive statement to the crowd and noted that he wanted some changes, adding: ""It's very technical. But that's Arlen -- he's thorough.""\Mr. Casey said in an interview, ""I can't count myself as a 'no' yet, but we're trying to work through some of these issues."" He said he still must analyze the entire bill, but he'd like to see more help for the coal industry, in addition to protections for workers who might lose their jobs as industries shed payroll to pay for carbon permits. As for an emissions caps, Mr. Casey said he'd prefer the 17 percent reduction by 2020 that the House bill calls for.\It has been tough to wrangle into the cap-and-trade fold Democrats from manufacturing states, including Pennsylvania's Rep. Jason Altmire, D-McCandless, who voted against the bill in the House. Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., issued a statement yesterday saying he couldn't vote for the Kerry-Boxer bill until he sees more help for the coal industry. \And that's just from the left side of the aisle.\A group of Republican senators held a news conference blasting the bill as a job-killer and called it ""the largest tax increase in American history,"" in the words of Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla. The Republicans said they would rather invest money in efficiency and alternative energy, while also exploring more domestic fossil fuels through offshore drilling and other means.\Republicans don't want emissions caps and a market for the right to pollute because, they said, utility companies will just pass on those costs to consumers at a time when they can ill afford it.\Still, Mr. Kerry said he has not given up on the minority party. ""I'm convinced there are a number of Republicans who want to get this over the finish line, and we're going to continue to work with them,"" he said after the rally, in which no Republicans participated.\Some business interests have sided with the legislation, arguing that if no bill passes, the Environmental Protection Agency could impose harsher -- and more unpredictable -- restrictions under the Clean Air Act. EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson yesterday took a step in that direction, announcing a proposed rule to force large polluters to obtain permits which show that they are using the best technologies and energy-efficiency measures to control pollution.\""We can begin reducing emissions from the nation's largest greenhouse gas emitting facilities without placing an undue burden on the businesses that make up the vast majority of our economy,"" Ms. Jackson said. ""We know the corner coffee shop is no place to look for meaningful carbon reductions.""\Much of the rhetoric in favor of climate-change legislation involves casting the United States as a leader in reducing greenhouse gases, to prod other nations to do the same. Many environmental groups are pressing to have a final bill before December's climate-change summit in Copenhagen.\Mr. Kerry said he's optimistic that his climate bill, as well as the controversial healthcare legislation, can pass before then, but he said a successful Copenhagen summit doesn't depend on it.\""I've talked to all of the [environmentally concerned global] leaders,"" he said. ""They are pretty much in agreement that if we are moving in a serious way, if we are showing our good faith here, the president is supportive of it and we're simply stalled by virtue of time on the floor, that's not going to have a negative impact. The seriousness of purpose is what's going to be measured.\""Clearly, it's better to have it [the legislation] done, because the signal is more direct and clear, and our hope is to be there. But I don't want to get locked into something that we don't have control over."""

Congressional candidate Malcolm Derk began serving on the Freeburg Borough Council at age 19.
\
After six years on the council, including two as its president, Derk became a Snyder County commissioner.
\
Today, Derk, 27, is running for Congress in the 10th District as a Republican and hopes to face off against incumbent Chris Carney in the election this November.
\
""I can say, with a proven record, that I am young, but I am not inexperienced,"" Derk said in a recent interview conducted by The Daily Review.
\
Nobody in the race for Congress in the 10th District, including Carney, ""has a record of balancing budgets without tax increases,"" Derk said. ""I have that record, and I have that experience.
\
""I balance $15 million budgets"" as a Snyder County commissioner, said Derk, who added that he has been a Snyder County commissioner since January 2008. ""I have a proven record as a fiscal conservative. I have never raised the taxes for the people of Snyder County.""
\
Derk said he was still a student at Susquehanna University in Selinsgrove when he began serving on the Freeburg Borough Council.
\
How did he become a borough council member at age 19?
\
""I was always involved in the community,"" Derk explained. ""I was involved in the Scouting program. I'm an Eagle Scout. I think the community realized I was interested in community service.""
\
Derk said that one of the accomplishments he is proudest of as a council member was the council's work to convert an elementary school that was no longer used by the local school district into a community center. After being acquired by the borough, it has been used, for example, as a senior center and a site for community basketball games, and a new playground for children has been installed at the site, he said.
\
After graduating from Susquehanna University in 2005, he went to work for the university, first in its business office, and then in its University Relations Office, where his duties included working with donors and doing fundraising to build up the college's endowment.
\
Derk said that when he was elected Snyder County commissioner, he gave up his job for Susquehanna University.
\
""Many people I talked to when I was running for commissioner thought that the commissioner's position should be full-time,"" Derk said. ""It hasn't always been that way. But I did commit that if I were elected that I would give up other employment to give my full-time attention to the county.""
\
Derk said his full-time job as a commissioner puts him at a disadvantage in the race for the Republican nomination for Congress.
\
""I've been campaigning on nights and weekend,"" Derk said. ""I think it makes it difficult when some other candidates may be able to give their full-time commitment to campaigning.""
\
Derk says he is pro-life and supports gun-owners' rights.
\
""I'm strongly pro-Second Amendment,"" Derk said. ""I do hunt.""
\
Derk said it is not government's role to create jobs. Instead, government needs to create an environment where businesses can thrive and thus provide jobs to the citizens, he said.
\
And the current federal government has advanced policies that add costs to businesses, such as cap-and-trade legislation, which would increase electricity rates for businesses and individuals, and the health care legislation that was signed into law earlier this year, he said.
\
Derk said he opposed the health care legislation.
\
He said that among the health care reforms that are needed are tort reform.
\
""I support tort reform because I believe many times doctors are forced to practice defensive medicine, perhaps order test after test when in fact it adds to the cost of health care,"" Derk said. ""And certainly there are a share of frivolous suits.""
\
Derk said he also supports tax credits to help self-employed people buy health insurance. And he said that people should be able to buy health insurance over state lines.
\
""I think competition is important to bring costs down,"" Derk said. ""If we were allowed to buy insurance over state lines, that would be a move in the right direction. If you were able to shop around when you were buying coverage, you would have more options, you would be able to look at plans offered in other states.""
\
Derk also said the United States' national debt is a ""huge concern for me as a member of the younger generation. We're mortgaging the future of future generations, and that's a big concern.""
\
Derk said that one of the ways he would address the national debt would be to end the distribution of the $787 billion federal stimulus package.
\
""Estimates I have read say that 65 percent of the money has yet to be released"" from the stimulus package, Derk said. ""I say, why not keep it in the Treasury? The whole bill was an absolute failure. We were promised when they were discussing the bill that unemployment would not go over 8 percent, if it was enacted. We all know that employment did go over 8 percent.""
\
Derk said he would work to reduce the cost of the federal government as a way to address the national debt.
\
""I am a person who believes that if you look hard enough, you will find things that aren't needed.""
\
Derk listed a number of things that the Snyder County commissioners have been able to accomplish since 2008.
\
For example, they implemented a DUI court and a drug court, he said. ""Those are courts that have proven results of reducing the number of return customers in the prison system,""
\
Since 2008, the Snyder County commissioners have also supported projects that improve public infrastructure and secured a Keystone Opportunity Expansion Zone ""to try to encourage business growth,"" he said.
\
And, faced with a court ruling that struck down tipping fees for waste haulers, which eliminated funding for the county's recycling program, the Snyder County commissioners were able to keep the recycling program in operation, without raising taxes, he said.
\
""We just had to run it (the recycling program) more efficiently,"" he said.
\
In addition, the commissioners recently created the position of community service coordinator, who will find supervised work projects for non-violent inmates in local municipalities, he said.

71,"
WASHINGTON -- In a sparsely furnished office with nothing to soften its bright white walls, Pat Toomey fidgets. He's ""really ready to get down to work"" as Pennsylvania's new Republican senator, but he has to endure today's ceremony of inaugural day for the 112th Congress.
\
It's a weighty agenda that Toomey, 49, vows to tackle with colleagues. This Congress will aim to fix problems that affect the economy and joblessness, he says, and to keep the Obama administration from proceeding with its agenda.
\
""Washington's role is not to make jobs, but it should create an environment where people across Pennsylvania will create jobs,"" Toomey says. ""The way to do that is to first stop a legislative agenda that is having a chilling effect on the economy, like serial bailouts and proposed legislation like cap-and-trade, card check.""
\
Toomey, a Lehigh Valley businessman, returns to the Capitol after a stint in the U.S. House from 1999 to 2005. He won the Senate seat in November by just 2 percentage points over Joe Sestak, a Democratic congressman. A Harvard University grad with a political science degree, Toomey is a consistent advocate of reducing or eliminating taxes and publicly opposed the 2009 federal stimulus bill.
\
His family is here for the pomp and circumstance: wife Kris, children Bridget, 10, Patrick, 8, and Duncan, 8 months, as well as his parents, five siblings with spouses and children, and a contingent of relatives from Rhode Island, where he grew up.
\
""It will be great to be surrounded by the family, but what I am really looking forward to is really getting down to work,"" Toomey repeats.
\
He's frustrated that he and other freshmen senators don't know their committee assignments. ""We are way behind; this is actually very unfortunate,"" he sighs.
\
It's problematic that Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky haven't negotiated committee designations because it makes a difference when hiring staff, Toomey says: ""You don't know which experts to hire.""
\
He'd like to serve on the Senate Finance Committee, but the powerful committee doesn't accept freshmen. So he set his sights on Banking or Budget and Commerce, or both, ""which would be good for Pennsylvania,"" he says.
\
Still, Toomey's reluctant to immediately define himself in the Senate. He points to former Texas Sen. Phil Gramm, a Republican in office from 1985 to 2002, as someone he admires because ""he really understood what makes an economy hum and was a very principled advocate for limited government and free enterprise.""
\
""Gramm made quite a stir at one time as a fiscal policy wonk who abandoned the Democratic Party for what he saw as its irresponsible tax-and-spend policies,"" says Mark Rozell, a political science professor at George Mason University. ""The trouble with the Gramm association is that the former senator lost a lot of stature with the subprime (mortgage) crisis. A lot of Republicans distanced themselves from him at that point.""
\
Toomey points to Gramm's principles because they address today's issues: ""Getting the economy moving again, and the job creation that we desperately need.""
\
In office, Toomey may not become the hard-driving, right-wing extremist portrayed in his opponent's political ads.
\
Immediately after his election in November, Toomey penned a column for USA Today with Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill, a Democrat, that recommended both parties work together to ban earmarks. He spoke in support of repealing the ""don't ask, don't tell"" clause that allows gays to serve in the military.
\
His moderate stance began in August 2009, when he supported President Obama's choice of Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, saying: ""I would vote for her confirmation because objective qualifications should matter more than ideology in the judicial confirmation process.""
\
That begs the question: Do Pennsylvanians know what they're getting with Toomey?
\
""A principled statesman,"" Keystone College political science professor Jeff Brauer says. ""Yes, he is ideologically conservative, but he is not the extremist that was painted by the Democrats during the election.""
\
Toomey says voters sent a clear message in November that they want Congress to control spending and focus on job creation.
\
""Now, with a majority in the House and a much stronger Republican presence in the Senate, legislation on things like card check and cap-and-trade aren't going to happen,"" he says, but with the caveat that the Obama administration could enact such policies at the agency level.
\
""If Toomey is serious as projecting himself as Mr. Fiscal Responsibility, that will diminish his political standing,"" predicts Bert Rockman, a political science professor at Purdue University in Indiana. ""It's not an easy task to stay in that role.""
\
A moderate approach makes sense, Rockman says. Toomey needs to start out by working with his Pennsylvania Senate colleague, Democratic Sen. Bob Casey Jr.
\
Toomey says he looks forward to that. ""We have vacancies on the federal bench that require appointments, which requires a collaborative effort, so that will be a good beginning of our relationship,"" he says.
\
Casey told the Tribune-Review last month that he looks forward to working with Toomey on issues that will affect Pennsylvania, such as education and energy, noting: ""There are a lot of places where we can come together, where party affiliation doesn't have to get in the way of progress.""
\
Because conservative Republicans ousted primarily moderate Democrats, and not liberals, in November's election, this could be a divisive Congress. Yet, Toomey believes there will be plenty of instances in which bipartisan approaches evolve.
\
""I am sure that there are a lot of Democratic senators that were paying careful attention to the election that just happened,"" he says. ""The American people spoke pretty clearly: They were not happy with the path that we were on. So, hopefully, there will be a significant amount of Democratic senators looking for ways to cooperate with new guys like me, as well as the guys that have been around here for a while.""
\
He may be right about that, Brauer says.
\
""Everyone seems poised to finally address the deficits that have plagued federal budgets,"" he says. ""We may finally get that done now.""

At a candidates' forum on Thursday in Towanda, the three Republicans running for Congress in the 10th Congressional District answered questions about health care reform, U.S. energy policy, the bailouts of U.S. companies, and other matters.
\
Printed below are excerpts of their answers to some of these questions, as well as excerpts of their opening statements.
\
Some parts of the forum were previously covered in an article in Friday's issue of The Daily Review.
\
The three candidates seeking the Republican nomination for Congress in the 10th District are business consultant David Madeira, former U.S. Attorney Thomas Marino, and Snyder County Commissioner Malcolm Derk.
\
On May 18, Republican voters will decide which of these three candidates will face off against incumbent Chris Carney in the November election.
\
The forum was sponsored by the Bradford County Republican Committee.
\
A moderator at the forum posed the questions to the candidates, who had up to two minutes to answer each question.
\
Opening statements
\
Malcolm Derk: ""I am a candidate who has proven himself as a fiscal conservative in everything I do and in all the decisions I have made for Snyder County. I balance $15 million budgets and I have never raised taxes for the people of Snyder County,"" Derk said.
\
Derk said he has lived his whole life in the 10th District.
\
""Many times politicians will come to you and tell you: 'I am a Blue Dog.' But we've come to realize that these Blue Dogs aren't all that committed to fiscal responsibility at all ... Whenever our congressional delegation votes 91 percent of the time with Nancy Pelosi, it seems quite evident that he's lost touch with the good people that are in this room tonight,"" Derk said.
\
David Madeira: ""I'm very excited about this race -- because we just spent the day at a Tea Party in Montrose. I am so excited that we are not alone in our concern for this out-of-control government. For many years, I've been saying, 'When are we going to stop the spending?'"" Madeira said.
\
Madeira said that his one-year-old daughter will owe $38,000 to help pay off the national debt. ""That's why I am running for Congress, because I believe we need to restore constitutionally limited government. We need to protect the fiscal health of our nation (by having a) government that doesn't spend money it doesn't have. We need to protect the traditional values that made this country great.""
\
Thomas Marino: Marino said he grew up in Williamsport, and that he served as an assistant district attorney and district attorney in Lycoming County, before being asked in 2002 to be the U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Pennsylvania.
\
""I am afraid for the direction in which this country is traveling,"" Marino said.
\
He said there are five issues that he is ""hearing overwhelmingly"" throughout the 10th Congressional District: the need to reduce federal spending, the need to reduce the size of the federal government, the need to lower taxes, terrorism, and the need to address ""a health care bill that is out of control.""
\
With the recent passage of the health care legislation and the possible passage of cap-and-trade legislation, do you feel the federal government has exceeded its Constitutional authority, and what is your position on the 10th Amendment?
\
Derk: ""Absolutely, they have overstepped their boundaries. We've never seen a Congress or a president that has expanded the far reach of the arm of the government like this one has. Health care has traditionally been a states' rights issue ... I am proud that our attorney general has filed a suit to try to stop this infringement,"" Derk said.
\
""If elected to Congress, I would try to repeal the health care overhaul,"" Derk said. ""Cap-and-trade is job-killing legislation,"" he continued. ""If you are a business and you are looking at adding one or two workers or an entire shift, would you do so if you're not sure of the cost of this job-killing legislation?""
\
Madeira: Madeira said that Congress does not have the authority to enact the health care legislation.
\
""I would work very hard to see that this thing (the recently passed health care legislation) is repealed as quickly as possible. Let's replace it with something that brings the consumer and the payer together so we restore the normal market forces that have been absent from health care for many, many years. I retired as a doctor of chiropractic about two years ago, because I believe the system is broken. But I think there are some simple things we can do, that don't require taking away everyone's rights, in order to improve accessibility and affordability,"" Madeira said.
\
Madeira said he is ""totally opposed"" to cap-and-trade legislation. ""It (cap-and-trade legislation) is a solution to a problem that doesn't exist.""
\
Marino: ""This administration has so far overreached its authority pursuant to the Constitution that is frightening,"" Marino said.
\
""Cap-and-trade is just another method by which the federal administration will try to find a way to tax us to make sure we are more dependant on the federal government than ever before,"" Marino said.
\
""The health care bill is a debacle. It's an embarrassment,"" Marino said.
\
""The health care bill, in my opinion, is just another step toward socialized government that -- I truly believe -- these individuals feel is best for our country,"" he said.
\
Do you feel the federal tax code needs to be overhauled and simplified? If you do, why?
\
Marino: ""Because I am in public, with ladies and gentlemen in here, I really can't tell you what I would do with the IRS,"" Marino said.
\
He said there are ""stacks and stacks of books one has to go through"" to answer a tax question.
\
""The IRS needs to be abolished as we know it today. The tax code can be very easily simplified ... This administration is continuing to tax us to death. The IRS tax code needs to be completely reworked, and we need to have a government agency that is friendly toward us, instead of prosecutorial toward us,"" Marino said.
\
Derk: ""We absolutely need to simplify the tax code,"" Derk said.
\
""It doesn't make a whole lot of sense that educated people can't often do their own taxes, because they make it so darn complicated,"" he said.
\
Another reason for simplifying the tax code is that some people can afford ""high-powered lawyers"" to find tax loopholes, whereas other people who can't afford the lawyers end up paying higher taxes, Derk said.
\
Madeira: ""We should abolish the IRS and we should force the federal government to collect taxes in a way that is more equitable, transparent, and cost effective,"" Madeira said.
\
""Almost half of Americans pay no income tax,"" he said.
\
Do you feel the United States can become energy-independent, and what do you want to see toward that end?
\
Madeira: Madeira said he believes that the United States can become energy-independent.
\
He said that market forces should determine what types of energy are used, rather than having the government ""pick winners and losers.""
\
""I understand that out West there was just recently discovered a potential reserve of oil that has enough oil to supply America's energy needs for oil and gas for 100 years,"" Madeira said, adding that it will ""take new technology"" to extract it. ""But it's there and we should explore it,"" Madeira said.
\
""I think we have to open the doors and make sure there is lots of access to energy (in the United States),"" Madeira said.
\
However, states need to make sure that the extraction of the energy ""doesn't destroy the environment,"" he said.
\
Marino: ""I'm a conservationist. I want clean water. I live out in the country on a well. I don't want anyone messing with my water ... I want clean air,"" Marino said.
\
""I've said for many years: 'Just think where we would be today if in the 1970s we took the initiative this country has always had to develop alternative sources,'"" such as wind and solar power, Marino said.
\
""I really blame the leadership of this country over the decades for not developing what we have,"" he added.
\
Marino also said the United States should be developing nuclear energy plants.
\
Derk: Derk said that natural gas from the Marcellus Shale is a ""very important part of the puzzle toward energy independence.""
\
Derk also said: ""I feel strongly that we need to consider building nuclear power plants.""
\
He said that France is more liberal than the United States, but has for many years relied on nuclear energy ""as it strives toward energy independence.""
\
Do you feel that Congress should or should not be able to exempt themselves from laws passed for the rest of us?
\
Marino: ""I'm tired of elected officials acting like they are royalty,"" Marino said.
\
Marino also described congressmen as thinking: ""That health care program that I'm jamming down your throat, that stinks, so therefore I don't want that program.""
\
He said it is ""common sense"" that Congress should have to abide by the same laws as everyone else.
\
""In November we're going to let these people know what common sense there is,"" Marino said.
\
Derk: ""I know absolutely that if I am given the privilege to represent you in Congress, I know that each and every one of you is my boss, and you tell me what to do. Under no conditions am I better than anyone else in this room. We all should be entitled to the same opportunity.""
\
Madeira: ""Let's pass a 28th amendment, which will say: 'Congress can't pass any law that applies to you and I that doesn't also apply to them,'"" Madeira said.
\
What is your definition and position on earmarks or pork?
\
Derk: ""I am sick and tired of seeing private corporations receive these earmarks. They are in effect no-bid contracts, where a congressman can award a business in his district that may have given him a few contributions over the years. They (the businesses) don't have to compete for that business ... The bidding process is important to make sure we get a less expensive product that meets our needs,"" Derk said.
\
""Earmark reform is desperately needed,"" he said. ""I would work tirelessly to make sure we cut out this waste in the federal government.""
\
Madeira: ""The merit-based spending process that all government money is supposed to go through is designed to find out where money ought to be spent, based on pre-established criteria that are open and transparent to all. Pork is just the opposite. It is money that a congressman sets aside for his district, for his constituents, for a business, a donor in his district, and in exchange he gets money back,"" Madeira said.
\
""Pork has been called the crack cocaine of spending. That is because it causes a congressman to maybe vote for a bill that isn't good, but since he is getting a piece of the pie for his special interest, he's willing to give a piece of the pie to someone else for their special interest,"" he said.
\
""I'm totally opposed to it (pork),"" Madeira said. ""I would not accept or pursue any pork, and would oppose anyone else's pork as well.""
\
Marino: ""We have the responsibility to bring back to this district what we deserve, to bring back tax money that we paid,"" Marino said.
\
A congressman in the 10th District has the responsibility to bring back to his district funds to improve schools, expand hospitals, pay for road projects, and meet other needs, he said.
\
""I would not be ashamed to introduce my own bill requesting money that we need in the 10th Congressional District,"" Marino said.
\
""I would be criticized if the district next door were getting all kinds of money for improvements ... At least I would be honest and open about it,"" Marino said.
\
Marino criticized congressmen who try to attach funding requests for their districts to large bills that have nothing to do with the funding requests.
\
Do you feel very large bankrupt companies should be allowed to fail or be bailed out by the taxpayers?
\
Madeira: ""Bankruptcy is the market purging itself,"" Madeira said.
\
Madeira said that General Motors Corp., which he referred to as ""Obama Motors,"" ""is still creating all kinds of economic problems because they are not being run efficiently.""
\
""Here's the thing about bankruptcy. Those assets don't disappear. They're still there. They just get bought up by someone else at a much reduced cost. And they get brought back into the system at a certain right-sized price that allows that business or person to be more competitive. So we would have been much better off in allowing there to be failures of these industries that didn't need to be propped up, didn't deserve to be propped up.""
\
Marino: ""I said from the beginning that I was ... totally against the bailout,"" Marino said.
\
""The bailout is nothing more than the system stepping toward a socialist government,"" he said.
\
Derk: ""Government is not in the business of choosing winners and losers,"" Derk said.
\
""The market should drive which businesses thrive and which businesses go under,"" he said.
\
In an interview on Friday, Jason Drobnyk, who is a spokesman for congressman Carney, responded to Derk's criticism of Carney, saying: ""Chris Carney is proud of his bipartisan record. He has been ranked among the most independent members of Congress in every year that he has been in office by the non-partisan National Journal magazine. In fact, this year, he was ranked the most fiscally conservative Democrat in the entire Pennsylvania congressional delegation. It is that record that led Republicans, including Sen. John McCain, to try to recruit congressman Carney in December. Chris Carney puts the district above any political party.""

73,"Don Hopey can be reached at dhopey@post-gazette.com or 412-263- 1983.\ Former Bush administration Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Christine Todd Whitman predicts the United States will respond to global climate change by enacting mandatory limits on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and industries but that no action will occur before the 2008 elections.\ Ms. Whitman, who spoke yesterday at the Air & Waste Management Association's annual conference in Pittsburgh, said she favors a cap- and-trade program over an across-the-board policy limiting emissions to reign in the greenhouse gases that exacerbate climate change.\ ""A market-based cap-and-trade program can and will work,"" she said, ""and the sooner we engage in that type of control, the better off we will be.""\ Such a program, she said, could be modeled after the successful acid rain control program. It could set a cap or limit on the total amount of carbon dioxide emitted and allow utility companies and industries to decide where to cut emissions by trading credits between those that make the reductions and those that don't.\ Ms. Whitman said global warming is ""not a partisan issue,"" and a federal response makes more sense than the ""patchwork quilt"" of state regulations and programs that have filled a vacuum created by the Bush administration's inaction.\ ""Most of the states would adopt federal greenhouse gas limits if Congress acts,"" she said, ""but carbon regulation probably won't happen before 2008. We need to be ready to go once the election is over.""\ Ms. Whitman said the nation's greenhouse gas control policy should include a new emphasis on nuclear power and encourage people to buy hybrid vehicles to reduce mobile source pollution.\ Government should also be encouraging development of renewable energy sources and use of alternative fuels, she said, but not corn- based ethanol production, which is inefficient to produce, transport and burn and is driving up food prices.\ ""It's a case of political science trumping actual science,"" she told an audience that was much friendlier than the one she had faced Monday in Washington, D.C., where her testimony to a congressional committee about air quality in New York City following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attack was booed by rescue workers. She declined to discuss that topic yesterday.\ Her speech was the third to address greenhouse gas issues at the four-day conference of the Pittsburgh-based, not-for-profit organization of environmental professionals, and reflects the gathering's focus on climate change.\ At a panel discussion yesterday titled ""Climate Change: Electric Power Industry Perspectives,"" there was consensus that such a change is occurring, and human-produced emissions are having a major impact. Discourse focused on how greenhouse gas emission controls should best be imposed.\ Ray Butts, manager of environmental services for Florida Power and Light, said the 65 percent to 70 percent reductions in carbon dioxide emissions needed to stabilize atmospheric carbon can be achieved only by mandatory limits on all sources: utility companies, industries and vehicles.\ He said his company and the Climate Action Partnership, a joint utility, business and environment advocacy group, favor enactment of a federal carbon fee that would ""change the behavior"" of polluters and provide money to support research and development on new technology to capture and sequester carbon emissions.\ Martin Smith, manager of energy policy for Xcel Energy, which has 3.3 million customers in eight Western states and uses coal for almost half of its fuel, said a carbon tax penalizes companies that use a lot of coal. Instead, he proposed they meet clean energy portfolio standards that require they get a minimum of 20 percent to 25 percent of their fuel from clean and renewable sources."

President Obama's call for new nuclear power development recognizes a perfect storm of problems and opportunities.
\
Obama always has favored renewed nuke development, but his proposal to guarantee financing for nuclear plant construction is a major step that adds urgency to the process.
\
America's 104 nuclear power plants in 31 states not only produce 20 percent of the nation's power, but 70 percent of the nation's power that does not produce greenhouse gases.
\
Other forms of non-polluting energy production are important, including wind and solar, but nuclear plants are the only non-polluting source that can produce massive amounts of power 24 hours a day regardless of weather conditions.
\
New nuke construction also would be a form of long-term job creation, in terms of design, construction and plant operation and support.
\
Politically, nuclear plant construction is more viable that at any time since the industry went into hibernation following the 1979 accident at Three Mile Island. Congress has not embraced the administration's complex cap-and-trade proposal for greenhouse gas reductions. Nukes ensure reduced emissions and reliable power production, and the proposed guarantees offer a basis for a compromise on other aspects of environmental and energy legislation.
\
Congress already has authorized $18.5 billion in loan guarantees for new plants. The money is not in the form of direct spending; rather it enables nuclear plant developers to obtain financing.
\
Another advantage of renewed nuclear construction is that it is still an American industry. Companies such as Westinghouse and General Electric are global leaders, but have had to rely on foreign markets.
\
Reviving the industry also is important because some older plants will have to come off line at the end of their operating lives, just as power demand justifies new plants. The industry will not only construct new plants but replace old plants.
\
The key question regarding nuclear plants is waste disposal. In addition to authorizing new plants, Congress and the administration also should embrace reprocessing techniques that allow most fuel to be reused and rendered incapable of being used for weapons.
\
Nuclear power is a partial answer to many questions facing the economy and environment. The administration, Congress and the industry quickly should jump-start its renewal.

"
77," Welcome to another week of life in Pennsylvania, where one hand does one thing and the other tries to stop it.\ On Monday, the commonwealth joined 15 other states in filing a new petition in federal court challenging the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's mercury pollution rules. The states are challenging the so-called ""cap-and-trade"" rule that allows utility companies to buy credits from power plants that have lower emissions rather than installing their own mercury emissions controls.\ This is more than academic for Pennsylvania, where power plants have the second-highest mercury emissions in the nation. State Environmental Protection Secretary Kathleen A. McGinty rightly said: ""The federal rule is hopelessly flawed.""\ On Tuesday, the state Senate voted 40-10 in favor of legislation that would block the Rendell administration's efforts to set its own tougher standards on mercury emissions. Senate Bill 1201 would have the perverse effect of making the commonwealth embrace the federal approach -- the very one being challenged by Pennsylvania and the other states in court.\ Mercury is a dangerous neurotoxin. Unlike other airborne contaminants, it has a nasty habit of depositing locally rather than far and wide. Fishermen should be particularly concerned, because mercury finds its way into rivers and lakes and hence into the food chain. Pregnant women, babies and children are also at special risk.\ It takes a special sort of irresponsibility to slight these risks to ordinary Pennsylvanians by insisting on weaker standards, but sadly the Senate was up to the task. An unholy alliance of utility companies and certain unions has persuaded many lawmakers that the state shouldn't pass tougher rules to deal with a problem that is bigger here than elsewhere.\ Fears of higher business costs are always raised against the cause of environmental protection -- and the sky never seems to fall. If this bill passes, the sky will drip mercury emissions for a longer time than necessary, but who cares about that?\ Not too many in the Senate, it seems. Locally, to their credit, Democratic Sens. Jim Ferlo and Jay Costa saw the need to put the public interest ahead of that of the special interests and vote against the bill. The House must do better than this. Who do they represent anyway -- utility companies or the people of Pennsylvania who want a safe environment?"
78,"Don Hopey can be reached at dhopey@post-gazette.com or 412-263- 1983.\ Pennsylvania moved a step closer to reducing unhealthy mercury emissions from its coal-fired power plants yesterday when the Environmental Quality Board approved new state rules that are tougher than federal standards.\ The new rules, pushed by the Rendell administration and opposed by the utility companies, coal industry and state Senate Republicans, will cut emissions of the neurotoxin mercury by 80 percent by 2010 and by 90 percent by 2015.\ The Environmental Quality Board, dominated by Rendell administration appointees, voted 17-3 to approve the tougher mercury controls, which were supported by all but three dozen of the almost 11,000 responses collected during a recent public comment period.\ ""This is a tremendous victory for public health, the environment and our economy,"" Gov. Ed Rendell said. ""Efforts to attract new investment and keep young people here are undermined as families and businesses understand that Pennsylvania is laden with more toxic mercury pollution than nearly anywhere else in the U.S. Our residents deserve better.""\ The federal mercury regulation requires a 70 percent reduction in mercury emissions by 2018, but allows smaller, older power plants to avoid installing any controls if they purchase ""credits"" from other power plants that have reduced emissions by more than required.\ That so-called ""cap and trade"" program is absent from the Rendell administration's rule because power companies could avoid retrofitting some plants in Pennsylvania and still meet federal standards by purchasing credits from newer plants in other states. Such a system could also perpetuate mercury ""hot spots"" located downwind from plants operating without mercury controls.\ Pennsylvania and 20 other states have sued the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in federal court claiming that provision would hurt their efforts to reduce mercury emissions.\ Before it can go into effect, the state rule must pass review by the five-member Independent Regulatory Review Commission within the next 30 days. Such an approval would allow the state to meet the Nov. 17 federal filing deadline for reporting its reduction plan.\ A dozen states are in the process of adopting mercury emissions controls that are stronger than those contained in federal regulations passed in July 2005, but Pennsylvania would be the first major coal-producing state in that group, a major issue for many opponents of the rule, who also question the health benefits.\ State Sen. Mary Jo White, one of the three quality board ""no"" votes on the mercury rule and the Republican chairwoman of the Senate Environmental Resources and Energy Committee, said it will provide no health or environmental benefits and could damage the state coal industry.\ Ms. White has authored a bill that would reduce mercury emissions by 86 percent but, like the federal regulation, would permit power plants that can't meet reduced emission limits to buy credits from those that can.\ The Electric Power Generation Association, a utility company lobbying group in Harrisburg, was also critical of the Rendell rule, saying it will threaten electricity reliability and increase consumer costs. It also proposed a mercury control plan that contains the same reductions and time frame as the Rendell rule, but includes a cap and trade provision.\ Pennsylvania's utility plants and industries emit more than 5 tons of mercury a year, second only to Texas and just ahead of Ohio, which sends some of its emissions into Pennsylvania on prevailing winds.\ Mercury is a neurotoxin that moves from the air into the soil and water, changes into methyl mercury, and is ingested by fish, which are eaten by people. Such exposure can be especially harmful to pregnant women, babies and children, and can cause attention and language deficits, memory loss, autism, mental retardation and impaired vision.\ Because of elevated mercury levels, a one-meal-a-week consumption advisory for all fish caught in Pennsylvania waters has been in effect since April 2001.\ It will cost the state's 36 coal-fired power plants an estimated $223 million to install the necessary mercury controls, and cost each residential customer about $13 extra a year.\ Another cost could be a reduced demand for Pennsylvania coal, which contains twice as much mercury as coal mined in West Virginia and Kentucky, and five times as much as Western states' coal.\ A study done for the coal industry found it could reduce the sale of Pennsylvania coal by 85 million tons over nine years, said George Ellis, president of the Pennsylvania Coal Association.\ ""DEP says the federal rule is discriminatory to Pennsylvania coal, but we think this state rule will discourage use of Pennsylvania coal because of our high mercury content,"" Mr. Ellis said. ""And some of the older, smaller coal-fired power plants in the state could shut down rather than install expensive emission reduction equipment."""

As an environmentalist, I was among the first to get a hybrid car, which helped me be among the first to admit that government-imposed fuel standards -- known as Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) -- don't work.
\
Before I bought my 2001 Toyota Prius (which gets 46 mpg), I drove my old, low-mileage Suzuki rarely because I wanted to save on gas and pollution. I opted to commute as much as possible on my bicycle, as well as ride it for pleasure. Then I picked up the Prius. Before I knew it, I seemed to be driving everywhere.
\
I was proof of economist David Greene's ""rebound effect"" -- that buyers of high-mileage vehicles drive more. With high-mileage cars, we pollute less per mile but we cancel that benefit by spending more time behind the wheel.
\
The fact is that after more than 30 years of CAFE, oil consumption, pollution and traffic congestion have soared; automakers have found ways around the tightest standards.
\
The U.S. Senate can hold CAFE hearings and chide Detroit. The president can say we'll be saved by ethanol or hydrogen. Presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain can claim that ""cap-and-trade"" systems are the answer. But all this falls apart when anyone does any real analysis of Americans' ""love affair with the automobile.""
\
We have about 226 million vehicles in this country. Will any of these efforts make families throw away the huge investments in their cars? No. But the real solution does lie with drivers; we must be pushed to realize the impact of our ""drive at the drop of a hat"" attitude.
\
We inhabitants of Earth are melting glaciers and raising sea levels at a frightening rate because we're spewing so much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The U.S. is fighting overseas, in part, because that's where the oil is. We Americans import 12.2 million barrels daily and put about 60 percent of that in our fuel tanks while we, with 5 percent of the world's population and 2.7 percent of the world's oil reserves, use 26 percent of its oil.
\
A major mitigation to all these problems is getting Americans to drive less. The way to do that is to build substitutions for driving. The way to build efficient substitutions such as mass transit and hiking and biking paths is from higher gasoline and diesel taxes.
\
The cars with the world's highest gas mileage are in Italy, a country that also has the some of the world's highest gas taxes. For decades, Europeans, overall, have used gasoline taxes to build better-developed mass transit and more bike and pedestrian trails.
\
Let's call America's higher gas tax a ""user fee."" Every fiscal quarter, the user fee should go up a dime (40 cents a year) until the fee reaches the average amount of Europe's gasoline ""user fees.""
\
This won't destroy the U.S. economy. And it requires no new bureaucracy because, after all, gas is already taxed. Revenues from this user fee should go toward construction of mass transit and hiking and biking trails, as well as a publicity campaign that connects excess driving with traffic congestion, pollution, global warming, peak oil and foreign-policy issues.
\
Drivers first will complain but will adjust. We'll walk in our own neighborhoods, rather than go for a ""mall walk."" We'll consider taking mass transit or carpooling for long commutes. When we go car shopping, we'll think, ""Gas taxes are going up. I think I'll buy a high-mileage car -- or try new technology.""
\
An incremental gasoline user fee would accomplish what CAFE hasn't been able to -- to reduce oil consumption and, hence, pollution, global warming and the $250 billion annual tab for importing oil.
\
The benefits of a healthier environment, less energy dependence and decreased congestion would be well worth the cost of the tax.

80,"Don Hopey can be reached at dhopey@post-gazette.com or at 412-263- 1983.\ Fish from Pennsylvania lakes all show elevated levels of mercury, according to an environmental group's analysis of federal test results, and almost half the fish sampled were unsafe for consumption by women of childbearing age.\ The study found that 55 percent of the fish sampled nationwide were contaminated with mercury at levels that exceed safe consumption levels for women and 76 percent exceed the safe mercury limit for children or younger.\ The report, which analyzed data collected from 1999 through 2001 by the federal Environmental Protection Agency for its ongoing lake fish contamination study, was prepared by Clear the Air, an environmental organization campaigning against pollution from dirty power plants. It was released in Pittsburgh yesterday by PennEnvironment, a public interest advocacy organization.\ Sudha Nandagopal, PennEnvironment outreach coordinator, said a Bush administration proposal that would give power plants flexibility in cutting emissions would permit utilities to emit 67 times more mercury nationwide than present Clean Air Act regulations allow.\ ""The public comment period for the administration's regulatory proposal has closed, but Congress must still approve them, and we are asking Pennsylvania's senators to take a stand against mercury pollution,"" Nandagopal said. ""It should be regulated as the Clean Air Act requires.""\ Mercury is released into the air when coal is burned. It falls to the ground and is washed into or falls into streams, rivers and lakes, where it accumulates in the tissues of plants and animals as methylmercury, the most toxic and harmful form of mercury.\ Coal- and oil-burning utilities emit 48 tons of mercury annually, about 40 percent of the nation's mercury pollution, and are the largest single source.\ Other industrial sources, including municipal and medical waste incinerators, have reduced their mercury emissions by more than 90 percent since 1990.\ Human exposure is primarily through eating contaminated fish. Pregnant women, children, subsistence fishermen and recreational anglers are most at risk for health effects that include brain and nervous system damage in children and heart and immune system damage for adults.\ Dr. Robbie Ali, director of the Center for Healthy Environments and Communities at the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of Public Health, said scientific evidence shows that exposure to even small amounts of mercury can harm children and their intellectual development.\ ""It's important that people, especially pregnant women, become aware of the risks of eating certain fish,"" Ali said.\ A one-meal-a-week consumption advisory for all fish caught in Pennsylvania waterways has been in effect since April 2001.\ The 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act exempted utilities from mercury controls, but subsequent EPA scientific studies led to a decision in December 2000 to regulate the metal as a toxic pollutant.\ The Bush administration, with the support of utilities, is seeking to reclassify mercury and regulate it under a less- stringent section of the federal air pollution law.\ The administration's proposal backs off imposing mercury controls at all of the nation's 1,100 coal- and oil-fired power plants in favor of a cap-and-trade system that would allow utilities to reduce mercury emissions from some plants but not others. Its goals are reductions of 14 tons or 30 percent by 2010 and 70 percent by 2018. Its cost to the utilities is estimated at $5 billion.\ The Electric Reliability Coordinating Council, a coalition of utilities, reacted to the environmental group's release by saying that mercury emissions from power plants are declining, stricter regulations will cost electricity consumers money and the administration's proposals are the ""smartest and most effective ways"" to regulate mercury emissions.\ The Bush regulatory proposal made in December falls short of the 90 percent reduction in mercury emissions by 2008 proposed by the Clinton administration and endorsed in December 2001 by Bush's first EPA administrator, Christine Todd Whitman.\ The Bush plan would not require any reductions in the more than 7,400 pounds of mercury and mercury compounds emitted by the state's older, dirtier, coal-fired utilities. It also would not require emissions reductions at Reliant Energy's Keystone power plant in Shelocta, Armstrong County, which released 1,800 pounds of mercury in 2001 -- more than any other power plant in the nation.\ Pennsylvania ranks third behind Texas and North Carolina for the amount of mercury released from power plants.\ ""Power plants could reduce mercury emissions at a relatively low cost,"" Ali said. ""But this cost is still an amount of money that utility companies won't spend unless they have to, and the problem is that the current administration's proposal will mean that they won't have to."""
81,"With the flick of a switch, Pittsburgh office workers could reduce global-warming pollution by the equivalent of taking 54,000 cars off the roads -- permanently. \A 20 percent energy savings from modest acts like turning off lights at night and managing heat and air conditioning systems would be easy to accomplish. Another 10 to 20 percent reduction is possible with a minimal investment by commercial building owners. These kinds of goals would be encouraged and rewarded by the energy and climate bill pending before Congress. \The bill, called the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009, sets out a common-sense strategy for reducing the pollution that is warming our planet and for weaning our nation off the fossil fuels that enrich foreign countries. \A key part of the strategy is to greatly improve energy efficiency, which means cutting energy waste and doing more with less energy. The bill also sets forth energy-efficiency requirements for new buildings and provides tax and other incentives to existing building owners to invest in energy-conserving features. \Buildings use nearly 40 percent of all energy consumed in the United States and contribute a similar percentage of greenhouse-gas emissions. In cities, buildings typically produce 70 percent or more of emissions. \Pittsburgh's 56.2 million square feet of office space uses more than 1.6 billion kilowatt hours of electricity annually. Cutting use by one-quarter would save nearly 300,000 metric tons of greenhouse-gas emissions every year, equal to the emissions from 54,000 cars. \The ACES bill would reward such efficiencies by creating a cap-and-trade system that would put a slowly declining limit on the greenhouse-gas emissions of power companies, utilities and large polluting industries. Companies that support the bill, including many major utilities, believe the establishment of a cap-and-trade market -- which would allow companies to sell or trade pollution allowances -- is necessary. \Critics say it would cost too much. Overlooked in their argument is the vast potential for energy efficiencies that could save companies more money than cap-and-trade would cost them, while also reducing greenhouse-gas emissions that produce global warming. \ACES might make a kilowatt-hour cost more, but it also would offer ways for companies to use fewer of them. So, while electricity rates could increase modestly, the electric bills most businesses pay likely would go down. Consumers win, the environment wins. \Buildings can reduce energy cheaply -- to a point. To go beyond requires a capital investment most owners are reluctant to make without knowing how long it would take to get paid back through decreased energy bills. \An exception are the owners of the Empire State Building in New York. A team led by Jones Lang LaSalle determined that the 2.5 million-square-foot skyscraper could reduce energy use by 38 percent by undertaking a $20 million energy retrofit with a payback period of about three years. The retrofit of that one building will reduce greenhouse-gas emissions by 105,000 metric tons over 15 years. \But many owners can't afford an extensive retrofit, especially in the current economic environment. ACES would help by providing building owners with allowances for public funding, loan guarantees, interest subsidies and credit support. \The bill also would encourage states to set building codes requiring new buildings to be increasingly energy efficient -- 25 percent more efficient than current standards by 2030. Existing buildings that don't upgrade would be less and less competitive for tenants over time. \Mandating efficiency and providing the means to achieve it represents a balanced approach to reducing greenhouse-gas pollution from buildings and to easing the pressure on companies in a cap-and-trade market. \This push for energy efficiency would help our economy. It would create jobs in energy service industries and make businesses operate more cost-efficiently, a key driver of profits. \Ultimately, though, the best reason for energy conservation is that we simply cannot keep accelerating global warming and gobbling fossil fuels, which eventually will run out. \Turning a blind eye to growing problems only makes dealing with them later much more painful. The need for energy action is apparent. An effective, sensible action plan is on the table. We should seize this opportunity."

In response to your editorial ""Climategate II"" (Nov. 30):
\
You may not be aware that 31,487 Americans with university degrees in science, including more than 9,000 Ph.D.s, have signed a petition that flatly denies Al Gore's claims that human-caused global warming is a settled scientific fact. Note that these people do not hold degrees in English or history or religion or any of the arts. Their degrees are in science.
\
The petition states in part: ""There is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide, methane or other greenhouse gases is causing or will, in the foreseeable future, cause catastrophic heating of the Earth's atmosphere and disruption of the Earth's climate. Moreover, there is substantial scientific evidence that increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide produce many beneficial effects upon the natural plant and animal environments of the Earth.""

You may read about it at http://www.petitionproject.org.I wonder how long would be a list of scientists who would put their names to a petition stating that global warming is caused, to any significant degree, by mankind's activities.

Keep in mind that carbon dioxide is plant food! Without it, we would die. Remember also that the name Greenland was not given in jest. When the Vikings arrived there, it was a green land and temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere were much higher than they are today. And yet, we survived. Imagine that!

83," With the fate of President Bush's Clear Skies proposal looking increasingly hazy on Capitol Hill, administration officials are preparing to make similar changes to air pollution rules for power plants, which are among the United States' biggest generators of smog, acid rain and mercury.\ For the third time in three weeks, Senate Republicans on Thursday postponed a pivotal committee hearing on the White House-backed Clear Skies legislation, the most ambitious overhaul of the Clean Air Act in 15 years, because they lacked the votes to pass it.\ But if Clear Skies stalls, Bush administration officials are now poised to reshape power plant regulations through the rule making process later this month in ways that mimic the legislation.\ In the offing are new limits on power plant emissions of mercury that have been widely criticized as too lenient.\ On the other hand, the administration's proposed changes include market-based incentives to reduce smog and acid rain which critics of Clear Skies support.\ The administrative changes would not entirely accomplish the administration's objectives to ease environmental restrictions on electricity generation, particularly on coal-fired power plants.\ Without Congressional approval, for example, the administration cannot eliminate requirements in the Clean Air Act that are about to compel power plants to invest billions of dollars in pollution control technologies in coming decades.\ But the changes may represent all that is politically possible, given bi-partisan objections in the Senate.\ Clear Skies would replace the complicated patchwork of Clean Air Act regulations that currently restrict power plant pollution with a simpler rule that is favored by coal-burning utilities. It aims to reduce emissions of principal power plant pollutants through what is known as a cap and trade system.\ The Clear Skies rule would set a national ceiling on the emissions, and power plants that cut more than their required share would obtain surplus ""pollution credits"" that they could sell to power plants that exceeded their quotas, giving them a financial incentive to clean the air.\ Bush administration officials assert that Clear Skies would cut pollution faster and with far less regulatory red tape than existing Clean Air Act rules while still maintaining a vital place for coal in the nation's energy mix. They argue that it is economically important to ensure that the next generation of clean air rules does not force utilities to abandon coal, the nation's cheapest and most abundant source of energy. Clear Skies seeks to cut power plant emissions of three major pollutants by 70 percent over the next 11 years.\ Such cuts would restore clean air to most of the more than 150 million Americans who live in counties that exceed federal health requirements for smog or particle pollution, though they would not solve California's extraordinary air quality problems.\ ""No one here thinks the Clean Air Act could get these types of reductions,"" said Jeffrey Holmstead, the Environmental Protection Agency's top air quality official.\ State air pollution regulators and some former EPA officials strongly disagree, arguing that the nation's air would be cleaned up faster if the Bush administration simply enforced existing rules instead of tinkering with them. The Clear Skies legislation would weaken regulations that are poised to force billions of dollars in pollution control improvements at hundreds of aging coal-fired power plants over the next 20 years, they note.\ Coal mining companies, labor unions and other supporters of Clear Skies mounted a fierce lobbying push this week in hopes of breaking a deadlock in the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee that has stalled the legislation.\ Senate Republicans pressured the lone GOP holdout, Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island, while the utility industry and other backers pressed Democrat Max Baucus of Montana, who represents a region with considerable coal reserves. Republicans even made last minute changes to the bill that gave favorable status to a Montana coal mine in hopes of winning Baucus's support.\ Environmental groups and the League of Women Voters made their own late lobbying pitches, arguing that Clear Skies was a dangerous rollback of clean air rules designed to benefit coal-burning power plants.\ Senate Republicans failed to find the one additional vote needed to move the legislation to the Senate floor, and rescheduled the hearing for March 9 -- the second postponement of the week."
84,"We now have a pretty good idea who will be on the ballot in November: Hillary Clinton (prediction markets give her a 96 percent probability) and Donald Trump (80 percent probability on the markets). But even if there's a stunning upset in what's left of the primaries, we already know what will be at stake - the fate of the planet.\The partisan divide on environmental policy has been growing ever wider. Just eight years ago the GOP nominated John McCain, whose platform included a ""cap and trade"" system to limit greenhouse gases. (It would restrict emissions but allow pollution permits to be bought and sold.) Since then, denial of climate science and opposition to anything that might avert catastrophe have become essential pillars of Republican identity. So the choice in 2016 is stark.\Of course, electing a pro-environment president wouldn't make much difference if he or (much more likely) she weren't in a position to steer us away from the precipice. And given Republican retrogression and the GOP's near-lock on the House of Representatives, even a blowout Democratic victory probably wouldn't create a political environment in which anything like Mr. McCain's 2008 proposal could pass Congress.\But the next president won't need to pass legislation to take a big step toward saving the planet. Dramatic progress in energy technology has put us in a position where executive action that relies on existing law can achieve great things. All we need is an executive willing to take that action and a Supreme Court that won't stand in its way.\This year's election will determine whether those conditions hold.\Many people, including some who should know better, still seem oddly oblivious to the ongoing revolution in renewable energy. Recently Bill Gates declared, as he has before, that we need an ""energy miracle"" - some kind of amazing technological breakthrough - to contain climate change. But we've had that miracle: the cost of electricity generated by wind and sun has dropped dramatically, while the costs of storage, crucial to making renewables fully competitive with conventional energy, are plunging as we speak.\The result is that we're only a few years from a world in which carbon-neutral sources of energy could replace much of our consumption of fossil fuels at modest cost. True, Republicans still robotically repeat that any attempt to limit emissions would ""destroy the economy."" But at this point such assertions are absurd. As both a technical matter and an economic one, drastic reductions in emissions would be quite easy to achieve. All it would take would be moderately pro-environment policies.\As a card-carrying economist, I am obliged to say that it would be best if these policies took the form of a comprehensive system like cap and trade or carbon taxes, which would provide incentives to reduce emissions all across the economy. But something like the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan, which would use flexible regulations imposed by the Environmental Protection Agency on major emitters, would get us a long way toward the goal.\Again, no new legislation would be needed, just a president willing to act and a Supreme Court that won't sacrifice the planet in the name of conservative ideology. What's more, the Paris agreement from last year means that, if the United States moves forward on climate action, much of the world will follow our lead.\This situation makes me very nervous. As long as the prospect of effective action on climate seemed remote, sheer despair kept me, and many others, comfortably numb - you knew nothing was going to happen, so you just soldiered on. Now, however, salvation is within our grasp but it remains all too possible that we'll manage to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.\This is by far the most important issue there is. It, er, trumps even such things as health care, financial reform and inequality.\So I'm going to be hanging on by my fingernails all through this election. No doubt there will be plenty of entertainment along the way, given the freak show taking place on one side of the aisle. But I won't forget that the stakes are deadly serious. And neither should you.\Paul Krugman is a syndicated columnist for The New York Times."
85,"
It is early evening on Capitol Hill, and I am sitting with Sen. Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican, who, along with Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., and Sen. Joe Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, is trying to craft a new energy bill -- one that could actually win 60 votes.
\
What is interesting about Graham is that he has been willing -- courageously in my view -- to depart from the prevailing GOP consensus that the only energy policy we need is ""drill, baby, drill.""
\
What brought you around, I ask? Graham's short answer: politics, jobs and legacy.
\
We start with politics. The Republican Party today has a major outreach problem with two important constituencies, ""Hispanics and young people,"" Graham explains:
\
""I have been to enough college campuses to know if you are 30 or younger this climate issue is not a debate. It's a value. These young people grew up with recycling and a sensitivity to the environment -- and the world will be better off for it. They are not brainwashed. ... From a Republican point of view, we should buy into it and embrace it and not belittle them. You can have a genuine debate about the science of climate change, but when you say that those who believe it are buying a hoax and are wacky people you are putting at risk your party's future with younger people. You can have a legitimate dispute about how to solve immigration, but when you start focusing on the last names of people the demographics will pass you by.""
\
So Graham's approach to bringing around his conservative state has been simple: avoid talking about ""climate change,"" which many on the right don't believe. Instead, frame our energy challenge as a need to ""clean up carbon pollution,"" to ""become energy independent"" and to ""create more good jobs and new industries for South Carolinians."" He proposes ""putting a price on carbon,"" starting with a very focused carbon tax, as opposed to an economywide cap-and-trade system, so as to spur both consumers and industries to invest in and buy new clean energy products. He includes nuclear energy, and insists on permitting more offshore drilling for oil and gas to give us more domestic sources, as we bridge to a new clean energy economy.
\
""Cap-and-trade as we know it is dead, but the issue of cleaning up the air and energy independence should not die -- and you will never have energy independence without pricing carbon,"" Graham argues. ""The technology doesn't make sense until you price carbon. Nuclear power is a bet on cleaner air. Wind and solar is a bet on cleaner air. You make those bets assuming that cleaning the air will become more profitable than leaving the air dirty, and the only way it will be so is if the government puts some sticks on the table -- not just carrots. The future economy of America and the jobs of the future are going to be tied to cleaning up the air, and in the process of cleaning up the air this country becomes energy independent and our national security is greatly enhanced.""
\
Remember, he adds, ""we are more dependent on foreign oil today than after 9/11. That is political malpractice, and every member of Congress is responsible.""
\
This isn't just for the next generation, says Graham: ""As you talk about the future, if you forget the people who live in the present, you will have no future politically. You have to get the people in the present to buy into the future. I tell my voters: 'If we try to clean up the air and become energy independent, we will create more jobs than anything I can do as a senator.' General Electric makes all the turbines for the GE windmills in Greenville, South Carolina."" He also is pushing to make his state a manufacturing center for nuclear reactor components and biomass from plants and timber.
\
What would most help him bring around his GOP colleagues? The business lobby. ""The Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers need to tell my colleagues it is OK to price carbon, if you do it smartly,"" he says.
\
Sure, Graham's strategy will give many greens heartburn. I don't agree with every point. But if there is going to be a clean energy bill, greens and Democrats will have to recruit some Republicans. Graham says he's ready to meet them in the middle. ""We've got to get started,"" he says, ""because once we do, every CEO will adopt a carbon strategy, no matter what the law actually requires.""
\
And for those Republicans who think this is only a loser, Graham says think again: ""What is our view of carbon as a party? Are we the party of carbon pollution forever in unlimited amounts? Pricing carbon is the key to energy independence, and the byproduct is that young people look at you differently.""
\
Look at how he is received in colleges today.
\
""Instead of being just one more short, white Republican over 50,"" says Graham, ""I am now semicool. There is an awareness by young people that I am doing something different.""
\
Five more GOP senators like him and we could have a real energy bill.
\
""We can't be a nation that always tries and fails,"" Graham concludes. ""We have to eventually get some hard problem right.""

Royalty wrangling
\
Editor: The Times-Tribune raises important issues associated with mineral development leases, including royalty payments, in a Sept. 24 editorial (""Ensure value of gas leases this session"").
\
There's no doubt this issue is very complex and we absolutely recognize that some royalty owners in the region have serious concerns, which we share. Royalty owners are critical resource development partners who share in the successes and challenges that the market brings.
\
Readers should know that this prolonged, depressed global commodity price environment - which has been especially painful across our region - has a negative impact on revenue, investment, jobs and royalty payments. In fact, many Pennsylvania natural gas producers and small business supply chain providers have been forced to cut back significantly, downsize and even lay off employees as a result of this downturn.
\
The proposed legislative response to this issue, however, will not bring the relief that some - like The Times-Tribune - may suggest. Land mineral owners negotiate post-production costs, among other matters, through contract agreements. Given that leases are contracts, there is long and clear precedent that the courts - not the Legislature - are the best and most-effective place to address and resolve such matters.
\
Our industry shares the frustration conveyed by some royalty owners. Natural resource development is a partnership - and the best path forward for royalty owners, energy producers and stakeholders during this difficult period is to work together with leaders in Harrisburg on common-sense policies aimed at ensuring that Pennsylvania remains competitive and can continue safely to produce clean-burning natural gas, which is a source of job creation, enhanced air quality and strengthened national security.

Editor: Those who intend to vote for Donald Trump because he is the alternative to ""politics as usual,"" should be careful for what they wish.
\
Trump is the opposite of politics as usual, which doesn't mean he's capable of being commander in chief. He is a rude, abrasive narcissist who thinks of himself first. How can anyone think about voting for someone who said Sen. John McCain is not a war hero? I am not a registered Republican, but McCain is a war hero. Trump said he shouldn't have allowed himself to be captured. Really, which branch of the armed forces did Trump serve?
\
He says the 9/11 terrorist attacks never would have happened if he had been president at that time. He says he wouldn't have allowed it. Really?
\
He wants to stop Muslims from entering the United States. He says he will build a wall to keep Mexicans out. He made fun of a reporter with a physical disability. That man could be your father, husband or son. Trump tells people little relative to policy. He's too busy telling us how wonderful he is.
\
Think about his aversion to foreigners, but two of his three wives were not born in the United States.
\
He is in the clothing business and his clothing is made in foreign countries. How would this make the United States great again? How does this square with his intentions to keep foreigners out of the United States?
\
The Republican Party as a whole should have disavowed Trump's presidential campaign the day he put down McCain. The party is responsible for the antics of this disillusioned cynic. Ergo, the GOP is responsible for the ridicule it endures.

Trump only knows how to dictate. His intentions are not to be president; they are to be a dictator.

"
89,"WASHINGTON -- A constellation of 508 red dots stretches across a wall map in the office of Bruce Nilles, one for every power plant now burning coal in the United States. It is his job to make these stars go dark, one by one. \The director of the Sierra Club's Beyond Coal campaign is a skinny Wisconsinite who bikes to work at the environmental group's warren of offices in adjoining Capitol Hill townhouses. He has no illusions that America can stop burning coal tomorrow, or even 10 years from now, and still generate enough power to function. But the transition, he says, has to start now and to him that means giving no quarter. His group fights every proposed coal plant. They work to shut down the old ones. \""It's such a large source of global warming pollution that if we don't end coal's contribution to global warming in two decades, it's going to be very hard to live on a planet that we recognize,"" Mr. Nilles said. \A dozen blocks away from Mr. Nilles' office, a strangely glittering hunk of coal holds a place of honor in the memorabilia case at the National Mining Association. When it comes to coal the only ground the association's chief lobbyist, Bruce Watzman, is giving is what can be burned. \""Coal is there,"" he said. ""It has proven itself year after year, year after year, year after year that it is a reliable, essential part of our energy mix. And it has to remain so."" \So, in the nation's capital the lines are drawn in a battle likely to affect everything from the price of a kilowatt of electricity to a Greene County miner's ability to pay for it. Income and environment, tradition and climate and two very different cultures are all colliding in Washington's halls of power where decisions, or their absence, will have lasting ramifications.\Unease on all sides\""I wish more people would come here and see it isn't as bad in the coal fields as they think it is,"" said Dru Ellis, who machines hydraulic equipment for the mines in southern West Virginia. His brother and friends work underground. \To Keith Eshleman, a professor at the University of Maryland's Appalachian Laboratory, which studies the region's ecosystem, the sense that his promotion of a coal-free energy grid might offend his neighbors is acknowledged. \""I understand that somebody whose job is wedded to the mining industry is not going to be happy with people like myself going around and drawing conclusions about the problems associated with their industry,"" he said. ""If your livelihood's tied to it, I understand that's an issue."" \But both sides -- industry and environmentalists -- feel frustration and a hint of fear at Washington's approach to coal in recent years, a sign of the sometimes contradictory policies the Obama administration and Congress have pursued. \President Barack Obama's Environmental Protection Agency, headed by Lisa P. Jackson, a former environmental regulator in New Jersey, has sought to limit mountaintop removal mining at every opportunity. The industry uses the practice, in which the top of a mountain is sheared off to extract the coal within, to reach coal that cannot be reached by ordinary underground mining. Because the waste from the process is dumped in surrounding valleys, the EPA is heavily scrutinizing mountaintop mining for its impact on streams in possible violation of the Clean Water Act. \The EPA also has made moves to more ambitiously regulate coal ash, the toxic material left over after coal is burned for energy. \Most strikingly, the agency in late 2009 issued a finding that greenhouse gases pose a danger to human health -- which could open the door to federal emissions controls. \The attitude of the coal industry to these developments, shared by many who live and work in Appalachia, can be neatly summed up in a billboard erected by the industry group ""Friends of Coal"" that greets drivers on Interstate 64 in Beckley, W.Va. It states: ""Don't let EPA bureaucrats take away our coal jobs."" \""What comes next?"" Mr. Watzman ventured. ""I don't think it's so much a surprise to us as a philosophy of where they're going. I think it's a surprise the speed with which they advanced the regulatory agenda and I think the expansion of the regulatory agenda beyond what has traditionally been a focus on use issues to production issues."" \As the administration aggressively pursued its agenda, Congress remained flat-footed. A bill loathed by coal producers and users to establish a cap-and-trade system, essentially putting a price on carbon emissions, passed the House but was blocked in the Senate as coal-state Democrats and a united Republican caucus never signed on. In a weak economy, anything that could raise prices for energy consumers was toxic. \The gridlocked Senate had no stomach for the reverse course, either. A proposal by Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, to bar the EPA from regulating greenhouse gases was defeated. But a similar strike against the administration -- perhaps in the form of a two-year moratorium on greenhouse gas regulation -- is possible with the Republicans gaining six seats in the upper chamber in this month's midterm elections. \The politics of coal know no party in West Virginia. In two of the state's key races this fall -- Rep. Nick Rahall against Spike Maynard for the state's third U.S. House district and Gov. Joe Manchin against John Raese for Senate -- it often seemed like the candidates were competing to see who could bow most majestically before the throne of King Coal. \Mr. Rahall, a 17-term Democrat who survived in a tough race against the former state Supreme Court justice, bragged about using his clout to blunt anti-mountaintop mining sentiment in the Democratic Party. The Democrat, Mr. Manchin, who won his race to fill the seat of the late Sen. Robert C. Byrd, memorably put a rifle shot through a replica of the cap-and-trade bill in a television ad. He also filed suit against the EPA last month for its tougher scrutiny of mountaintop removal permits.\'You can't fight the big man'\The guys from New York who'd come to raft the New River Gorge might have made small history the day they were beaten up by a Ph.D. who was standing up for his hillbilly heritage. Paul Rakes, who spent years working in the coal mines and now holds a professorship in history at West Virginia University Institute of Technology, said he had simply had his fill. \""There were a couple of what we'd call Yankees who were making fun of an elderly woman in a grocery store,"" he said. He was waiting in line behind her. She had the look. She had the accent. \""They actually said 'Deliverance' and there were a couple other things about her appearance -- mountain woman from the wilds,"" he said. \Mr. Rakes followed the men out of the store and invited them to do themselves a favor and go back where they came from. The anger swelled. The words followed. Then came the fists. \This sense of frustration-cum-indignation is atmospheric in coal towns and Mr. Rakes, who made the transition from coal miner to academic, says the outside world's continuing judgment of the coal industry, its future, its culture and its people has created its own subtext of social angst and cross-cultural resentment. \""Coal miners always had pride in what they do,"" said Mr. Rakes, whose father worked underground. At the same time, he said, that pride was always edged by a certain feeling: ""It would be better if I could do something else -- but I never wanted to."" \That nagging suspicion about status drove Mr. Rakes to the earth's surface 17 years ago. He walked away from a 21-year career as a miner to go to graduate school and take up life as an academic. \From those two perspectives he said he has come to grasp the thing that gnaws at the West Virginia coal community. The state has long been owned by outside corporations that bought up bottom land and mineral rights and dug into the mountains when the economy favored it. \""It's a frustration that's generationally born,"" Mr. Rakes said. ""The old statement was, 'Well, you can't fight the big man.' The big man seems ambiguous, but it's not. It means someone who has a lot of money and has no true, vested interest in the state."" \At one time, the big man was corporate. Often as not, today, it's governmental. The EPA and other regulators have, in a sense, united West Virginia's miners and their former nemesis -- Big Coal -- against a common enemy they see as arrogant, aloof and a bit condescending. \Thus, mountaintop removal, a drastic procedure that environmentalists say leaves a surface that will not allow plants to root, finds a range of ideologies within the same populace. Some see outside corporations plundering the land. Others see outside government locking it up. And everybody worries about what an abrupt halt to coal would mean in a state with little else by way of heavy industry. \Mr. Rakes has his own sense of ambiguity. \""I love the mountains as well,"" he said. ""But we can't just stand here as forgotten wilderness.""\'We're fighting for our lives'\The city of Logan, buried deep in southern West Virginia coal country, is named for a Native American chief who was accommodating to white settlers until a few of them decided to slaughter several of his people in 1774. During peace negotiations, Chief Logan gave a speech later published in several newspapers that included the line, ""Who is there to mourn for Logan? Not one."" \More than two centuries later, the area's current residents who rely on coal feel as besieged as the Mingo tribe. \""We're fighting for our lives,"" said Jim Winkler, owner of American Hydraulics, a mining equipment repair shop located just outside Logan. \Mr. Winkler, 60, has run his shop for 27 years. The economy has forced him down to 36 employees from a staff that once numbered 50. As the vice president of the Logan Coal Vendors Association, he looks with a jaundiced eye at the Obama EPA's approach to the coal industry. \""Obama, in my opinion, when he came into office developed an environmental attitude with their extremists,"" he said. ""I don't think he realizes what's at stake."" \Logan County is a crucial front in the War on Coal, as it is home to Arch Coal's planned Spruce No. 1 Mine, among the largest proposed mountaintop removal projects in Appalachia with a saga to match. \The site has been in limbo since it was first proposed in 1998. Arch conducted an exhaustive environmental impact statement and in 2007 the Army Corps of Engineers -- in cooperation with the George W. Bush administration EPA -- signed off on six ""valley fills,"" in which Arch would dump its mine waste in surrounding streams. \Local and national environmental groups took aim at the site for its size and impact on tributaries to the Coal River; litigation and protests have greeted it at every turn. The new administration's EPA entered the fray last year, announcing a public review of the Spruce permit under the Clean Water Act. The EPA has a rarely exercised power to veto existing permits, but given that the Spruce project ""could result in unacceptable adverse effects to fish and wildlife resources,"" in agency parlance, the EPA took another look. \It received 50,000 comments, and a public hearing in Charleston in May turned into a shouting match. The agency's regional administrator recommended in September that Ms. Jackson veto the project, and her final word is expected by Feb. 22 -- though the legal fight is likely to continue regardless of her choice. \Spruce has become a symbol for all of surface mining. Ms. Jackson in April said her agency's new scrutiny on mountaintop mining means ""no or very few valley fills."" But the audacious move of revoking an existing permit would further restrict the practice and set a fearsome precedent for the industry. \""It puts every permit in the Appalachian region at risk,"" said Gene Kitts, who helped usher the Spruce project through the permit process at Arch and is now an executive at International Coal Group. \""If you study the objection document that EPA submitted, there's nothing unique about that operation."" \The project's supporters season their argument with economic statistics. Arch says a veto would prevent it from investing $250 million in the area, with 250 direct jobs created by the project. Logan County Commission President Art Kirkendoll says Spruce would swell the coffers of the county and school system by ""a couple million,"" and create additional indirect jobs. The coal industry, in all, contributes $7.5 million in taxes to the school system, according to Logan school superintendent Wilma Zigmond. \Mr. Kirkendoll also sees a benefit in the dramatic topography changes wrought by mountaintop removal. Mining companies, once they finish reaping the coal from a site, are required to repair the newly flattened land. In Logan County, topless mountains now are home to an industrial park, an airport, a jail and a Wal-Mart. \""Down here we can't diversify unless we have some flat land to put something on,"" Mr. Kirkendoll said. \In response to written questions, an EPA spokesman wrote in an e-mail that the agency is reviewing mine permits to ensure that quality of life is protected in coal towns. \""Without a healthy community and environment, we can't have a healthy economy,"" the spokesman said. ""We've set commonsense guidelines that protect the local waters, maximize coal recovery and reduce costs. We continue to reject the notion that for Americans to have economic security, they must sacrifice their health and the health of their communities."" \Home-grown activists\Judy Bonds will happily direct you to her moment of mild YouTube fame with its more than 8,000 views. The film was taken during a protest last year in which environmentalists, including those from Ms. Bonds' Coal River Mountain Watch, marched outside a Massey Energy coal processing plant that is adjacent to an elementary school and the subject of litigation for possible health consequences on the schoolchildren. \Ms. Bonds only appears briefly in the 54-second clip, and is hidden from view during the crucial sequence, when a burly looking woman wearing a orange-striped miner's jumpsuit smacks her in the face and then is cheered by the pro-Massey counter-protesters. The woman was arrested and fined, but Ms. Bonds says the incident is emblematic of the hostility she often encounters. \""The coal industry is telling these workers that people are out to get their jobs and that's created a level of danger,"" she said in an interview several months ago. ""This feels like 1963 Mississippi down here."" \Ms. Bonds, whose activism has taken a backseat of late as she battles cancer, puts to rest the canard that opposition to the coal industry in West Virginia originates entirely in Washington or other latte-slurping coastal cities. She comes from a family of coal miners and lives in the same place she grew up, Marsh Fork, W.Va. \Like many of her fellow activists, Ms. Bonds joined up with the environmental movement because coal was a bad neighbor. In this case, Massey started a surface operation in her hollow and the streams filled with dead fish. The somewhat abstract cause of global warming is not the most pressing task for this cadre of natives. They just want to keep their mountains and streams intact. \""The first time I saw a strip mine I was absolutely in disbelief,"" said Julian Martin, a Boone County native and environmentalist. \""I couldn't imagine why anyone would tear up a mountain like that. ... Those mountains are more valuable than a million jobs because mountains can be forever. As soon as they get the coal, the mountains are destroyed, the coal is burned and we're left with a wasteland."" \But the natural beauty argument is a difficult sell in a time of high unemployment, which is why environmental groups have turned their efforts to economic analyses. A report released in June by the Morgantown-based environmental research firm Downstream Strategies and the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy in Charleston found that the state spent $42.2 million more than it took in, directly and indirectly, from the coal industry in 2009, and that even counting indirect jobs coal only accounts for 9 percent of the state's workforce. \The proportions are much higher in the southern part of the state -- in Boone County, coal directly provides 45 percent of the jobs -- where the question of what could replace this kind of good-paying work rings loudest. The answer is difficult to ascertain. The Sierra Club's Mr. Nilles cited wind farms and home weatherization as sources of work for the manual labor set. \Rory McIlmoil, a researcher who co-authored the Downstream Strategies report on the costs of coal, said the jobs picture is bleak -- but with central Appalachian coal production already declining, those jobs are far from permanent. Regulatory factors aside, central Appalachian coal faces competition from other parts of the country where coal is easier to extract, as well as from newly developed natural gas fields. \""Any transition away from coal is going to be really difficult,"" he said. ""It's going to result in massive job loss and migration out of rural areas in coal producing areas. But the thing is, that's going to happen anyway.""\Not if but when\Though it's not as fast as he'd like, the territory is shifting in Mr. Nilles' direction. He noted that -- recent belligerent skepticism aside -- awareness of global warming has grown since the Beyond Coal campaign began in 2005. Even National Mining Association spokesman Luke Popovich acknowledges that renewable energies are ascendant and coal must reduce its harm to the environment in order for the industry to avoid the fossilized fate of its fuel. \The difference, then, between these adversaries isn't the goal, but the speed and method of arriving there. \With cap-and-trade kaput for now, Mr. Nilles said Congress must pass an aggressive Renewable Energy Standard, forcing the country to generate a certain percentage of its electricity from non-fossilized sources. Mr. Popovich said NMA never lobbies against renewables, but they aren't ready and reliable like coal. And he points to the industry's progress on pollution: New coal plants spew 90 percent less sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and mercury than their 1970s-era predecessors, according to the National Energy Technology Laboratory. \The Obama administration has pushed for investment into carbon capture and storage technology, which coal plants could use to store their carbon emissions underground rather than having them add to global warming. But commercial deployment of such technology is more than a decade away even under the most optimistic projections. \Mr. Popovich said backing the coal industry into a corner with environmental regulations and legislation will only hamper technological efforts like CCS -- which can be used the world over, including by massive coal burners like China. Mr. Nilles counters that the international community, including China, is advancing renewable technologies by leaps and bounds while the U.S. is stuck in the grips of coal. \The federal stimulus bill invested unprecedented billions in clean energy, but private sector money isn't flowing to the unproven technologies over the cheaper fossil fuels. Environmentalists argue that coal must account economically for its true costs to human health and the environment, thus sparking investment into cleaner alternatives. \""The clean energy sector offers huge opportunities for growth here in the United States,"" Mr. Nilles said. ""And we invented many of these technologies. But because we're not investing in the scale that other countries are, we're getting left behind."" \Mr. Popovich sees a clean energy future, too, but one in which there is no need to move beyond coal. \""Their view is almost ideological,"" he said of the environmental movement. \""It's, 'Coal is an evil and, quite apart from any technology, it's never going to be any good.' And our view is, 'No, we've proven that coal is different today than it was 70, 150 years ago in the Industrial Revolution, and there's no reason that in the next 25 or 50 years it can't be even more dramatically different.'"""

Editor: I couldn't agree more with Ted Prusinski's Jan. 16 letter. Just one thing he left out: when he talked about it not being the bishop's fault because the churches and schools are closing and low Mass attendance, he forgot to say that over 48 million people would be living and giving to churches if we didn't buy the lie of contraception and abortion. This number grows by 3,000 a day.
\
One out of every three people have had an abortion or been involved somehow with one. That means that we have 96 million mothers and fathers hurting and in need of healing because of a mistake they made.
\
Mr. Prusinski also stated that many people are waiting for the ""changing of the guard."" The bishop may be changed -- I hope not -- but God will never change. Maybe we the people who make up the church better look at ourselves. Because we the people are the ones who need to change our ""I want it my way"" attitude.

\
The Democrats, being in the majority, proceeded to develop an economic stimulus legislative bill with much pork. I have been to Washington, D.C., and yes, the mall does need to be resodded, but not in this bill.
\
The greatest shame is on Republicans. According to one journalist there were 30 GOP members of the House who would have voted for the bill, but the leadership determined Republicans would all vote against the bill. This denied every citizen who voted for a Republican representative his right to a free and independent vote on this bill.

Guarantee clear air
\
Editor: While warnings have alerted many Americans to the possible environmental threat that a rise in greenhouse-gas emissions poses, it should not divert our focus from the specter of higher health bills and shorter life spans if we are blown off course in efforts to control urban air pollution.
\
Perhaps the biggest reason for the increase of life expectancy for people in dozens of U.S. cities is the reduction in airborne fine particulate matter, or soot, which is linked to heart and respiratory diseases. The dramatic impact on public health from reducing air pollution was pointed out in a recently published study by a team of researchers from Brigham Young and Harvard universities. Researchers said that between 1980 and 2000, federal regulations on power plants helped reduce smog components such as sulfur dioxide significantly, while the installation of catalytic converters on vehicles cut nitrogen oxides.
\
The study provides new scientific proof that a market-based system of emission trading that requires coal-fired power plants to reduce the ingredients of acid rain and smog have paid off. California and several Northeast states are adopting similar cap-and-trade systems for cutting carbon dioxide emissions. And now pressure is building in Congress to institute carbon cap-and-trade nationally.
\
But cap-and-trade would not have worked as well as it has if not for the greatly improved performance of U.S. nuclear power plants since the early 1990s, with plants now running 90 percent of the time instead of 70 percent as they were doing years ago. That increase makes a big difference, given that nuclear power is the only large-scale energy source that does not contribute to acid rain, increased levels of ozone smog and greenhouse-gas emissions. It accounts for more than 70 percent of the nation's carbon-free energy production.
\
The U.S. Department of Energy has said that the single most effective emission control strategy for utilities is to increase nuclear-generated electricity. Unfortunately, there is a danger that the importance of nuclear power will be lost in the emphasis on renewable energy.
\
Nuclear power's share of U.S. electricity generating capacity -- 19 percent -- will decline unless new reactors are built to replace aging plants.
\
Companies want to build as many as 35 new plants and seek $122 billion in loan guarantees, but Congress has authorized only $18 billion. That's shortsighted. Loan guarantees for nuclear plant construction would cost taxpayers nothing.
\
Constructing additional nuclear plants would reduce air pollution and greenhouse-gas emissions, help move the country toward energy independence, create tens of thousands of jobs, and reduce health costs.
\
Permanent disposal of nuclear waste pales in importance when compared to the need for environmentally benign nuclear power.
\
No energy source is perfect, and there is an important role for renewable sources, but we will need all our environmentally benign resources in the future, especially nuclear, if we are to meet the growing demand for power while maintaining a livable environment.

CLEARING THE RECORD, PUBLISHED DECEMBER 9, 2008, FOLLOWS: A caption in the series on the Environmental Protection Agency, with a photograph showing President Bush and EPA Administrator Stephen L. Johnson, gave an incorrect source. + The photo was supplied by the White House.

\
The judge cocked her head sideways as the young government lawyer tried to justify what the EPA had done: Not much.
\
U.S. District Court Judge Rosemary Collyer could barely contain her disgust. The EPA had repeatedly failed to set pollution limits for diesel ships entering U.S. ports, including Camden and Philadelphia. Following lawsuits, the EPA had promised that it would do so by 2003, then by 2007. Now, in April 2008, EPA was saying it might - might - follow the law and do it by 2009.
\
Collyer was no liberal. A Bush appointee, she had held two political posts during the Reagan administration. But now she cast a wary eye at the lawyer for the EPA.
\
""So you're saying EPA could just keep granting itself extensions?"" Collyer asked.
\
Yes, the lawyer said.
\
The judge shook her head and invoked Peter Pan.
\
""It's Never-Never Land,"" she said.
\
The lawyer insisted that the EPA was working on the problem.
\
Incredulous, Collyer held up a thumb and index finger an inch apart. ""This -"" she said, holding her fingers aloft - ""this is how much EPA has done.""
\
The judge's exasperation with the EPA's manipulation of air pollution rules mirrored reactions in cases by other federal judges.
\
In a dozen cases since 2001, federal judges in Washington have used increasingly caustic language to throw out EPA regulations, chastising the Bush administration for illegally changing U.S. environmental rules. Most decisions were rendered by the conservative U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
\
The result: The EPA's most significant new air-pollution initiatives lie in tatters, creating uncertainty for those who worry about the environment and human health, as well as for businesses that have spent billions to meet new EPA standards that no longer exist. When the courts killed one Bush rule in July, the decision triggered immediate market losses that cost at least one Pennsylvania power company, PPL Corp. of Allentown, $33 million.
\
Taxpayers are losers, too. According to the EPA's own figures, the agency spent at least $53 million to create these now-defunct rules.
\
Most of the court decisions against the EPA were not close calls. Nearly every key appellate ruling on air pollution was unanimous and bipartisan. Two-thirds of the votes against the EPA were cast by judges appointed by Republican presidents, according to an Inquirer analysis.
\
""In modern environmental law, this is absolutely unprecedented,"" said James R. May, a Widener University law professor and chair of the American Bar Association's annual Environment and Energy Resources conference. ""All across the spectrum, judges are finding that virtually every environmental initiative of the Bush administration is illegal.""
\
An Inquirer analysis also shows that when the EPA is sued, it appears to treat industry as a friendlier foe than environmental groups.
\
Of the four dozen pollution cases filed in federal court in Washington, the EPA settled 80 percent of the lawsuits brought by industry. By contrast, the EPA settled only 15 percent of the cases brought by environmental groups.
\
In one case - in which utility companies challenged states' authority on pollution enforcement - the EPA settled with the utilities and then went one step further. The EPA rewrote the rule to take the industry position. The courts later said that the EPA acted wrongly, and threw out the revised rule.
\
Bush's senior environmental adviser, James Connaughton, said most of the decisions the EPA has lost have not been about the substance of the environmental rules, but about the legal process.
\
""You look at those cases and they have nothing to do with whether the air is getting cleaner,"" he said. ""The EPA is pursuing flexible approaches that allow for even greater economic growth and development as we dramatically improve air quality.""
\
Nearly all cases have been decided by the powerful D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, which hears most challenges to newly minted agency rules.
\
Those judges have repeatedly called the EPA's legal justifications thin, some so laughable they would only make sense if presented in a fairy tale:
\
When the EPA tried to argue that the word any in existing air pollution law did not literally mean ""any,"" the court said that would make sense ""only in a Humpty Dumpty world.""
\
When the EPA tried to alter mercury emission controls on certain power plants, the court compared its legal logic to the Queen of Hearts, the Alice in Wonderland character who makes one arbitrary decision after another.
\
When the EPA essentially lowered a water pollution limit by reinterpreting a law requiring ""daily"" monitoring to allow ""seasonal or annual"" monitoring, the court said this was absurd: ""Daily means daily, nothing else.""
\
The EPA's biggest loss in the courts came last year in the case brought by Massachusetts on climate change. The agency had argued that it did not have the authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate carbon emissions and other greenhouse gases, and therefore could not use the law to combat global warming.
\
The U.S. Supreme Court rejected that contention, saying the evidence of climate change was overwhelming and that the EPA did have the authority to regulate greenhouse gases, regardless of doubts about causes and effects.
\
""That EPA would prefer not to regulate greenhouse gases because of some residual uncertainty . . . is irrelevant,"" the court wrote.
\
James Pew, a Gladwyne native and a lawyer for Earthjustice, a firm that represents environmental groups, said the EPA was prone to issue rules that courts later would find arbitrary.
\
""I think EPA was being reckless,"" he said. ""There were only a few outcomes, and all of them were good for industry. If they managed to get a rule passed through judicial review, they would get an industry-friendly rule on the books. If it got thrown out, industry would get a delay in having to clean up its emissions, and that would be good for industry.""
\
Either way, the consequences were severe, said Pew. ""Whenever EPA loses one of these cases, the people who have to breathe toxic air take the hit because EPA has to go back and write another rule. Years go by.""
\
Rep. Henry Waxman (D., Calif.), who chairs the House Oversight Committee, said: ""This administration's pattern of issuing rules that don't stand up in court has caused multiple serious harms"" - to public health, taxpayers and industry.
\
Jeffrey Holmstead, a former EPA assistant administrator who was a chief architect of the Bush air pollution agenda, said the courts ruled incorrectly.
\
The losses, Holmstead said, were unexpected, in part because the courts had historically deferred to EPA rulemaking, except in extreme circumstances.
\
""If the D.C. Circuit had reviewed these cases the way they had done in the previous 15 years, those rules would have been upheld,"" he said. ""Some of the decisions were not only a surprise but don't make any sense as a matter of administrative law.""
\
But three former EPA political appointees, including former Administrator Christine Todd Whitman, said many court decisions did not come as a surprise. They said lawyers in the EPA's Office of General Counsel had warned that several administrative rules were too arbitrary to survive a court challenge.
\
""The General Counsel's Office offered very frank advice,"" former Associate Deputy Administrator Jason Burnett recalled.
\
EPA Administrator Stephen L. Johnson, who signed many of the rules that the courts have thrown out, blames a Democratic-controlled Congress for failing to adopt a comprehensive new pollution law. If Congress does not adopt new laws to address 21st-century pollution issues, Johnson said, the EPA will continue to be caught in a cycle in which it writes administrative regulations that are inevitably challenged in court by industry or environmental groups.
\
""EPA can do it reg by reg, year by year, but as I look as to what's best for the nation, let's have Congress cut to the chase, make some important decisions,"" he said. Otherwise, ""it will be decades before our nation fully addresses these, given the litigation issues, and I have grave concern.""
\
Sen. Tom Carper (D., Del.), who chairs the Senate's clean air subcommittee, said comprehensive legislation could have been passed, but the Bush administration simply refused to compromise.
\
""Eight years have gone by without any meaningful, substantive action on the clean-air debate,"" he said. ""I hope this offends everyone as much as it does me.""
\
It certainly seemed to offend U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman, a Clinton appointee. In 2006, Friedman directly accused the Bush administration of ignoring its environmental obligations under the law to promote the interests of industry.
\
The case involved accusations that the EPA failed to meet a 2000 deadline set by Congress to enact rules for dozens of hazardous air pollutants.
\
In his ruling, Friedman appeared annoyed by the EPA's argument that it had been too busy to comply with the law. The EPA had certainly found time, the judge noted, to issue new rules that fit the Bush administration's political agenda.
\
""EPA currently devotes substantial resources to discretionary rulemakings, many of which make existing regulations more congenial to industry, and several of which since have been found unlawful,"" the judge wrote. ""By all appearances, EPA's failure to promulgate the required standards owes less to the magnitude of the task at hand than to the foot-dragging efforts of a delinquent agency.""

The Bush strategy of using administrative rules to change environmental policy can be traced to the early days of the administration, according to documents and interviews with Republican political appointees.
\
One of the bluntest accounts of this agenda can be found in a 2001 transcript of a private presentation by electric industry lobbyist Quin Shea to utility, mining and rail executives. Shea did not know that a young trade association aide was taping his remarks, but said recently that the transcript captured the essence of what he said.
\
He addressed the power company executives' biggest concern. As their industry is one of the nation's largest air polluters and contributors to greenhouse gases, they realized that new regulation was inevitable. They simply hoped that Bush could ease or delay the pain.
\
Shea told the executives that he had just come from White House meetings, and reported that Bush intended to bypass an unfriendly Congress and use EPA administrative rules to make pro-industry changes.
\
The smart move, the lobbyist said, would be to take a preemptive approach - create pollution controls that would be as palatable as possible for industry.
\
""The president is prepared to do this administratively,"" Shea said, according to the transcript. ""The goal here will be to gain a foothold, an irreversible foothold, on the next generation of reasonable cost-effective sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide reduction, plus air toxics, that we can all live with and that someone else can't undo.""
\
Holmstead, the assistant administrator for air from 2002 to 2006, said that when it became clear that Congress would not cooperate with the Bush agenda, it made sense for the administration to employ administrative rules.
\
""We knew early on that we needed various reductions from coal-fired power plants, and that we had to deal with mercury, we had analysis that showed you could achieve a lot if you did it together at a lower cost,"" Holmstead said.
\
Environmental advocates said that Bush, Johnson and Holmstead pursued a strategy in which they would appear to improve air quality, but in reality would make incremental moves and delay substantive changes for years, if not decades.
\
""They have been very clever in the way they changed the debate, and were able to push the deadlines far back from where they should have been,"" said Bill Becker, executive director of the National Association of Clean Air Agencies.
\
Looking back, Shea said in a recent interview, industry and EPA lawyers took their best shot to change the rules.
\
""I think they were being as aggressive and creative as they could,"" he said.
\
Humpty Dumpty world
\
One of the first such attempts at aggressiveness and creativity came in 2003, and led to at least two high-profile EPA resignations.
\
It involved a process called New Source Review, a 1977 amendment to the Clean Air Act. New Source Review requires the nation's 17,000 power plants, oil refineries, paper mills and other factories to submit to an EPA pollution analysis whenever they expanded or modernized in a way that increased pollution emissions. Often, that analysis triggered more pollution controls that cost millions.
\
Industry found New Source Review onerous and expensive, and during its first term the Bush administration announced that EPA would change cost thresholds, essentially exempting certain plant modifications, thereby weakening the rule.
\
""They overreached wildly, and put in thresholds that meant almost no one would have to comply,"" said Bruce Buckheit, then EPA director of air enforcement. Buckheit resigned the following year after being ordered to drop 75 already active New Source Review investigations, 17 of which were so serious they had been referred to the Justice Department.
\
Whitman, the former New Jersey governor who was EPA administrator at the time, publicly supported Bush's revisions to New Source Review. Privately, she later said, she found it so outrageous that she refused to sign it.
\
""The devil's in the details, where you set the numbers."" Whitman said. ""They set the numbers far too low.""
\
She resigned, though she would not say why for years.
\
""You could tell they were going to lose in court, but that was the attitude,"" Whitman said. ""Clearly, there were those in industry who said, 'Go ahead and do that, because every day that you don't tighten these regulations, I make money.' ""
\
Three years later, in New York v. EPA, the D.C. Circuit ruled as Whitman and EPA career lawyers predicted.
\
The court wrote that the EPA's new lowered thresholds violated the plain language of the Clean Air Act, which called for stringent pollution rules to kick in whenever a factory undergoes ""any physical change.""
\
The EPA had argued that the word any in the law was ambiguous. Therefore, it reasoned, there could be exceptions.
\
The court disagreed, and took the unusual step of mocking the EPA with a reference to Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking-Glass:
\
""Only in a Humpty Dumpty world would Congress be required to use superfluous words while an agency could ignore an expansive word that Congress did use. We decline to adopt such a world view.""
\
Whitman said part of the reason Bush's EPA lost so many court cases was because circuit judges in Washington were well aware of the administration's penchant for distorting science and pushing legal envelopes.
\
""The assumption was always that this group was going to try to fudge facts or manipulate data,"" Whitman said.
\
For example, in a related New Source Review case, the D.C. Circuit threw out portions of a Bush EPA rule that allowed some factory owners who modified their facilities to dispense with record-keeping. The EPA had reasoned that this was OK, so long as the factories didn't expect the changes to increase emissions.
\
The court said that made no sense: If nobody kept records, how could the EPA ever determine if emissions stayed the same?
\
Clear Skies or 'Clear Lies'?
\
A major part of the Bush strategy was to try to dramatically change the existing Clean Air Act - the umbrella law that set a foundation for national air pollution regulation - with sweeping legislation called Clear Skies.
\
Clear Skies would have created, in many cases, new air pollution and mercury controls for power plants. Bush aides said these standards were more stringent; critics said they would have delayed meaningful health benefits for years. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other environmentalists called Bush's proposal ""Clear Lies.""
\
When the Senate killed the proposed Clear Skies bill in 2005, Bush's EPA turned to rule-making.
\
""We moved to Plan B,"" said Connaughton, Bush's senior aide.
\
That spring, Johnson signed two of EPA's most significant administrative rules. Both closely tracked elements of the failed Clear Skies agenda.
\
The first was called the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR). It became a cornerstone of the Bush administration's environmental policies, and was based in part on EPA's successful Acid Rain program of the 1990s.
\
EPA said CAIR would have reduced total sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from power plants in 28 states by 70 percent. CAIR involved a market-based system called cap-and-trade that set a limit for the total amount of pollution from all plants.
\
Under cap-and-trade, factories whose pollution fell below EPA limits would earn so-called allowances. Plants whose pollution exceeded EPA limits could then purchase these allowances. In other words, utilities faced a choice: invest in expensive pollution control ""scrubbers,"" or make arrangements to buy pollution allowances from a company that had.
\
The Bush administration said CAIR would trigger almost immediate pollution reductions, but environmental groups said that in reality the program would delay serious pollution controls for 10 to 20 years.
\
EPA projected that CAIR would prevent 17,000 premature deaths annually by 2015, and trigger related health benefits of $70 billion.
\
Power companies and others in industry did not relish spending billions to erect scrubbers, but they favored the Clear Skies element of CAIR that created the cap-and-trade program because it offered more flexibility and time to meet the coming regulations.
\
Environmental advocates thought CAIR set weak long-term goals but nonetheless were eager to see the scrubbers installed.
\
Shortly after Johnson signed CAIR in March 2005, he issued the second key EPA regulation, the Clean Air Mercury Rule.
\
That rule, which targeted the nation's coal-fired power plants, was far more controversial. Like the CAIR provision, it created a cap-and-trade market for mercury pollution. This alarmed environmentalists because it meant some communities would be more exposed to mercury, a dangerous neurotoxin, than others.
\
The EPA defended its mercury calculations and projections. They said the numbers were based on sound economic principles.
\
But an EPA inspector general's report said the EPA's process was flawed.
\
Investigators found that the EPA's political staff instructed career scientists to flatly set mercury levels at 34 tons nationally per year, instead of using existing best-technology data to determine an appropriate level.
\
Thirty-four tons, it turned out, was the amount of mercury power plants expected to emit anyway under the related CAIR rule. The EPA, the inspector general said, should try again, and make an ""unbiased determination.""
\
""It was so clearly an ass-backward way of doing it, so transparently political,"" said Temple University environmental law professor Amy Sinden. ""That's why EPA has had the kind of record it's had in the courts.""
\
Burnett, the former associate deputy administrator who worked on the mercury rule, conceded that the EPA's own lawyers had warned the agency that it was likely to lose in court.
\
""On the mercury rule, we were told in no uncertain terms about the legal vulnerability,"" Burnett said. ""But the decision was to risk this, given the strongly desired policy outcome.""
\
Queen of Hearts
\
This year, the federal appeals court threw out the mercury and CAIR rules.
\
The mercury case, New Jersey v. EPA, was decided in February.
\
The court took particular offense at the way the EPA had implemented the new rule. Bush's EPA had simply revamped a Clinton-era finding that mercury from coal-fired power plants should be regulated facility by facility.
\
As the court put it, one day the EPA found it ""appropriate and necessary"" - the legal standard - to regulate mercury this way. The next day, it did not.
\
""This explanation deploys the logic of the Queen of Hearts,"" the court wrote, referring to the character whose signature phrase is ""Off with their head!""
\
EPA has appealed the mercury decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, which means the matter won't be resolved until at least early next year.
\
Everybody loses
\
The CAIR case on power plants, North Carolina v. EPA, was decided in July.
\
The ruling surprised many, and upset nearly everyone - from environmentalists to power companies - because it sent the EPA back to the drawing board on its most significant air pollution program.
\
""It left a huge regulatory hole,"" said Eric Svenson, vice president of PSEG, New Jersey's largest electric utility.
\
Environmentalists, Duke Energy and the State of North Carolina had only challenged certain portions of CAIR. Few had expected the court to find so many faults that it would throw out the whole rule.
\
The 60-page ruling was complex, but the bottom line was that the court voided the EPA's most ambitious air-pollution program in eight years. The court stated six reasons for killing CAIR, including that the EPA used a flawed method to create the market-based system.
\
""No amount of tinkering with the rule or revising of the explanations will transform CAIR, as written, into an acceptable rule,"" the court said.
\
The court seemed particularly upset about the market-based approach that allowed power companies to distribute pollution unevenly from state to state.
\
""CAIR may be one of the few examples where the Bush administration tried to do the right thing, but for the wrong reasons,"" said Eric Schaeffer, a former senior EPA enforcement official who is now executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project.
\
""The Bush administration's fascination with emissions trading may have blinded it to what the law actually required.""
\
The three-judge appeals panel - the conservatives David Sentelle and Janice Rogers Brown and ""Humpty Dumpty"" opinion author Judith Rogers - expressed exasperation with the EPA's legal reasoning.
\
After years of vacating rule after rule as illogically and illegally conceived, the judges began to openly question the EPA's true intentions.
\
In a sarcastic footnote, the judges noted the similarities between the emission cap levels in the CAIR administrative rule and the ""Clear Skies"" legislation Bush failed to move through Congress.
\
What a coincidence, the court said. The numbers were the same.
\
The consequences
\
The CAIR court decision on power plants took a big anti-pollution rule off the books - the one that the EPA believed could prevent thousands of premature deaths annually. But it also hit utility companies hard.
\
In 24 hours, the spot market for sulfur dioxide emissions trading fell from $300 per ton to $100 per ton, triggering huge losses for those who had invested in allowances. PPL Corp., one of the nation's 10 largest electric companies, reported a related $33 million loss in November. A spokesman said as much as $77 million more in trade allowances remains at risk.
\
PPL had already invested $1.5 billion to construct scrubbers at two Pennsylvania plants that generate wholesale electricity for Eastern Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland. Each project doubled the size of the existing plant.
\
""I've been in the business 30 years,"" said PPL vice president Dennis Murphy. ""This is the first time EPA has said, this is exactly what you have to do, and then while we're in the process of building it to meet the rule, a court comes in and says it's totally gone - never mind.""
\
A $750 million project in Montour, Pa., south of Williamsport, was already online. PPL's second $750 million scrubber project is nearing completion at a power plant south of Harrisburg, on Brunner Island in the Susquehanna River.
\
Twelve thousand tons of coal arrive by railcar daily at the 1960s-era PPL Brunner Island plant, and, until the scrubber goes online, it will continue to spew sulfur dioxide and particulate matter into the air. The pollution wafts from a 600-foot-high smokestack and drifts east toward Philadelphia.
\
""We're in compliance with our permits, but man, we don't like it,"" said PPL engineer Ross Magee. He oversees the scrubber project, a ""clean coal"" system that PPL says can reduce sulfur emissions by 97 percent and decrease mercury output.
\
Scrubber projects are major endeavors, consisting of sophisticated new buildings, enormous filters, and state-of-the-art smokestacks. They take years to design and construct, and trigger a shift to cheaper coal, which is purchased well in advance. So when EPA put out the CAIR rule in 2005, power companies had to make a significant business decision: Start building scrubbers or wait to see what the courts would do.
\
Murphy said PPL decided to build immediately because if it didn't and the courts had upheld CAIR, the company would have been forced to buy expensive allowances on the trading market to comply with the rule.
\
""When we looked at it, by 2010, we figured we would be able to be ahead environmentally and have allowances that were tradeable,"" Murphy said.
\
Now, in the wake of the CAIR ruling, PPL also faces competition from power plants that have not yet built scrubbers.
\
Shortly after the CAIR ruling, PPL and other companies - as well as states and environmental advocates - asked Congress for a quick fix, one that would temporarily reinstate the CAIR rule by law.
\
But in an election year, Democrats and Republicans couldn't come to a fast agreement, and a proposed bill didn't even get introduced.
\
Lame-duck battles
\
Bush may be a lame duck, but the EPA court and regulatory battles continue, even in the final weeks of his presidency.
\
Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court heard an appeal on a new EPA rule related to fish-kills near power plants. A lower court, ruling for the environmental group Riverkeeper, had struck down the EPA's methods because they employed cost-benefit analysis. In that case, the EPA joined a power company's appeal.
\
The EPA also issued two new rules last week.
\
First, the agency proposed new air pollution standards for medical waste incinerators, pleasantly surprising environmentalists.
\
""It's great news that has us scratching our heads,"" said Pew, the Earthjustice lawyer. ""It's an encouraging sign that EPA can do the right thing, if it wants.""
\
But then the EPA made another announcement. The EPA and the White House made it easier for mountain-top strip-mining operations, including coal suppliers, to dump debris into streams and rivers.
\
Environmental groups said they plan to take the EPA to court.

Major Air Pollution Court Rulings, 2005-08
\
Global warming
\
Massachusetts v. EPA (2007)
\
The EPA claims that it does not have the authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions and other greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming.
\
In a landmark 5-4 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court disagrees and says that the Clean Air Act clearly allows EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emission from cars.
\
Mercury
\
New Jersey v. EPA (2008)
\
The EPA modifies a Clinton-era mercury rule for coal-fired power plants, creating a market-based system with less-stringent pollution controls.
\
The D.C. Circuit vacates the rule, saying EPA's decision to create a rule ""deploys the logic of the Queen of Hearts, substituting EPA's desires for the plain text"" of the Clean Air Act.
\
The EPA appeals to the Supreme Court.
\
Clean Air Interstate Rule
\
North Carolina v. EPA (2008)
\
Power companies, states and environmentalists make minor court challenges to EPA's sweeping air pollution rule - which creates a market-based system and triggers expensive retrofits at power plants in 28 states.
\
But the D.C. Circuit finds so many flaws that it throws the whole rule out. EPA is considering an appeal.
\
New Source Review
\
New York v. EPA (2006)
\
EPA issues new rules related to so-called New Source Review, which requires some power plants making upgrades to implement new pollution controls. The new rule is less burdensome on industry.
\
The D.C. Circuit Court throws out the rule, saying EPA essentially ignored a key phrase - ""any physical change"" - in the Clean Air Act. The court said EPA's logic would make sense ""only in a Humpty Dumpty world.""
\
Smog
\
South Coast Air Quality Management District v. EPA (2006)
\
The EPA interprets the Clean Air Act to allow it to give areas with mild ozone issues more time to reduce smog. The D.C. Circuit Court throws out the rule, saying the EPA's action evaded the plain language of the Clean Air Act, ""which Congress purposefully crafted to limit EPA's discretion.""
\
Incinerators
\
NRDC v. EPA (2007)
\
EPA creates a ""low-risk"" subcategory of manufacturing facilities to be exempted from the Clean Air Act. The D.C. Circuit rejects EPA's new definition of commercial and industrial boilers, ruling that EPA violated ""clear and unambiguous"" language of the Clean Air Act.
\
Pollution monitoring
\
Sierra Club v. EPA (2008)
\
The EPA creates a rule that prohibits states from creating tougher pollution monitoring rules than the federal government. The rule, supported by large oil companies, affect 18,000 factories and limit the amount of pollution they are required to report.
\
The D.C. Circuit throws this out, saying the EPA rule ""is contrary to the statutory directive that each permit must include adequate monitoring requirements.""
\
EPA is weighing an appeal.
\
\
Yesterday
\
The Bush administration systematically eroded the EPA's mission to protect.
\
Today
\
Skeptical judges repeatedly voided the EPA's attempts to end-run Congress.
\
Tomorrow
\
Major flaws mar a voluntary program promoted as a solution for global warming.
\
Wednesday
\
The EPA chief sets air-pollution rules that appall his own scientific advisers.

92,"Don Hopey can be reached at dhopey@post-gazette.com or at 412-263- 1983.\ The Bush administration yesterday issued a new rule aimed at reducing smog and soot from power plants that it says will save thousands of lives and billions of dollars in health care costs across 28 states in the East, Midwest and South.\ Some environmental groups said the rule was a step in the right direction, but others were critical of the slow pace of the reductions and the cap-and-trade provisions of the plan.\ The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said the tightened regulation will help Pennsylvania's coal-burning power plants reduce emissions of smog-forming nitrogen oxides by 835,000 tons or 86 percent, and emissions of soot-producing sulfur dioxide by 97,000 tons or 56 percent.\ In addition, the Clean Air Interstate Rule -- CAIR -- will reduce power plant pollution from 10 Southern and Midwestern states, which drifts into Pennsylvania on prevailing westerly winds and significantly adds to the state's unhealthy levels of smog and soot.\ ""This is a really big deal, not just a regulatory rule making,"" said Donald Welsh, EPA administrator for the mid-Atlantic region. ""The reductions will really have an impact on the lives of people on the street.""\ Those emissions reductions will help 32 Pennsylvania counties meet federal smog standards and 22 counties meet federal soot standards by 2015.\ But the EPA projections show the Clairton/Liberty area of Allegheny County as one of four areas in the 28-state region that will remain in non-attainment for soot standards unless additional emissions controls are placed local industrial sources. The others are in Maryland near Washington, D.C., and two areas of West Virginia. The new rule will also fail to reduce smog to healthy levels in five southeastern counties around Philadelphia.\ Nationally, the EPA estimates the new interstate rule will prevent 17,000 premature deaths and 700,000 cases of asthma, bronchitis and other respiratory ailments. The agency estimates that when fully implemented the rule will save 1.7 million lost work days and 500,000 lost school days.\ The pollution cuts will cost utilities about $4 billion a year to implement and eventually cost consumers about $1 more a month on their electric bills but will save $85 billion annually in health care costs.\ ""CAIR will result in the largest pollution reductions and health benefits of any air rule in more than a decade,"" said acting EPA Administrator Steve Johnson. ""The action we are taking will require all 28 states to be good neighbors, helping states downwind by controlling airborne emissions at their source.""\ While the rule mandates emissions reductions, it does not mandate reductions from any individual power plants. Instead it will utilize a ""cap and trade"" program that allows utilities to reduce emissions at some power plants but not others, as long as total emissions are reduced to the targeted amounts.\ EPA air quality program officials in Philadelphia said ""significant numbers"" and ""a healthy percentage"" of power plants will have to install new controls, but could not say how many. Larger power plants are more likely to install controls, they said, but older plants are less likely.\ ""The rule harnesses the power of the market to the cause of human health and the environment,"" Fred Krupp, president of Environmental Defense. ""And by addressing upwind pollution, it will help states and local governments meet their legal obligations to bring healthy air to their citizens.""\ But Arthur Stamoulis, policy analyst for the Clean Air Council, said the rule doesn't go nearly far enough in mandating emissions reductions from the biggest polluting power plants.\ ""Even at full implementation in 2015 there will still be approximately 60 million Americans breathing dirty air,"" Stamoulis said. ""People in southeastern Pennsylvania and Delaware will still be breathing smog, and people in Allegheny County will still be saddled with high levels of soot.\ ""This rule is significant and will save lives but it still leaves a lot of room for improvement.""\ Utilities and pro-business and development organizations generally supported the interstate rule's cap and trade provisions as a cost-effective way to get the required reductions.\ Rachel Gogos, a spokeswoman for the Allegheny Conference, which has consistently called for emissions controls on upwind pollution sources, called the rule ""a significant tool for our region to meet air quality standards.""\ Scott Segal, director of the Electric Reliability Coordinating Council, said the organization's member utilities favor the cap and trade approach over ""case-by case, litigation heavy approaches to air pollution control.""\ The interstate rule was announced a day after the Bush administration's controversial Clear Skies legislation, the centerpiece of its environmental policy, failed to win approval of a Senate committee.\ Although the administration touted the bill as an opportunity to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and mercury from 1,300 coal-burning power plants by 70 percent, environmentalists, state and local air quality officials and Democrats remain opposed.\ The administration plans to introduce new rules to control mercury emissions from power plants and other industrial sources Thursday."
93,"THE ISSUE\Exelon announced May 8 that it will shut down Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station’s Unit 1 reactor, which began operation in 1974, by Sept. 30. The Dauphin County facility, which was infamously the site of a partial meltdown of Unit 2 in 1979, has been losing hundreds of millions of dollars per year. Exelon, which first disclosed the possibility of closure two years ago, said significant subsidies or policy changes in Harrisburg would have been needed for TMI to be economically viable. Proposals in the Capitol, including one by state Sen. Ryan Aument, R-Mount Joy, that would provide Pennsylvania’s nuclear industry with about $500 million in annual subsidies from electric ratepayers received little traction as Exelon’s June deadline for refueling TMI loomed.\There is no applause from us regarding the news that TMI will stop producing electricity in September. We think it’s the correct decision, as we have stated here previously. But we regret that hundreds of workers, including about 200 who live in Lancaster County, are likely to lose their jobs. We regret the strain the significant loss of tax revenue will put on Londonderry Township and the Lower Dauphin School District. We regret that businesses around TMI will take a financial hit.\These are the lamentable realities surrounding the closure of any business.\And that is, ultimately, what TMI is. It is in the business of making electricity, and it was losing money. Its owner, Exelon, gave advance warning that TMI would close without some sort of state rescue.\And so the pros and cons of issues related to TMI’s looming closure were debated; these issues include the carbon footprint of nuclear energy, the safety of nuclear energy (and its spent-fuel storage), and the diversity and reliability of Pennsylvania’s overall electricity grid. These are important discussions.\Also debated were the pros and cons of subsidizing nuclear power in Pennsylvania by giving it preferential treatment as a “clean” energy source. A change of status within the state’s Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards — as proposed in both state House and Senate bills — would require electricity distributors to make nuclear energy represent 50% of the market, thus giving the industry hundreds of millions in subsidies per year. That money would come out of the pocket of the state’s electric ratepayers.\This approach seemed to us, and many critics, to be an expensive bailout of nuclear power. It struck us as both wrong and curious.\Curious because TMI was the only Pennsylvania nuclear power plant losing money. Why should we give hundreds of millions annually to a profitable industry? As Marc Levy of The Associated Press noted: “Exelon reported $2 billion in profits last year, and critics said a bailout meant investing in outdated, inefficient and expensive power plants while benefiting shareholders of a profitable company on the backs of Pennsylvania ratepayers.”\Unsurprisingly, the subsidy proposals didn’t appear to get much traction in Harrisburg, which is likely why Exelon went ahead with its closure decision.\In this case, no move by our lawmakers was the right move.\The market and the consumers have spoken. Three Mile Island was not profitable. Instead of being propped up, closure is the logical step.\Yet this cannot be the end of the important discussion over Pennsylvania’s electricity grid and its long-term energy plan. It must be just the beginning.\Our state lawmakers should focus on a broader, greener energy strategy for the crucial next decades. Pennsylvania is lagging behind other states in combating climate change, and it needs legislation for aggressively limiting pollution and encouraging investment in zero-emission energy.\We believe there is an important role for the state’s remaining nuclear power plants during this transition. Aument — as a co-chair of last year’s Bicameral Nuclear Energy Caucus Report — did a good job of outlining the benefits of nuclear power within a diverse and reliable electricity grid.\One of the report’s proposals to undergird the nuclear industry involves the establishment of a statewide carbon fee that would be, in essence, a market-based solution valuing nuclear power.\“Currently, damages and associated costs to society caused by carbon pollution are largely not reflected in the price of generating electricity,” the report stated. Carbon dioxide — produced by burning natural gas and coal — is the main greenhouse gas contributing to global warming.\Pennsylvania is studying a citizen-led petition that would price carbon emissions via a cap-and-trade system, StateImpact Pennsylvania’s Marie Cusick has reported. The state Department of Environmental Protection is evaluating the petition, which is modeled after the approach used in California.\“Cap-and-trade is a market-based system that sets a firm, overall limit on emissions,” Cusick wrote last year. “Companies are then allowed to buy and sell allowances to pollute certain amounts. California’s program applies to greenhouse gas emissions from the electricity sector, as well as to other major air pollution sources, the import of electricity, and the sale of natural gas, heating oil, and gasoline.”\Cap-and-trade is the better approach to leveling the playing field for Pennsylvania’s remaining nuclear power plants, especially against cheaper natural gas. And cap-and-trade would help us reach Gov. Tom Wolf’s call for Pennsylvania to achieve a 26% reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions statewide by 2025 (from 2005 levels) and an 80% reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 (from 2005 levels).\TMI will continue to loom large over south-central Pennsylvania — the iconic towers are not expected to come down until 2074, according to Exelon. Our memories of the accident at Unit 2 in 1979 perhaps clouded some of our discussions about the site’s future. But this closure wasn’t about fear. It was about market forces. And our future decisions about nuclear power in Pennsylvania should be grounded in sensible ideas about the environment, the reliability of the electricity grid and fiscal responsibility.\ Vote today \Today is the Pennsylvania primary. Polls open at 7 a.m. and close at 8 p.m.\Lancaster County voters registered with either of the two major political parties — and only those voters — will nominate candidates for dozens of municipal and judicial offices. Those positions include school board, township supervisor, borough and city council, magisterial district judge and countywide offices such as register of wills and commissioner.

94,"Due to newsroom front-end system production difficulties the entire text could not be electronically captured for the online archive, please see microfilm or pdf for the complete chart.\ Melody Zullinger unhooked the shimmering 31/2-pound bass and let it slip from her hands back into the river.\ ""The mercury,"" she said later, explaining why she let the fish go.\ For the executive director of the Pennsylvania Federation of Sportsmen's Clubs, the fight in Harrisburg over mercury emissions from power plants is more than political. She can't help wondering if consumption of contaminated fish when she was pregnant years ago contributed to her son's disability. He has attention deficit disorder, one of many health problems linked to mercury pollution.\ ""It's a problem,"" Zullinger said of mercury. ""We know it's a problem. So why shouldn't we do whatever we can to fix the problem?""\ Pennsylvania's coal-fired power plants, the state's greatest source of mercury pollution, spew five tons of mercury into the air every year. Some of the toxic metal, which is found in coal, rains down nearby; some blows into other states, and even into countries on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean.\ New rules proposed by Gov. Ed Rendell would require the plants to reduce mercury emissions by 90 percent by 2015, exceeding federal reduction requirements. The state rules would transform coal-rich Pennsylvania -- the country's second-biggest mercury polluter, behind only Texas -- into an exemplar of environmental protection.\ The proposed state rules already have been approved by the state's Air Quality Technical Advisory Committee and its Environmental Quality Board as part of an elaborate regulatory review process.\ Next the state's Independent Regulatory Review Commission will vote on the rules. Even if the commission approves them, the environmental committees of the Assembly and Senate could try to override the decision by moving the matter to the Legislature.\ But the rules must first overcome fierce opposition from business interests, particularly energy companies, including PPL Corp. of Allentown. Complying would be at best too expensive, and at worst technologically impossible, according to the Electric Power Generation Association, a lobbying group.\ At a legislative hearing in Harrisburg in September, the association's president laid out a doomsday scenario: The rules would drive up costs of energy production, forcing energy companies to shut power plants and lay off workers. Pennsylvania could see electricity shortages, with the effects rippling throughout the economy.\ Reducing mercury emissions should be done in a ""way that doesn't put power in jeopardy,"" said Robert Barkanic, PPL's director of environmental management.\ The debate boils down to two sets of conflicting predictions. Both sides say science is on their side. Each cites expert testimony and published studies.\ Kathleen McGinty, secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, says technology to control mercury emissions is both proven and affordable.\ ""We are morally compelled to take effective action to safeguard our people against this toxic pollutant,"" said McGinty, the former chief of President Clinton's Council on Environmental Quality, at the legislative hearing. ""And we can take that action at minimal cost.""\ The state's approach to curbing that pollution has won the support of a broad coalition of groups, such as the sportsmen's federation and religious organizations concerned with the plight of the unborn. Hearings this year drew an unprecedented 11,000 public comments -- all but 38 in favor of the rules.\ But state politicians also will have to consider the powerful constituencies who are opposed. The electric companies are allied with the coal companies with operations in the western parts of state. And both are giving money to sympathetic office-holders.\ State vs. federal rules\ Under the new state rules, Pennsylvania would opt out of the Bush administration's cap-and-trade system, which allows smaller, dirtier power plants to buy mercury pollution credits from bigger, cleaner plants.\ Proponents of the cap-and-trade system, who include electric and coal companies, say it balances mercury reduction and electricity production and protects the country's energy supply by ensuring that smaller plants, which would be very expensive to retrofit considering their limited output, can continue to operate.\ Here's how it works: The Sunbury power plant in Northumberland County, for example, could forgo making changes by buying pollution credits from -- in other words, paying a fee to -- some California power plant that has earned credits with its top-of-the-line pollution-control technology.\ ""Mercury control at particular points is purely optional under the president's plan,"" McGinty said.\ By comparison, the state rules would prohibit Pennsylvania power plants from buying emissions credits from out of state. This means that virtually all Pennsylvania power companies would have to cut emissions, as opposed to buying pollution credits.\ Another difference between the federal and state rules has to do with the amount of mercury reduction.\ Under the federal rules, power plants are expected to reduce mercury emissions by 80 percent to 86 percent by 2018. Under the state rules, the goal is 90 percent by 2015.\ That difference could translate into additional hundreds of millions of dollars in how much electric companies will have to spend on pollution controls, according to Barkanic. Capturing mercury emissions, it turns out, is like picking fruit: It becomes more difficult after getting what's within easy reach.\ In fact, Barkanic said, 90 percent reduction might not be even possible with today's technology, which is the primary reason, PPL says, it is opposed to the state rules.\ ""You can't put yourself in a noncompliance situation,"" he said. ""It's not that we don't want to [comply]; we might not be able to.""\ Mercury poisoning\ vs. electricity shortages\ Even tiny amounts of mercury can cause serious health problems, according to studies cited by proponents of the state rules. Exposure to excessive levels can permanently damage the brain and kidneys and result in death.\ Today, mercury poisoning is most commonly associated with fish, such as tuna. Pregnant women and children are advised to limit fish consumption. In Pennsylvania, 77 lakes, ponds and rivers have been found to have dangerously high levels of mercury.\ A growing body of science -- including studies by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- suggests that mercury is finding its way into other foods, as well, and that it could be responsible for a wide array of health problems.\ Mercury is being absorbed by the grains that people and animals eat. Beef liver, for instance, has 44 times the amount of mercury considered safe by the EPA.\ Some scientists believe the rising prevalence of attention deficit disorder could be the result of mercury pollution. Mercury also has been linked to mental retardation, autism and cardiovascular problems.\ But Pennsylvania could go too far in its efforts to reduce mercury pollution, according to opponents of the state rules.\ ""We believe good public policy demands that as we protect the environment and public health, we also protect jobs, consumers and Pennsylvania's economic future,"" said Douglas Biden, president of the Electric Power Generation Association. ""A thorough cost/benefit analysis is critical.""\ In response to Secretary McGinty, Biden said the state rules offer ""no demonstrated environmental or health benefits"" over the federal cap-and-trade system.\ As for the costs, according to Biden: Forcing electric companies to shut down smaller, dirtier power plants could threaten the power supply and send rates in a newly deregulated electricity market skyrocketing; they also could reduce demand for Pennsylvania coal by 14 percent, since Pennsylvania coal has a higher mercury content than coal from other parts of the country.\ The rules also would raise the overall cost of reducing mercury emissions -- another sore spot for PPL.\ While McGinty said complying with the state rules will cost about $1 million per coal-fired power plant, PPL said in a recent financial filing that it is about $100 million, on average, bringing the total cost for its five coal-fired power plants to more than $500 million.\ ""We're not saying we're against more reductions,"" Barkanic said. ""Where we're disagreeing with the state is how to do that.""\ Cutting across political lines\ The Electric Power Generation Association has framed the mercury debate as a contest between unreasonable environmentalism and jobs.\ In Harrisburg, more Republicans than Democrats oppose the state rules. Of 100 sponsors of a state House bill designed to block the rules, about a dozen were Democrats.\ Although some Democrats have received political contributions from the energy industry, the political action committees representing electric and coal companies have favored Republicans. Rep. David Reed, R-Indiana, who wrote a bill intended to block the state rules, has gotten at least $4,800 this year from groups such as the Pennsylvania Coal PAC and PACs representing PPL and Reliant Energy, of Houston, Texas.\ Yet, outside the state capital, the debate cuts across political party lines.\ At least 15 states -- including some Republican strongholds such as Montana and North Carolina -- either have enacted or are considering their own rules, which would go beyond the federal cap- and-trade system.\ In Pennsylvania, the electric and coal companies have recruited to their side both the Pennsylvania Chamber of Business and Industry and the Democratic-leaning International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.\ Meanwhile, many outdoorsmen, typically a Republican voting bloc, and some Christian groups are siding with Democrat Rendell.\ ""Forget whether you're a Democrat or a Republican. It's whether you are right or wrong,"" said Zullinger, the director of the sportsmen's clubs federation.\ Anglers such as her are perhaps more aware of the dangers of mercury than most because they can't eat some of the fish they catch.\ ""If you are a true conservationistyou clean up your own backyard first,"" the Harrisburg resident said.\ The plight of children is the primary concern of Christian groups, such as the National Council of Catholic Women and the Pennsylvania Council of Churches, that have spoken out.\ At a public hearing this summer, the Rev. William Thwing, representing the churches council, said he supports state rules ""for the sake of my children and their children yet unbornfor the sake of the young people who plan to have children in Pennsylvania.""\ The Independent Regulatory Review Commission, which consists of three Democrats and two Republicans, will meet Thursday to vote on the proposed state rules. According to people closely following the matter, whatever the commission decides is likely to be challenged.\ DECISION DAY\ ON THURSDAY, an independent state commission will vote on stricter rules for mercury emissions at coal-fired power plants.\ EVEN IF the commission approves the new rules, the state Legislature could step in and take up the issue, effectively overriding the commission.\ AT STAKE: Continued ill-effects of mercury poisoning and the cost to treat those afflicted; or the millions of dollars to convert power plants, an expense that utility consumers may have to absorb."
95," Pennsylvania has been given the green light from an oversight panel to develop its own regulations for power plant mercury emissions, while it sues the federal government over pollution standards it believes fail to adequately address the public health risk.\ Mercury accumulates in fish, for which there are statewide consumption advisories.\ While the move has been hailed by conservation and outdoors groups, which have been pressing the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection to do something about mercury, some air quality experts question the economic and environmental benefits of a state-specific approach in the face of a global problem.\ DEP received permission to craft its own rule for coal-fired power plants at a hearing before the Environmental Quality Board Tuesday in Harrisburg. Pennsylvania is second only to Texas in mercury emissions, 77 percent of which come from 39 coal-burning power plants, according to DEP spokesman Kurt Knaus. By a 17-3 vote, the board gave DEP approval to draft a plan by November 2006, instead of complying with the federal rule, which took effect in March.\ That rule, an amendment to the Clean Air Act of 1990, calls for a gradual emissions reduction of 69 percent nationwide by 2018. Companies can retrofit their plants to become compliant, but also have the option of purchasing pollution allowances from other companies as part of an approach known as ""cap and trade.""\ Pennsylvania has joined other states in suing the EPA to have the rule overturned because it believes ""the federal market-driven approach just doesn't work when it comes to mercury,"" Knaus said.\ Unlike some pollutants that quickly disperse, mercury is more prone to settle around the pollution source, Knaus said. Though so- called hot spots are a topic of debate among air quality experts, Knaus cites EPA data indicating that 50 to 80 percent of the mercury plaguing Pennsylvania waters is from plants located within the state, and that mercury deposits are typically found within a 90- mile radius of power plants.\ Mercury is a highly toxic chemical emitted into the air by coal- burning plants and deposited by rain into waterways and soil, where it bio-accumulates through the food chain, beginning with plant life. It has been identified as a particular health threat to subsistence anglers and to women of childbearing age and children.\ Mercury has been shown to cause developmental delays and brain and nervous system disorders in children, and heart and immune system problems in adults, said Knaus. Though there is a statewide advisory of one fish meal a week for all species, special advisories exist for certain types of fish, such as largemouth bass and walleye, on lakes and streams where mercury levels test high. There are also advisories for PCBs, which come from paint, plastics, electrical transformers and other sources, and for chlordane, a pesticide chemical. The state and the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission have been testing fisheries for mercury and other pollutants for the past 15 years.\ ""Mercury is an air quality issue, but fish are the bell- weathers, the barometers, of stream health,"" said Fish and Boat Commission spokesman Dan Tredinnick. ""Their health impacts our constituents.""\ Tuesday, the Pennsylvania Game Commission Web site began advising hunters to avoid eating mergansers, a type of duck that dives for fish. It also urges them to cut as much fat as possible from other types of waterfowl harvested in the wild and to discard the stuffing used to flavor birds in the cooking process. The advisories aren't new, said Game Commission spokesman Gerry Feaser, but putting them on line makes them more visible.\ According to the EPA, humans aren't the only ones to suffer the effects of mercury consumption. Wildlife can experience reduced fertility, slower growth, abnormal behavior and death. On its Web site, the EPA reports that mercury found in the environment can alter the endocrine system of fish, which plays an important role in their development and reproduction. In crafting its proposed rule, DEP will seek input from sportsmen, the academic and scientific communities, representatives of coal and other industries, and members of its Air Quality Technical Advisory Committee, which has no authority but will be part of the process, said Knaus. Some members of that committee, including Peter Adams, a Carnegie Mellon University assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering, are questioning how cost-effective state regulations would be, given mercury's global scope. He said power plant emissions cross state lines, so some of the mercury deposited in Pennsylvania is coming from elsewhere, just as mercury from Pennsylvania-based power plants is polluting other parts of the world.\ ""Having a state rule would be an improvement over what we've had,"" Adams said, ""but are all emitters sharing the cost in the same way?""\ Joe Duckett, an environmental engineer who works for an air emission control system design company and serves on the technical advisory committee, also questioned a state-specific approach. ""Mercury is an international problem, so the money might be better spent elsewhere,"" he said. ""I think the federal regulations are fine.""\ Knaus said a cost-benefit analysis would be part of DEP's final proposal. He also said that Pennsylvania still advocates for a federal approach to ensure equity and reductions on a broad scale. ""But the current federal rule isn't strong,"" he said. ""We had the option of making a stronger one on our own and that's the one we took.""\ Environmental groups have applauded the move. ""We'll be at the table advocating for a 90 percent reduction in emissions, and the technology is there for plants to do that,"" said Jan Jarrett, vice president of PennFuture, a public interest and environmental advocacy group that has led the push for state-specific regulations.\ Once a draft proposal is written, DEP will need approval from the Environmental Quality Board and the Independent Regulatory Review Commission.\ The proposal will be put out for public comment before a final plan is adopted."
96,"WASHINGTON - Last month, Mike Doyle stepped out of a meeting on climate change legislation to face a group of union steelworkers on a lobbying storm on Capitol Hill.\It was a brief, friendly meeting in a marble hall. Mr. Doyle, D-Forest Hills, talked about his commitment to the environment without passing policies that could imperil steel and manufacturing jobs in the Pittsburgh region. He brought up his concerns about the Green New Deal, a sweeping plan calling for an end to fossil fuels, hatched by liberal Democrats from New York and Massachusetts.\""We share the same goals: We want to get to net-zero carbon,"" he told them. ""I think there are a lot smarter ways to do it.""\These subtle but long-standing climate policy differences within the Democratic Party recently erupted after Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto announced his unequivocal opposition to new petrochemical plants in the region.\Mr. Peduto, who cited his concern that more carbon and methane would degrade Pittsburgh's troubled air quality, drew fire from labor unions and some moderate Democrats who see such staunch opposition to more plastics plants - and the natural gas drilling that enables them - as jeopardizing the region's economy.\Since arrival to Congress in 1995, Mr. Doyle has been on the front lines of confronting climate change as a 19-year member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. It's a powerful panel, now controlled by Democrats, with the unenviable task of how to limit atmospheric gases released by a range of sources - and how to find Congressional consensus on solutions.\In July, the committee launched a series of hearings and meetings to get input on climate change legislation. The committee's goal is to reach net-zero carbon emissions and a 100% clean economy by 2050.\Mr. Doyle's broad view, shared by unions and Rep. Conor Lamb, D-Mt. Lebanon, is that investment in technology can allow industries, even those dependent on extracting fossil fuels, to operate cleanly.\Those measures are more realistic, Mr. Doyle said in an interview, and can garner enough bipartisan votes to move forward on meaningful proposals.\Mr. Doyle touted his recent proposal to provide a 30% production tax credit for large-scale batteries that store energy for solar and wind farms when the sun isn't shining and the wind isn't blowing.\He wants to encourage energy efficiency in the building sector and scale up electric vehicles, he said, because the building and transportation sectors are together responsible for more emissions than the power and steel sectors.\Doyle's drumbeat\Mr. Doyle has beat this drum in a similar situation in 2009 - during the last session of Congress the Democrats controlled the House.\Two liberal Democrats from the coasts - Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., and Rep. Ed Markey, D-Mass. - were pushing forward on a carbon cap-and-trade program. (Mr. Markey, alongside Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., introduced the Green New Deal in February.)\Cap and trade sets a limit on carbon emissions and requires facilities to buy pollution credits for excess emissions, credits that facilities can then trade. Mr. Doyle felt it amounted to major penalties for the steel and manufacturing sectors, which were already battered by foreign competitors that did not have such regulations. He was concerned some U.S. companies may leave the country, destroying American jobs while still emitting carbon.\Mr. Doyle and Jay Inslee, then a representative from Washington State, drafted an amendment to provide rebates, for up to 15 years, to energy-intensive industries and those manufacturers vulnerable to overseas competition.\""It makes sense we attack the low-hanging fruit,"" he added. ""What do we agree on?""\Mr. Lamb, a first-term congressman who represents the northwestern Pittsburgh suburbs, including the Shell cracker plant, has favored increased federal funding for energy research as a way to fight climate change.\As chair of the Energy subcommittee of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology - he wants to boost the budget for ARPA-e, the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy.\Established in 2009, the Energy Department research agency was modeled on DARPA, a Defense Department program well known for investing in Carnegie Mellon University robotics ventures for military purposes.\In September, Mr. Lamb's subcommittee moved forward legislation that more than triples ARPA-e's budget to $1 billion by 2024 and directs more funding toward lowering emissions in manufacturing.\Reached for comment last week, Mr. Lamb reiterated that natural gas, as a whole, has been beneficial to his district.\""Everybody talks about Pittsburgh reinventing itself and being successful in the 21st century - well, outside the city limits, it means energy jobs and manufacturing,"" Mr. Lamb said.\""I don't think it's really accurate to suggest that there's a trade off there between jobs and the environment.""\Asked if he would sponsor a carbon tax, Mr. Lamb said he wasn't ready to support it.\""It's still early days for a proposal like that,"" he said. ""It's a little hard to forecast what that would mean for jobs in this region.""\Mr. Lamb won two elections in 2018 with the overwhelming support of labor unions. And last month, Allegheny County Labor Council disagreed ""wholeheartedly"" with Mr. Peduto's comments - in a statement distributed for the council by Mr. Lamb's brother and campaign spokesman, Coleman Lamb.\""It's hard to believe that the mayor of Pittsburgh would actually tell companies not to create thousands of good middle-class jobs in our region,"" the labor council's president, Darrin Kelly, stated. ""It just isn't true that we have to choose between good jobs and clean air and water.""\The GOP chimes in\Some Republicans, sensing a moment to beat back more progressive proposals like the Green New Deal and a nationwide ban on fracking, have chimed in.\Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., said petrochemicals had brought ""tremendous benefits"" to Western Pennsylvania without harming the environment.\Mr. Toomey, in an interview, said he was ""really shocked"" when he heard Mr. Peduto's comments. ""I like the mayor, I think he's a good man, but he couldn't be more mistaken,"" he said.\Asked why a U.S. senator would comment on a mayor's views, Mr. Toomey said the debate is bigger than Pittsburgh.\This is ""a very far left wing of the Democratic Party that is frankly become hostile to economic growth and prosperity, and they're advocating terrible policies,"" Mr. Toomey said. Mr. Peduto's position ""is an example.""\Mr. Doyle, a self-styled broker of climate compromise, believes he can pull together all sides on his committee to get something done.\""There's no magic wand to it,"" Mr. Doyle told the steelworkers last month, before ducking back to the hearing. But ""we have to make sure we're not taking out whole industries to do this, and we can do this in a way that doesn't do that.""\CAPTION: PHOTO: Alexandra Wimley/Post-Gazette: U.S. Rep.

97,"Like the climate itself, Gov. Tom Wolf’s decision to include the state in a regional effort to curb greenhouse gas emissions is not a purely partisan matter.\The order directs executive branch agencies to lay the regulatory foundation for the state to join the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. That coalition of nine states operates a “cap-and-trade” program, under which fossil fuel-powered utilities and other industrial polluters are allowed to meet emission caps by buying credits. Governments use the revenue to promote clean energy and develop clean-energy infrastructure. Over time, the amount of available credits declines, creating pressure for higher energy efficiency and fewer emissions.\Members of the RGGI are Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont. New Jersey, an original member that withdrew, is expected to rejoin.\Pennsylvania is unique among those states because, as the nation’s second-leading natural gas producer and third-leading coal producer, it would be the only major fossil-fuel producer in the group. It also would be the only state in the group to be a net exporter of electricity, a majority of which is produced by fossil fuels.\So the economic stakes are higher for Pennsylvania than for the other members.\Although the political fault lines on the issue generally divide pro-environment Democrats and pro-industry Republicans, those lines are not distinct. Many Republican legislators, for example, are proponents of the state’s nuclear power industry, the second-largest nationally. Since nuclear power generation does not produce carbon emissions, the industry would be among the foremost beneficiaries of a cap-and-trade pact. Likewise, some legislative Democrats represent districts heavily invested in coal and gas production, and power production dependent upon those fuels.\The cap-and-trade concept has a long bipartisan pedigree. President Ronald Reagan embraced it in the 1980s to help phase out leaded gasoline. In 1989, President George H.W. Bush convinced a Democratic Congress to use it to help reduce sulfur emissions to fight acid rain. President George W. Bush used it in 2005’s Clean Air Interstate Rule to increase Clean Air Act pollution standards.\Wolf’s order is the beginning of a process.

99,"The six ""Principles for Global Warming Legislation"" released recently by Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., were notable for what they lacked. There were no specific greenhouse-gas emissions targets. There was no determination on an auction of pollution permits vs. initially giving some or most of them away to polluters. But Ms. Boxer was clear on one thing: There will be no consideration of a carbon tax.\Sure, the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee said, ""We're willing to look at everything."" But she ended that declaration with ""... but we believe cap-and-trade is the way to go.""\Ms. Boxer's principles include enforceable reductions with periodic review. States and localities would be allowed to forge ahead on their own efforts to fight global warming. A transparent carbon market would be established. The proceeds generated by it would fund clean energy technology and assist the transition by consumers, manufacturers, states and localities to a clean-energy economy.\Cap-and-trade regimes have advantages, notably the ability to set a limit on emissions and to integrate with other countries. But they are complex and vulnerable to lobbying and special pleading, and they do not guarantee success.\The experience of the European Union is Exhibit A. Emissions targets were set too high. Too many pollution allowances were given away to industry. The value of a carbon credit plummeted. Companies made windfall profits by charging customers more for energy while selling allowances they didn't need. And the Europeans have not had much success reducing greenhouse-gas emissions. Disputes on the next round of reductions led to the creation of a two-tiered system to appease Eastern European countries fearful of the cost to their industries.\A carbon tax, by contrast, is simple and sure in its effects. Last summer, when gas prices shot up past $4 a gallon, average miles driven dropped significantly, as did energy consumption. Demand for fuel-efficient cars and overall energy efficiency skyrocketed.\If high prices had been the result of a gas tax, that money would have stayed in the United States rather than lining the pockets of oil-rich regimes all too happy to feed the U.S. addiction to fossil fuels. As with a cap-and-trade system, the money generated by a carbon tax could be given back to the American people.\Alluding to the climate-change bill that failed in the Senate last June, Ms. Boxer said that her committee would be ""starting afresh."" What better way to do that than by giving a tax on carbon a fair hearing?"
100,"A federal appeals court yesterday threw out the Environmental Protection Agency's approach to limiting mercury emitted from power-plant smokestacks, saying the agency ignored laws and twisted logic when it imposed new standards that were favorable to plant owners.\The ruling, by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, was another judicial rejection of Bush administration pollution policies. It comes less than a year after the U.S. Supreme Court rebuked the administration and EPA for refusing to regulate greenhouse gases.\This court's critique -- which undid a controversial program to ""trade"" emissions of mercury, a potent neurotoxin -- was especially sharp. It compared the EPA to the capricious Queen of Hearts in ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,"" saying the agency had followed its own desires and ignored the law's ""plain text.""\Coal-fired power plants are responsible for about a third of the country's total mercury emissions. The EPA responded yesterday that the ruling wiped out a valuable program that would have reduced mercury emissions by 70 percent.\Mercury, a byproduct of burning coal, is an environmental problem because it drops out of the air and accumulates in rivers and streams, winding up stored in the tissue of fish. If the fish are eaten by expectant mothers or children, the metal can cause serious developmental problems in a child's brain.\The case decided yesterday turned on a highly contentious 2005 EPA decision. It proposed a ""cap-and-trade"" program, in which plants were required to reduce their mercury output to a certain level -- or buy credits from plants with emissions below those levels. That rule was to go into effect in 2010.\But environmentalists objected. They said that if a plant were allowed to buy its way out of some cutbacks, the result could be a ""hot spot"" of pollution in nearby areas. ""There will be neighborhoods that get little or no reduction"" in pollution if their local plants take no measures to curb emissions, said Carol M. Browner, the EPA administrator under former President Bill Clinton.\After the EPA decision, a coalition of activist groups and state officials sued. Their argument was that the EPA violated terms of a clear mandate from Congress: that all plants be outfitted with the best available technology to cut emissions. The appeals court agreed.\Pennsylvania was one of the 25 states that had rejected the weaker federal rule that contained the cap-and-trade provision. The state's rule does not have cap-and-trade, and requires coal-fired power plants to cut mercury emissions 80 percent by 2010 and 90 percent by 2015.\""Today's decision was in the best interest of our citizens and environment,"" said Gov. Ed Rendell. Pennsylvania has 34 plants with 71 electric generating units and a capacity of 20,000 megawatts."
101,"WASHINGTON -- A bipartisan trio of senators trying to forge a compromise on climate change legislation huddled with Obama administration officials yesterday about their plan to combine caps on greenhouse gas emissions with expanded offshore drilling and incentives for nuclear power.\Sens. John Kerry, D-Mass., Joseph Lieberman, I-Conn., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said they were working on a ""dual track"" to assemble a new proposal they hope would win Senate approval, even as Republicans stall a key committee's work on the issue of global warming.\""The stakes are so high for the people of our planet, for the people of our country, [and] for our children and grandchildren, that we will be held accountable by history unless we make every effort to find common ground,"" Mr. Lieberman told reporters.\Mr. Kerry and Mr. Graham said their approach would combine ""aggressive reductions"" in greenhouse gas emissions blamed for global warming with a plan to spur the construction of nuclear power plants and more ""onshore and offshore oil and gas exploration.""\""We're trying to find that sweet spot of a bill that will be good for the environment, good for business and make us energy independent,"" Mr. Graham said yesterday.\Mr. Kerry said the group was trying ""to broaden the base of support"" for a climate plan and ""achieve the obviously all-important goal of getting 60 votes"" that are needed to overcome a filibuster in the Senate.\Although Mr. Kerry said the group's push wouldn't interfere with work by six Senate committees on the issue, it was a tacit acknowledgment that the leading measure -- a bill he introduced with Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif. -- is too controversial to pass.\That legislation has already stalled in Ms. Boxer's Environment and Public Works Committee, where Republicans members have boycotted two days of meetings in a bid to force a new federal analysis of the bill's potential price tag.\The Kerry-Boxer bill at issue would effectively put a price on the carbon dioxide released whenever fossil fuels are burned by creating a cap-and-trade system for polluters to buy and sell allowances to release the substances.\A cap-and-trade program is likely to be part of any compromise fashioned by Mr. Kerry, Mr. Graham and Mr. Lieberman, but they have signaled their support for a firm ""price collar"" that would set a minimum floor and maximum ceiling for the price of emission allowances. Business groups have said they crave certainty in carbon pricing and worry about spikes in the cost of pollution permits."
102,"WASHINGTON -- Clad in a pinstripe suit, Josh McNeil made the rounds on Capitol Hill yesterday, lobbying for climate change legislation. \Mr. McNeil, who met with staff members for Sens. Bob Casey and Arlen Specter, is a typical kind of advocate for the bill, which would force drastic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. From the group's Philadelphia office, he runs Pennsylvania operations for the League of Conservation Voters, an environmental group.\But as the influence battle escalates in the Senate over the Clean Energy Jobs and American Power Act, introduced last week, Mr. McNeil has some atypical allies.\A delegation of more than 150 businesses supporting the bill, which is sponsored by Sens. John Kerry, D-Mass., and Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., arrived in Washington yesterday and will flood senators' offices today to urge movement on the legislation. They range from companies that would directly benefit -- such as solar panel makers -- to ones that just want consistent federal guidance on carbon emissions.\Some of them, including computer giant Apple, have left the U.S. Chamber of Commerce because of the organization's opposition to the House of Representatives climate bill, which passed in June.\""The fact that [Apple is] saying, 'We have to do this' is something that other industries and people who stand in opposition to this bill in the Senate and the House really need to start paying attention to,"" Mr. McNeil said.\Representatives from the diverse group of businesses attended a reception last night with Ken Salazar, secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior, and will hold a news conference today. They are part of a group called We Can Lead, sponsored by business coalitions Ceres and Clean Economy Network.\Seven companies with Pennsylvania ties are in the group, including McCandless-based renewable energy vendor Vox Energy Solutions, Lawrenceville-based contractor Limbach Facility Services and real estate management company Jones Lang LaSalle, which has an office in Downtown Pittsburgh.\Dan Probst, chairman of energy and sustainability services at Jones Lang LaSalle, said the company is promoting energy efficiency incentives, which would benefit its real estate clients and create job opportunities to retrofit buildings.\Mr. Probst said the fact that the coalition of businesses on board with the Kerry-Boxer proposal includes big companies like Nike and Starbucks shows a desire for clearer federal guidance on emissions. Though placing a price on carbon and creating a cap-and-trade system could be unpalatable to big industry, it beats dealing with a patchwork of shifting state and local regulations, the group contends.\""I've been on several calls with people like the head of Duke Energy who are in support of the bill,"" Mr. Probst said. ""I think they acknowledge this is something we're going to have to face sooner or later, and they'd rather have legislation that forces us to address it now.""\Still, climate change legislation has many foes in Congress and industry -- especially coal, an enormous job-creator and energy producer in Pennsylvania. The bill's opponents claim that it would force job losses and higher utility bills on a population already reeling from recession.\The bill's supporters say it will create a jobs boom in the efficiency and renewable energy fields.\Mr. Casey and Mr. Specter, who will help shape the bill as a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, have said that they want to see more aid to the coal industry before voting for the legislation -- and their votes are crucial, as Republicans have shown little willingness to climb aboard.\""[The senators'] principal concern is making sure that this bill is the best thing for Pennsylvania,"" Mr. McNeil said. ""They want to ensure that manufacturing in Pennsylvania is taken care of. ... They want it to be a bill that all of Pennsylvania can get behind."""

104,"Potentially halting a plan to reduce power plant carbon emissions, Pennsylvania house members voted Wednesday to move forward a bill that would take decision-making power away from Gov. Tom Wolf and his administration.\Several of the 130 lawmakers who supported House Bill 2025, made clear that their votes were also in support of coal, a faltering industry they believe could suffer further job cuts and economic loss with increased regulation.\Bill sponsor Rep. Jim Struzzi, (R - Indiana), referenced energy-industry stakeholders while addressing his colleagues just prior to the vote.\“They felt their voices were not being heard,” he said.\Effectively, the bill was designed to combat an executive order issued by the governor last October, when Wolf announced plans to have the state join the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative — a cap-and-trade system that targets carbon-emitting electric power plants.\It’s a plan that Wolf said would help meet statewide greenhouse gas reduction goals by setting decreasing yearly limits on the amount of carbon dioxide that can be emitted from power plants.\Power plant owners also would be forced to pay a fee for each ton of carbon emitted — money that would eventually be reallocated back to the state.\ Call for more voices \Already, 10 Northeastern and mid-Atlantic states have joined to the initiative, which combats climate change.\But Struzzi, and his supporters, have called the governor’s order an overstep, claiming Wolf and his administrators alone shouldn’t have the power to impose carbon limits and enter multi-state initiatives.\“We strongly disagree with Gov. Wolf’s continued practice of go-it-alone approaches,” reads a prior statement from House Republicans, which also was shared by Speaker Bryan Cutler (R - Peach Bottom).\Instead, the legislation stipulates that the cap-and-trade initiative and similar proposals must be decided by the multiple voices and viewpoints of the General Assembly and beholden to greater public scrutiny.\ Environmental concerns \But on Wednesday, Democratic Rep. Greg Vitali of Delaware County said he believed the bill was more about lawmakers blocking the cap-and-trade proposal and remaining friendly with leaders in the coal industry — a top greenhouse gas emitter and source of air pollution, including in Lancaster County.\It’s for those reasons that officials at the American Lung Association also support Wolf’s plan to enter the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, according to Kevin Stewart, the association’s locally based mid-Atlantic director of environmental health.\Owners of the Brunner Island power plant, just across the Susquehanna River in York County, are now working to phase out coal burning for natural gas by 2028 due to increased scrutiny about pollutants.\“There is no doubt that RGGI is not going to help the coal industry,” Vitali said, calling coal’s downfall an inevitability as fracking leads to a growing focus on natural gas.\Also, Vitali said a focus on low-emissions power generation could see economic growth and job creation in other industries, specifically nuclear.\Prior to the vote, officials at Exelon -- which owns nuclear power plants, including Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station in nearby York County -- decried Bill 2025.\“Blocking Pennsylvania from participating in RGGI would forego hundreds of millions of dollars each year in economic opportunities and reverse progress to protect our environment and air quality,” a spokesman said.\A draft initiative-entrance plan by officials at the state Department of Environmental Protection is now under review by the state Environmental Quality Board.\The bill will now move to the state Senate for consideration.\It’s unclear how that review process could be impacted by Wednesday’s 130-71 approval of Bill 2025.\The bill will now move to the state Senate for consideration.\“DEP cannot speculate on . . . possible outcomes, but Gov. Wolf has threatened to veto this legislation should it reach his desk,” DEP spokesman Neil Shader said.\------------\ Related coverage \ Today's Top Stories \Crédito: SEAN SAURO | Staff Writer"
105,"TO THE EDITORS:\As Congress debates how best to protect our natural environment while securing essential energy supplies for America's families, farms and factories, one of the strategies being discussed is a system known as cap-and-trade. Cap-and-trade is a proven approach to controlling the impact of pollutants, but applying pollution regulations to non-pollution entities makes no more sense than taxing working people's wages to buy party favors for zoo animals.\The recent decision by EPA bureaucrats to begin regulating carbon dioxide as a pollutant cries for open-minded and careful review. Carbon dioxide is essential to the Earth's food and oxygen supply system. The best available data indicates that the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has increased by 90 parts per million of 0.009 percent since 1880. Considering the massive amounts of carbon dioxide released since 1880, this level of increase indicates that the Earth's natural systems are managing very well without additional EPA regulation.\Capping carbon dioxide emissions will inflict severe harm on efforts to raise the quality of life for Earth's people; it will do nothing to improve our environment.\Joe Heller\Earl Township"

TRENTON Gov. Christie's administration did not follow the law when it stopped enforcing regulations on carbon emissions by power plants, a state appellate court panel ruled Tuesday.
\
The court, siding with environmental groups that challenged the administration's actions, ordered the state Department of Environmental Protection to begin a process required by state law to formally repeal the regulations.
\
The process, which the court ordered the state to begin within 60 days, must involve public input, environmental groups said - in contrast to the department's actions when it stopped enforcing the regulations in 2012, following Christie's decision to withdraw New Jersey from a regional cap-and-trade program.
\
Christie announced in 2011 that the state would withdraw from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), a consortium of nine Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern states seeking to limit carbon pollution by power plants.
\
After the governor's announcement, the Department of Environmental Protection posted a notice on its website that said power plants would no longer have to abide by regulations adopted in 2008 limiting carbon emissions.
\
Environmental groups then sued the department, arguing that it had not taken proper steps to repeal the regulations.
\
In its ruling Tuesday, the appellate court said the state needed to follow a process outlined by state law to formally repeal the regulations, or specify that they apply only if the state is part of a program like RGGI.
\
""You cannot govern by fiat - or website,"" said Doug O'Malley, director of Environment New Jersey, which sued the state over the regulations. ""You have to go through a public process.""
\
U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez (D., N.J.) and state Senate President Stephen Sweeney (D., Gloucester) praised the decision for letting New Jerseyans provide input on the carbon regulations, which the Democrats said they support.
\
While the state could still repeal the regulations, residents ""will get their first chance to officially weigh in on the governor's decision to pull out of"" RGGI, O'Malley said. ""We expect there to be a strong public outpouring calling for New Jersey to stay in this program.""
\
Leland Moore, a spokesman for the Attorney General's Office, said the decision ""is under review in consultation with the client [DEP]."" He declined to comment further.
\
In announcing his intention to withdraw the state from RGGI, Christie criticized the cap-and-trade program as ineffective.
\
The program, which requires that power plants buy allowances to release carbon, provides financial incentive for curbing emissions, proponents say. The money paid by the plants is then invested in clean-energy projects.
\
Christie - who has said human activity does play a role in climate change - said the program did not do enough to influence the behavior of power plants.
\
""The whole system is not working as it was intended to work,"" Christie said in 2011. ""It's a failure.""
\
Environmental groups say RGGI has succeeded in reducing pollution. A statement released Tuesday by Environment New Jersey and the Natural Resources Defense Council - which also sued the state - credited the program with contributing to a 30 percent reduction in ""regional climate-change pollution"" since 2009.

107,"WASHINGTON -- Several Republicans, Sen. John Kerry insisted, have privately assured him that they are encouraged by the climate bill he introduced Wednesday and are eager to work on it.\But after six months of talks fell apart in recent weeks with Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., Mr. Kerry, D-Mass., and Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., were left standing with no Republicans in sight to promote their new compromise measure, a last-ditch effort to pass a comprehensive climate bill this year.\The American Power Act puts a price on carbon and creates a tightly regulated cap-and-trade market in which about 7,500 manufacturers and utility companies swap the right to pollute.\The goal in pricing carbon is giving an economic incentive for companies to cut back emissions and move to renewable power. Like its Senate predecessor, the bill aims to cut carbon emissions 17 percent by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050.\But the previous bill authored by Mr. Kerry and Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., was unable to garner enough support last fall, so Mr. Kerry, Mr. Lieberman and Mr. Graham worked with industry leaders, environmental groups and colleagues to craft a bill that could get 60 votes. The House of Representatives narrowly passed a cap-and-trade bill last year with no Republican votes, and the bill has been lambasted as a job killer that will raise energy costs.\Responding to those concerns, the three senators added tax incentives for nuclear power and natural gas, and gave more time for the most energy-intensive industries -- like steel -- to transition into a cap-and-trade system.\To limit rising energy prices, the bill hands some of the money made by the government in the carbon auctions back to middle- and lower-income energy consumers.\Mr. Graham abruptly dropped out of the talks last month because, he said, the White House and Senate Democrats were considering a push for immigration reform before the climate bill in the name of political gain.\Then, another Republican carrot in the bill -- incentives for Atlantic and Pacific coast states to allow offshore drilling -- became politically toxic after the massive BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Since the spill, several coastal Democrats have voiced their opposition to allowing any offshore drilling -- though the bill does allow states to veto a drilling site within 75 miles of their shores or if they would be severely impacted by a spill.\Mr. Graham said he was looking forward to working on the bill -- though he was pessimistic at its chances.\""We should move forward in a reasoned, thoughtful manner and in a political climate which gives us the best chance at success,"" he said. ""The problems created by the historic oil spill in the Gulf, along with the uncertainty of immigration politics, have made it extremely difficult for transformational legislation in the area of energy and climate to garner bipartisan support at this time.""\Mr. Kerry and Mr. Lieberman, though, said passage is urgent and must happen this year. The business community, Mr. Kerry said, is fearful of what will happen without legislation. \""Killing a Senate bill is not a measure of success, because if Congress can't legislate this issue, the EPA will regulate it,"" Mr. Kerry said. ""And it will come without the help to America's businesses and consumers that is in this bill.""\Top environmental groups lined up in support of the bill as the best chance for climate legislation in the near future -- even if some of its components are undesirable.\Adam Garber, an organizer for Pennsylvania advocacy group PennEnvironment, said he would like a full moratorium on offshore drilling and more money going to energy efficiency and renewable technologies.\Nevertheless, he said, ""the bill makes critical steps forward.""\The draft bill could have significant impact on natural gas development in Pennsylvania's Marcellus shale through its tax incentives for trucks that use natural gas as fuel.\""We're pleased that Senators Kerry and Lieberman have included such a robust natural gas title in their bill, and are eager to work with leaders in Congress to ensure that American natural gas will continue to be safely and responsibly leveraged into jobs, economic opportunity and security,"" Kathryn Klaber, Marcellus Shale Coalition president, said in a statement.\Sen. Arlen Specter, D-Pa., voted for the Kerry-Boxer bill to clear the Environment and Public Works Committee. At the time, Mr. Specter said he would have liked to see more protection for the coal industry but wanted to move the process along. In a brief statement Wednesday, Mr. Specter said he is eager to examine the new bill and offer amendments.\Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., said his staff is still reviewing the bill and he is most concerned about how it deals with the coal industry -- including subsidies for Carbon Capture and Storage technology and help for workers who lose their jobs in the transition away from fossil fuels. \Senate aides said the Kerry-Lieberman bill mirrors the Kerry-Boxer bill on carbon capture and storage provisions, which both Mr. Casey and Mr. Specter helped negotiate along with other coal-state senators. The bill provides $2 billion per year in incentives for research and development of CCS technology.\Pennsylvania's Democrats should be easier to woo than Republicans, at least one of whom is needed to break a filibuster. The political reality is a source of frustration and a bit of humor for the bill's sponsors.\Near the end of Wednesday's news conference, Mr. Kerry asked a few of the bill's supporters to introduce themselves. When one identified himself as being from ""Republicans for Environmental Protection,"" Mr. Kerry turned back to the crowd of reporters.\""You hear that?"" he said, to laughter."
108,"Tuesday night, I tuned in to President Barack Obama's Oval Office address expecting to learn details of a master plan to stop the oil spilling into the Gulf and a clarion call to action, complete with mobilization of forces, to clean up the apocalyptic mess destroying the environment and the economy there.\What I heard was what I have always heard when Mr. Obama speaks: a lightweight, once-over-lightly, short-on-details-long-on-rhetoric campaign-style speech.\Mr. Obama still seems to think that inspiration is all that the American people are looking for.\The latest Rasmussen poll, taken after that speech, proves Mr. Obama has badly misjudged what we want to hear from our president during a time of crisis.\But Mr. Obama did something else on Tuesday night. He flinched. The leader of the free world succumbed to fear. And in the process, he magnified the fears of the American people by citing statistics about fossil fuels (how much we use and how little we have).\Then, deciding not to waste a good crisis, he turned this speech into a commercial pushing his clean-energy agenda.\Mr. Obama compared the current crisis with the national push to produce the military equipment needed to fight WW II, and I believe there is a really important lesson to be learned from the Greatest Generation - a lesson in resilience.\When did we shift from being courageous, unshakable, can-do people, with leaders who said things like, ""We have nothing to fear but fear itself,"" to being fearful, intimidated people afraid of risks and desiring iron-clad guarantees of perfect safety and freedom from difficulties?\We live in a 21st century world filled with technology and innovation, most of it powered by energy. Locally, we drive everywhere, but we also love to fly. We live and work in climate-controlled environments. Most of us use computers every day, and we run our lives with Blackberries, cell phones, laptops, and Wi-Fi. We have to install powerstrips to accommodate all the electronic tech-gadgets recharging overnight.\We have benefited greatly from technology and the availability of electricity and fuels to power labor-saving equipment. Dishwashers, washers and dryers, kitchen appliances, water heaters, tools and farm equipment have delivered us from a lot of backbreaking work, and technology in the workplace has been the great equalizer. Machines have permitted people to compete for high-paying jobs which once required the physical prowess of only very strong men.\We cannot lose the gains we have made because we are so fearful of fossil fuels and industrial accidents and carbon footprints that we allow ourselves to be reduced to Third World status by a fear-driven environmentalist agenda.\France is largely energy independent, deriving 75 percent of its electricity from nuclear power. The French viewed that move as a national security issue, so that they could not be held hostage by foreign powers.\Meanwhile, the United States suffered one serious nuclear plant incident at Three Mile Island 30 years ago, which we have allowed to make us so afraid of nuclear power generation that we haven't built a new nuclear plant since.\We have allowed recent accidents in coal mines in West Virginia to make us afraid to mine coal, and now the president and others are fanning the fears over offshore oil drilling, allowing this one admittedly horrifying disaster to cause us to abandon our own domestic oil potential.\I don't think Franklin Delano Roosevelt would have reacted the way Mr. Obama has, and I don't think he would have tolerated the American people wanting to throw the baby out with the bath water.\Where is the voice of reason, the voice of empowerment, the voice of determination that will say this to the American people:\""We will not compromise our way of life. We will have nuclear power, and we will demand of the nuclear industry unparalleled safety measures. We will exploit our abundance of coal, develop technology that is environmentally friendly and demand of the industry the protection of miners with the very latest in ventilation and safety equipment. And we will drill for oil wherever we find it, with stringent standards for prevention of environmental impact. We are Americans, the smartest, most innovative people on the face of the earth, and we will not be shaken by an accident, no matter how big the mess. We will clean it up and make sure it never happens again.""\I didn't hear that voice of reason on Tuesday night. I heard a man with an agenda.\The solar panels and wind turbines he talked about, as wonderful as those may turn out to be, are not able to supply our energy needs for the foreseeable future.\And cap and trade and a carbon tax, which he alluded to, would be the nail in the coffin of an economy already on life support.\Carol Petersen is a freelance writer, artist and photographer from Lancaster Township. Her e-mail address is cpetersencolumn@gmail.com."
109,"With his political party firmly in control of Congress, President Obama devoted his first two years to several massive regulatory schemes that would bring whole sectors of the economy under federal government control for the first time in history.\The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, passed only after several reluctant lawmakers were plied with giveaways to their states, placed fully 17 percent of the U.S. economy in the hands of the Department of Health and Human Services.\Not only does Obamacare mandate that every single American buy health insurance, an exotic notion recently ruled unconstitutional, but it also regulates out of existence basic plans that cover millions of Americans. It mandates expensive new coverages; regulates doctors, hospitals and insurers; fines and regulates employers; and establishes a board of unelected functionaries with the power to ration medical care.\Is it any wonder that barely a year after the law was passed more than a thousand companies and unions, including some of the president's biggest supporters, have applied for and received waivers?\The public backlash against Obamacare was so intense that Congress quickly abandoned another of the president's goals -- a vast expansion of environmental regulations. The proposal, called cap and trade, would have imposed a complicated system of penalties and credits aimed at driving up the cost of energy. Why do that, in heaven's name?\Despite carbon emissions dropping sharply in the past two decades because of technology -- carbon is a natural element found everywhere in the environment -- the academic left from which President Obama comes is fervently devoted to the proposition that our entire energy system must be replaced by new, green technologies, even if they don't exist. Cap and trade is explicitly designed to force Americans to use less energy.\But with the economy on the ropes and energy prices soaring, the president's allies in Congress were willing to go no further. No matter. The president would merely regulate what he was unable to legislate. So last year, the Environmental Protection Agency declared that carbon emissions were a dangerous substance that could be regulated by the federal government.\It's the first time in history that a federal agency has assumed so much power over the economy without congressional approval. Since then, rules have been tumbling out of EPA as fast as it can write them, and they make virtually every function of life, from running a small business to turning on a light switch, more expensive for every American. Indeed, EPA is considering 330 new regulations, and every one of them would have an impact of $100 million or more on the economy.\But there's more. Other Obama administration agencies are also busy writing new rules affecting nearly every commercial activity -- our food choices, financial lives, farmers and even basic renovations to our homes. Nothing is beyond the reach of the federal government.\Small businesses pay the heaviest price to comply with these rules. According to the Small Business Administration, mom-and-pop businesses pay 60 percent more to meet federal standards than larger corporations. In fact, the cost exceeds $10,500 per year, per employee. It's no surprise, then, that small businesses are extremely reluctant to hire new workers -- even if they can -- because of the cloud of uncertainty that billows out of Washington these days.\The National Federation of Independent Business, the country's largest advocate for small businesses, has embarked on a nationwide campaign to educate Americans on the effects of regulations. It is joined by dozens of other groups representing important industries also concerned about the country's direction.\It is our goal to bring to Americans stories we hear every day from members that never seem to make the news. They involve small business owners who are being destroyed or prevented from operating successfully by the landslide of new rules from Washington. It's important to consider that every new rule comes with a cost.\Those costs destroy jobs, raise prices and encourage lawsuits. What's worse, regulations very often fail completely to improve public health, the environment, workplace safety or anything else. Our representatives in Washington should be reminded that Pennsylvania's economic future depends on a healthy, efficient private sector, and that before approving new burdens, they should ensure that the rules are necessary and founded in science.\Kevin Shivers is Pennsylvania director for the National Federation of Independent Business.\Credit: Kevin Shivers Special to The Morning Call - Freelance\Credit: Kevin Shivers Special to The Morning Call - Freelance"
110,"Joe Sestak is halfway to learning whether his defeat of Arlen Specter will end with a seat in the U.S. Senate.\But so far Pat Toomey has controlled the conversation in their nationally watched statewide contest.\It's been 13 weeks since Democrat Sestak's primary election takedown of Specter, a Pennsylvania political institution. And it's 11 weeks until Sestak learns whether general election voters select him or Republican Toomey to fill the seat Specter held for three decades.\More than midway through the political calendar, Sestak seems endlessly on the defensive. It's partly of his own doing, but largely because Toomey, with a sharper message and flush finances, has been the aggressor.\So far, Pennsylvania's U.S. Senate battle has been fought on Toomey's terms.\To be sure, the campaign's biggest battles are to come. Face-to-face debates and a looming television ad war could shape the race. A sizable number of undecided voters won't tune in until the final weeks in October.\Still, the political momentum favors Toomey, who almost beat Specter himself in 2004, spent six years in the U.S. Congress, and most recently presided over the Club for Growth, a D.C.-based group that promotes fiscally conservative candidates nationwide.\Unlike Sestak, Toomey had no bloody spring primary, allowing him to stockpile resources and build alliances. Specter, the state's longest-serving senator, was backed by President Obama and Gov. Ed Rendell over Sestak. Toomey enjoyed the support of the Republican establishment from the start.\Beyond his early advantages, Toomey has done more with the available weapons. The political environment does not bode well for politicians linked to Obama's policy agenda, and a stream of commercials have painted Sestak as a supporter of massive government, staggering deficits and ruinous health care reforms.\Today Wall Street is nearly as vilified as Washington, and Toomey had a career as a derivatives trader in Manhattan. Sestak repeatedly has attempted to cast Toomey as a Wall Street insider who only cares about corporate interests. During debate on sweeping financial reform legislation, Sestak blamed Toomey for the recession and called him out of touch.\Last week, the national campaign arm for Senate Democrats did the heavy lifting, shopping to reporters videos of Toomey on the House floor in 1999, 2000 and 2003 praising the types of derivatives blamed for the economic meltdown.\""This has certainly been, so far, Toomey's summer in terms of his ability to frame the election he wants, tell the narrative he wants to tell,"" said G. Terry Madonna, political science professor at Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster.\Two days after the May 18 primary, Toomey went on the air with a commercial that highlighted Sestak's support for health reform, bailouts and civilian trials for foreign terrorists. A few days later, after Sestak had appeared on NBC's Meet the Press, Toomey's campaign sent out a press release saying the interview showcased Sestak's ""sham independence.""\The next week the melodrama of Sestak's White House job offer garnered national attention and Toomey joined the chorus of public figures calling on Sestak to divulge who offered him what job to bow out of the Senate race against Specter. Toomey said in a statement he intervened only to force Sestak to address the issue so it would not continue to distract voters in the issues-based campaign.\And so it went throughout the summer.\Toomey has aired six television commercials about Sestak, painting him as an extreme liberal to the left of most members of his political party. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce aired two commercials linking Sestak to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and calling him ""anti-business.""\Sestak decried Toomey's ads as negative, even though they were issue attacks, not character assaults. He allowed himself to become the villain rather than the victim in the White House job saga by leaving it to the administration to divulge that Bill Clinton had made the job pitch to him. And he came off as nitpicky when he demanded the Chamber's first ad be taken down, arguing he voted with Nancy Pelosi 97 percent of the time, not 100 percent, as the ad stated.\Daily for more than a week, Toomey's campaign refused to let up on Sestak for not fully living up to a personal pledge not to take campaign money from corporations that requested special federal funding known as earmarks. Sestak's office fielded calls on the issue for about two weeks.\Toomey also pushed for Sestak to return campaign contributions from embattled New York Democrat Charlie Rangel. Sestak eventually did after Rangel was charged with 13 counts of ethics violations.\Toomey's campaign chided Sestak for being a hypocrite.\""I believe at this point in the race the Toomey campaign has outfoxed the Sestak campaign at virtually every point,"" said Charlie Gerow, Republican consultant in Harrisburg.\Toomey, who is extremely conservative on fiscal issues, is appealing to moderates and even Democrats more than Sestak is with independents and Republicans, according to recent public opinion polls.\Even Democrat consultant Larry Ceisler of Philadelphia admitted that Toomey has done the better job so far, making Sestak look like an extremist.\""Toomey has certainly been textbook,"" Ceisler said. ""His outreach to not only moderate Republicans, but also Democrats, has been exemplary. He's positioning himself as nonthreatening.""\Sestak calls the Toomey barrage dirty politics.\""I've been surprised and disappointed that Congressman Toomey hasn't forgotten what he learned in Washington over 10 years, and that is if you can mislead and confuse the public you can hide your own record of bad policymaking,"" Sestak said in a recent phone interview. ""[Toomey thinks] ""the best approach is to be negative and misleading ... Pennsylvania voters are not going to buy that.""\Toomey countered it's not negative to point out Sestak's votes.\""If he considers that negative,"" Toomey said, ""that's because most Pennsylvanians disagree with his votes on bailouts and cap and trade.""\Toomey's early control is reminiscent of Sestak's run against Specter in the spring. Political pundits all but counted Sestak out because his campaign seemed disjointed and disorganized compared with Specter's machine.\Some say Sestak won the primary only because Specter was so disliked by the Democratic electorate. Those people warn that Sestak may not be so lucky in a contest with Toomey.\""[Sestak] only defined himself as someone other than Arlen Specter,"" Gerow said. ""That won't be enough to win the general election.""\Others say it's too soon to discount Sestak's tactics.\""I watched Joe Sestak win two races where people thought it was impossible and I'm never going to second-guess how he conducts a campaign,"" Ceisler said. ""In his own different way, they know what they're doing.""\Credit: Colby Itkowitz OF THE MORNING CALL\Credit: Colby Itkowitz OF THE MORNING CALL"
111,"Today, a coalition of Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern states will launch the first sale of carbon credits to date, an attempt to curb pollution generated from coal-, oil- and natural gas-powered plants.\How significantly it will reduce carbon emissions, how much alternative energy will come as a result of it, how much new technology could be produced to reduce energy and produce cleaner options - all goals of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative - are a few questions remaining to be answered.\What will happen in Pennsylvania is clear - nothing.\Pennsylvania, the No. 4 coal producer in the nation, opted not to participate in the agreement, which stretches from Maryland to Maine.\RGGI caps the total amount of carbon that power plants in the 10-state region can pump out of their smokestacks at the current level, which is 188 million tons. The goal is to reduce that to 169 million tons by the year 2018 - a 10 percent drop.\If a power company emits more than it's allowed, it needs to either buy extra allowances or -- ideally -- reduce pollution.\Proponents of the plan say Pennsylvania's decision not to participate cuts a gaping hole in the regional effort.\""The low-cost energy [produced by coal] is the worst for the environment and worst for global warming,"" said Bill Wolfe, who works with the New Jersey chapter of Public Employees for Public Environmental Responsibility.\Wolfe has been an outspoken critic of RGGI -- he says it doesn't charge enough for allowances and emission targets are set too high, a view shared by other environmental groups.\""The general guy in the street thinks we're taking a step in reducing emissions when it's just slowing the rate of growth,"" said Wolfe.\But he and experts said doing nothing is worse.\""With the leadership vacuum in Washington, it has fallen to the states to take the lead on combating climate change,"" said Richard Revesz, dean of the New York University School of Law and an expert on environmental law.\Pennsylvania officials say consumers would pay more because power companies would pass on the cost of the allowances.\""We have a couple of disagreements there. It's really focused on the energy sector and doesn't include transportation and other sectors needed to really address the issue"" of reducing emissions, explained Charlie Young, a spokesperson with the state Department of Environmental Protection.\And Pennsylvania had other priorities: namely, to develop technology to sequester, or capture underground, what the coal-powered plants emit. Such technology remains years off.\""It's certainly an interesting development what RGGI's doing and one we will continue to monitor,"" said Young. But, he continued, ""We do need to protect the viability of Pennsylvania's economy.""\PPL Corp. plans to participate in today's auction to buy allowances for its natural gas plants in Connecticut and New York. Those costs - likely minimal - will be factored into the 2009 electricity rates, said spokesman George Lewis.\""It would be a lot easier and more efficient for all the companies to have a single national program,"" said Lewis. ""Then we'd all be going by the same rules.""\Maryland was the last state to join, and it did so only after a state-ordered economic analysis by University of Maryland professor Matthias Ruth showed RGGI could bring in $140 million annually from the auction.\""We had the same trepidations"" as Pennsylvania, said Tad Aburn, air director for the Maryland Department of the Environment.

Having stalled for as long as possible, a routine White House strategy when it comes to environmental matters, Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne has put the polar bear, its environment melting away because of global warming, on the Endangered Species List. Also typically, the secretary went out of his way to make clear that his department was not advocating any measures that would reduce what humans do to spur on the global warming that caused the endangerment of the polar bear. With the Bush administration tied in knots to the end on environmental matters, we look forward to the promise of a new administration.
\
The Interior Department's decision, delayed by months and finally forced by the successful lawsuits of environmental groups, was the only one that could be made, however grudgingly. Kempthorne acknowledged that the melting of the sea ice in the Arctic is depriving the polar bear of the footing it needs to hunt for seals and other prey. With Arctic ice coverage now at record low levels, the polar bear is the first animal ever placed on the endangered species list because of global warming.
\
After years of denying the reality of global warming and refusing to join the rest of the civilized world in pursuing the international agreements needed to protect the environment, the Bush administration has lately taken to paying lip service to the problem. It has no concrete plans for action in its final months in office, however. Kempthorne asserted that his ruling on the polar bear should not be used as a way of advancing plans to reduce greenhouse emissions, but environmental groups believe otherwise, and it may ultimately be up to the courts to determine the full implications of Interior's ruling.
\
With a new president in the Oval Office in January, however, perhaps it will not be necessary for the courts to painstakingly poke and prod the federal government into overdue action on the environment. Likely Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama has solid environmental credentials, and if the Democratic Party can maintain control of both houses of Congress, he will have a sympathetic legislative body to work with. In a speech last week, presumptive Republican nominee John McCain criticized the Bush administration for failing to act on global warming, promising he would not ""permit eight long years to pass without serious action on serious challenges.""
\
Encouraging words; unfortunately, the senator's voting record on environmental issues is not particularly good. We agree with McCain that nuclear power should be among the alternative energy sources the nation explores in ending its addiction to fossil fuels, but with the caveat that a federal storage site be designated and made ready first. The senator's cap-and-trade plan in which businesses that emit carbon pollutants into the atmosphere could earn credits by exploring innovative ways of reducing them has potential, though his goals for reductions are insufficiently ambitious.
\
We can hope that, whether Democrat or Republican, the next president will hit the ground running on the issue of global warming. One fact that cannot be disputed that is that eight years have been tragically wasted in Washington.

The U.S. Senate is next to weigh in on a climate change bill that could affect York County's renewable energy firms, offering new standards for the use of green energy.
\
The House of Representatives last week narrowly passed a bill that creates new standards requiring utilities to use an increasing amount of renewable energy. The legislation would place the first national limits on emissions of greenhouse gases from major sources -- such as power plants, factories and oil refineries -- to reduce the gases linked to global climate change.
\
It would require the U.S. to reduce carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions by 17 percent from 2005 levels by 2020 and by 83 percent by mid-century, and also start moving the U.S. away from fossil fuels and toward cleaner power sources, such as geothermal, wind, solar, nuclear and hydropower.
\
Hydro and solar:Voith Hydro in West Manchester Township, which makes hydropower equipment for dams, is among the York County renewable energy firms expected to be affected by the legislation.
\
Voith CEO Mark Garner -- who attended the first Green Jobs Leadership Summit hosted by congressional leadership in Washington, D.C., earlier this month -- said he thinks the renewable energy aspects of the legislation are productive, increasing the amount of renewable energy companies must use.
\
It's not as aggressive as other measures that have been proposed, but it still creates a timeline for using more renewable energy, he said.
\
Garner said part of his job is making people realize hydropower is one of the renewable energies the U.S. can utilize, and he was pleased the bill includes hydropower. He said companies need incentives and options to move toward renewable energies, which would decrease dependency on foreign oil and help the environment.
\
Garner said he's not certain of the incentives present in H.R. 2454, but the industry could double the amount of hydropower produced in the U.S. without building a new dam; utilities could invest in modernization and increasing efficiency at existing dams, he said.
\
Voith has grown from 380 to 550 employees in York over the past two years, and the legislation could help the company continue to grow and hire more employees for family-sustaining green jobs, he said.
\
At Loganville-based solar component manufacturer Komax Systems, president and CEO Brian Micciche said the legislation can't help but benefit the solar industry.
\
""Any growth in the industry will definitely result in additional business for us,"" he said. ""Timing is the big question. How long until (the changes) find their way down?""
\
Source of opposition:The bill passed 219-212. Renewable energy aside, the carbon-capping side of the bill, which requires companies to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide they produce, is alienating some lawmakers.
\
Rep. Todd Platts, R-York County, voted against the bill, saying the ""cap and trade"" legislation isn't fiscally responsible.
\
He said the legislation will harm the already struggling economy by ""increasing costs on consumers and driving American manufacturing jobs to countries with less stringent environmental safeguards.""
\
The Congressional Budget Office estimated the cost of the bill to the private sector at $846 billion over the next 10 years -- before the strictest provisions of the bill even begin, Platts said.
\
But in his weekly radio and Internet address, President Barack Obama -- who visited Voith last year while campaigning -- said the bill will help the economy, not hurt it.
\
""Don't believe the misinformation out there that suggests there is somehow a contradiction between investing in clean energy and economic growth,"" he said. ""It's just not true.""
\
He called on senators to pass the bill, and urged them and ""every American"" not to be afraid of the future.

"
114," It is time to acknowledge that if we are sincere in wanting to reduce carbon dioxide emissions produced in generating electricity, the honest and transparent way to do it is by expanding the use of non-emitting sources.\ Now, nine states in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic regions have an opportunity to do this, in the context of a regional effort to control the main greenhouse gases linked to global climate change. The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), as it is known, is quietly emerging as a major influence in efforts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plants that burn fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas.\ The strategy is to make use of a cap-and-trade system to control carbon emissions, and in so doing serve as a model for similar efforts in other parts of the country. This system, which utilizes a market-based approach to pollution control, has been successfully used at the national level to achieve significant reductions in power-plant emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, which form acid rain and smog. Taken as a whole, the system would provide a strong incentive for expanded use of emission-free energy sources such as nuclear power.\ States that are participating in the RGGI program are New York, New Jersey, Delaware, and those in New England. Pennsylvania and Maryland are participating in RGGI meetings as observers, but it's time for us to become full participants.\ Under the program, states will establish their own statewide caps on carbon emissions. This would allow utilities in states that have adopted such a ceiling to trade emissions with one another. Companies that more than meet the carbon cap would be able to sell emission credits to those that can't. In other words, companies would have incentives to use low-carbon energy sources.\ The aim is to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2010, and eventually achieve a 75-to-85-percent reduction below current levels.\ The key to such a program is to give utilities credit for limiting the release of carbon dioxide into the environment. The nation's 103 operating nuclear power plants prevent about 680 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year from being emitted to the atmosphere and between 1995 and 2003, U.S. nuclear plants avoided the emission of about 6.7 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide.\ Nuclear plants play a particularly vital role in meeting clean- air targets in the nine Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states, with 16 power plants generating 30 percent of the region's electricity. If Pennsylvania and Maryland are added, there would be another 11 nuclear plants involved, with utilities that own the plants in a position to buy and sell emission credits.\ It is reasonable to believe that we can meet the ambitious goals of reducing greenhouse gases with the use of more emission-free sources like nuclear power, and emissions credits are key to making that possible.\ Forrest J. Remick, Ph.D., is professor of nuclear engineering emeritus and associate vice president for research emeritus at Penn State University. He also was a commissioner on the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\ ***"
115,"
President-elect Barack Obama said yesterday that his administration would ""value science"" and ""make decisions based on facts"" as he nominated an environmental team that includes New Jersey's Lisa Jackson as head of the Environmental Protection Agency.
\
Jackson, who for nearly three years led New Jersey's environmental protection efforts, is poised to take over an agency where, critics say, politics has repeatedly trumped science.
\
Obama signaled a change, saying Jackson ""shares my commitment to restoring the EPA's robust role in protecting our air, our water, and abundant natural resources.""
\
He said energy independence is crucial for the nation's security and praised Jackson's work in New Jersey to curb greenhouse-gas emissions, an effort that moved forward yesterday when the state Department of Environmental Protection released an overdue report detailing its ambitious plans.
\
Jackson, a Princeton-educated engineer who has spent more than 20 years in environmental regulatory positions, said she hopes to show longtime EPA staff that their work is valued.
\
""EPA's mission has never changed. Its mode of doing business has changed over the years and probably needs to change again,"" Jackson said in a telephone interview from Chicago.
\
""As an environmentalist, [there's] no better job to have at this time right now, provided the agency is allowed to do what it's supposed to do.""
\
Jackson, 46, who must be confirmed by the Senate, worked at the EPA's Washington and New York offices. She joined New Jersey's DEP in 2002 and became Gov. Corzine's chief of staff at the start of this month.
\
Obama also nominated Steven Chu as energy secretary, Nancy Sutley to chair the White House Council on Environmental Quality, and Carol Browner to be a newly created White House energy czar.
\
Jackson cochaired Obama's environment and energy transition team.
\
Senate Democrats praised the Obama picks.
\
Sen. Barbara Boxer (D., Calif.), chair of the Environment Committee, said the team ""signals that positive changes are coming as we work for energy independence and for solutions to global warming.""
\
Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D., N.J.) called Jackson an ""excellent"" choice.
\
""She understands we need real leadership to rebound from the neglect of the last eight years,"" he said.
\
The ranking Republican on the environment committee, Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma, stressed the importance of balancing the environment and the economy, and said he looked forward to working with Jackson.
\
Outgoing EPA Administrator Stephen L. Johnson, who often bore the brunt of criticism heaped on EPA, called Jackson ""uniquely qualified to recognize the challenges facing the agency and lead from Day One.""
\
In New Jersey, Jackson won praise as a consensus-builder from environmentalists and business groups in a state where industry has often complained of feeling under siege.
\
She worked with a decreasing budget and was part of ambitious plans to cut greenhouse-gas emissions and shape the state's long-term energy plans.
\
Some critics say Jackson was slow to act. They cite a roughly four-month delay in issuing the details behind New Jersey's highly-touted global warming initiative and an EPA report that chided the state for moving slowly on cleaning up some of its most polluted sites.
\
Jackson's successor at DEP, acting Commissioner Mark Mauriello, yesterday released a draft report outlining how the state could meet its goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020.
\
It would entail an emissions reduction of about 25 percent below the levels anticipated under a business-as-usual scenario.
\
In a statement, Corzine said, ""This draft report outlines a New Jersey where employees commute without the frustration of traffic and the air pollution it causes, where energy is clean, and where waste is a thing of the past.""
\
The report concludes that three actions in progress - the energy master plan, a low-emission vehicle plan, and a multi-state cap-and-trade program for the electric generating sector called the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative - could put New Jersey on track for meeting its 2020 limits.
\
Matt Elliott, the global warming and clean-energy advocate with Environment New Jersey, called the report ""the nation's strongest and most comprehensive plan"" to slash emissions.
\
""It's the first plan we've seen that looks all the way out to 2050 and figures out how to reduce emissions 80 percent,"" he said.
\
""It essentially means that by 2050 we'll be totally free from fossil fuels, even to the extent that we'll be powering our cars and trucks with electricity generated by the wind and the sun. It's a pretty big deal to see Gov. Corzine and the DEP say, 'Yes, indeed, we can do this.' ""
\
But the plan is, he cautioned, ""just a plan.""
\
Corzine yesterday announced that his chief counsel, Ed McBride, would replace Jackson as chief of staff.

116,"
As she talks about the nation's energy policy, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi walks across her Capitol Hill office to retrieve a statue of a miner sculpted in coal.
\
""My father was a member of Congress when I was born, and when I became a member of Congress almost 50 years later, he gave this to me,"" she says. ""He had this in his office.""
\
She explains Jennings Randolph, the late senator from West Virginia, gave it to her father. Both men had a deep understanding of the importance of coal to their constituents and to the nation.
\
When Pelosi came into office, the statue helped her connect with Johnstown Democratic Rep. Jack Murtha, too.
\
""He wanted to know the story behind the miner, and ever since then, we became fast friends, you know, we just became friends because of this guy,"" Pelosi says, proudly tracing her fingers along the face of the miner.
\
Pelosi's family always has played a big role in shaping her identity and how she runs the House. Now those connections -- not only as a daughter, but as a mother and grandmother -- are helping her set legislative priorities such as reforming health care and energy.
\
As House speaker, she is arguably the most powerful woman on the planet and the only woman ever to be second in line for the presidency. She learned the basics of running the show as a stay-at-home mom who had five children in six years.
\
""Never underestimate what happens in a home,"" Pelosi tells two Tribune-Review reporters and two editors. ""All the discipline, diplomacy, sense of organization ... I learned it all there.""
\
Political supporters and opponents agree.
\
Pelosi's maternal skills have helped her to instill discipline and to demand loyalty within her party, says Kent Gates, a GOP strategist who works with another congresswoman, Republican Rep. Shelley Moore-Capito of West Virginia.
\
Pelosi ""resolves intra-party disputes behind closed doors and presents a unified House majority that should enable her to pass her agenda,"" Gates says.
\
Democratic strategist Mark Siegel met Pelosi in 1972 when he was executive director of the Democratic National Committee and she was a delegate to the party's national convention. Much of her success, survival and ascension in politics began with her strong political family, he says.
\
""That taught her organizational skills, building up political credit or chits, locking in loyalty and always planning years and years ahead,"" Siegel says.
\
'Get a life'
\
Until her youngest daughter, Alexandra, was in high school, Pelosi, 69, of San Francisco, stayed home but volunteered in local and statewide politics. The family matriarch decided to run for office only after Alexandra told her to ""get a life"" outside the noisy Pelosi home.
\
And so she did: Pelosi ran and won a special election to fill the seat of Democratic Rep. Sala Burton, wife of Rep. Phillip Burton, both of whom died of cancer in office.
\
Pelosi's office is awash in warmth and family with gold-colored walls and miniature vases filled with yellow tulips and roses. Framed photographs of her grandchildren sit next to one of her at 16 posing with then-Sen. John F. Kennedy.
\
Another photograph shows Pelosi and her father, Thomas J. D'Alesandro Jr., on the day she was sworn into Congress in 1987. D'Alesandro, a former Maryland congressman and Baltimore's first Italian-American mayor, inspired Pelosi to meld politics with her family life. He died that year.
\
Pelosi did not become a party leader, however, without a few fights along the way. She knows when and how to fight, and when not to fight, Siegel says.
\
""When she fights, she wins ... and those that stand in her way not only lose, but she never forgets,"" Siegel says. ""Cross her once, she crosses you off the list.""
\
Siegel and Pelosi were on opposing sides during that 1972 nominating convention.
\
""I am pretty sure I threw her off of the convention floor because of a technicality in her delegation's support of George McGovern,"" Siegel says. ""Thank God she forgot ... at least until she reads this.""
\
Health care
\
Pelosi says she expects to accomplish much this year.
\
""The American people did not send us a message of change to split the difference,"" she says. ""They want us to make a difference.""
\
Pelosi dismissed the notion that the newly signed federal budget was strictly partisan, even though it passed the House with no support from Republicans.
\
""Budget votes are generally always down party lines,"" she says.
\
Some critics contend Congress is doing too much, spending too much money and taking the nation toward socialism.
\
She says they're wrong, but she does not dismiss their concerns.
\
""That is what they believe,"" she says. ""They just do not believe in government.""
\
Her central issue is health care, and she says she wants to get comprehensive legislation approved this year.
\
""Health care is a looming economic issue for families,"" she says. ""At the end of the day, we can't say, 'I'm sorry. We couldn't get universal access or quality affordable health care.' ""
\
Pelosi says she knows that means compromise on some points.
\
""Nobody gets everything they want,"" she says. ""You know that going in. The biggest issue will be, will there be a public option health care?""
\
Senate Republicans -- including Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Charles Grassley of Iowa -- have said they will oppose any health care reform that includes a public option. Their concern is that private health insurers will not be able to compete with a government health insurance program.
\
When pressed for a bottom line on health care, Pelosi pushes back.
\
""I am not a bottom liner because we are trying to be open and listen to everybody's point of view, and put every reasonable suggestion on the table and treat it all with respect,"" she says.
\
""But I will say this: Unless we have a public option, I just don't think we are doing the best we can. ... The president said if you have a better idea to do this, tell me what it is. So that's it. But right now the differentiation is the public. There will be plenty of other fights.""
\
Pelosi sees room for compromise on coal issues, particularly on President Obama's cap-and-trade proposal to limit carbon emissions.
\
""Coal pollutes the environment,"" she says. ""There's just no question about it ... but we're going together with this technology, and we're going to try to find a way to make this happen.""
\
All in perspective
\
When an aide walks in to hand Pelosi a note from first-term Rep. Kathy Dalhkemper, D- Erie, she quickly explains:
\
""Kathy Dahlkemper is going to bring her mother over to meet me. I'm so excited,"" she says.
\
When Dahlkemper walks in with mom, the speaker invites them onto her balcony, along with the Trib reporters and editors, for photographs.
\
In the distance the Mall is sprinkled with tour buses, with groups of people young and old pouring out and fanning off in different directions, all in an effort to see the nation's capital.
\
On the balcony, Dahlkemper and her mom are chatting with Pelosi, casually sharing pleasantries.
\
""This really does put it all in perspective,"" Pelosi says to no one in particular, watching the tourists and traffic bustle along the Mall.
"
117,"
As he sought re-election two years ago, Democratic U.S. Rep. Paul E. Kanjorski acted as if he had two opponents.
\
One was the Republican on the ballot, Hazleton Mayor Lou Barletta. The other was President George W. Bush, who had turned as unpopular among voters as any president ever.
\
Many television commercials aired by the Nanticoke Democrat and a national Democratic committee strapped Barletta to Bush.
\
""They're like two peas in a pod, Lou Barletta and George Bush,"" speakers in a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee attack commercial said.
\
This year, the unpopular leader of the free world is President Barack Obama, a Democrat, and Kanjorski is trying a new tactic. Earlier and far more pointedly than in their 2002 and 2008 contests, Kanjorski is attacking Barletta's tenure as mayor.
\
The strategy parallels that of incumbent Republican congressmen in 2006 and 2008. They distanced themselves from Bush, touted their own performance and attacked their opponents' deficiencies.
\
""In 2006 and 2008, Democrats tried to nationalize the elections,"" said Stuart Rothenberg, editor and publisher of the Rothenberg Political Report, referring to the effort to make elections about Bush.
\
It worked as Democrats rode discontent with Bush to control of Congress in 2006 and strengthened their hand in 2008.
\
""This year, the teams just switched uniforms,"" Rothenberg said. ""The national environment stinks for Democrats. ... This is a cycle when George Bush is increasingly irrelevant, Barack Obama is increasingly important. ... If you're Paul Kanjorski, you're going to want to make this about yourself and your Republican opponent, Lou Barletta, and you're going to try to rip him apart to show voters why he is an unacceptable alternative.""
\
After taking shots from Barletta for more than a month after the May primary election, Kanjorski fired back on a July 1 WILK Radio program more sharply than his campaign had until then. He laid into Barletta's competence with more bite than he ever showed in their two previous campaigns.
\
In 2002, the mayor's management of Hazleton came up almost exclusively when Barletta boasted about it. In 2008, Kanjorski aired a television commercial criticizing Barletta for ""pocketing campaign cash from developers dumping contaminated Philadelphia sludge"" at the proposed site of an amphitheater the mayor has long touted. But that had little to do with the day-to-day running of the city.
\
With unemployment worse than during the pro-Democratic cycle of 2008, Kanjorski is trying to turn that against Barletta by focusing on Hazleton's troubles.
\
His first television commercial of the campaign, which began airing Friday, harps on Barletta's ""ten long years of failure.""
\
""Hiked Hazleton's property taxes 70 percent,"" the narrator says. ""Income taxes went up 20 percent. Under Barletta, the city had the highest jobless rate in Pennsylvania. Times are tough for all, but the city is the worst run in the state.""
\
Barletta raised property and income taxes by those amounts this year.
\
Shawn Kelly, Barletta's campaign spokesman, said the Kanjorski focus reflects Democrats' national strategy to deflect blame from a failed Democratic agenda.
\
""Democrats cannot run on their records, whether it's his votes for bailouts, health care, cap-and-trade energy legislation,"" Kelly said. ""He doesn't want to shine any light on his record, especially the last two years. ... That shows you how desperate he is. Kanjorski has nothing to offer the voters of this district, no reason to re-elect him.""
\
Kelly defended Barletta's management.
\
""Virtually, every municipality in Pennsylvania, particularly Northeastern Pennsylvania, every mayor, every city council, every borough council have had to make tough decisions,"" Kelly said, referring to the tax hikes. ""They attack Mayor Barletta's management because of Kanjorski's support for the failed Democratic policies.""
\
Ed Mitchell, Kanjorski's campaign spokesman, denied Kanjorski wants only to localize the election.
\
""We're going to talk about Social Security. We're going to talk about Bush and jobs and employment on the national level as well as the local scene,"" he said. ""It's not going to be just a Barletta narrative.""
\
He argued the campaign's focus is largely because Barletta's 10 years of mismanagement ""came home to roost"" since 2008.
\
""He shuffled things around for 10 years to not have to raise taxes and not to raise fees,"" Mitchell said. ""If he had been more responsible and cut waste and cut costs, he wouldn't have had to do it. Now he had no alternative.""

As he sought re-election two years ago, Democratic U.S. Rep. Paul E. Kanjorski acted as if he had two opponents.
\
One was the Republican on the ballot, Hazleton Mayor Lou Barletta. The other was President George W. Bush, who had turned as unpopular among voters as any president ever.
\
Many television commercials aired by the Nanticoke Democrat and a national Democratic committee strapped Barletta to Bush.
\
""They're like two peas in a pod, Lou Barletta and George Bush,"" speakers in a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee attack commercial said.
\
This year, the unpopular leader of the free world is President Barack Obama, a Democrat, and Kanjorski is trying a new tactic. Earlier and far more pointedly than in their 2002 and 2008 contests, Kanjorski is attacking Barletta's tenure as mayor.
\
The strategy parallels that of incumbent Republican congressmen in 2006 and 2008. They distanced themselves from Bush, touted their own performance and attacked their opponents' deficiencies.
\
""In 2006 and 2008, Democrats tried to nationalize the elections,"" said Stuart Rothenberg, editor and publisher of the Rothenberg Political Report, referring to the effort to make elections about Bush.
\
It worked as Democrats rode discontent with Bush to control of Congress in 2006 and strengthened their hand in 2008.
\
""This year, the teams just switched uniforms,"" Rothenberg said. ""The national environment stinks for Democrats. ... This is a cycle when George Bush is increasingly irrelevant, Barack Obama is increasingly important. ... If you're Paul Kanjorski, you're going to want to make this about yourself and your Republican opponent, Lou Barletta, and you're going to try to rip him apart to show voters why he is an unacceptable alternative.""
\
After taking shots from Barletta for more than a month after the May primary election, Kanjorski fired back on a July 1 WILK Radio program more sharply than his campaign had until then. He laid into Barletta's competence with more bite than he ever showed in their two previous campaigns.
\
In 2002, the mayor's management of Hazleton came up almost exclusively when Barletta boasted about it. In 2008, Kanjorski aired a television commercial criticizing Barletta for ""pocketing campaign cash from developers dumping contaminated Philadelphia sludge"" at the proposed site of an amphitheater the mayor has long touted. But that had little to do with the day to day running of the city.
\
With unemployment worse than during the pro-Democratic cycle of 2008, Kanjorski is trying to turn that against Barletta by focusing on Hazleton's troubles.
\
His first television commercial of the campaign, which began airing Friday, harps on Barletta's ""ten long years of failure.""
\
""Hiked Hazleton's property taxes 70 percent,"" the narrator says. ""Income taxes went up 20 percent. Under Barletta, the city had the highest jobless rate in Pennsylvania. Times are tough for all, but the city is the worst run in the state.""
\
Barletta raised property and income taxes by those amounts this year.
\
Shawn Kelly, Barletta's campaign spokesman, said the Kanjorski focus reflects Democrats' national strategy to deflect blame from a failed Democratic agenda.
\
""Democrats cannot run on their records, whether it's his votes for bailouts, health care, cap-and-trade energy legislation,"" Kelly said. ""He doesn't want to shine any light on his record, especially the last two years. ... That shows you how desperate he is. Kanjorski has nothing to offer the voters of this district, no reason to re-elect him.""
\
Kelly defended Barletta's management.
\
""Virtually, every municipality in Pennsylvania, particularly Northeastern Pennsylvania, every mayor, every city council, every borough council have had to make tough decisions,"" Kelly said, referring to the tax hikes. ""They attack Mayor Barletta's management because of Kanjorski's support for the failed Democratic policies.""
\
Ed Mitchell, Kanjorski's campaign spokesman, denied Mr. Kanjorski wants only to localize the election.
\
""We're going to talk about Social Security. We're going to talk about Bush and jobs and employment on the national level as well as the local scene,"" he said. ""It's not going to be just a Barletta narrative.""
\
He argued the campaign's focus is largely because Barletta's 10 years of mismanagement ""came home to roost"" since 2008.
\
""He shuffled things around for 10 years to not have to raise taxes and not to raise fees,"" Mitchell said. ""If he had been more responsible and cut waste and cut costs, he wouldn't have had to do it. Now he had no alternative.""

WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Bush's call on Friday for a new fund to reduce global warming fell flat with Europeans and environmentalists who say U.N.-mandated cuts in greenhouse gases are what's needed.
\
To show he meant business, Bush designated his treasury secretary to talk to other nations about getting worldwide contributions to the fund. The money would pay for clean-energy projects in poor countries.
\
""This here was a great step for the Americans and a small step for mankind,"" Germany's environment minister, Sigmar Gabriel, said after Bush's speech at the State Department before representatives of the nations that are the world's biggest emitters of greenhouse gases. ""In substance, we are still far apart.""
\
In his speech, Bush acknowledged that climate change is real and that human activity is a factor.
\
""By setting this goal, we acknowledge there is a problem, and by setting this goal, we commit ourselves to doing something about it,"" he said. ""We share a common responsibility: to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while keeping our economies growing.""
\
The president's speech capped two days of talks at a White House-sponsored climate conference that brought together the U.S. and developing nations such as China, India and Brazil that are not required to make cuts under the Kyoto Protocol, the U.N. treaty for reducing greenhouse gases that expires in 2012.
\
Most of the talk behind closed doors focused on Japan's proposal that nations agree to cut global emissions by half of their current levels by 2050, said Bush's top environmental adviser, James Connaughton. A Japanese statement to other conference members called that proposal ""a vision and not a legally binding target.""
\
The conference included representatives of other major industrial nations such as Russia, Britain, France and Germany that have signed onto the Kyoto treaty that Bush rejected because he said it would harm the U.S. economy and did not require immediate cuts of countries like China and India. The treaty aimed to put the biggest burden on the richest nations that contributed the most carbon emissions.
\
Other participants came from Australia, Canada, Indonesia, Italy, Mexico, South Africa and South Korea, plus the European Union and the United Nations. Iran, another of the biggest emitters, notably was excluded.
\
""There was lots of talk about mandatory caps,"" said Yvo de Boer, the top U.N. climate official. ""I don't think it would have been realistic to expect at this first meeting to expect any country to change its position.""
\
He said he found Bush's speech ""encouraging because it indicates that the U.S. wants to develop this discussion among the major economies, get into the substance, including on the question of goals and the type of regime that's appropriate, and then feed that into the larger U.N. process.""
\
Bush said his purpose was to begin setting a new worldwide goal for cutting carbon dioxide emissions after 2012 and to help developing nations pay for the changes that would be needed. The president said the reduction goal should be finished by next summer, along with ways to measure progress toward it.
\
He said each nation should establish for itself what methods it will use to rein in the pollution problem without stunting economic growth.
\
But he refuses to sign onto mandatory emission-reduction obligations, preferring to encourage the development of new technologies and other voluntary measures, and won't participate in any talks toward a global agreement that do not include energy guzzlers from the developing world.
\
Bush made clear, however, that he saw his talks as complementary to the U.N. negotiations over what will succeed the Kyoto treaty after 2012. U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon held a summit Monday to grease the wheels for an agreement in December in Bali, Indonesia. Bush has seemed more sensitive lately to perceptions in other parts of the world that the U.S. government either does not take the phenomenon of global warming seriously -- or seriously enough.
\
It may be too little, too late.
\
John Ashton, a special representative on climate change for the British foreign secretary, said: ""One of the striking features of this meeting is how isolated this administration has become. There is absolutely no support that I can see in the international community that we can drive this effort on the basis of voluntary efforts.""
\
C. Boyden Gray, the U.S. ambassador to the E.U., strongly disagreed.
\
""The British might be isolating themselves,"" he said. ""It's been a little uphill because of skepticism in Europe. On the one hand they say you are undermining Bali, and on the other hand they say you are not doing anything at all.""
\
The ball is now in Congress' court, said Fred Krupp, president of Environmental Defense, who was one of the few outsiders to address the panel of mostly midlevel government ministers.
\
""Congress needs to lead. The president is not giving us the leadership we need. Ultimately what we need are mandatory caps,"" Krupp said. ""No air pollution problem in the world has ever been solved without having legal limits.""
\
Democrats Barbara Boxer of California and Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, who both chair committees in the Senate, said they would provide that leadership and work toward legislation with mandatory carbon controls and a cap-and-trade system.
\
Boxer called Bush's speech an improvement on what he has said about climate change in the past ""but unless it is followed up with mandatory cuts in global warming pollution, it will amount to little more than empty words.""
\
At the same time, the fact that the United States was taking a role in the process, and a leading one, was heartening to some.
\
Until recently, said Emil Salim, an economist and member of the Indonesian president's council of advisers, Bush offered ""no dialogue on the Kyoto Protocol whatsoever. This time, the members of the Kyoto Protocol are invited to discuss. So from that point of view, there is some improvement,"" he said in an interview. ""But on the other hand, I think it has more to do with the domestic politics, because you have election.""

Voter suppression imperils democracy
\
Editor: In November 1862, in the middle of the Civil War, Ralph Waldo Emerson envisioned what American democracy should look like after the defeat of the Confederacy.
\
The assumption was that the war would simply re-establish the Union as it was, with slavery intact in the states where it already existed.
\
But Emerson had something else in mind. He wanted to make real the promise of the Declaration of Independence that ""All men are created equal,"" and so he insisted that in the new America, we must ""leave slavery out."" And he went one step further. ""Since nothing satisfies but justice,"" he declared, ""let us stifle our prejudices against common sense and humanity, and agree that every man shall have an equal vote in the state, and a fair chance in society.""
\
It was astonishing to Emerson's audience that he would insist on voting rights for every American, not only emancipated slaves but also Native Americans and immigrants. But Emerson understood, like President Johnson a century later, that ""a man without a vote is a man without protection."" The only real power that citizens have is through their votes.
\
An estimated 750,000 Americans died in the war that ultimately established this bedrock principle. But now, in 2012, in virtually every state that is controlled by Republican majorities, including Pennsylvania, there has been a shameful and systemic effort to suppress the votes of the elderly, minorities and young people. Such obscene laws are a threat to democracy itself.
\
This tea-party led, Republican assault on our democratic values must be turned back. The election in November will be a defining moment in American democracy where ""We shall nobly save, or meanly lose, the last best hope of earth."" The tea party fanatics are clearly banking on the latter. I hope they're wrong.

Energy costs crippling nation
\
Editor: From June 22 to Sept. 12, the cost of gasoline charged to the distributor increased by 83.61 cents per gallon and heating oil increased by 64.35 cents per gallon, fattening the bottom line of the major oil companies by an additional $621.4 million.
\
Why the huge increases? The hurricane? Prices went up before Hurricane Isaac ever came ashore and continue to increase even after the storm passed and operations in the Gulf resumed.
\
Escalating energy costs are strangling our economy while putting an enormous strain on the people's purses. And while I agree that government spending is out of control, cutting programs that provide aid to the poor, the elderly and the children is not the only solution.
\
Cuts must start at the top with subsidies to big businesses like the major oil companies.
\
There is concern that soon Social Security benefits will exceed funding for the program. Why can't Congress simply take the cap off of taxable income for Social Security and have everyone pay taxes on their entire earned income? Our national debt continues to grow in leaps and bounds, yet we allow American corporations, many that outsource jobs overseas, to pay little or no income taxes. These tax loopholes must be eliminated and these companies must be made to pay their fair share.
\
Our country should not be for sale. Lobbyists should not exert more influence than the voice of the people on Congress. With elections around the corner, and congressional ratings at all-time lows, the time is now for the people to show their displeasure for the current condition of this great country and get out and vote for change.

Wild claim
\
Editor: In a campaign appearance, Republican vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan made an extraordinary, if not ridiculous, claim that the Obama administration has ""gone to great lengths to make oil and gas more expensive.""
\
Now, virtually all analysts and the oil industry itself have blamed the most recent spike in gasoline prices on the effects of Hurricane Isaac. For safety reasons, Gulf drilling rigs were evacuated and coastline refineries were closed, reducing production in the short term, resulting in higher prices at the pump. The prices are expected to go down once the rigs and refineries come back online.
\
Ryan conjures up an explanation that ignores the facts and simply conforms to his theories. He accused Obama of jacking up gas prices to advance his ""cap and trade"" energy policy, which is designed to reduce carbon emissions. Ryan and the energy industry oppose it.
\
Now, in an election season, it is patently ridiculous to suggest that Obama would want high gas prices, which everyone understands and hates, to advance an energy policy about which most people are unfamiliar.
\
But Ryan, as he showed at the GOP convention, would rather just make things up to suit his story than actually make a sensible argument. This is a part of Romney's and Ryan's fact-free campaign. After the convention, their pollster, Neil Newhouse, actually boasted that ""we're not going to let our campaign be dictated by fact-checkers.""
\
So, they just lie whenever they think it may help them. But, as the Seinfeld sitcom character George Costanza said, ""Remember, Jerry, it's not a lie if you believe it.""

Impact fee fair
\
Editor: Your editorial, ""State still short-changed on gas cash,"" utterly overlooks the facts of the 2009 debate on a state Marcellus Shale gas severance tax.
\
In 2009, then-Gov. Ed Rendell said he hoped to generate ""about $100 million in additional revenue"" by enacting a severance tax on natural gas from the Marcellus region. Moreover, this tax was designed in a punitive manner that discouraged additional capital investment and job creation. You get no revenue whatever if you drive a business away.
\
However, your own editorial acknowledges that the state and its communities will share in over $200 million in impact fee revenue. And, unlike the severance tax, this revenue will not disappear into the black hole of Harrisburg, but rather be driven out within three months to the benefit of communities all across the commonwealth.
\
Unlike the approach of severance tax advocates, Gov. Tom Corbett's vision of ""doing it right"" also includes ensuring high standards for protecting our environment. These enhancements, contained in Act 13, were built upon the recommendations of the Governor's Marcellus Shale Advisory Commission and our legislative partners.
\
Mr. Corbett did in one year what the prior administration failed to do in four years: adopt a fair revenue stream for local communities, while further enhancing our environmental standards for oil and gas development. Mr. Corbett's leadership means we have more revenue, more jobs, and a culture of environmental stewardship in which we can all be proud.

Fervent:1. Hot, burning, glowing, boiling.
\
-- Oxford English Dictionary
\
Fervently"" is how America will henceforth engage in talks on global warming. So said the president's climate change negotiator Sunday in Germany, at a U.N. conference on reducing carbon emissions. This vow was fervently applauded by conferees welcoming the end of what AP's news story called the Bush administration's ""eight years of obdurate participation"" in climate talks.
\
Reducing carbon emissions supposedly will reverse warming, if it resumes after the current period without warming, a period that began, according to statistics published by the World Meteorological Organization, 11 years ago. Regarding the reversing, the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change has many ambitions, as outlined in a working group's 16-page ""information note"" to ""facilitate discussions.""
\
For example: ""Tariffs can be lowered to grant special preference to climate-friendly goods, or they can be maintained at high levels to discourage trade in GHG (greenhouse gas)-intensive goods and services."" The working group says protectionism ""in the service of climate change objectives"" might virtuously ""shelter domestic producers of climate-friendly goods.""
\
Furthermore, using ""border carbon adjustment,"" a nation might virtuously ""impose costs on imports equivalent to that (sic) faced by domestic producers"" operating under a carbon tax. Or a nation with a cap-and-trade regime regulating carbon emissions by domestic manufacturers might require foreign manufacturers ""to buy offsets at the border equal to that (sic) which the producer would have been forced to purchase had the good been produced domestically.""
\
Cynics will see only potential for mischief by governments, including the U.S. government, using such measures to give a green patina to protectionism. Meanwhile, the U.S. government is having its own problems with one ""climate-friendly good"" that might not be. Last week The New York Times front page carried this headline: ""The Bulb That Saved the Planet May Be a Little Less Than Billed.""
\
The story recounted some Americans' misadventures with the new light bulbs that almost all Americans -- all but those who are filling their closets with supplies of today's incandescent bulbs -- will have to use after the phaseout of today's bulbs in 2014. (You missed that provision of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007?)
\
A San Francisco -- naturally -- couple emerged from Al Gore's movie ""An Inconvenient Truth"" incandescent with desire to think globally and act locally, in their home. So they replaced their incandescent bulbs with the compact fluorescents that Congress says must soon be ubiquitous. ""Instead of having a satisfying green moment, however,"" the Times reported, ""they wound up coping with a mess.""
\
Although supposed to last 10,000 hours and save, the Times says, ""as much as"" $5.40 a year in electricity costs, some bulbs died within a few hours. Some experts, reports the Times, ""blame the government for the quality problems,"" saying its push to cut the bulbs' prices prompted manufacturers to use inferior components. Furthermore, some experts have written a guide saying the new bulbs require ""a little insight and planning."" The Times says that ""may be an understatement.""
\
The bulbs, says the Times, ""do not do well in hot places with little airflow, like recessed ceiling fixtures,"" and some do not work ""with dimmers or three-way sockets."" And: ""Be aware that compact fluorescents can take one to three minutes to reach full brightness. This is not a defect."" Well, if you say so. Because all fluorescents contain mercury, a toxic metal, they must never be put in the trash, so Home Depot and other chains offer bins for disposing of dangerous bulbs. Driving to one of these disposal points might not entirely nullify the bulbs' environmental benefits. Besides, the Times summarizes the Environmental Protection Agency's helpful suggestions for coping with the environmental dangers caused when one of these environment-saving bulbs breaks:
\
""Clear people and pets from the room and open a window for at least 15 minutes if possible. Avoid vacuuming. Scoop up larger pieces with stiff paper or cardboard, pick up smaller residue with sticky tape, and wipe the area with a damp cloth. Put everything into a sealed plastic bag or sealed glass jar. In most cases, this can be put in the trash, but the EPA recommends checking local rules.""
\
Worrywarts wonder what will happen when a lazy or careless, say, 10 percent of 300 million Americans put their worn-out bulbs in the trash. Stop worrying. What do you think? That Congress, architect of the ethanol industry and designer of automobiles, does not think things through?

\
Last week, Chris Cali, a Scranton Prep graduate and junior biology major at Villanova University, shared his experiences living in a sustainable environment last summer at the Center for Sustainable Development Studies in Costa Rica.
\
In recognition of Earth Day, I've asked Chris to offer tips for sustainable living in order to promote health and wellness. Here are his 11 suggestions:
\
a?, a?, a?,
\
- Solar panels: Getting energy directly from the sun is one of the cleanest and most efficient ways to make electricity. Solar panels on your roof can reduce your electricity bill to almost nothing, and the costly initial investment will pay off in time.
\
- Drive a fuel-efficient vehicle: Driving a car with good gas mileage is a no-brainer with the current price of gas. While saving money, you will also be reducing your emission of carbon dioxide and therefore helping to fight climate change. Look into getting a hybrid electric vehicle, as there are tons of options now available, including SUVs and trucks. The extra cost of the vehicle will most likely be made up with the savings at the gas pump.
\
- Rain barrels: Reducing daily water use can save money and water for times of harsh weather. Collecting rainwater from the gutters and using it to water plants or the lawn is a good way to save water.
\
- Composting: Composting fruit and vegetable remains is a good way, along with recycling, to reduce the amount of waste we send to the landfill. The composted soil can then be used to fertilize your own garden.
\
- Eat organic and local foods: Organic foods are grown without the use of any artificial pesticides or fertilizers and are not genetically modified. Studies have shown that organic fruits and vegetables actually contain more nutrients than conventionally grown food, and locally grown foods do not have the artificial preservatives that are used on commercial crops.
\
- Eat less meat: The meat industry in the United States harms the environment and our health. Animals are kept in disgusting conditions that are breeding grounds for E. coli and salmonella, animal wastes pollute the air and water, and tremendous amounts of water and food are used to raise the animals. If you love a good steak like I do, buy grass-fed beef instead. Grass-fed cows are treated better, and the meat contains more omega 3 fatty acids necessary for a healthy diet.
\
- Visit nature: Ecotourism involves visiting a place to experience and learn about nature. It offers hope to preserve nature while at the same time bringing economic development to local communities. Be wary, however, because not all ecotourism is sustainable. Costa Rica has a government-run program that certifies hotels and tour operators as sustainable. Travel websites such as Trip advisor now display whether hotels merit a ""CST"" - Certificate for Sustainable Tourism - so visitors can better chose sustainable options.
\
- Write to Congress: The United States is one of the few developed nations that doesn't have some restriction on carbon emissions known to cause global warming. A carbon tax on polluting companies would bring in much-needed revenue for our government. Alternatively, a cap-and-trade system, which allows companies to buy and sell carbon credits to each other, would promote greener industry while fighting climate change.
\
- Support green business: Consumers have power when it comes to making our economy more sustainable. Read labels and choose products that do not contain substances that will harm the environment. Buy products made in sustainable factories, and buy stock in companies that are environmentally friendly. Boycott companies that are known to pollute or treat their workers unjustly.
\
- Plant trees: Planting trees and preventing deforestation is the cheapest and most effective way to fight climate change. Tropical forests are especially important, as they take in huge amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Every tree helps, so plant some in your own yard.
\
- Be less consumptive: Walk more; use less gas. Eat less; use less food and energy. Both you and the planet will be healthier.

Protect lungs
\
Editor: Have you ever been in the company of a person with COPD/emphysema while they're trying to get a breath of air?
\
I witnessed my dad gasping for a breath of air while doing something as simple as eating dinner. It's a vision I will never forget.
\
My dad, Wayne A. Litzenberger, lost his 13-year battle to COPD/emphysema on Dec. 26, 2003.
\
Try this: Hold your nose and breathe through a straw. If you feel like you're suffocating, that's how more than 12 million people feel every day as they cope with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
\
It's the fourth-leading cause of death worldwide, causing more than 3 million deaths every year.
\
COPD is an umbrella term for emphysema and chronic bronchitis; a debilitating lung disease which makes the individual ""breathless,"" unable to exhale carbon dioxide and inhale oxygen.
\
November is COPD Awareness Month. If you have symptoms, such as coughing, bringing up sputum, and shortness of breath during exertion, see a doctor for a simple breathing test. COPD is not curable but is treatable when diagnosed in the early stages . . . leading to earlier treatment and a higher quality of life.
\
The eighth annual World COPD Day will be observed on Wednesday. On this important day, lung disease organizations, COPD patients, and others will sponsor activities such as health fairs and ""Breath of Life"" Walks.
\
The Great American Smokeout on Thursday will draw attention to the deaths and chronic lung diseases caused by smoking. Smokers across the nation will take part by smoking less or quitting for the day.
\
This event is a way to challenge people to stop using tobacco and raise awareness of the many ways to quit for good.
\
Many communities and local volunteer support quitters will publicize the event and press for laws that will control tobacco use and discourage teens from lighting up.

Killer in the air
\
Editor: Secondhand smoke causes almost 50,000 deaths in adult nonsmokers in the U.S. every year, including approximately 3,400 from lung cancer.
\
Thousands of people make the healthy decision of saying no to cigarette smoking, but are still being ""murdered"" by the toxic fumes of those who do smoke. Does this seem right?
\
Although much progress has been made by cutting down smoking in restaurants and some bars, many are still falling victim to the harmful effects of this secondhand killer. Asthmatics, such as myself, can feel these effects almost instantaneously. In fact, secondhand smoke increases the number and severity of asthma attacks. Even stepping outside for a breath of ""fresh air"" can quickly turn into an asthma attack because someone is lighting up a cigarette nearby.
\
But what about those who have no choice but to be stuck in smoke-filled environments such as children living with smokers? It's pretty scary to think if parents or relatives smoke around their children, the children can inhale the equivalent of 102 packs of cigarettes by age 5.
\
Luckily for those who are victims of secondhand smoke and for those who are looking to quit, the Great American Smokeout is just around the corner. On Thursday smokers and tobacco users are asked to stay tobacco free for one day. Not only does this challenge people to stop using tobacco, but also helps to raise awareness about the dangers of smoking and the many effective ways available to quit smoking.

Focus on recycling
\
Editor: On Sunday, Americans will celebrate America Recycles Day. Recycling is a simple way in which everyone in Pennsylvania and in your community can protect the environment, preserve our natural resources, and contribute to the economic well-being of our nation.
\
According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, many easily recycled materials are still thrown away. For example, 78 percent of glass containers, 60 percent of aluminum cans, 41 percent of steel cans, 45 percent of paper and paperboard containers and packaging are not currently recycled. Demand for these recyclable materials has never been greater and, in many cases, manufacturers aren't getting all the recyclables they can use.
\
For example, if your old incandescent Christmas lights fail to light this year, or if you choose to replace them with energy-efficient LED lights, those old lights can be recycled. Check with your local recycling facility to see if they can take them for recycling. If not, you can send them to HolidayLEDs, a national manufacturer of LED holiday lights, for recycling. For details, go to: www.holidayleds.com/holidayledscom_christmas_light_recycling_program

Editor: I would like to thank William A. Levinson (Your Opinion, Nov. 1) for his letter to the editor on cap and trade.
\
Cap and trade will indeed raise the price of energy for all working Americans. I believe it will benefit financial firms greatly, with Goldman Sachs high among them.
\
A 1999 cover of Time had pictures of Robert Rubin, Larry Summers and Alan Greenspan. The caption of the pictured trio was, ""The Committee To Save the World.""
\
Mr. Rubin's idea was that the American economy, particularly the financial markets, were overregulated and needed to be set free. He was the Goldman Sachs co-chairman in the early 1990s. During President Clinton's administration, he directed the National Economic Council and later became secretary of the treasury.
\
Mr. Summers was Mr. Rubin's treasury deputy and Mr. Greenspan was fed chief.
\
President Obama has made Mr. Summers director of his National Economic Council.
\
I was disgusted when Mr. Summers made the decision that it should be up to the financial firms to decide if CEOs should retain their gigantic salaries and bonuses.
\
Several weeks ago Mr. Summers was quoted in a story stating the middle class may have to be taxed more after all. Shortly after that article, Mr. Greenspan was cited in another article. The gist of the article was that the jobs situation is awful. Need more be said?
\
Every day we are growing closer to the demise of the average American.

125,"There has been a great deal of misinformation generated recently about President Bush's Clear Skies Initiative. While our administration certainly welcomes a debate over the best way to reach our goal of cleaner air for all Americans, we respectfully suggest that this issue is too important to be decided on anything other than the facts. So here they are:\The Clear Skies Initiative will, over the next decade, achieve substantially greater reductions in air pollution from power plants than are attainable under current law.\Clear Skies will reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide by 73 percent, of nitrogen oxides by 67 percent, and of mercury by 69 percent over today's levels.\Clear Skies will achieve these reductions more quickly and with greater certainty than under current law.\Clear Skies will bring much better results than under the current Clean Air Act. The same is true for the two other pollutants covered under Clear Skies.\The program's mandatory cap and trade approach is modeled on the Acid Rain Trading Program, the most successful clean air program in history, having achieved more tons of pollution reduction than all other 1990 Clean Air Act programs combined.\Compliance with the Acid Rain Trading Program is at virtually 100 percent, without the need for litigation that delays results.\The Clear Skies cap-and-trade approach will not harm air quality in Philadelphia or in any other part of the country. In fact, the program's stringent caps will improve air quality in every region affected by pollution from power plants.\Clear Skies will allow us to achieve historic reductions in air pollution from power plants without causing disruptions to the power supply or sending electricity prices sky-high.\President Bush's initiative is a clear winner for all Americans. It will help prevent tens of thousands of asthma attacks, save thousands of lives, and again reveal the scenic vistas in our national parks that have been shrouded in haze for too long.\Clear Skies also recognizes that we don't have to stop progress to stop pollution. Given advances in pollution-controlling technologies, we can protect the health of our environment while also protecting America's economic health.\I am confident the Congress will see the wisdom in the Clear Skies Initiative once members see the facts.\The simple truth is that America's air will be cleaner, sooner, and at less cost to consumers under Clear Skies than under the current Clean Air Act. What's at stake is nothing less than a healthy future for us and for our children and grandchildren.\Christine Todd Whitman is administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.\ \ \Credit: By Christine Todd Whitman"

Pennsylvania and 14 other states scored a major victory for environmental and public health Friday, when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit overturned a dangerous Bush administration policy on regulating mercury.
\
The states had adopted rules mandating reductions in mercury emissions by coal-fired power plants, the chief source of the emissions. The Bush administration imposed a ""cap and trade"" rule, by which plants that emit mercury beyond the standards may buy credits from plants with emissions below the standard. That might work for some other types of emissions, but not for mercury, a dangerous neurotoxin. The problem with the cap and trade system is that it could have precluded any actual reductions of mercury pollution, allowing further contamination of waterways.
\
Power plants nationwide spew about 48 tons of mercury into the environment each year. That doesn't sound like much until you consider that a fraction of a teaspoon of mercury is enough to render fish in a 25-acre lake to be unfit for human consumption.
\
Pennsylvania and the other states were correct to insist on actual reductions of mercury emissions from every power plant. The administration should accept the court's decision.
"
128,"WASHINGTON -- Two top Senate Democrats are set to introduce a climate-change bill this week that would put new limits on carbon emissions, as world leaders prepare for a climate summit in Denmark after agreement last week by the G-20 nations on phasing out subsidies for fossil fuels.\Sens. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., who chairs the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, and John Kerry, D-Mass., will reportedly unveil their bill tomorrow after months of closed-door meetings.\The bill will be modeled largely on legislation passed by the House in June that aims to cut carbon emissions by 17 percent by 2020 and more than 80 percent by 2050, compared to 2005 levels, reported ClimateWire and other publications.\But it's unclear how far the bill will get this year, or how fast. The bill from Ms. Boxer and Mr. Kerry would come as senators are intensely busy with health care legislation, President Barack Obama's top domestic priority. Mr. Obama is aiming to sign a health care overhaul this year that would cut costs and cover the uninsured.\At the same time, the Boxer-Kerry bill also comes just over two months before a Dec. 7 meeting in Copenhagen, where world leaders are hoping to finalize a new agreement to reduce greenhouse gases. At last week's G-20 meeting in Pittsburgh, leaders pledged to ""intensify [their] efforts, in cooperation with other parties, to reach agreement in Copenhagen."" They also agreed to slash subsidies in the ""medium term"" for oil and other fossil fuels.\A climate-change bill faces a steep climb in the Senate after passing the House on a narrow 219-212 vote in June. Republicans have consistently portrayed Democrats' efforts to reduce global warming as a tax on families and businesses, and say it will lead to loss of jobs and U.S. competitiveness. Moreover, Democrats from industry-heavy states like Ohio and Michigan want breaks for manufacturing industries that would be affected by the legislation's caps on emissions.\Mr. Obama argues that the House bill will create jobs through new energy investments, but critics say the ""cap and trade"" system at the heart of the bill amounts to a tax. Under the ""cap and trade"" system, companies would buy and sell permits to meet emissions limits."
129,"Pittsburgh used to be called ""The Steel City."" Today we are home to health care, technology, robotics and financial services companies, and when it comes to higher education, we can still boast about University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon. \Thanks to its business diversity, Pittsburgh is economically strong. The city added jobs in 2008 while, at the same time, our nation slipped into recession and unemployment began to climb. \I am concerned that the Waxman-Markey climate change bill could confront Pittsburgh with a second recession, one it may have difficulty overcoming. The bill features a cap-and-trade system to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But cap-and-trade is rife with complexities and subtleties that would make it easy to manipulate. Congress is already making backroom deals to give away free carbon allowances to favored companies, not mindful of the billions of dollars the carbon credits are worth. Since there's no free lunch, someone will have to pay for that pork. Who? You, me and the environment. \I would like to see progressive, transparent and positive climate change policy, but hold the pork."
130,"
They are two fallacious arguments aimed at the same source.
\
First is a John McCain television commercial about the high price of oil, and in it blame is squarely put on the shoulders of a single junior senator from Illinois who hasn't yet finished his first term and does not serve on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.
\
You can probably figure out who the McCain camp wants us to blame for the pain at the pump.
\
Second is a Web ad by the Republican National Committee targeting Democrat Barack Obama's much-discussed, much-covered speech in Berlin, where he talked about eliminating walls between cultures and races, a speech heard by an estimated 200,000 people.
\
McCain's response? Equate Obama, a Harvard Law School-educated presidential nominee with a rare flair for rhetorical eloquence, with two bimbo starlets, Britney Spears and Paris Hilton.
\
While the midsummer timing may seem early in the election season to launch attack ads, they're indicative of McCain's predicament: being on the wrong side of popular opinion on just about every major issue in the campaign.
\
The war in Iraq remains unpopular. A majority of registered voters have said they've experienced some form of financial hardship in the last year, and two-thirds said they believe the government can fix their problems. Those who believe health care is the most important issue favor Obama by an overwhelming majority - and so do those who are concerned about the economy.
\
All McCain and the GOP have left in their arsenal are ad hominem attacks to tear down the pristine image of Obama as savior to the nation's ills. McCain already has name recognition, and according to Reid Wilson of RealClearPolitics.com, the only thing the Arizona senator needs to complete the formula for a successful presidential campaign is to convince people not to vote for his opponent.
\
That's hard to do when Obama's singing the song a majority of people want to hear. All McCain has left is to strike at Obama's image, and you can expect the attack ads to keep rolling out all summer long.
\
McCain has at least opened an advantage on Obama in one area: energy.
\
Using the last Franklin & Marshall College poll of voters nationwide, it's not difficult to see why McCain's up in this area, and Obama would be wise to curtail his message on gasoline prices and energy policy so as to effectively counter McCain.
\
Nearly 40 percent of those polled said the economy is the No. 1 issue of the election, with energy policy garnering only 5 percent. The environment isn't even on the list.
\
A closer look, though, shows that three-fourths of the respondents said some sort of financial trouble, and high gasoline prices or health insurance costs or the economy in general, are the most important issues facing them personally. Again, the environment doesn't even make an appearance.
\
This is a pocketbook election. So it's no wonder McCain's winning on this front when he has people convinced expanded domestic oil drilling will save them dollars.
\
It's a false formula, because any savings wouldn't impact our bank accounts for years, even decades, and it's quite possible the growing worldwide demand for oil will swallow up potential savings. But those are the dirty details missing in McCain's message. For now, he's telling the American people that more domestic oil drilling equals savings at the pump.
\
A look at Obama's energy platform illustrates why he's struggling to get traction on this issue. He's advocating a complex cap-and-trade formula to reduce carbon emissions; incentives to stop deforestation; funding development of biofuels; making old manufacturing sites green; encouraging geothermal, solar and wind electricity use; and much more.
\
Catch a theme there? Obama's message is about saving the environment - probably something he's trying to utilize as an appeal to his party's base - but while these pursuits may indeed protect the natural world, it's not clear how they will save the American people money.
\
If gas prices continue to hover around $4 a gallon, it could be the issue propelling McCain to an upset. Obama would be wise to explain how his policies not only save air, land and water but money, too.
\
I feel great and am confident that the treatment and care I received will allow me to return to serving the people of the 36th Senatorial District in the manner they expect.

131,"WASHINGTON -- A group of coal state senators including Pennsylvania's Bob Casey Jr. and Arlen Specter have negotiated protections for the coal industry into a draft of climate change legislation. \But both Mr. Specter and Mr. Casey are withholding full support of the chairman's mark, released Friday by Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., because of concerns about how Pennsylvania would be affected by a transition away from fossil fuels. \The bill would give coal plants advance payments to take measures to reduce emissions, provided that the projects would cut emissions by at least 50 percent. It would mandate that coal plants cut emissions by using carbon capture and storage technology by 2020, but only if the technology is available on a large scale at that point. \The provisions were negotiated in meetings over several months among the staffs of several senators from coal states, in a group chaired by Tom Carper, D-Del. \Sens. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., Joseph Lieberman, I-Conn., Max Baucus, D-Mont., Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and Mark Warner, D-Va., participated as well. \The interests of coal were balanced against the wishes of some of the more liberal members of the Environment and Public Works Committee, which will hold hearings on the bill starting tomorrow. The White House, environmental groups such as the Sierra Club and coal industry players have been kept abreast of the negotiations. \Heavy industry has opposed the bill for its aggressive greenhouse gas reduction targets: a 20 percent reduction by 2020 and an 83 percent reduction by 2050. Those targets go further than the ones in the Waxman-Markey climate bill that narrowly passed in the House of Representatives in June. Both bills create a cap-and-trade market where big emitters can trade pollution credits. \A likely result of the bill's passage would be a shedding of jobs in the coal industry with an increase in so-called ""green-collar jobs"" in renewable energy fields. Protecting those who lose their jobs and retraining them for green jobs is also on the minds of Pennsylvania's senators, both Democrats. \""The coal issues we're still working through,"" Mr. Casey said. \He said his office is ""trying to push hard on wages and doing our best to make people whole who are adversely affected by a climate bill, both individuals and communities. ... I think that's essential and I don't think we can pass a bill without it."" \Cecil-based coal producer Consol Energy is against the legislation, as long as it keeps the emissions reductions targets, which spokesman Tom Hoffman last week said are unrealistic. The American Petroleum Institute and the ranking Republican on Environment and Public Works, Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma, issued statements denouncing the chairman's mark within minutes of its release on the grounds that it would raise costs for America's energy consumers. \Still, Mr. Specter, who sits on Environment and Public Works, said he's confident that business and environmental groups can find middle ground on the bill. \""I think we can deal with environmental concerns and global warming and still maintain a vibrant coal region,"" Mr. Specter said last week. \""There's going to be a lot more negotiation. We haven't had the hearings yet. We've got a lot of work to do."""
132,"President Bush wants Americans to have clean air - after he's out of office.\Yesterday, the President proposed legislation to regulate pollution from power plants, but it doesn't take full effect until 2018.\He calls his ""Clean Skies"" proposal ""the most significant step America has ever taken"" to reduce smog, soot and acid rain. Not exactly. In fact, if he left current rules alone, more pollution could be eliminated - and six years sooner, according to his own Environmental Protection Agency.\So why this assault on the Clean Air Act, supported so strongly by his father? To give industry ""flexibility.""\The same reasoning drives his voluntary greenhouse-gas reduction program, also announced yesterday. Basically, the President believes Americans should trust energy companies to do the right thing for the environment.\Companies like Enron?\He complains that current environmental regulations only create an endless cycle of litigation. Yet Attorney General John Ashcroft last month declared that lawsuits against 51 power plants over failure to install pollution controls were justified. Further, if the companies had complied with the rules, they would not have been sued.\The Clean Air Act, passed in 1970 and amended in 1990, has steadily improved air quality for all Americans. Still, smog and soot contribute to millions of asthma attacks and thousands of premature deaths each year.\The act needs to be strengthened, not weakened. Congress should reject Mr. Bush's plan in favor of a bill sponsored by Vermont Sen. Jim Jeffords, which tightens up existing law.\Mr. Bush recommends a ""cap and trade"" system, which sets a limit on emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and mercury. Plants that could not meet the ""cap"" could buy pollution credits from cleaner plants.\In theory, ""cap and trade"" could work if the cap were set well and the trade geographically restricted. (The Jeffords bill has its own emissions trading.) But if the rules aren't carefully crafted, air quality could worsen in specific regions, such as this one, even as national air quality measures improved.\For example, a dirty power plant in Pennsylvania could buy credits from a cleaner plant in Illinois. Overall, U.S. pollution levels decrease, but in, say, Southwest Philadelphia, they stay the same or increase.\Mr. Bush insists on making environmental progress contingent on the health of the economy, but asthma doesn't consult the Dow Jones average. Pollution damages health in both bull and bear markets. Plus, many antipollution upgrades increase efficiency, saving money in the long run.\The President's ""Clean Skies"" initiative is really just a smoke screen.\ \ \Credit: "

To the Editor:
\
As the $789 billion stimulus package attempts to pull our country out of recession, we need to remember our fragile economic condition when addressing climate change -- an issue bound to be a ""hot"" topic this year.
\
Living in rural Pennsylvania almost all my life, I know dealing with climate change is important to protect the environment.
\
However, at a time when we're trying to grow businesses and create jobs, we should adopt a climate change solution that reins in emissions, but doesn't cause more economic turmoil.
\
And more turmoil is inevitable if our country goes with a complex carbon cap and trade program. Mandating companies to buy and sell emissions allowances would be expensive and difficult to monitor. It would nurture more market manipulation and corruption -- something everyone has had enough of.
\
To foster new energy technologies with lesser carbon footprints, our nation needs a stable, growing economy. As our country bares the weight of the sub-prime mortgage and Wall Street crises, we need to steer clear of risky dealings like a cap and trade program.
\
A better policy for coping with climate change would be a carbon tax. This simple, transparent policy would maintain economic stability while reducing emissions and encouraging investment in energy research and development. Sounds like a win-win to me.

Calling mercury pollution a ""life issue,"" the state's top environmental official Tuesday implored citizens to get behind a push for more stringent emission regulations.
\
Dismayed by a new mercury reduction rule adopted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Environmental Protection Secretary Kathleen A. McGinty appealed especially to caregivers of populations susceptible to mercury's adverse health effects to join in an effort to get Pennsylvania to enact stricter standards than the federal mandate.
\
""Mercury needs to be one of the things you're concerned about,"" Mrs. McGinty said during a meeting with the editorial board of The Times-Tribune.
\
""I hope we can bring people around on it.""
\
One in six children are born with dangerous levels of the neurotoxin, she said. Pennsylvania pumps about five tons of mercury into the air each year, second only to Texas.
\
If successful, Pennsylvania will be the fifth state in the nation to adopt standards that are tougher than the EPA requirements.
\
In May, Pennsylvania joined 10 other states in suing the EPA over its new regulation for curbing mercury emissions from power plants. The rule, which took effect July 18, calls for a 70 percent reduction in emissions by 2018 and establishes a cap-and-trade program, allowing companies to purchase emission credits from other, cleaner plants.
\
State officials have decried the federal rule as short-sighted and said the trade program will create mercury hot spots at power plants. Gov. Ed Rendell last month announced a state-specific plan that aims to cut emissions by 90 percent within nine years and eliminates the cap-and-trade option.
\
Mercury can remain active in the environment for 10,000 years and poses special risks to pregnant women, children, subsistence fishermen and recreational anglers, according to DEP. Mercury exposure is linked to brain damage and nervous system problems in children and heart and immune system damage in adults.
\
""This is a life issue,"" she said. ""It is substantially related to whether the unborn face a very real health threat.""
\
Mrs. McGinty touched on several other topics during meeting, including the state's clean energy and abandoned mine land reclamation initiatives.
\
The state has invested about $25 million on about 60 mine reclamation projects in Lackawanna County in the last few years, she said.
\
""If we just look at these the right way, they're economic opportunities in disguise,"" she said of the state's environmental wealth, from wind and water to mine-scarred lands.

"
135," President Bush's plan for sweeping changes in the Clean Air Act is set to go before a deadlocked Senate Environment and Public Works Committee today, with nine members for it and nine against.\ A tie vote would kill the bill, known as the ""Clear Skies Act of 2005,"" at least as far as action by the committee is concerned.\ The measure would repeal existing Clean Air Act provisions that require owners of power plants to install the best available equipment for removing mercury and oxides of nitrogen from power plant smoke.\ In their place, it would install ""cap-and-trade"" systems in which operators of coal-burning power plants that meet pollution standards would earn allowances, which they could sell to those that do not.\ Proponents, including President Bush, say such systems are more efficient and remove more pollution faster than existing control requirements.\ A 1990 cap-and-trade law for sulfur dioxide, which is generally regarded as successful, would be broadened and extended.\ It also contains a ""transitional"" provision that would give states and metropolitan areas now under federal mandate to reduce ozone pollution until 2018 to come into conformity with federal standards.\ The measure's two sponsors, Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., chairman of the committee, and Sen. George Voinovich, R-Ohio, were still lobbying late yesterday for the one additional vote necessary for approval.\ Inhofe says the Clear Skies plan proposed by President Bush on Valentine's Day, 2002, is the most aggressive air pollution control measure any president has ever asked Congress to pass.\ Opponents say the air would be cleaned more quickly under existing air pollution controls.\ All seven Democrats on the committee have announced their opposition to the bill, along with Independent James Jeffords of Vermont and Republican Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island.\ Inhofe, Voinovich and the remaining seven Republicans, including freshman Sen. Johnny Isakson of Georgia, are on record in favor of recommending the bill for passage by the full Senate.\ Without the committee's approval, it would take difficult parliamentary maneuvers to bring the measure before the full Senate, and members of the staffs of Jeffords and several Democrats appeared confident yesterday that the bill was dead.\ Jeffords has authored his own Clean Air Act amendment, which would set more stringent limits for sulfur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen and mercury, and create a regulatory regime for carbon dioxide, believed by most scientists to be the major cause of global warming.\ Jeffords and the seven Democrats last week appealed to Inhofe to ""work with all of us to develop multi-pollutant legislation that will improve our nation's air quality faster than current law.""\ But Inhofe says that over the past three years the president's Clear Skies plan ""has been debated and re-debated and was the subject of over 20 committee hearings.""\ And Voinovich, chairman of the subcommittee with jurisdiction over Clean Air Act legislation, has said Congress must act early this year if it is to pass changes in the law.\ Voinovich warned at a hearing by his subcommittee last month that the existing law is forcing electric utilities to switch from coal to natural gas.\ This drives up the price of gas and forces jobs - as well as air pollution - to other countries, he said.\ The polarity of the committee is evident in the way the voting records of its members are ""graded"" by the League of Conservation Voters.\ Eight of the nine Republicans who have said they will vote for the bill were rated ""zero"" for votes last year on environmental issues. These include Isakson and two other freshmen senators, Jim DeMint of South Carolina and David Vitter, who were in the House of Representatives.\ Of the nine members who say they will vote against the bill, five - Jeffords, Hillary Clinton of New York, Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, Barbara Boxer of California and Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey are rated 100 by the environmental group."
136,"The health-care debate has been so combustible that the political fire is in danger of sucking the oxygen out of other important congressional business. That can't be allowed to occur, because the other concern about health -- that of the planet -- will only be hurt by delays.\On June 26, the House of Representatives by a narrow margin -- 219-212 -- passed the American Clean Energy and Security Act, HR 2454, which would wean the nation away from fossil fuels with incentives to encourage alternative energy sources such as wind and solar.\The payoff would come at several levels -- the creation of new jobs in green industries, greater national security by lessening the nation's reliance on importing oil from dubious foreign regimes and reduction of global warming gases (of course, less pollution also benefits the overall health of the American people).\Using a cap-and-trade system -- a cap would be set on overall emissions, but companies could buy or sell credits to comply -- the bill would reduce emissions in stages resulting in an 83 percent reduction over 40 years. While climate change still has its skeptics, despite the ever-growing body of evidence, even the Pentagon has become concerned about the implications of a planet convulsed by global warming-linked upheavals.\Before health care became demagoguery's cause du jour, the climate bill was the focus of dire predictions that are sure to be soon revived. The critics say cap-and-trade is just a tax increase on businesses. No, it is a market mechanism offered as a more palatable alternative to a direct carbon tax.\Critics say that it will bankrupt the country, but the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the cost per household by 2020 will be only $175, which is less than the likely rise in the cost of cable TV over that period. They say it will kill jobs, but the potential for job growth is huge. A recent study by a project of the Pew Charitable Trusts found that green energy jobs are already exploding at a rate of 9.1 percent a year. In 2007, Pennsylvania had more than 38,700 of them.\It is not only environmentalists who support this bill. Groups with a personal stake in jobs and a good economy -- ranging from the United Steelworkers to Alcoa -- are backing the bill as a reasonable and much-needed step for the nation to take.\It is now up to the Senate. Supporters of the bill expect it to be introduced in the Committee on the Environment and Public Works shortly after the summer recess, on Sept. 8 or 9. Democratic Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania is a member of that committee.\In the House, Rep. Mike Doyle, D-Forest Hills, provided leadership that helped make the difference, and we hope Sen. Specter and his colleague Sen. Bob Casey will now pick up the ball and run with it. This bill is good for the planet and for America's place in it. It cannot be allowed to die."
137,"
Maybe Joe Barton finally did it. Maybe the Texas congressman's rash rush to hold BP's hand will wake up Americans to the daunting reality of today's ultrapartisan politics, where nothing is good if it bears the other team's brand.
\
Most Americans are likely pleased that President Obama's measured belligerence led BP to announce a $20 billion escrow fund to aid victims of the Gulf oil spill. Barton, though, had the gall to call the deal a ""shakedown,"" casting the Britons as poor innocents being preyed upon by the voracious Obama.
\
It was bad enough that his fellow Republicans could barely wait for Obama to make his prime-time speech on the oil spill Tuesday night before they pounced on him. House Republican leader John Boehner issued a statement blasting Obama before the president uttered his first word.
\
Midway through the speech, a statement was released by national Republican Chairman Michael Steele accusing Obama of ""manipulating this tragic, national crisis for selfish political gain,"" and playing ""Chicago-style politics.""
\
What sin, you might ask, led to such verbal flagellation? Obama dared mention this country needs a new energy policy that is less dependent on oil and other fossil fuels. ""I say we can't afford not to change how we produce and use energy - because the long-term costs to our economy, our national security, and our environment are far greater,"" he said.
\
A day after Obama's speech, Boehner accused him of planning to ""exploit the oil spill crisis by forcing a job-killing national energy tax through Congress."" Obama never said the words cap and trade, but that didn't stop Boehner from suggesting that idea was up the president's sleeve.
\
This gamesmanship needs to stop. Only a year ago, there was wide consensus that this country should impose strong measures that lead industries to reduce the carbon dioxide emissions that cause climate change. Today, politicians ignore science and deny global warming even exists.
\
For 20 years, this country has had a cap-and-trade program that has helped reduce the sulfur dioxide pollution that causes acid rain. But it was imposed before the current partisan rancor that has Democrats and Republicans so locked in battle they can hardly agree on the time of day.
\
Remember when Sen. John McCain was celebrated for being willing to reach across the aisle? You hardly hear his name these days; he's too afraid of being accused of cozying up to Democrats by his Aug. 24 primary opponent, former GOP Congressman J.D. Hayworth. Remember when McCain was a leader on immigration reform? He's turned tail and is running away from the issue.
\
So, who will stand up and cross party lines for a new energy policy that makes sense? Obama was absolutely right to connect the dots between the Gulf tragedy and America's gluttonous appetite for oil. This is exactly the time to push for a move to boost alternative energy sources.
\
People like Joe Barton, who prefer to weigh every initiative on the scale of political expedience, can't be allowed to stand in the way of this nation's progress - on energy or anything else. But if this oil spill that has cost lives and is costing livelihoods can't motivate Washington to see past the next election, then what will?

138,"THE CLIMATE crisis is already hitting Pennsylvania, raising temperatures and increasing our days of extreme heat alongside the impact of floods and landslides — but some lawmakers are forcing an old debate that will lead to no action at all.\That’s the only conclusion an honest observer could draw from the effort to block Pennsylvania from joining the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) — a compact of 11 New England and Mid-Atlantic states, with over a decade-long track record, to reduce carbon emissions and bring home revenue.\RGGI is a carbon emission cap-and-trade program — not a new or radical idea. It sets a total carbon allowance for power plants operating within states that belong to the compact. A power plant then can either transition toward cleaner energy or buy CO2 allowances, with revenues from these purchases going back to RGGI states.\In October 2019, Gov. Tom Wolf signed an executive order instructing the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to start drafting regulations to join RGGI. For nearly two years, the DEP has been going through a long regulatory process with multiple stakeholders — including the legislature.\The DEP estimates that by joining RGGI in 2022, Pennsylvania would be able to cut carbon emissions by at least 25.5% by 2030. Considering that Pennsylvania accounts for nearly 1% of greenhouse gas emissions worldwide, that reduction could have global significance.\What makes RGGI appetizing to states, and should to Pennsylvania, is that revenue from the purchase of power allowances goes right back to the state. The program has so far brought in more than $139 million for New Jersey to invest in clean energy and emission reduction in 2021 alone. DEP estimates that RGGI will bring the commonwealth nearly $2 billion and net 30,000 jobs between 2022 and 2030.\Revenue, jobs, better health, reduced emissions — these are the opportunities the state Senate is trying to block in Pennsylvania.\On June 14, the Senate passed a bill advertised by Republicans as “requiring Legislative Approval for Imposing a Carbon Tax.” Although RGGI does not include such a tax, the bill is an effort to prevent Pennsylvania from joining the compact under the guise of legislators wanting to be involved. A similar bill passed both chambers in September 2020, and was rightly vetoed by Gov. Wolf. But the current bill has received more Democratic support in the Senate — including from Philadelphia’s Sen. Tina Tartaglione — and is now going to the House.\Sen. Gene Yaw, the Republican chair of the Environmental Resources and Energy Committee who discloses income from oil and gas companies year after year, claims RGGI would put “hardworking Pennsylvanians out of work.” That is exactly the kind of backward-looking view that leaves workers in polluting plants vulnerable to their jobs’ inevitable disappearance. The operator of the Cheswick Generating Station, a coal-fired power plant outside of Pittsburgh, announced the plant’s closure this month — along with closures of coal plants in Ohio and Maryland, only the latter a RGGI state.\Inaction abandons workers. RGGI and investment in the transition to clean energy manages the decline.\RGGI is also merely one starting point for mitigating the climate crisis. It addresses just one type of emissions (carbon) in one type of sector (power). RGGI does nothing to tackle, for example, methane — agreenhouse gas that leaks from fracking wells and traps more heat in the atmosphere than does CO2. Following a recent study on the impact of methane emissions, the executive director of the United Nations Environment Programme said: “Cutting methane is the strongest lever we have to slow climate change over the next 25 years.”\Instead of debating RGGI, Pennsylvania should join speedily, and the legislature should debate how to most equitably use the revenue both to support those who work in polluting plants and to address environmental injustice. Then the state could address the big-ticket items: how to move away from fracking and liquefied natural gas pipelines to reduce methane emissions.\The opportunities of investment in renewable energy and infrastructure improvements go well beyond the jobs and revenues RGGI would bring in. But as long as even a tested, market-based, cap-and-trade program meets such vigorous opposition, Pennsylvania will be stuck in the polluting past — not doing its part to protect its own residents, nor its fair share for the rest of the world."
139,"Earlier this week, the Environmental Protection Agency announced proposed regulations to curb emissions of ozone, which causes smog, not to mention asthma, heart disease and premature death. You know what happened: Republicans went on the attack, claiming that the new rules would impose enormous costs.\There's no reason to take these complaints seriously, at least in terms of substance. Polluters and their political friends have a track record of crying wolf. Again and again, they have insisted that American business - which they usually portray as endlessly innovative, able to overcome any obstacle - would curl into a quivering ball if asked to limit emissions. Again and again, the actual costs have been far lower than they predicted. In fact, almost always below the EPA's predictions.\So it's the same old story. But why, exactly, does it always play this way? Of course, polluters will defend their right to pollute, but why can they count on Republican support? When and why did the Republican Party become the party of pollution?\For it wasn't always thus. The Clean Air Act of 1970, the legal basis for the Obama administration's environmental actions, passed the Senate on a bipartisan vote of 73-0, and was signed into law by Richard Nixon. (I've heard veterans of the EPA describe the Nixon years as a golden age.) A major amendment of the law, which among other things made possible the cap-and-trade system that limits acid rain, was signed in 1990 by George H.W. Bush.\But that was then. Today's Republican Party is putting a conspiracy theorist who views climate science as a ""gigantic hoax"" in charge of the Senate's environment committee. And this isn't an isolated case. Pollution has become a deeply divisive partisan issue.\The reason pollution has become partisan is that Republicans have moved right. A generation ago, it turns out, environment wasn't a partisan issue: According to Pew Research, in 1992 an overwhelming majority in both parties favored stricter laws and regulation. Since then, Democratic views haven't changed, but Republican support for environmental protection has collapsed.\So what explains this anti-environmental shift?\You might be tempted simply to blame money in politics, and there's no question that gushers of cash from polluters fuel the anti-environmental movement at all levels. But this doesn't explain why money from the most environmentally damaging industries, which used to flow to both parties, now goes overwhelmingly in one direction. Take, for example, coal mining. In the early 1990s, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, the industry favored Republicans by a modest margin, giving around 40 percent of its money to Democrats. Today that number is just 5 percent. Political spending by the oil and gas industry has followed a similar trajectory. Again, what changed?\One answer could be ideology. Textbook economics isn't anti-environment; it says that pollution should be limited, albeit in market-friendly ways when possible. But the modern conservative movement insists that government is always the problem, never the solution, which creates the will to believe that environmental problems are fake and environmental policy will tank the economy. My guess, however, is that ideology is only part of the story - or, more accurately, it's a symptom of the underlying cause of the divide: rising inequality.\The basic story of political polarization over the past few decades is that, as a wealthy minority has pulled away economically from the rest of the country, it has pulled one major party along with it. True, Democrats often cater to the interests of the 1 percent, but Republicans always do. Any policy that benefits lower- and middle-income Americans at the expense of the elite - like health reform, which guarantees insurance to all and pays for that guarantee in part with taxes on higher incomes - will face bitter Republican opposition.\And environmental protection is, in part, a class issue, even if we don't usually think of it that way. Everyone breathes the same air, so the benefits of pollution control are more or less evenly spread across the population. But ownership of, say, stock in coal companies is concentrated in a few, wealthy hands. Even if the costs of pollution control are passed on in the form of higher prices, the rich are different from you and me. They spend a lot more money, and, therefore, bear a higher share of the costs. In the case of the new ozone plan, the EPA's analysis suggests that, for the average American, the benefits would be more than twice the costs. But that doesn't necessarily matter to the nonaverage American driving one party's priorities. On ozone, as with almost everything these days, it's all about inequality.\Paul Krugman is a syndicated columnist for The New York Times."
140,"With regards to the Post-Gazette's recent editorial on climate change (Jan. 9, ""Attacking Climate Change), the Pennsylvania Chamber recognizes that addressing this challenge must involve innovative solutions, practices and technologies from the private sector. However, real-world experience has shown that competitive markets do a better job driving growth, saving families their hard-earned dollars and reducing emissions than cap-and-trade schemes.\According to available data, the United States has significantly reduced emissions, without implementing the far-reaching, costly policies put in place by the European Union. Since 2005, the U.S. has reduced greenhouse gas emissions by about 760 million metric tons (while seeing gas and electric prices fall), while the European Union has reduced emissions by 770 million metric tons but at a much greater cost to employers and consumers. It's also been estimated that the U.S.'s competitive markets are delivering between $2.8 billion and $3.1 billion of savings to consumers, while EU energy prices have skyrocketed.\By embracing competitive markets, Pennsylvania has achieved the goals envisioned in the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan and has also reduced greenhouse gas emissions more than any of the states involved in the New England Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative cap-and-trade program. Instead of recognizing this progress, activists have petitioned the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection to, by regulatory fiat, tell more than a dozen industries (and the hundreds of thousands of workers they employ) to meet impossible emissions targets or shut down. It's the wrong approach for the state, and will harm the state's business environment and working families.\Kevin Sunday\Harrisburg\The writer is the director of government affairs for the Pennsylvania Chamber of Business and Industry.\Country at risk\A lesson from the government shutdown is that a politics of confrontation, competing interests and winners and losers is no longer suitable or viable in the 21st century and beyond. The necessary alternative is a politics of synergy, grounded in the recognition that everything is connected. And because everything is connected, ultimately, there are no winners and losers, even though it may appear to be so in the short term. Ultimately all gain and lose together; it is just a matter of degree and timing, as the shutdown manifests.\A majority of the people's representatives in the federal government, including the president, agreed to a way to keep government functioning while debating a sticking point on border security. Then the agreement, representing the common wisdom of the people's elected representatives, was hijacked by being reframed in terms of winning and losing in relation to ""a wall."" The result is a state of increased national insecurity, because everything is connected.\Millions of people - government workers, their families, the communities where they live and work - are now more insecure and this entails more than missing paychecks. Their physical, mental and emotional well-being is impacted also. And for many, the effects may be felt long after the shutdown ends. So the well-being of the nation is placed at risk, because everything is connected.\A politics of synergy acknowledges, embraces and governs based on our essential interconnections. It requires humility of our elected representatives, refusing politics that demean and denigrate those with whom one disagrees, and willingness to search for common ground that provides for shared well-being of diverse constituencies. And this includes the common constituent that sustains us all, our planet.\John Rogers\Point Breeze\A matter of safety?\The newly elected speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi asked President Donald Trump to delay the State of the Union address until the government shutdown is over. According to John Roberts at Fox News, Ms. Pelosi is concerned about security since the Secret Service and the Homeland Security departments are affected by the shutdown.\If her request is sincere, she is worried about her personal safety and the safety of the Congress. The shutdown is about Mr. Trump's demand for a wall to stop illegal aliens, drugs, human traffickers and gang members from entering the United States. Ms. Pelosi strongly rejects this wall and refuses to discuss a compromise.\Border agents and Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel working on the southern border strongly support the wall and its effectiveness. Ms. Pelosi's actions show clearly that while she is concerned about her personal safety, she cares nothing about the safety of citizens.\The shutdown battle is clear. Mr. Trump wants an effective physical barrier to slow down or stop illegal immigration. The Democrats under Ms. Pelosi's leadership have no plan other than trying to stop Mr. Trump's success. Why is the safety of the American public and this country's sovereignty not important to the Democrats? The Democratic Party is headed in a bad direction right now.\Bob Vincent\Upper St. Clair"
141,"The climate crisis is already hitting Pennsylvania, raising temperatures and increasing our days of extreme heat alongside the impact of floods and landslides — but some lawmakers are forcing an old debate that will lead to no action at all.\That’s the only conclusion an honest observer could draw from the effort to block Pennsylvania from joining the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) — a compact of 11 New England and Mid-Atlantic states, with over a decade-long track record, to reduce carbon emissions and bring home revenue.\RGGI is a carbon emission cap-and-trade program — not a new or radical idea. It sets a total carbon allowance for power plants operating within states that belong to the compact. A power plant then can either transition toward cleaner energy or buy CO2 allowances, with revenues from these purchases going back to RGGI states.\In October 2019, Gov. Tom Wolf signed an executive order instructing the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to start drafting regulations to join RGGI. For nearly two years, the DEP has been going through a long regulatory process with multiple stakeholders — including the legislature.\The DEP estimates that by joining RGGI in 2022, Pennsylvania would be able to cut carbon emissions by at least 25.5% by 2030. Considering that Pennsylvania accounts for nearly 1% of greenhouse gas emissions worldwide, that reduction could have global significance.\What makes RGGI appetizing to states, and should to Pennsylvania, is that revenue from the purchase of power allowances goes right back to the state. The program has so far brought in more than $139 million for New Jersey to invest in clean energy and emission reduction in 2021 alone. DEP estimates that RGGI will bring the commonwealth nearly $2 billion and net 30,000 jobs between 2022 and 2030.\Revenue, jobs, better health, reduced emissions — these are the opportunities the state Senate is trying to block in Pennsylvania.\On June 14, the Senate passed a bill advertised by Republicans as “requiring Legislative Approval for Imposing a Carbon Tax.” Although RGGI does not include such a tax, the bill is an effort to prevent Pennsylvania from joining the compact under the guise of legislators wanting to be involved. A similar bill passed both chambers in September 2020, and was rightly vetoed by Gov. Wolf. But the current bill has received more Democratic support in the Senate — including from Philadelphia’s Sen. Tina Tartaglione — and is now going to the House.\Sen. Gene Yaw, the Republican chair of the Environmental Resources and Energy Committee who discloses income from oil and gas companies year after year, claims RGGI would put “hardworking Pennsylvanians out of work.” That is exactly the kind of backward-looking view that leaves workers in polluting plants vulnerable to their jobs’ inevitable disappearance.

********CORRECTION: The number of construction jobs that could be created by the building of the new pollution control technology at a PPL plant was incorrectly attributed. Dan McCarthy of PPL made those statements. *********
\
PPL plans to install pollution control equipment at its Brunner Island power plant to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions.
\
Company officials said Wednesday they will spend $630 million for equipment for the largest generating unit at the Brunner Island plant in East Manchester Township and for two generating units at the company's Montour plant, north of Danville.
\
The pieces of equipment called scrubbers will remove nearly all of the sulfur dioxide from emissions, said Dan McCarthy, PPL spokesman.
\
McCarthy said Brunner Island is in compliance with air quality laws.
\
Installing the equipment is a voluntary effort officials believe will help the company avoid having to buy credits for emissions from other companies down the road to meet future air quality laws.
\
Statewide environmental groups spoke favorably about PPL's effort. The secretary of the state Department of Environmental Protection, who was present when the announcement was made at the Montour plant, also applauded the effort.
\
In the past, environmental groups have criticized Brunner Island for polluting the air.
\
Brunner Island is an older, coal-fired power plant. The plant released more than 4.7 million pounds of toxins into the air and land in 2002, making it the third-worst chemical polluter in the state, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
\
However, earlier this year, PennEnvironment's ""Pollution on the Rise"" report stated the power plant had decreased carbon dioxide emissions by 19 percent between 1995 and 2003.
\
And company officials said they have cut sulfur dioxide emissions by almost 40 percent and nitrogen dioxide emissions by almost 60 percent since 1990.
\
""It's always good to see a power company doing the right thing,"" Toni Flora, project manager at the Clean Air Council, said in an issued statement. ""The sulfur dioxide pollution that scrubbers prevent is associated with all sorts of negative health impacts, from asthma attacks to heart attacks to premature death.""
\
Sulfur dioxide is a byproduct of burning coal and widely believed to be a contributor to acid rain, McCarthy said.
\
Emissions would have gone up the smokestack will be re-routed through limestone sludge a combination of limestone and water, he said.
\
An electrostatic precipitator will charge the sulfur dioxide in the emissions, making the sulfur dioxide more likely to attach to the limestone. Then, the water will be drained and re-used. This process will create gypsum, a mineral powder.
\
That would leave the emissions entering the air cleaner, he said.
\
Gypsum may be useful in manufacturing, McCarthy said, adding its possible another company could set up near the power plant to use the product.
\
In addition to the environmental benefits, putting in the new equipment should create about 100 construction jobs at Brunner Island and possibly a small number of jobs in the power plant once it's installed, Nathan Willcox, an energy and clean air advocate at PennEnvironment, said.
\
Construction is tentatively expected to begin next year, with the project at Brunner Island to be completed by 2010.
\
Willcox said that because of rollbacks at the federal level and weak federal enforcement, power plants have been able to comply with air quality laws and yet still pollute the environment.
\
In order for cap-and-trade policies to work, there needs to be an established minimum standard of pollution. His group believes this is missing in proposed federal Clear Skies legislation.
\
In the cap-and-trade approach, favored by President Bush, a limit or cap is set on emissions, and then companies that pollute less that the cap can trade emissions allowances with campanies that pollute more.
\
Willcox said he hadn't seen specifically how Brunner Island's new equipment will work or numbers on how much sulfur dioxide it would remove from emissions, but he said the more pollution controls, the better.
\
""Brunner Island made the wise solution for purchasing pollution controls, instead of paying another plant to get cleaner,"" he said.

143,"
When Chinese President Xi Jinping's handlers arranged his flight from Seattle to Washington on Thursday, they made sure he would land after Pope Francis had left. Xi didn't want to be overshadowed by the rock-star pope.
\
As it turned out, the Chinese leader was unable to avoid the pope's shadow. The elaborate reception ceremonies for Xi on the White House lawn were eclipsed on TV by the pope's address to the United Nations.
\
But, apart from timing, comparisons between the pope and Xi are unavoidable.
\
The two leaders command the two largest constituencies in the world, 1.2 billion Catholics and 1.2 billion Chinese, respectively. And they hold polar opposite views on how to address the problems of their flocks and the world.
\
Pope Francis believes that solutions must emerge from the bottom up, while Xi seeks to solve everything from the top down.
\
During his U.S. trip, Francis stressed repeatedly that individuals have a moral responsibility to work together to preserve the environment, fight corruption, and ameliorate conflicts. His urgings were not just spiritual homilies but calls for grassroots political action to press legislators to act.
\
Citing four American heroes who turned ""dreams into action"" - Abraham Lincoln, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Dorothy Day, and Thomas Merton - the pope made clear that individual efforts to effect change are as important as those of the political elite.
\
However, the pope was also concerned about the future of Western democratic institutions, many of which have become so sclerotic that they have turned voters into cynics. As he addressed a joint session of Congress, Francis urged legislators to overcome the partisan behavior that has paralyzed our government.
\
Xi, on the other hand, is an authoritarian, distrustful of grassroots efforts. China experts believe his outlook stems more from personal history than Leninist ideology, which has largely given way in China to a blend of nationalism and Confucianism. Despite his family's communist pedigree, Xi was forced to labor in the countryside for years during the chaos of the Cultural Revolution; he appears to have emerged with the belief that order must be strictly imposed from above.
\
So Xi has moved to squash China's expanding civil society and its remaining free media, and shows a Mao-like propensity to rule from the very top.
\
What's so fascinating is that Francis and Xi are addressing many similar problems - especially pollution and corruption - but from a totally different perspective.
\
The pope pleaded in Congress and at the United Nations for individual and governmental action to combat man-made climate change. Meantime, Xi proposed a cap-and-trade plan that would supposedly limit China's greenhouse gas emissions. Chinese action on this front is essential, as Beijing has surpassed the United States as the world's biggest polluter.
\
However, it's hard to have confidence in a Chinese government that blatantly manipulates statistics and markets, and seeks to control (and hack) the Web. When China's stock market recently tanked, the government's reaction was to bend the stats back into shape by forbidding press coverage, banning sales of shares, and intervening massively to fix prices.
\
This hardly inspires confidence in a market for cap and trade.
\
Similarly, Xi is waging war on Chinese corruption from the top down, by publicly firing and arresting a number of party officials. In a country as huge as China, fighting corruption from such heights is likely to fail.
\
On my last trip to China, I heard from senior Chinese officials that they often depend on nongovernmental agencies working on health or environmental issues to alert them to corruption far from Beijing. Ditto for the work of local Chinese media that struggle to expose provincial misbehavior at great risk.
\
But Xi is shutting down civil society and activist media, isolating himself and his circle. He is failing to take advantage of a growing middle class that could play a critical role in fighting pollution and exposing corruption.
\
In a sense, Pope Francis is daring us to demonstrate that our model is preferable to China's. He is trying to mobilize individuals to join together to work for the common good, and legislators to act responsibly as well.
\
Yet, as he observed in Congress, the discontents and contradictions of U.S. democracy can thwart such efforts. All the more so if legislators make war on all regulations, including those that curb pollution or combat destructive behavior by banks.
\
As if to confirm Francis' analysis, the Republican House speaker, John Boehner - a devout Catholic who had invited the pope to address the joint session - announced his resignation Friday. The conservative Boehner had been hounded by GOP extremists who seek to shut the national government down, yet again - something the speaker opposed.
\
The pontiff has thrown down a challenge for Americans to do better. He urged Congress to ""confront every form of polarization,"" and individual Americans to pursue ""dreams that lead to action.""
\
The difference between Francis and Xi is basic: The pope believes in democracy's endless prospects for renewal by committed individuals and legislators. We have the chance to prove him right or wrong.

145,"President Bush proposed yesterday to slice by 70 percent the levels of three air pollutants from power plants, using strategies heavy on economic incentives and light on regulations.\He also proposed voluntary goals that could slightly slow the increase in greenhouse gas emissions that lead to global warming.\""To clean the air, and to address climate change, we need to recognize that economic growth and environmental protection go hand in hand,"" Bush said. That, he said, is because only affluent societies can afford ""the most environmental protection.""\Democrats and environmental groups generally rejected Bush's ""Clean Skies"" initiative as a step backward that would delay clean-up measures already under way.\The President proposes mandatory national limits on three types of pollution from power plants, but would drop other regulations that apply to power plants and delay their enforcement dates.\Reductions required by 2018 would cut nitrogen oxides, which cause smog, by 67 percent; sulfur dioxide, which produces soot and acid rain, by 73 percent; and mercury, which taints water supplies and fish, by 69 percent.\Bush would allow another pollutant, carbon dioxide, which causes global warming, to grow, but at a rate 4.5 percent slower than projected.\The power plant pollution caps are looser and take effect later than a version the administration presented to the utility industry last fall.\The greenhouse gas goal for 2012, consisting mainly of carbon dioxide, is 40 percent higher than President Clinton's 1997 goal and 30 percent higher than the goal President Bush's father set in 1992.\""It's really a rollback of the Clean Air Act masquerading as a step forward,"" said Frank O'Donnell, executive director of the Clean Air Trust, a Washington environmental group. ""It's very much like what the industry has called for: eliminating current requirements and replacing them with a less restrictive system.""\Bush, business and energy leaders laud the plan for freeing power plants - among the nation's biggest polluters - from intricate regulations. Instead, they would be given pollution limits for each plant. Those that failed to meet the limits would be able to buy pollution credits from plants that exceeded them.\""Instead of the government telling utilities where and how to cut pollution, we will tell them when and how much to cut,"" Bush said, speaking to the Silver Spring, Md., office of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. ""We will give them a firm deadline and let them find the most innovative ways to meet it.""\Congress still must approve Bush's plan.\""It's a very reasoned plan to get to a practical result,"" said Bill Kovacs, environment and energy vice president for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a business lobby in Washington. ""It gives you a lot of incentives [to clean up] faster.""\Kovacs and Bush predicted an active market in pollution credits and noted that a similar ""cap and trade"" system, introduced in 1990 to reduce acid rain, had proven successful and cheap.\""Cap and trade is a wonderful engine,"" said Joseph Goffman, senior lawyer for Environmental Defense, a moderate New York environmental group, but he criticized Bush's cleanup goals as too modest. ""What the President essentially offered is a Ferrari for cleaning up the air, but he's only willing to drive it at 15 m.p.h.""\""The administration may be able to fool the American people that they're doing something, but they can't fool the atmosphere,"" said Dan Becker, a spokesman for the Sierra Club.\Among the critics of the plan was Bush's 2000 campaign opponent, former Vice President Al Gore, who has been sounding the alarm on global warming for more than a decade.\""The United States can and should lead the world to a clean technology future,"" he said in a statement. ""Unfortunately this plan abdicates the responsibility instead of accepting it.""\House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D., Mo.) said both of Bush's proposals ""fall short of the mark.""\""Unfortunately, the administration continues to press for a 19th century energy policy that simply rewards oil, gas and utility special interests,"" Gephardt said.\Sen. John Kerry (D., Mass.) called Bush's plan ""all procrastination and no progress. It may well lead to more pollution, not less.""\On global warming, Bush's plan is entirely voluntary. It is based on tax credits of $4.6 billion over five years. The credits would reward use of solar energy, fuel cells, renewable energy, and hybrid gas-electric cars.\In addition, companies could submit tallies of their greenhouse gas pollution cuts, for which they would be credited in the event of future regulation.\Environmental groups said voluntary programs were not enough.\""You need mandatory caps like you have in the Kyoto Protocol to bring emissions down,"" said Jennifer Morgan, climate change program director for the World Wildlife Fund.\The Kyoto Protocol, which Bush rejected last year as unfair and economically stifling to the United States, set pollution limits that signatories pledged to meet. The U.S. limit would have been 40 percent below Bush's current goal.\Jim Connaughton, chairman of the president's Council on Environmental Quality, said if this voluntary program did not work, the administration would look at other voluntary programs.\Seth Borenstein's e-mail address is sborenstein@krwashington.com.\ \ \ \Credit: By Seth Borenstein INQUIRER WASHINGTON BUREAU"

Some people are climate change skeptics, some take a ""we might as well enjoy it while it lasts"" approach and some are actively working to make meaningful changes to ensure that our beautiful part of the world remains a viable place to live.\And for those who insist that human behavior has nothing whatsoever to do with climate change, so what? Regardless of the causes and the unlikelihood that every scientist in the world will agree on every single point, are we not obligated to leave a livable planet for future generations? Because where else are our grandchildren, and their grandchildren, going to go?\Hank and Linda Pool\Bonita Springs, Fla.\The writers are formerly Pittsburgh residents.\Campaign promise\President Donald Trump's obsession with our southern border is because he made the wall his principal major political issue in getting elected. On countless occasions, before and after his election, he promised it would be built and amazingly made the ridiculous claim that Mexico would pay for it.\As a consequence, we now are in a horrendously harmful and needless government shutdown, all because Mr. Trump desperately needs a wall victory so as to appease and maintain the core supporters of his political base. He knows that, without them, he has little political future.\The plain truth is that we have four borders: Mexico, Canada, the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. The easily accessible public records covering our many years of struggling with illegal imports and illegal immigrants clearly show that most illegal activities involve the ports on these ocean borders. This evidence shows that if a wall was made to totally block our Mexican border, it would hardly make a dent in the illegal traffic coming into our nation.\Our only national emergency today is having a president who is willing to do anything possible to ensure his own political survival, willing even to affect more than 800,000 federal employees with a shutdown.\William McCarthy\West Mifflin\Reducing emissions\Instituting a cap-and-trade pollution system is not, in fact, ""a good place to start"" when it comes to fighting climate change (Jan. 9 editorial, ""Attacking Climate Change""). In fact, it's a total dead end. Such programs - where polluters pay for credits to keep spewing harmful emissions - cannot dramatically reduce emissions in the next decade, which is what scientists warn us is necessary to avoid the worst impacts of the climate crisis.\California's cap-and-trade scheme should not be a model for Pennsylvania.\Pennsylvania needs real climate leadership to push a Green New Deal that moves our state to 100 percent clean renewable energy by 2035 and creates thousands of good-paying jobs in solar, wind and energy efficiency.\Megan McDonough\Elizabeth"

\
Abortion: Roe v. Wade is a flawed decision that must be overturned and, as president, McCain will nominate judges who understand that courts should not be in the business of legislating from the bench. Constitutional balance would be restored by the reversal of Roe v. Wade, returning the abortion question to the individual states. However, the reversal of Roe v. Wade represents only one step in the long path toward ending abortion. Once the question is returned to the states, the fight for life will be one of courage and compassion -- the courage of a pregnant woman to bring her child into the world and the compassion of civil society to meet her needs and those of her newborn baby. The anti-abortion movement has done tremendous work in building and reinforcing the infrastructure of civil society by strengthening faith-based, community, and neighborhood organizations that provide critical services to pregnant women in need. This work must continue and government must find new ways to empower and strengthen these armies of compassion.
\
Education: Public education should be defined as one in which our public support for a child's education follows that child into the school the parent chooses. McCain will fight for the ability of all students to have access to all schools of demonstrated excellence, including their own homes. No Child Left Behind has focused our attention on the realities of how students perform against a common standard. We can no longer accept low standards for some students and high standards for others. Parents should be empowered with school choice to send their children to the school that can best educate them just as many members of Congress do with their own children. He will pursue reforms that address the underlying cultural problems in our education system -- a system that still seeks to avoid genuine accountability and responsibility for producing well-educated children. All federal financial support must be predicated on providing parents the ability to move their children, and the dollars associated with them, from failing schools.
\
Energy: The federal moratorium on drilling in the outer continental shelf stands in the way of energy exploration and production. It is time for the federal government to lift these restrictions and to put our own reserves to use. There is no easier or more direct way to prove to the world that we will no longer be subject to the whims of others than to expand our production capabilities. We should keep more of our dollars here in the U.S., lessen our foreign dependency, increase our domestic supplies and reduce our trade deficit, 41 percent of which is due to oil imports. When people are hurting and struggling to afford gasoline, food and other necessities, common sense requires that we draw upon America's own vast reserves of oil and natural gas. The Outer Continental Shelf alone contains 77 trillion cubic feet of recoverable natural gas.
\
Environment: Establish a market-based system to curb greenhouse gas emissions, mobilize innovative technologies and strengthen the economy. He will work with our international partners to secure our energy future, to create opportunities for American industry and to leave a better future for our children.
\
Health care: Make health care more affordable for all Americans by ensuring that drug companies, doctors, insurance companies, hospitals and every other aspect of the health care system compete vigorously to respond to their needs. Every American should have access to quality and affordable coverage of their choice, including keeping their current coverage. American families -- not government bureaucrats or insurance companies -- should choose the coverage that best meets their needs. All Americans should be able to keep their health insurance as they move from job to job or job to home. Health care quality should be improved by promoting research and development of new treatment models, promoting wellness, investing in technology and empowering Americans with better information on quality.
\
Iraq: It is strategically and morally essential for the United States to support the government of Iraq to become capable of governing itself and safeguarding its people. It would be a grave mistake to leave before al-Qaida in Iraq is defeated and before a competent, trained and capable Iraqi security force is in place and operating effectively. The best way to secure long-term peace and security is to establish a stable, prosperous and democratic state in Iraq that poses no threat to its neighbors and contributes to the defeat of terrorists. When Iraqi forces can safeguard their own country, American troops can return home.
\
Social Security: McCain will fight to save the future of Social Security, and he believes that we might meet our obligations to the retirees of today and the future without raising taxes. He supports supplementing the current Social Security system with personal accounts -- but not as a substitute for addressing benefit promises that cannot be kept.
\
Taxes: Keep the top tax rate at 35 percent, maintain the 15 percent rates on dividends and capital gains and phaseout the Alternative Minimum Tax. Small businesses are the heart of job growth; raising taxes on them hurts every worker. Cut the corporate tax rate from 35 to 25 percent; a lower corporate tax rate is essential to keeping good jobs in the United States. Allow first-year deduction, or ""expensing,"" of equipment and technology investments; American workers need the finest technologies to compete. Establish a permanent tax credit equal to 10 percent of wages spent on research and development. That would simplify the tax code, reward activity in the United States and make us more competitive with other countries.

Job: U.S. senator, lawyer
\
Abortion: Obama understands that abortion is a divisive issue and respects those who disagree with him. However, he has been a consistent champion of reproductive choice and will make preserving women's rights under Roe v. Wade a priority. He opposes any constitutional amendment to overturn the Supreme Court's decision in that case.
\
Education: He would reform No Child Left Behind, which starts by funding the law. Teachers should not be forced to spend the academic year preparing students to fill in bubbles on standardized tests. Double funding for the Federal Charter School Program to support the creation of more successful charter schools to states that improve accountability for charter schools, allow for interventions in struggling charter schools and have a clear process for closing down chronically underperforming charter schools. Support outreach programs like GEAR UP, TRIO and Upward Bound to encourage more young people from low-income families to consider and prepare for college. Create new Teacher Service Scholarships that will cover four years of undergraduate or two years of graduate teacher education, including high-quality alternative programs for mid-career recruits in exchange for teaching for at least four years in a high-need field or location. Streamline the financial aid process for college by eliminating the current federal financial aid application and enabling families to apply simply by checking a box on their tax form, authorizing their tax information to be used and eliminating the need for a separate application.
\
Energy: Provide short-term relief to American families facing pain at the pump; help create 5 million new jobs by strategically investing $150 billion over 10 years to catalyze private efforts to build a clean energy future; within 10 years save more oil than we import from the Middle East and Venezuela combined; put 1 million plug-in hybrid cars, cars that can get up to 150 miles per gallon, on the road by 2015, cars that we will work to make sure are built here in America; ensure 10 percent of our electricity comes from renewable sources by 2012, and 25 percent by 2025; enact a windfall profits tax to provide a $1,000 emergency Energy rebate to American families.
\
Environment: Implement an economy-wide cap-and-trade program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 80 percent by 2050; weatherize 1 million homes annually; develop and deploy clean coal technology; prioritize the construction of the Alaska natural gas pipeline.
\
Health care: Require insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions so all Americans regardless of their health status or history can get comprehensive benefits at fair and stable premiums; create a new small-business health tax credit to help small businesses provide affordable health insurance to their employees; lower costs for businesses by covering a portion of the catastrophic health costs they pay in return for lower premiums for employees; prevent insurers from overcharging doctors for their malpractice insurance and invest in proven strategies to reduce preventable medical errors; make employer contributions more fair by requiring large employers that do not offer coverage or make a meaningful contribution to the cost of quality health coverage for their employees to contribute a percentage of payroll toward the costs of their employees' health care; lower drug costs by allowing the importation of safe medicines from other developed countries, increasing the use of generic drugs in public programs and taking on drug companies that block cheaper generic medicines from the market; cover preventive services, including cancer screenings.
\
Iraq: We must be as careful getting out of Iraq as we were careless getting in. Immediately upon taking office, Obama will give his Secretary of Defense and military commanders a new mission in Iraq: ending the war. The removal of our troops will be responsible and phased, directed by military commanders on the ground and done in consultation with the Iraqi government. Military experts believe we can safely redeploy combat brigades from Iraq at a pace of one to two brigades a month that would remove them in 16 months. That would be the summer of 2010 -- more than seven years after the war began. Under the plan, a residual force will remain in Iraq and in the region to conduct targeted counterterrorism missions against al-Qaida in Iraq and to protect American diplomatic and civilian personnel.
\
Social Security: Ensure Social Security is solvent and viable for the American people, now and in the future -- strongly opposed to privatizing Social Security. And it is not necessary or fair to hardworking seniors to raise the retirement age. As part of a bipartisan plan that would be phased in over many years, ask those making more than $250,000 to contribute a bit more to Social Security to keep it sound.
\
Taxes: Cut taxes for 95 percent of workers and their families with a tax cut of $500 for workers or $1,000 for working couples; provide generous tax cuts for low- and middle-income seniors, homeowners, the uninsured and families sending a child to college or looking to save and accumulate wealth; eliminate capital gains taxes for small businesses, cut corporate taxes for firms that invest and create jobs in the United States and provide tax credits to reduce the cost of health care and to reward investments in innovation; dramatically simplify taxes by consolidating existing tax credits, eliminating the need for millions of senior citizens to file tax forms and enabling as many as 40 million middle-class Americans to do their own taxes in less than five minutes without an accountant.

Abortion: N/A
\
Education: School reform starts by shifting control over education from government to parents. We must abolish the Department of Education, eliminate federal grants and regulations, and begin moving power back to the states and local communities. States should consider tax credits or deductions for parents who home school or send their children to private schools. Public schools should be managed locally, increasing accountability and parental involvement. Parents should have control of and responsibility for the funds expended for their children's education. Ultimately, education will best serve the children of America if it occurs within a competitive private system rather than a government system.
\
Energy: The federal government should eliminate restrictions that inhibit energy production, as well as all special privileges for the production of politically favored fuels, such as ethanol. In particular, Congress should allow the exploration and production of America's abundant domestic resources, including oil in the Outer Continental Shelf and Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and alternative sources such as shale oil.
\
Environment: N/A
\
Health care: Our health care policy should be reformed based on the principle of consumer-oriented health care. Regulations that mandate insurance coverage and inflate premiums should be eliminated. Controls which unduly restrict competition within the health care industry, and that limit access to insurance across state lines, should be ended. Today's health care problems are complex, but the solution is not socialized medicine in any form.
\
Iraq: The invasion and occupation of Iraq were two separate mistakes, which collectively have cost thousands of American lives and hundreds of billions of U.S. taxpayer dollars. Every day that the occupation in Iraq continues without a withdrawal plan is a day that more American blood and treasure (some $400 million a day) is needlessly wasted. ... I would put in place plans for withdrawal without undue delay. While I support an exit from Iraq as quickly as possible, I would not publicly announce a timetable to our adversaries. However, as president, I would begin to immediately and significantly begin to reduce both the military and the economic security blanket we are providing the government.
\
Social Security: N/A
\
Taxes: Tax reform is desperately needed in the United States; but before we can reform the tax code, we must sharply reduce the tax burden on Americans. Meaningful tax reform begins with reining in government spending. Second, we need a tax code that makes taxation fairer and simpler for all citizens. There are several alternative tax reform strategies. One would be to create a flat income tax, while cutting or eliminating many other levies, such as the estate tax (or ""death tax"") and capital gains tax. Another option would be to replace the income tax and payroll taxes with a consumption tax, such as the Fair Tax; but prior to which it would be essential to repeal the Sixteenth Amendment, which allows government to tax the earnings of all hard-working Americans. Initiating a consumption tax while leaving the power to tax income in place inevitably would result in having an income tax on top of a consumption tax.

\
Abortion: Ralph Nader endorses the full 11-point agenda for economic, social and political rights of women advanced by the National Organization for Women. NOW supports access to safe and legal abortion, to effective birth control, to reproductive health and education. We oppose attempts to restrict these rights through legislation, regulation (like the gag rule) or constitutional amendment. NOW supports the right of women to have children, including appropriate prenatal care and quality child care. We oppose government efforts to limit or discourage childbearing, such as family caps and involuntary sterilization.
\
Education: Education is primarily the responsibility of state and local governments. The federal government has a critical supporting role to play in ensuring that all children -- irrespective of the income of their parents, or their race -- are provided with rich learning environments, equal educational opportunities and upgraded and repaired school buildings.
\
Energy: We urge a new clean energy policy that no longer subsidizes entrenched oil, nuclear, electric and coal mining interests -- an energy policy that is efficient, sustainable and environmentally friendly. We need to invest in a diversified energy policy, including renewable energy like wind and other forms of solar power, more efficient automobiles, homes and businesses -- a policy that breaks our addiction to oil, coal and atomic power.
\
Environment: The epidemic of silent environmental violence continues. Whether it is the 65,000 Americans who die every year from air pollution, or the 80,000 estimated annual fatalities from hospital malpractice, or the 100,000 Americans whose demise comes from occupational toxic exposures, or the cruel environmental racism where the poor and their often asthmatic children live in pollution sinks located near toxic hot spots (that are never situated in the suburbs), preventable, harmful situations abound.
\
Health care: The state of health care in the United States is a disgrace. For millions of Americans it is a struggle between life, health and money. The Nader Campaign supports a single-payer health care plan that replaces for-profit, investor-owned health care and removes the private health insurance industry (full Medicare for all).
\
Iraq: The current political strategy of pre-emptive war in the Middle East is a disaster for both the American people and the people of the Middle East. It has bloated the already wasteful military budget and has cost at present more than 4,000 American lives, nearly 100,000 American injuries and more than a million Iraqi civilian lives, plus the destruction of their country. Nader/Gonzalez propose a rapid withdrawal of troops from Iraq. A target of withdrawing troops in six months would be set.
\
Social Security: N/A
\
Taxes: The complexity and distortions of the federal tax code produces distributions of tax incidence and payroll tax burdens that are skewed in favor of the wealthy and the corporations further garnished by tax shelters, insufficient enforcement and other avoidances.

148,"A federal appeals court yesterday threw out a major component of the Bush administration's effort to reduce unhealthy levels of soot and smog in Eastern and Midwestern states, a decision that environmental groups worry will delay action on air pollution well into the next administration.\A three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled unanimously that the Environmental Protection Agency had overstepped its authority in instituting a rule that would have established a cap-and-trade system for soot and smog.\The court ruling came on the same day that the administration said it would take no steps under the Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming, even though the EPA formally announced that it would seek public comment on the issue. The Clean Air Interstate Rule, or CAIR, rejected by the appeals court does not apply to greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, which is produced by burning fossil fuels.\The interstate rule represented the Bush administration's most aggressive action to clean the air over the next two decades. The EPA estimated that the rule would help prevent 17,000 premature deaths and reduce levels of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides by as much as 70 percent by 2025. An unusual alliance of power companies and environmental groups supported the measure.\But the three-judge panel found that the EPA had committed ""more than several fatal flaws"" in creating the measure, which was challenged by several power companies and North Carolina for contrasting reasons.\""No amount of tinkering with the rule or revising of the explanations will transform CAIR, as written, into an acceptable rule,"" according to the unanimous 60-page opinion issued by the D.C. circuit's Chief Judge David B. Sentelle, and Judges Judith W. Rogers and Janice Rogers Brown.\EPA Administrator Stephen L. Johnson said in a conference call with reporters: ""We are extremely disappointed in the court's decision because it's overturning one of the most protective [air pollution] rules in our nation's history. ... We'll wait and see what our next steps are.""\Environmental groups said the decision will delay efforts to reduce harmful air pollution and leave tough decisions to be made by the next president and Congress. ""This is probably the biggest air-quality setback ever suffered by the EPA under any administration,"" said John Walke, clean air director and senior attorney for the National Resources Defense Council, an advocacy group.\Lawmakers who support tougher air pollution standards said the decision should help their efforts to pass legislation addressing the problem.\The interstate rule was one of the Bush administration's signature air-pollution policies. It would have required 28 states and the District of Columbia to make reductions in emissions of nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide from power plants.\It took a regional approach to the issue and established a cap-and-trade system that would have allowed utilities to sell and buy pollution credits as long as total industry emissions remained below a pre-set cap.\While several environmental groups criticized the rule for not setting more aggressive pollution limits, they nevertheless welcomed the measure, saying they thought it was the best they could expect from the Bush administration.\Many power companies also supported the rule because it was not as costly as some proposals pending in Congress. Even North Carolina-based Duke Energy, which was one of the power companies that challenged the rule, said in a statement that it did not intend to have it overturned.\William M. Bumpers, an attorney with Baker Botts LLP, said most of the 20 or more electric-generating companies that his firm represents supported the rule. Some have made large investments to upgrade their coal-fired plants, assuming the rule would remain.\""This is a trainwreck for the EPA, and it's a trainwreck for the environment,"" Mr. Bumpers said.\But not all power companies supported the EPA's action. Several, led by Duke Energy Corp. and Florida Power & Light Co., filed court challenges, arguing that the EPA did not have the legal right to establish its plan, and that it had set pollution limits arbitrarily.\North Carolina attacked the plan from a different angle, saying the program was not tough enough, because utilities would be allowed to pollute more by buying credits.\In agreeing with many of those arguments, the judges said the EPA's regional cap system was ""fundamentally flawed,"" because it had not set any state-specific emissions requirements."
149,"
I was feeling so smug the other morning.
\
Down in the basement, I was draping wet socks over a rack, hanging T-shirts from a line and flopping jeans over a bar.
\
The clothes dryer - that energy hog! - was empty. Except for laundry emergencies, it's been that way for months.
\
And, really, it hasn't been so bad, stiff towels notwithstanding.
\
But that night, when I got home, I paused at the top of the basement steps.
\
Ack! I'd left the lights on all day.
\
Since becoming The Inquirer's environment reporter two years ago, I've been trying to take it easy on the Earth, reduce my carbon footprint, lessen my impact.
\
Today, I'm beginning a new column to chronicle these adventures in green-land and write about other people's attempts to do the same thing.I'll be an eco-explorer, trying new technologies and techniques to figure out how a greener lifestyle works; indeed, whether it works. How big a difference can one person make? Is it worth it? At what point does it shift from ecologically correct to patently absurd?
\
The condition of our environment is the sum of millions of decisions made every day by governments, corporations and, yes, individuals.
\
Perhaps like no other time in history, our understanding of the planet is changing. Around even the family dinner table - not just the halls of science - we debate scary concepts such as climate change. We know that oil is finite.
\
Government treaties and emerging technologies aside, many people are taking matters into their own hands. They're not just changing light bulbs and carrying canvas bags to the grocery. They're wearing bamboo and buying plug-in hybrids that get 100 miles a gallon.
\
A recent survey by the international polling firm GlobeScan found that 76 percent of Americans say they are willing to make ""significant"" changes in the way they live to help prevent climate change.
\
I didn't need to consult GlobeScan. I just talked to my cousin Betsy.
\
She never struck me as an eco-activist, but one day recently as I was popping another of her panko-encrusted artichoke hearts into my mouth, she started talking about recycling.
\
Turns out she's kind of fanatic, crushing cereal boxes to put out with the newspapers, wadding up dry-cleaner bags to stick in the plastics bin at the grocery store.
\
Within a week, I'd re-analyzed and mined our trash, too. How come I thought the lining on my cat-food cans made them unsuitable for recycling? Why didn't I know you have to take the caps off plastic bottles? (Basically, it's so the bottles will empty, and it makes them easier to crush.) These days I'm squinting at every plastic container, looking for the recycling symbol.
\
Betsy was an inspiration, and others seem to be cropping up everywhere. My husband, Bob, a metal artist, met a guy for business, and they wound up talking about how his family no longer runs single errands. They've set a three-errand minimum. It saves on gas and auto emissions.
\
So far, my own efforts have been, by turns, both easy and difficult, simple and confusing. Clearly, living green is anything but black and white.
\
We turned down our water heater - although we're not sure by how much; there are no numbers on the dial. Every evening, solar lights I've planted in the yard to illuminate the path at night begin to glow. Table scraps are stewing in the compost pile.
\
The ecological to-do list keeps growing even as, sure enough, our electric bill has shrunk, down about 20 percent.
\
Some things, however, are too much to ask. Yes, burning charcoal spews particulates into the air. But crispy, smoky chicken thighs straight off the grill are among life's great pleasures.
\
At least I've found a local source for poultry. This helps meet my goal to eat and drink more from our local ""foodshed."" I decided to try this after learning that the average bite of food travels about 1,300 miles before descending the final few feet down our gullets.
\
Some claim they've been able to live off whatever they can get within, say, a 100-mile radius. But I think I've figured out a way to get what I want and still be a green player.
\
I want a version of industry's cap-and-trade so I can continue to consume things I'd otherwise have to give up. For every basket of tomatoes from our not-quite-organic garden just 50 feet away, can I get mileage credits toward Florida oranges? Colombian coffee? Kentucky bourbon?
\
The downside to the foodshed initiative is we recently spent an entire Saturday morning driving around to purchase local cheese, yogurt, fruit. I have a Prius, but still, I don't know which is easier on the environment - local food or less driving.
\
Obviously, this lifestyle can eat up time - from hanging my laundry to growing my green beans.
\
Convenience is seductive.
\
Last summer, for a big picnic, I bought plastic cutlery and disposable plates. It was a great party, but by the end I had a trash bag as big as a St. Bernard. The plastic will outlive everyone there.
\
I felt a twinge of guilt, but it sure was nice to spend the rest of the evening rocking on the porch. Instead of washing dishes, we listened to the crickets.

150,"Due to newsroom front-end system production difficulties the entire text could not be electronically captured for the online archive, please see microfilm or pdf for the complete graphic.\ It wasn't really in it for the money.\ The Lancaster County Solid Waste Management Authority's primary objective was to prevent a greenhouse gas from escaping into the atmosphere, where it would cause global warming.\ The authority had agreed to contribute $1.4 million to the environmental project -- a collaboration with PPL Corp. of Allentown to turn methane into electricity -- under the assumption that its methane sales to PPL would return a mere $50,000 or so a year.\ So imagine authority Executive Director Jim Warner's surprise when, at an industry trade show last year, he stumbled upon a booth with information about the Chicago Climate Exchange. This is what he found out:\ Under the voluntary cap-and-trade program, the project would also earn environmental credits. The credits would be worth $300,0000- $350,000 a year on the exchange.\ ""An unexpected windfall -- that's what we're getting here,"" Warner said.\ Instead of taking nearly three decades to recoup its initial investment, the authority could break even in less than four years. After that, profits could be passed on to Lancaster residents in the form of defrayed garbage disposal fees.\ The other benefits of the methane-to-electricity project at the Frey Farm Landfill in Lancaster County include:\ The generation of 3.2 megawatts of electricity, or\ enough for roughly 3,000 homes.\ The production of steam, used by the nearby Turkey Hill dairy to sanitize equipment. It accounts for 85 percent of the dairy's thermal needs -- saving 240,000 gallons of diesel fuel annually.\ In January, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency named the Frey Farm Landfill ""project of the year.""\ The honor has attracted national attention to the otherwise nondescript landfill. It is to be featured in an upcoming edition of Popular Science magazine.\ The Frey Farm Landfill includes construction debris, yard waste and household garbage. On a recent day, a flock of seagulls had descended onto the dump in search of nourishment. The birds poked their beaks into the muck and pulled out scraps.\ Methane is a natural by-product of the decomposition of organic material. But it's also a highly potent greenhouse gas -- 21 times more so than the carbon dioxide in automobile exhaust.\ The landfill produces 6,400 tons of methane a year. The gas used to rise to the surface and escape into the air. Now it's captured in 86 underground wells and channeled, via 20,000 feet of pipe, to PPL's on-site generation plant. There, two massive, yellow Caterpillar engines, each housed in its own trailer-sized shed, convert the clean-burning fuel into electricity.\ The environmental impact is the equivalent of removing 45,000 cars from the road, according to PPL.\ ""The problem with global warming is so large that every possible reduction needs to be done. And what's great about this reduction is that it makes great economic sense,"" said John Hangar, president of the PennFuture environmental group. ""That's a lesson that policy makers and citizens still need to be taught.""\ After a year of planning and preparation, methane-to-electricity conversion got underway the Frey Farm Landfill in January of 2006.\ Since October, the Lancaster County Solid Waste Management Authority has earned $140,000 by selling environmental credits on the Chicago Climate Exchange. (The cap-and-trade program, established in 2003, allows energy companies and manufacturers that emit greenhouse gases to buy credits from entities, such as the Frey Farm Landfill, that have taken steps to reduce pollution. In this way, polluters can offset their damage to the environment -- which the corporate world is under increasing pressure to do.)\ For its part, PPL brought in $650,000 in electricity and steam sales in 2006. At that rate, it will make back its $6.5 million to the project in 10 years.\ Under Pennsylvania's Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards act, which took effect in 2004, the company benefits in another way, as well. It earns ""green"" credits that it would otherwise have to buy to meet its obligation to the state; it amounts to an annual savings of $100,000.\ ""We're doing these projects because it's the right thing to do,"" said Steve Gabrielle, a business development manager in PPL's Energy Services division. ""There's also a return on the investment for shareholders.""\ sam.kennedy@mcall.com\ 610-820-6517"
151,"While recent months have seen a global contraction in both debt and equity markets, at least one financial market has been booming this year, a market that scarcely existed five years ago.\The global market for ""carbon trading"" grew 36 percent between January and September, to $84 billion from $67 billion, according to New Energy Finance, a London-based company that tracks activity in energy markets. By year's end, the market is expected to surpass $100 billion. \But what is carbon trading? \To begin with, carbon trading does not mean trading carbon. What is being traded are credits for greenhouse gases, with carbon dioxide being first among them. \Here's how the trading works: \In its most basic form, a carbon market consists of participants who agree to a baseline for carbon emissions. Say that two companies each have a manufacturing plant that emits 10 tons of carbon during the course of a year. As members of the market, they agree to reduce their emissions by 10 percent, to 9 tons of carbon. ""Company A"" has more cash on hand and begins retooling its plant. In two years, it manages to reduce its emissions, not to 9 tons, but to 8.5 tons. Company A then receives a credit for the amount by which it exceeded the required reduction, or one-half a ton. \Company B, meanwhile, not being as flush with cash as Company A, is moving more slowly than its counterpart. At the end of two years, it has reduced the emissions at its plant to 9.5 tons, a half-ton more than the agreement allows. It is still working toward that 9-ton mark, but in the meantime, it can bring itself into compliance by buying Company A's half-ton credit. Company A has made money, Company B has gained breathing room to continue its retooling, and the overall goal, average emissions of 9 tons per member, has been achieved. \The primary U.S. marketplace for carbon trading is the Chicago Climate Exchange, launched in December 2003 by Richard Sandor, the economist and entrepreneur widely credited with creating financial futures. The instrument of exchange is the CCX Carbon Financial Instrument, or CFI. Each CFI represents 100 metric tons of carbon dioxide, or its equivalent (the market includes five other greenhouse gases: methane, nitrous oxide, sulfur hexafluorides, perfluorocarbons and hydrofluorocarbons). \The exchange has some 350 members, including more than 10 percent of the Fortune 100 and eight cities, Mr. Sandor said. Members make a legally binding agreement to reduce their emissions from year 2000 levels. \""In 2006, they were supposed to have reached a 4-percent reduction, but they have actually reduced them by 11 percent,"" Mr. Sandor said. The reduction in industrial emissions, 180 million tons, approximates the yearly emissions of France and Belgium combined, he added. \Robinson-based CNX Gas joined the exchange last year. The company has registered 8.4 million metric tons of emission offsets with CCX, arising from its coalbed methane capture project in Buchanan County, Va. The offsets represent methane captured there between 2003 and 2007. \The value of the offsets fluctuates. In May, vintage 2003 CFIs -- ""vintage"" is an indicator of the year in which the emission-reducing activity occurred -- traded for more than $7 per metric ton. Yesterday's closing price was $1.40. \CNX has not yet traded any of its offsets (which it lists as a no-cost asset on its balance sheet), adopting a wait-and-see stance until after the election. \""Future prices are likely very dependent on the next administration and where it stands on the climate change issue,"" said spokeswoman Laural Ziemba. ""If the country is going to implement a cap-and-trade system, similar to what's happened in Europe, then the price of the credits could increase."" \Bayer AG joined the exchange in June 2003 as one of its first 20 members. David Schnelzer, manager of health environment safety and security governance for Bayer Corp., the company's Robinson-based U.S. subsidiary, said Bayer already had ""a very comprehensive broad environmental issues program"" when it joined the CCX. Over the next three years, he said, Bayer expects to spend more than $1.5 billion on climate-related research and projects. \The company agreed to a four-year contract, which it renewed for another four years in 2007. Like CNX Gas, ""We have not bought or sold a single credit."" Mr. Schnelzer said, viewing its participation more as a learning exercise and a way of preparing for the future. \""We thought this was a good opportunity to get in early on the trading scheme,"" he said, ""and to formalize the manner in which we collect data and use that data."" \Carbon trading is not without its critics. Some say that it is just a shell game that allows excessive polluters to burnish their reputations without changing their ways. A recent Wall Street Journal article described how some landfills have earned and sold credits for capturing methane -- something that they were already doing in order to sell the gas as a fuel. \Still, New Energy projected that the carbon market would continue to grow -- to $500 billion by 2012, and $3 trillion by 2020. \Underlying that prediction is a growing embrace of carbon trading, not only by more companies, but by more government leaders. In February 2007, the governors of Arizona, California, New Mexico, Orgeon and Washington signed off on the Western Regional Climate Action Initiative, a pledge ""to collaborate in identifying, evaluating and implementing ways to reduce GHG emissions in our states."" \They have since been joined by the governors of Montana and Utah, and the premiers of British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec. The focus of the initiative is the development of a market-based cap-and-trade system similar to CCX, with the additional muscle of government behind it. \Closer to home, 10 Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states have joined forces to create the nation's first mandatory carbon trading system, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont have each established state regulations requiring power companies to reduce their carbon dioxide emissions by 10 percent by 2018. Under the initiative, credits generated in any state can be traded in any other member state."
152,"WASHINGTON -- Opening the door to possible broad new federal regulation on U.S. power plants, heavy industry and automobiles, the Obama administration yesterday officially declared that greenhouse gases produced by burning coal and oil are a danger to public health.\""Look at the droughts, the flooding, the changes in diseases, the changes in migratory habits, the changes in our water cycle and climate that we now find affect human health and welfare,"" Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lisa P. Jackson said in announcing its ""endangerment finding.""\The finding is a key step in a legal process that would allow the EPA to act on its own authority -- without further action by Congress -- to develop tough rules for emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases that scientists blame for global warming.\The finding is also the latest step in the Obama administration's carrot-and-stick strategy for keeping pressure on Congress to approve a comprehensive climate bill, while at the same time giving the president an alternative approach if the legislation bogs down. For political and other reasons, the White House has said repeatedly that it would prefer to deal with the complex and emotion-charged issue through congressional action.\Climate legislation would effect a broad swath of the U.S. economy and could raise consumer prices and manufacturing costs in at least some areas. It faces formidable opposition from business groups, Republican lawmakers and some Democrats. The challenge of passing a bill is all the greater at a time when Congress is preoccupied with the even-more-controversial health care overhaul, and when voters seem more concerned about jobs and the economy than about long-term climate change.\As a result, President Barack Obama, who made action on global warming a signature promise during last year's presidential campaign, has also moved forward on the alternative track: direct administrative action by the EPA. And, coming on the eve of Mr. Obama's trip to the climate summit in Copenhagen, the endangerment announcement gives the White House something positive to point to in the absence of congressional action.\At the same time, even with yesterday's announcement, the White House has not committed itself to pushing ahead with the regulatory process even if climate legislation bogs down.\Criticism of the EPA announcement came quickly.\Republican Tennessee Sen. Lamar Alexander, chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, said, ""The elected Congress, not an administrative agency, should write the laws governing the economy's response to climate change. The costs of compliance with the EPA's unilateral announcement today could run into hundreds of billions of dollars a year -- costs borne by average Americans through huge increases in their electric bills and at the gas pump. This is an especially bad idea when unemployment is at 10 percent,"" he said.\Jeff Holmstead, EPA air administrator for President George W. Bush's administration, expressed concern that new paperwork requirements would bring new construction ""to a standstill."" He added, ""If the agency's eventual regulatory approach is mishandled, it could result in profound consequences for the economy, with little environmental benefit to show for it.""\Climate legislation is also strongly opposed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, though its stand has drawn criticism from some prominent members.\Some analysts say complying with new emissions regulations would be much more expensive than using the ""cap-and-trade"" provision in the climate bill. The cap-and-trade system, under which companies could buy and trade permits to cover gases they release, is intended to minimize costs to emitters. Major emitters could use permits to spread the cost of reducing emissions over time. If the EPA imposes rules, companies would likely have to move more quickly to make costly changes in their operations.\Ms. Jackson yesterday said the EPA finding was not intended to pressure Congress, and that legislation is still the best way to address climate pollution and move toward clean energy.\Even so, she said, ""I do not believe this is an 'either-or' proposition. I actually see this as a 'both-and.' I believe the Clean Air Act can complement legislative efforts.\But the long-anticipated announcement upped the ante for the administration and the Democrats, especially since it came on the eve of Obama's departure for a global climate summit in Copenhagen.\Ms. Jackson said the administration ""will not ignore science or the law any longer,"" and that the EPA was ""obligated"" to take steps to reduce greenhouse pollutants under the Clean Air Act. She said the EPA move was meant to ""complement"" a comprehensive clean-energy reform, and that the administration still planned to work with Congress to get a climate-change bill to the president's desk.\""The vast body of evidence not only remains unassailable, it's grown stronger, and it points to one conclusion,"" she said. ""Greenhouse gases from human activity are increasing at unprecedented rates, and are adversely affecting our environment and threatening our health.""\White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said the announcement's timing, on the first day of the Copenhagen summit, was coincidence. ""This is part of a process that started more than two years ago,"" he said, ""with a Supreme Court finding that the EPA should regulate greenhouse gases that threaten the public health because it's a pollutant.""\Indeed, the administration has had the power to step up regulations since 2007, when the Supreme Court held that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are pollutants subject to regulation under the Clean Air Act."
153,"WASHINGTON --While introducing her climate change bill Wednesday, Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., told a cheering crowd in front of the U.S. Capitol, ""We have expanded our coalition in the business community.""\In Pennsylvania, that coalition includes businesses that stand to benefit, such as energy-efficient windows manufacturer Serious Materials and wind turbine maker Gamesa.\But heavy industry concerns in Western Pennsylvania, including U.S. Steel, Alcoa and Consol Energy, expressed varying degrees of dismay and fear last week at what the Clean Energy Jobs and American Power Act could mean for their businesses -- and for energy consumers.\The bill, similar to House of Representatives legislation that narrowly passed in June, sets aggressive deadlines for greenhouse gas reductions and creates a cap-and-trade system in which a price is set to emit carbon above a certain level and the right to do so is traded in a newly created market for big polluters.\The result, according to foes of the bill, will be higher energy prices and job losses when utilities scale back because of increased costs.\""You run the risk of having a lot of major coal-fired power plants shut down,"" said Tom Hoffman, spokesman for Cecil-based coal producer Consol Energy.\But in the long run, argue environmentalists and officials with ""green jobs"" companies, energy costs will come down and jobs will be created in areas of renewable energy and efficiency that cannot be outsourced. In addition, the act could create momentum for a global consensus to reduce emissions and, perhaps, stave off global warming. And by spending less on foreign oil, they contend, the United States will reduce funding to potential enemies.\""This bill is the first of many steps toward a cleaner, healthier, safer world,"" said Adam Garber, an organizer for PennEnvironment.\A crucial detail to be filled in as the bill proceeds through Environment and Public Works, Finance and other committees, is how carbon offsets -- or emissions-reduction credits -- will be doled out in the cap-and-trade market.\Aluminum maker Alcoa also would like to see more guidance on how carbon payments would be phased in, and more concessions for companies that compete internationally.\Alcoa is a member of the United States Climate Action Partnership, a group of 30 companies and environmental organizations that lobbies for greenhouse-gas reductions coupled with protections for the economy. The group includes the National Resources Defense Council, as well as Ford Motor Co. and DuPont.\Lee Califf, a Washington-based lobbyist for Alcoa, said USCAP's lobbying efforts will focus on getting language in the bill to address ""carbon leakage"" -- in which emissions reductions in one nation result in increases elsewhere because production is moved. Mr. Califf said the House bill, through issuing free carbon rebates for certain industries, does this well. \Kate Jackson, senior vice president and chief technology officer of nuclear producer Westinghouse Electric, in an e-mailed statement, did not endorse or reject the Senate climate bill -- which promotes nuclear power in an apparent attempt to woo Republicans. In pitching support for the industry, Dr. Jackson noted that nuclear power provides 75 percent of the country's carbon-free energy.\Dr. Jackson wrote that legislation should address the need for more nuclear plants, as well as increases in power output and life span of existing plants, which are heavily regulated now. The Kerry-Boxer bill pledges a reduction in regulatory barriers to expansion of the nuclear industry.\Requests for comment from U.S. Steel were referred to the American Iron and Steel Institute, a trade association. In a news release Wednesday, it called the bill a disappointment.\""If we don't get climate legislation right, we'll harm the U.S. economy, outsource our manufacturing to China and see global emissions increase -- the exact opposite of the goals of climate policy,"" AISI president Thomas J. Gibson said in a release.\Consol jump-started its lobbying efforts last year and is continuing on a similar pace this year, having spent nearly $2 million through June to lobby on climate change, the stimulus package and the union card-check bill.\Mr. Hoffman said Consol is not against reducing emissions, but the company believes the aggressive emissions requirements -- a 20 percent reduction by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050 -- would sink the coal industry.\Consol has invested considerable funds to research technology that would capture carbon emissions from smokestacks and store them underground, but large-scale implementation of that technology is years away. \In March, Serious Materials reopened a shuttered plant in Vandergrift to make high-tech, energy-efficient windows. The company could expand considerably with passage of this legislation, which mandates stronger energy efficiency standards.\Vice President for Projects and Policy Robin Roy said the legislation would spur Serious Materials to ""promote investment and keep hiring. It gives confidence that there is a will to address this issue.""\Mr. Roy said the company would like to see stronger efficiency standards and incentives in the bill. This year, in its first foray into federal lobbying, California-based Serious Materials has spent $20,000.\Wind turbine manufacturer Gamesa, which employs 800 workers at plants in Ebensburg, Cambria County, and Fairless Hills, Bucks County, also would benefit from increased investment in energy sources that won't carry a carbon tax.\""The market depends on regulatory certainty,"" said Michael Peck, director of external relations. ""When investors see that usage for renewable energy is guaranteed and a defined price of carbon, [they start] putting their money on the table.""\The environmental lobby is increasingly turning to an economic argument to sway legislators. Repower Pennsylvania, a grassroots lobbying subsidiary of the Alliance for Climate Protection, pointed to a study released last month by the Center for American Progress showing that Pennsylvania would gain 72,000 green jobs within two years if the federal government invested $150 billion in efficiency and renewable energy. The pending legislation includes some of those ideas.\But economic benefits could be outweighed by the decline of fossil fuels.\The National Association of Manufacturers and the American Council for Capital Formation commissioned a study of the House bill that foretold losses of 71,500 to 97,500 jobs in Pennsylvania by 2030 as heavy industry struggles with higher costs and sends jobs to overseas markets where there are no pollution caps.\If a measure similar to the Boxer-Kerry bill becomes law, it will constitute a revolution in how Americans produce and use energy. But that's a big if, especially with a simultaneous battle on health care reform going on in both chambers and lobbyists and interest groups swarming lawmakers."
154,"Oil prices flirting with $100 a barrel, warnings of climate change and holiday road trips fueled by gas topping $3 a gallon are combining to give energy issues unprecedented prominence in the presidential campaign.\""The bottom line for us, we're happy everybody is talking about it,"" said David Willett, national press secretary for the Sierra Club. ""Even in '04, while there was a clear difference between the candidates, it wasn't really a campaign issue.""\The Republicans, with notable exceptions, have concentrated on the dangers to the nation's strategic and economic security of relying on energy from the Middle East.\The Democrats, while embracing those same arguments, have placed much greater emphasis on the threat of global warming.\""The positions the leading Democratic candidates have advanced are, for the most part, very thoughtful, very much at the strong end of realistic,"" said Manik Roy, director of congressional affairs for the Pew Center on Global Climate change. ""I'm not seeing as much from the Republican candidates.""\A New York Times survey of likely caucus and primary voters in Iowa and New Hampshire, for example, found that Democrats were significantly more likely to cite the environment as a primary issue in choosing a candidate. Mr. Roy emphasized, however, that Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona stood out from the GOP field in his emphasis on global warming.\Mr. Roy pointed to the senator's work with Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., in pushing, unsuccessfully so far, for legislation that would cap the overall levels of greenhouse gas emissions in tandem with a system in which emitters could buy and sell permits authorizing the release of different levels of the targeted pollutants.\""He completely changed the dialogue in the Senate, and, to a certain, extent, in the House,"" Mr. Roy said.\Variations of the cap-and trade proposal are also central to the energy plans offered by the leading Democratic candidates. They also tend to favor greater or complete reliance on an auction system for distributing the emission permits, as opposed to one in which certain industries, such as existing coal-fired plants, are granted some level of emission allowance by the government.\Sens. Hillary Rodham Clinton, D-N.Y. and Barack Obama, D-Ill. and former Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina would use part of the proceeds of the cap-and-trade auction to fund research on advances in renewable energy, clean-coal technology and similar efforts. The leading Democrats also propose to fund energy research by curtailing a variety of tax breaks for major oil companies.\Sen. Christopher J. Dodd, D-Conn., stands out among the candidates for his call for a broader carbon tax on corporations of all kinds. Despite their generalized calls for conservation, none of the candidates has supported significantly higher fuel taxes, along the European model, to hold down consumption.\Alternative energy\The politics of climate change have produced what once would have been considered strange bedfellows. With the exception of U.S. Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, who calls for a gradual phase-out of both nuclear and coal-fired plants, all of the candidates at least acknowledge the need for nuclear power as part of the nation's energy future, a position that once would have been anathema to Democratic primary voters.\""When you look at their comments in general, particularly the leaders, they realize that nuclear has to play a significant role,"" said Mitch Singer, a spokesman for the Nuclear Power Institute, an industry lobbying group. ""These are not dumb people. They are aware of the fact that the demand for energy is expected to grow by 40 percent by 2030.""\The Democrats' difficulty with the implications of nuclear power generation were evident, however, at their debate in mid-month in Las Vegas. The candidates were united in their opposition to the opening of a federal facility for storing spent nuclear fuel at Nevada's Yucca Mountain, undeterred by the fact that several of them had supported the facility in the past. And despite their opposition to that site and their grudging support for expansion of the plants that produce the highly toxic waste, no Democrat has offered an alternative for the spent fuel storage.\Auto standards\For Detroit, the Democratic proposals include both carrots and sticks. There is general agreement on the need for mandating increases in fuel economy standards for automobiles. Mrs. Clinton, for example, has called for an increase to an average of 55 miles per gallon by 2030; Mr. Edwards, 40 miles-per-gallon by 2016.\But, along with other Democrats including Mr. Obama, they have also proposed multi-billion dollar aid packages for the auto industry to help it research new technologies and retool factories to produce cleaner cars. The auto industry is also one of the prime beneficiaries of a fund Mrs. Clinton has proposed separately to help pay for the ""legacy costs"" of retiree health care benefits.\As they troll for votes in Iowa, the candidates form a united chorus of support for the use of ethanol.\Most of the candidates of both parties have also called for spending on research for clean-coal technology, including the capture and sequestration of carbon dioxide emissions. Mr. Edwards, for example, while the recipient of an enthusiastic endorsement of the United Mineworkers of America, has taken a hard line on new coal plants that do not capture greenhouse gases.\A UMW spokesman said the union's decision to back the ex-senator came in part because he has put forth what is, in the union's view, the most specific plans for research on coal's future.\Touting their foreign policy credentials, Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico and Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., are among the Democrats calling for a renewed and more vigorous American role in international agreements to curb the release of greenhouse gases.\GOP cool on warming\Global warming in particular and energy in general have played a relatively less prominent role in the GOP nomination battle, a tendency reflected in the candidates' Web sites. While most of the Democratic candidates offer fairly detailed energy plans, the Republicans' debate, and their Web sites, have more abbreviated, broad-brush proposals.\In his standard stump speech, however, Mr. McCain regularly cites the ""devastating"" consequences of global warming and faults the Bush administration for being slow to respond to the issue. Some other Republican candidates, most notably former Sen. Fred D. Thompson of Tennessee, and U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, have been skeptical about the science behind assertions of global warming.\Others, such as former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts and former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, are agnostic on the scientific debate, but support energy conservation and research for security reasons.\Mr. Huckabee pledges that his administration would achieve energy independence by the end of his second term. Mr. Romney offers a general everything-should-be-on-the table approach, endorsing research on a broad array of renewable energy, nuclear and fossil fuel sources. Former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York has similarly called for an ""Apollo project"" to diversify the nation's energy sources, including nuclear, renewable sources and clean coal technologies.\In keeping with his libertarian philosophy, Mr. Paul opposes any significant energy role for the government, arguing that free markets will find a better path to the nation's energy future."
155,"When President George W. Bush delivered his 2006 State of the Union address, some observers were struck by his declaration that America was ""addicted to oil.""\After all, ""addiction"" typically carries the implication that the addictive substance is inherently bad. It also can imply the addict is a victim or lacks willpower.\""It makes it seems as if the consumer has the means to discontinue using gas or oil, as if the responsibility were solely in our hands,"" said Deborah S. Bosley, an associate professor at the University of North Carolina Charlotte and a member of the board of directors for the Center for Plain Language in Washington, D.C.\""I could quit using heroin, but could I quite using gasoline? Not likely.""\Welcome to the rhetoric of energy, in which a commodity is spoken of like a drug, geographical designations become pejoratives and new phrases gain currency without ever being clearly defined.\""Words are chosen because of political and economic agendas,"" Ms. Bosley said.\There's evidence that the way in which issues are framed influences how people think about them, said Michael Wagner, assistant professor in political science at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. \""A lot of times something happens in the world, and then the frame that gets discussed the most seems to be one of crisis.""\The 1973 Arab oil embargo provided such a crisis, and President Richard Nixon responded with a call for a new national goal: ""By the end of this decade, we will have developed the potential to meet our own energy needs without depending on any foreign energy sources.""\In announcing his Project Independence, Mr. Nixon unveiled a matched pair of rhetorical swords still being wielded today.\The first is the use of ""foreign"" as a pejorative. The word ""foreign"" simply means that something is not produced domestically, but calls for a reduction in foreign oil often are linked with phrases such as ""nations that would do us harm.""\Such a description might not apply to the leading source of imported oil, Canada. Or to second-place Mexico. While the U.S. government is regularly at odds with third-place Venezuela, that country is generally not viewed as a threat.\""'Foreign' is code for the Middle East,"" Ms. Bosley said. \""Language is code because words always mean more than they appear to mean,"" she said. ""The minute you put 'Middle East' in there, then it evokes visions of terrorists.""\The fact that the leading Middle Eastern supplier of oil, Saudi Arabia, is only fourth among foreign suppliers ""takes a lot of steam out of the issue of our dependency on the Middle East,"" she said.\Mr. Nixon's second gift to energy rhetoric is the term ""independence"" as the overarching goal of national energy policy.\While Americans may respond well to the word ""independence,"" energy independence is not an entirely realistic idea or premise to start with, said Alison Taylor, director of government affairs-environment, Siemens Corp.\Even if one assumes energy independence as a goal, descriptions about the paths toward that goal differ.\""Energy policy can be tilted three ways,"" said John C. Wohlstetter, a fellow at the Discovery Institute, a conservative think tank.\""'Security' would end imports from unfriendly countries who spend petrodollars in ways harmful to our national interest. 'Efficiency' stresses lowest economic cost, which perpetuates sending dollars to such countries but keeps lowest cost in a very weak economy. 'Clean' energy focuses on environmental concerns, such as clean air, water and climate change.""\President Barack Obama's tilt may be guessed from the title of a bill that he wants to see passed, ""The American Clean Energy and Security Act.""\One provision of the House bill, introduced by Democrats Henry Waxman, of California, and Edward Markey, of Massachusetts, is the establishment of a ""cap-and-trade"" regime for greenhouse gases.\Ms. Bosley described ""cap-and-trade"" as ""an interesting phrase, because it sounds very playful in a way. \""It's almost like I'm gonna trade marbles or I'm gonna trade stories.""\Opponents to the plan want to change the language about it.\A year ago, Washington Post columnist Robert J. Samuelson said, ""Let's call it by its proper name: cap-and-tax."" Republicans now use that phrase to describe the Waxman-Markey bill but it has not gained widespread currency. Which illustrates one of the great challenges of contemporary politics: to find language that resonates with voters.\When voters are unsure about what they want, the challenge grows.\""People have conflicting views, right?"" said Mr. Wagner. ""They would love to have cars with great gas mileage ... so long as they have as big a car as they want.\""I don't know that the debate that energy policymakers have is doing a good job of helping people to sift through those values.""\One term that has gained currency is ""green,"" a word that Ms. Bosley said, has now been sort of co-opted and applied to everything.\The problem, Ms. Taylor said, is that there's not a great definition of ""green"" out there.\The U.S. Green Building Council has gone to great lengths to define criteria for awarding certifications for ""green"" buildings, but in many other areas such criteria remain vague or entirely absent.\Businesspeople have struggled for decades to craft messages that combat the image of business as environmentally dirty.\Ms. Taylor acknowledged industry seems to be losing the battle of perceptions in at least one arena: namely, regarding the efforts to either contain or reduce emissions produced in mining or burning coal, by using ""clean coal technology.""\The Reality Coalition, a consortium of environmental groups, has lampooned the concept of clean coal technology with satirical ads that share the tag line, ""In reality, there's no such thing as clean coal.""\""If we tried to run an ad to explain to the world the technology behind 'clean coal,' it would bore everybody to death and wouldn't do any good,"" Ms. Taylor said. ""I think at the moment the campaign against coal and the campaign against clean coal is winning out.""\Beyond that, she sees signs of hope for a consensus between businesspeople and environmentalists. \Over the past three or four years, she said, ""They've been more willing to talk to each other, which is a new phenomenon, given that they usually talk to each other on the courthouse steps.""\One result of that new conversation is the emergence of a word that may trump ""green"" in shaping policy. \""A lot of these groups talk commonly about sustainability,"" she said, an idea that goes beyond short-term strategies, even green ones, to take a long-term view.\For instance, she said, ""Part of our sustainability plan is looking at education opportunities, how to bring future generations into energy education.""\In an April 22 speech on energy, Mr. Obama spoke, predictably, of ""reducing our dependence on foreign oil"" and ""energy independence."" But he also upped the ante by referring to ""the next energy revolution,"" ""a new era of energy exploration"" and ""a new, clean energy economy,"" phrases that go beyond independence or security to evoke one of his primary campaign themes, newness.\The conclusion of the speech was nearly utopian:\""That can be our legacy. A legacy of vehicles powered by clean renewable energy traveling past newly opened factories; of burgeoning industries employing millions of Americans in the work of protecting our planet; of an economy exporting the energy of the future -- instead of importing the energy of the past; of a nation once again leading the world to meet the challenges of our time.""\Even Mr. Obama's eloquence may be outmatched by a culture in which voters choose to take in only news that reinforces what they already believe, Mr. Wagner said.\""It's harder and harder for presidents in the modern era to affect public opinion,"" he said."

They also tend to favor greater or complete reliance on an auction system for distributing the emission permits, as opposed to one in which certain industries, such as existing coal-fired plants, are granted some level of emission allowance by the government.\Sens. Hillary Rodham Clinton, D-N.Y. and Barack Obama, D-Ill. and former Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina would use part of the proceeds of the cap-and-trade auction to fund research on advances in renewable energy, clean-coal technology and similar efforts. The leading Democrats also propose to fund energy research by curtailing a variety of tax breaks for major oil companies.\Sen. Christopher J. Dodd, D-Conn., stands out among the candidates for his call for a broader carbon tax on corporations of all kinds. Despite their generalized calls for conservation, none of the candidates has supported significantly higher fuel taxes, along the European model, to hold down consumption.\Alternative energy\The politics of climate change have produced what once would have been considered strange bedfellows. With the exception of U.S. Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, who calls for a gradual phase-out of both nuclear and coal-fired plants, all of the candidates at least acknowledge the need for nuclear power as part of the nation's energy future, a position that once would have been anathema to Democratic primary voters.\""When you look at their comments in general, particularly the leaders, they realize that nuclear has to play a significant role,"" said Mitch Singer, a spokesman for the Nuclear Power Institute, an industry lobbying group. ""These are not dumb people. They are aware of the fact that the demand for energy is expected to grow by 40 percent by 2030.""\The Democrats' difficulty with the implications of nuclear power generation were evident, however, at their debate in mid-month in Las Vegas. The candidates were united in their opposition to the opening of a federal facility for storing spent nuclear fuel at Nevada's Yucca Mountain, undeterred by the fact that several of them had supported the facility in the past. And despite their opposition to that site, and their at least grudging support for expansion of the plants that produce the highly toxic waste, no Democrat has offered an alternative for the spent fuel storage.\So far, at least, the Yucca Mountain facility has not emerged as an issue in the Republican race.\For Detroit, the Democratic proposals include both carrots and sticks. There is general agreement on the need for mandating increases in fuel economy standards for automobiles. Mrs. Clinton, for example, has called for an increase to an average of 55 miles per gallon by 2030; Mr. Edwards, 40 miles-per-gallon by 2016.\But, along with other Democrats including Mr. Obama, they have also proposed multi-billion dollar aid packages for the auto industry to help it research new technologies and retool factories to produce cleaner cars. The auto industry is also one of the prime potential beneficiaries of a fund Mrs. Clinton has proposed separately to help pay for the ""legacy costs"" of retiree health care benefits.\As they troll for votes in Iowa, the candidates form a united chorus of support for the use of ethanol. Several of their Web sites cite the virtues of increasing production of the fuel, both from corn and from other natural sources such as switch grass.\Most of the candidates of both parties have also called for spending on research for clean-coal technology, including the capture and sequestration of carbon dioxide emissions. Mr. Edwards, for example, while the recipient of an enthusiastic endorsement of the United Mineworkers of America, has taken a hard line on new coal plants that do not capture greenhouse gases.\A UMW spokesman said the union's decision to back the ex-senator came in part because he has put forth what is, in the union's view, the most specific plans for research on coal's future.\Touting their foreign policy credentials, Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico and Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., are among the Democrats calling for a renewed and more vigorous American role in international agreements to curb the release of greenhouse gases.\GOP cool on warming\Global warming in particular and energy in general have played a relatively less prominent role in the GOP nomination battle, a tendency reflected in the candidates' Web sites. While most of the Democratic candidates offer fairly detailed energy plans, the Republicans' debate, and their Web sites, have more abbreviated, broad brush proposals.\In his standard stump speech, however, Mr. McCain regularly cites the ""devastating"" consequences of global warming and faults the Bush administration for being slow to respond to the issue. Some other Republican candidates, most notably former Sen. Fred D. Thompson of Tennessee, and U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, have been skeptical about the science behind assertions of global warming.\Others, such as former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts and former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, are agnostic on the scientific debate, but support energy conservation and research for security reasons.\Mr. Huckabee pledges that his administration would achieve energy independence by the end of his second term. Mr. Romney offers a general everything-should-be-on-the table approach, endorsing research on a broad array of renewable energy, nuclear and fossil fuel sources. Former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York has similarly called for an ""Apollo project"" to diversify the nation's energy sources, including nuclear, renewable sources and clean coal technologies.\In keeping with his libertarian philosophy, Mr. Paul opposes any significant energy role for the government, arguing that free markets will find a better path to the nation's energy future."
157,"For once, says Pat Toomey, the political planets and stars have aligned in a year of protest brushfires he thinks could yet send him to the U.S. Senate seat deprived him six years ago.\The then-and-now of the quest to unseat Arlen Specter is a study in political tectonics.\""Obviously, it's a profoundly different race. It's a different environment,"" said Mr. Toomey, who gave up a seat in Congress to chase Mr. Specter in the 2006 Republican primary. Mr. Toomey narrowly lost amid a last-minute gush of spending by Mr. Specter, who enjoyed the backing of the Republican establishment.\Today, Mr. Toomey, a youthful 48, conservative Republican, has a seemingly clear field -- to say nothing of the backing of the same Republican establishment that Mr. Specter abandoned last year when he changed sides and became the Senate's newest Democrat.\Polls have suggested that a Specter-Toomey rematch in the general election would be a statistical dead heat. In fact, Mr. Specter must fight his way through a Democratic primary. Where Mr. Toomey once attacked from the right, Democratic U.S. Rep. Joe Sestak is charging at Mr. Specter from the middle-left.\Either way that primary turns out, Mr. Toomey gives little indication that there will be any fine-tuning of his political creed. In his three terms in Congress -- which ended when he kept a first-term pledge to serve only six consecutive years -- he has been almost monochromatic in his views. He is a socially conservative free-marketeer whose abiding desire is to slash spending wherever he finds it. Period.\Not so, he said, with Democrats seeking the nomination. Republican primary opponent Peg Luksik of Johnstown is a strong anti-abortion candidate.\""(The Democrats) both supported all the bailouts of the failing banks and car companies. They both supported government takeover of health care, they both supported cap and trade, which would be devastating for our economy, they both supported card check, which would deny workers a secret ballot,"" Mr. Toomey said.\Cap and trade, designed to essentially penalize companies for carbon emissions, is likely to become a campaign issue in Pennsylvania's coal-rich west. Card-check, more conventionally known as the Employee Free Choice Act, would ease the way for work forces to unionize based on a majority of employees signing cards endorsing a union, foregoing often contentious and, so say many organizers, intimidating election fights financed by union-resistant companies.\Health care reform -- what Mr. Toomey calls the ""government takeover of health care"" -- is likely to be an issue in his childhood home in East Providence, R.I., where his father, the elder Patrick Toomey, resides. The elder Toomey, said his son, supported health care reform.\""My father's the man in the world that I admire the most, but we just don't agree on politics,"" said Mr. Toomey.\Mr. Toomey's political singularity has long stood out, among fellow Republicans and in his own family. He was the third of six children born to an electrical lineman. The elder Toomey was, and from all accounts remains, a New Deal Democrat.\Young Patrick Toomey was a precocious student, winning a scholarship to LaSalle Academy, a private, Catholic school where he excelled and won admission to Harvard University.\It was at Harvard where Mr. Toomey received his political awakening. Fitting in neither with the wealthy, upper-class blue bloods who attended as a birthright, nor the earnestly fashionable left that fit into Harvard Square's bustle, Mr. Toomey found himself a Reagan conservative.\""I didn't just walk into Harvard carrying those views,"" he said. The change came as he watched Ronald Reagan take power in a Washington paralyzed by malaise and inflation, remaking the political map and, in the process, realigning much of American politics.\The so-called Reagan Democrats began to emerge at the same time the nation's industrial base withered and new businesses and new business models emerged.\Among them was the financial services sector, and it was there that Patrick Toomey first established himself.\He began as an investment banker with New York-based Chemical Bank before moving on to a vice president's title, and paycheck, at another investment firm.\Mr. Toomey became an expert at currency rate ""swaps,"" a tricky system by which international businesses hedged their financial risks.\But a year in Hong Kong left him looking for a return to the United States. Unwilling to go back to Manhattan, he connected with two of his brothers and the trio mapped out a strategy to open a restaurant-discotheque. As businessmen will do, they researched the market for openings.\Up came Allentown, Lehigh County, Pennsylvania.\It was there that the Toomey brothers opened the first of what would become a series of restaurants. Pat joined the local Chamber of Commerce and began connecting with people like Kim Snyder.\The pairing would have seemed unlikely. By then, Mr. Toomey was a foursquare opponent of government spending. Mr. Snyder was sent to town to run a local contracting firm that specialized in public road contracts.\""I just clicked with the guy,"" said Mr. Snyder. ""He's just so strong a man of principle and character. He's just a good guy. He's very smart. He's very intellectual. But he's a very warm individual. He's warm, he's got a good sense of humor. He has a lot of humanity.""\He also had an ambition. When Paul McHale, a moderate Democrat who represented the 15th Congressional District, decided to retire, Mr. Toomey, who had previously been elected to the local planning board, decided to run for Congress.\The district is largely Democratic in registration by an edge roughly the same as the Democrat-to-Republican ratio statewide.\He continued to hold onto that seat with widening victory margins in the two subsequent elections.\That success in running against the political tide in his district is explained, said one Toomey friend, by strength of personality. People like Pat Toomey despite politics, said Dave Zinczenko, an executive with Rodale Press.\""What's cool about Pat is that he doesn't have that typical politician career arc,"" said Mr. Zinczenko. ""You admire Pat because he's a great friend, he's a hard worker, he's a great family man.""\That voter enthusiasm did not always extend to the House Republican leadership, which often found itself at odds with the conservative member over his sometimes intractable stand on federal spending bills.\""I thought Republicans were spending too much money, that earmarks were being abused, were extremely excessive,"" Mr. Toomey said. ""When I felt it was necessary, I would go down to the House floor and try to rein in those excesses and that would sometimes cause problems with my fellow Republicans.""\His fiscal conservatism was not always matched by social conservatism, Mr. Toomey acknowledged.\He changed views on abortion during his first term, a transformation he regards as natural after marrying during his campaign and later having children.\""I've been very upfront about this,"" he said. ""While I was serving in Congress around my first term, my views on abortion changed. They changed in the sense that when I first ran I was not comfortable with a prohibition on abortion in the first trimester.""\That switch, from the standard first set by Roe v. Wade to a call for an outright ban except for cases of rape, incest and the life of the mother, played well with conservative Republicans disaffected by Mr. Specter, a longstanding abortion rights advocate.\Mr. Toomey ran with the backing of the conservative Club for Growth, and generated statewide buzz that failed to carry him through in the primary battle.\""The vast majority of people didn't think I had a chance of beating him,"" Mr. Toomey said. ""The conventional wisdom was that my prospects were very, very slim.""\This week, one poll suggested Mr. Toomey might hold a slight lead over Mr. Specter -- who is now facing his own primary contest.\Moreover, Mr. Toomey now enjoys a new, if somewhat inchoate, ally in the form of an angry mob. The tea party movement, a nebulous assortment of angry conservatives unhappy with everything from federal taxes to the health care reform bill, is now regarded as fertile ground for conservative candidates.\Even Republicans from the party's center, such as gubernatorial hopeful Tom Corbett, have begun to turn out at tea party events.\""There's a tremendous energy and passion and it's ordinary Americans,"" said Mr. Toomey. ""They see a government that is spinning out of control in Washington, bailing out failing companies, spending on a staggering level we will be unable to maintain.""\Should that mood hold fast, Mr. Toomey is hoping that what conventional intra-party politics was unable to do for him six years ago, a growing number of disaffected citizens will do for him this time."

Other than health care reform, the Democratic candidates for the 17th Congressional District agreed on most things Monday evening during a debate hosted by The Republican-Herald and the Orwigsburg Free Public Library at the Sovereign Majestic Theater in Pottsville.
\
Harrisburg attorney Sheila Dow Ford slammed U.S. Rep Holden, D-17, for voting against health care reform legislation, calling it a lack of leadership.
\
Holden defended his position on the health care bill and pointed to the benefits his district has enjoyed because of his seniority on the House transportation and agricultural committees.
\
Dow Ford is trying to take the Democratic nomination for the district away from 18-year incumbent Holden in the May 18 Primary Election. The 17th District includes Schuylkill, Lebanon and Dauphin counties and parts of Perry and Berks counties.
\
Questions put to the candidate were based on those submitted by readers of The Republican-Herald and republicanherald.com. Republican-Herald reporters Ben Wolfgang and Dustin Pangonis asked the questions, which were displayed on a PowerPoint presentation behind the candidates.
\
Monday's debate was open to the public and admission was free. Tickets were distributed by lottery and more than 180 people attended the event, which lasted an hour and 10 minutes.
\
What is your position on health care reform and why?
\
""I believe that bill was robbing Peter to pay Paul,"" Holden, who voted against health care reform, said.
\
He said the bill cuts Medicaid services and he has been informed it will still boost the cost of Medicaid by $350 million. Moreover, the reform bill imposes taxes on current insurance plans, something he said organized labor asked him to oppose.
\
Holden said he believed there was a definite need for reform but it should have been done incrementally, citing outlawing discrimination on the basis of a previous condition, closing the Medicare doughnut hole for senior citizens and allowing the sale of insurance of across state lines.
\
Dow Ford said organized labor actually asked Holden to support the bill.
\
""I would have voted for that bill,"" she said. ""Do I think it was perfect? No, but I think is was a good start. That bill was 40 years in the making .""
\
She criticized Holden for missing the call of history and not showing leadership. As an example of the reform's benefits, she referred to a 70-year-old woman from the district who previously had to go back to work to pay for her prescription medicine, but because of the reform, the woman will now ""get a check in the mail"" to cover her prescriptions.
\
What steps will you take to fight unemployment in the 17th District?
\
Dow Ford said that of all of Pennsylvania's Congressional Districts, the 17th has been hardest hit in job losses over the last few decades.
\
She said she believes the Federal Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 has done much to help depressed areas, but more needs to be done.
\
""We need to look at trade policy,"" she said. ""We import too much.""
\
Referring to the building of distribution centers across the region, she said, ""We need to send something back"" to balance trade.
\
She said more investment is needed in manufacturing, infrastructure and green technology.
\
Holden is also a believer in infrastructure jobs, highways and transportation, which he said his seniority in Congress has helped gain for the state through federal spending.
\
He pointed out that, should he be re-elected, he will still be on the House Transportation Committee as it prepares the next highway bill.
\
""I will be in the room when they write that bill,"" he said. The bill could be in excess of $9 billion and through his influence, he would see that it brought ""thousands and thousands of jobs to Pennsylvania.""
\
Do you believe the welfare system needs to be restructured?
\
""The federal government has a responsibility to give people an opportunity to lift someone up,"" Holden said.
\
He said that means job training and ""the tools to get back on their feet in this economy.""
\
Holden said he was glad to vote for welfare reform under President Bill Clinton.
\
""Here's the problem,"" Dow Ford said. ""Yes, he did sign the Welfare Reform Act ... But there has been significant slippage since then. More people are on welfare than in many, many years.""
\
She blamed this on a disconnect between education and job training, and the work that is available. As an example, she said the president of the United Steel Workers union told her recently that he had trouble fulfilling a request for 20 welders.
\
What role do you think the federal government should play in education?
\
""Some say local control is sacrosanct,"" Dow Ford said. However, although she believes local control is important, since the federal government is spending an ever larger amount on education, she believes the role of the national government is therefore greater as well.
\
""What we need is a national set of standards in science, math, English, because we need to have a well-educated workforce.""
\
She called for more initiatives that are ""well-funded and well-managed that make the connection between inputs and outputs.""
\
Holden said ""the federal government has a responsibility to make a significant contribution to education. However, it should not ""micro-manage it.""
\
He said President George W. Bush's No Child Left Behind initiative has been a failure that forces teachers to ""teach to the test"" while the federal government has not paid out the money it promised in imposing the regulations.
\
Holden also stressed the need for a well-educated workforce for the nation to compete on a global scale.
\
To what extent should the government support energy projects such as wind and clean coal?
\
Holden called for a ""multi-pronged"" attack on the nation's energy problems, including the development of solar and wind power as well as domestic oil supplies and the drilling for gas in the Marcellus Shale.
\
Moreover, ""We have more recoverable coal in this country than the world has recoverable oil."" Holden said if the technology exists to put a man on the moon, then it must be possible to sequester carbon, a process needed to make the use of coal cleaner.
\
Holden reminded the audience of his efforts to procure federal funding for a coal-to-gas plant in Schuylkill County and blamed bureaucrats in the Bush and Obama administrations for holding up the project.
\
Dow Ford said she agrees with Holden on alternate energy but she faulted him for the failure of Schuylkill County industrialist John W. Rich Jr. plans to build a coal to oil plant in the county to materialize. She said in spite of all the tax money that was allocated for ""The Rich Debacle"" to bring thousands of jobs to the area ""That contract has gone now ... and it's not coming back.""
\
She also called for an extraction tax on gas drilling in the Marcellus Shale and called it ""shameful"" that many of the people employed in the new industry are not from the state.
\
What is your position on global warming?
\
Dow Ford believes global warming ""is a serious concern for the United States."" She said she would support cap and trade measures in Congress.
\
She said that the U.S. needs to be a leader in protecting the environment because ""America is just one portion of the globe"" and has had 100 years to develop like Third World countries are doing now.
\
Holden did not vote for cap and trade ""because it would have been devastating to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and to Schuylkill County.""
\
He said that such measures would put the U.S. at a disadvantage and that, on a recent trip to India, a developing country, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton was told ""forget it"" regarding restrictions on carbon emissions, Holden said.
\
What is your position on immigration law and enforcement?
\
""If it is illegal, it is illegal,"" Holden said. ""If someone is here illegally, they should be detained and deported.""
\
Holden said he has voted for stronger border control as a Congressman and hounded immigration authorities for a month until they raided the construction site of a Wal-Mart Distribution Center in Highridge Business Park near Gordon, where in November 2005, 120 illegal immigrants were arrested.
\
He said he wants stronger enforcement of existing laws, no amnesty for violators and stronger border security.
\
Dow Ford said she agreed with Holden and called illegal immigration a threat to American jobs and homeland security but said, ""We need to be reasonable.""
\
The one exception she made for strict enforcement is for illegal immigrants who have been in the country for ""generations."" During his closing statement, Holden pointed out this is a factual error as anyone born on U.S. soil gains citizenship.
\
Dow Ford also said she wants to companies to be held accountable.
\
""Too often we turn a blind eye to those companies that have decided they need cheap labor,"" she said.
\
Do you support military engagement to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons?
\
Both candidates said they supported the use of military force against the spread nuclear arms, referred to Iran as a threat and Israel as a valuable ally and bastion of democracy in the Middle East.
\
The candidates were also asked about Afghanistan. Holden said the Afghanistan issue might have been more quickly solved if the same effort had been applied to it as had been to Iraq. Dow Ford said the Afghanistan-Pakistan border is the place where efforts need to be focused.
\
When asked about term limits, both candidates said term limits already exist because incumbents must be re-elected.
\
Holden has faced no primary challenges since he ran for Congress in 1992. From 1994 to 2007, Dow Ford was senior vice president and chief counsel to the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency. In 2007, she started Dow/Ford Strategies, a public policy consulting firm.
\
Holden was Schuylkill County sheriff from 1985 to 1993, before which he was a sergeant-at-arms and a probation officer. In 2002, he confounded political wisdom after his district was redrawn to favor the GOP. Holden ousted long-time Republican incumbent George Gekas due in part to his support in Schuylkill County.
\
Holden is a member of the conservative Blue Dog Democrats coalition. Dow Ford has taken issue with Holden's conservatism.
\
Meanwhile, this year, a Holden supporter challenged Dow Ford's ballot petitions in court but lost.

Holden has faced no primary challenges since he ran for Congress in 1992. From 1994 to 2007, Dow Ford was senior vice president and chief counsel to the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency. In 2007, she started Dow/Ford Strategies, a public policy consulting firm.
\
Holden was Schuylkill County sheriff from 1985 to 1993, before which he was a sergeant-at-arms and a probation officer. In 2002, he confounded political wisdom after his district was redrawn to favor the GOP. Holden ousted long-time Republican incumbent George Gekas due in part to his support in Schuylkill County.
\
Holden is a member of the conservative Blue Dog Democrats coalition. Dow Ford has taken issue with Holden's conservatism.
\
Meanwhile, this year, a Holden supporter challenged Dow Ford's ballot petitions in court but lost.

160,"Last month, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the American Clean Energy and Security Act, a clean-energy bill that will strengthen national security, decrease our nation's reliance on imported fuels and reduce global warming in a mature, balanced and reasonable approach. As a Pittsburgh area resident and as the vice president of sustainability and environment, health and safety for Alcoa Inc., I would like to thank U.S. Rep. Mike Doyle for voting for the bill. \Over the past few months I have had the opportunity to speak with a number of U.S. congressmen, including Mike Doyle, on climate-change legislation. Rep. Doyle has provided strong leadership in formulating a balanced approach to greenhouse-gas emission reduction in this legislation. He clearly understood the need for America to provide global leadership on this issue, but to do so in a manner that supports our economy and preserves industrial competitiveness. \Alcoa, as a founding member of the United States Climate Action Partnership, favors the enactment of legislation that will slow, stop and reverse the growth of greenhouse-gas emissions over the shortest time reasonably achievable. Alcoa has supported a cap-and-trade program that ensures both economic and environmental success. \Alcoa has voluntarily reduced its own greenhouse gas emissions by 36 percent from a 1990 base and understands the importance of effective global action on this issue. \Thank you, Mr. Doyle and your colleagues, for voting for the American Clean Energy and Security Act.\BILL O'ROURKE \Vice President \Sustainability and Environment, Health and Safety \Alcoa Inc. \North Shore"

162,"""My reading of history convinces me that most bad government results from too much government."" -- Thomas Jefferson.\In the blink of an eye, President Obama and an unfettered Democratic Congress have transformed America from a land of unlimited possibilities to one of limited economic and individual freedom.\The most recent example is passage of the Cap and Trade legislation in the House. This is the largest tax increase in history in the name of preserving the planet. Without carbon restrictions by China, India and others it does nothing for the environment. However, it will empower politicians to distribute the billions in taxes generated to favored constituents, providing them with another re-election tool. The bottom line: no change in the environment and a crippled American economy.\We are allowing the federal government to control more and more of our economy -- government-owned banks, automobile companies and mortgage companies.

163,"With the U.S. Senate considering several climate bills and an international forum on climate change convening next week, Pennsylvania Republican Sen. Arlen Specter has been touting his own bill to reduce greenhouse gases, a tour that brought him to Pittsburgh yesterday.\He visited the Siemens Stationary Fuel Cells plant in Churchill -- a subsidiary of Germany's Siemans AG that has been researching the conversion of coal into synthetic natural gas, which can be used to efficiently produce electricity.\Last month, he visited a power plant east of Harrisburg and touched on some of the same themes he discussed yesterday: namely, that the reduction of industrial carbon emissions is key to healing the environment and curbing global warming.\Promoting fuel-cell technology, and the researchers who nurture the technology to commercial viability, is an important part of the proposed ""Low Carbon Economy"" act, a piece of legislation being sponsored by Mr. Specter and Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M. The legislation has the support of some major electrical companies, as well as the AFL-CIO and the United Mine Workers of America.\The bill, introduced in the summer, would set a national, mandatory cap on greenhouse emissions, allowing businesses with lower emissions to sell ""credits"" to facilities with larger carbon emissions. The goal is to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions to ""avoid the problems of air pollution"" and the ""very imminent threat of global warming,"" he said yesterday.\Mr. Specter's bill would try to reduce carbon emissions to 2006 levels by 2020 and to 1990 levels by 2030, via the caps and research-and-development funding provided under the bill. Still, there are several competing bills -- the leading one, sponsored by Sens. Joe Lieberman and John Warner, has made it out of subcommittee and could be up for a Senate vote in 2008.\But handicappers have said that an alliance of political opponents, industry lobbyists and environmental groups that think the bills don't go far enough could ruin the chances of any climate bill emerging from the 110th Congress. Further, President Bush has not signaled support of carbon caps.\Meanwhile, critics say Mr. Specter's proposal is flawed -- some prefer outright carbon taxes to the ""cap-and-trade"" method. Others note the Bingaman-Specter bill contains a provision that allows companies to buy an unlimited number of $12-per-ton emission credits directly from the federal government, instead of from companies that operate more efficiently. That could cancel out the mandatory caps, but Mr. Specter and proponents note that the proceeds from selling the credits would go to fuel and energy technology research.\Rep. Tim Murphy, R-Upper St. Clair, echoed Mr. Specter yesterday in his opinion that Congress has done too little for too long on the issue of greenhouse gases.\""Whether you're concerned about the condition of the planet, or the condition of one's wallet,"" he said, referring to high gas and energy prices, ""we're in a situation where other nations, such as China, open up a new coal-fired power plant every day with no scrubbers, [no] equipment on it to clean the air.""\It's time to be responsible stewards of the environment while also crafting a bill that attracts the support of energy firms, manufacturers and coal producers, Mr. Murphy said.\Mr. Specter's tour of Siemens came just a week before representatives from a number of nations are set to convene in Indonesia for a United Nations conference on climate change, pollution and greenhouse gases."
164,"What problems can the United States solve with renewable energy?\Four years ago, both presidential candidates acknowledged the threat of climate change and endorsed vigorous policies to move away from fossil fuels. The nation seemed on the verge of committing to greenhouse-gas reductions and developing alternative-energy technologies. Since then, most Republican leaders have become skeptical about global warming and now oppose any major policy response.\Democrats, including President Barack Obama, have stopped talking about the subject. Their energy proposals now target lower costs, energy security and job creation from domestic production. That doesn't mean they no longer worry about climate change; they just decided it would be politically infeasible to adopt greenhouse-gas policies directly. Instead, they are betting they can push the climate agenda indirectly, by focusing on renewable energy as the solution to other problems.\It's a bad bet and likely to backfire. We need to invest in renewable energy, but not because it would be a good way to address energy security, affordability or unemployment.\Domestic coal is cheap and plentiful, and likely to remain so for centuries. Natural gas is more abundant by the month. With new drilling technologies, there probably is enough moderately priced domestic gas to last for decades.\Similar new techniques are even improving U.S. oil production. More than half of the oil we use is now produced domestically and that share is likely to rise over the next decade. \Sure, the cost of low-carbon energy technologies -- wind, solar, biofuels and others -- is coming down. But improvements in technologies for extracting fossil fuels are making it harder for renewables to reach cost parity. Scientific breakthroughs are hard to predict: Still, the most likely scenario is that domestically produced fossil fuels will be the lowest-cost way to meet most of our energy needs and achieve greater energy security for years to come.\The employment argument also falls short. During a recession, it makes sense for the government to promote job creation with subsidies and federal expenditures, some of which may be targeted at specific industries. In the longer run, however, economists are almost unanimous that the economy creates more and better jobs when companies operate in the most cost-effective way. If we don't count the cost of environmental damage, that's likely to mean carbon-based energy for generations.\Some politicians argue that the government should invest in alternative energy because it's the next economic frontier. The evidence doesn't suggest such initiatives build a sustainable industry. In Spain, renewables took off during the last decade, but the industry crumbled in 2009 when subsidies were halted during the country's fiscal crunch. Germany made a big push in solar photovoltaic technology with subsidies more than five times the cost of conventional power generation, and manufacturing of PV systems exploded. Then China got into solar-panel production and German firms' share of domestic PV sales fell to 27 percent in 2010, from 77 percent in 2008.\The only compelling argument for policies to boost renewables and reduce fossil fuels is the environment. The vast majority of climate scientists believe that carbon-dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels are the primary cause of climate change. Most believe there is a real risk that the changes could cause major ecosystem disruptions, including more frequent droughts, floods, hurricanes and wildfires, as well as rising sea levels, more conflicts over resources and accelerated species extinction.\Economists of all political persuasions agree that the free market, by itself, won't address unregulated emissions that damage the environment. Government policy is necessary and the most efficient policy is pricing those emissions. By doing so, we give incentives to develop all possible solutions: solar, wind, biofuels, nuclear power, improved energy efficiency and even capturing emissions from power plants and sequestering them underground.\Those incentives, however, should be even-handed, not the patchwork of mandates, subsidies and tax breaks for favored technologies that we have today. Pricing greenhouse gases helps all low-carbon alternatives without putting a thumb on the scale.\If conservatives continue to reject carbon pricing -- even though cap and trade was the brainchild of mainstream Republicans -- then subsidizing green power is probably the best option. It is a more costly way to rein in greenhouse gases, as I explain in recent research. But if similar subsidies for all low-carbon technologies maintain a level playing field, such an exchange is still likely to be a major step in fighting climate change.\Those market incentives need to be augmented by support for the scientific research that will discover the next generation of low-carbon technologies. \What once was bipartisan agreement on the need to reduce greenhouse gases has been recast as a political food fight. Advocates of renewable energy feel cornered by the gridlock in Congress and waning interest in climate change. But arguing that renewable energy is the best way to address economic or security concerns isn't the way to prevail. It just focuses the debate on issues where fossil fuels are almost sure to win."

Well, so much for our daffodils! They all bloomed in our front yard last week. They now form a nice bright yellow cluster at the bottom of our driveway. Temperatures of 65 degrees in Washington in January will do that. Frankly, daffodils in January do brighten up the lawn. Maybe next year we'll try for roses in February.
\
Don't know about you, but when I see things in nature that I've never seen in my life, like daffodils blooming in January, it starts to feel creepy, like a ""Twilight Zone"" segment. I half expect to wake one day and find Rod Serling mowing my lawn -- in shorts.
\
Why not? Last December was the fourth warmest on record, and 2006 was the hottest year in America since 1895. It was declared the hottest in Britain since 1659.
\
Even the White House seems to have noticed. Al Hubbard, the president's economic adviser, says Bush will soon unveil an energy independence strategy that will produce ""headlines above the fold that will knock your socks off."" Since everything the president has done on energy up to now has left my socks firmly in place, I will be eager to hear what Bush says.
\
Neither the White House nor the Democratic Party seems to grasp that the public and business community are miles ahead of them on this energy/environment issue. The presidential candidate who finally figures that out, though -- and comes up with a compelling energy/environment agenda -- is going to have a real leg up in 2008.
\
What would be compelling? I used to think it would be a ""Manhattan Project"" on energy. I don't any longer. I've learned that there is no magic bullet for reducing our dependence on oil and emissions of greenhouse gases -- and politicians who call for one are usually just trying to avoid asking for sacrifice today.
\
The right rallying call is for a ""Green New Deal."" The New Deal was not built on a magic bullet, but on a broad range of programs and industrial projects to revitalize America. Ditto for an energy New Deal. If we are to turn the tide on climate change and end our oil addiction, we need more of everything: solar, wind, hydro, ethanol, biodiesel, clean coal and nuclear power -- and conservation.
\
It takes a Green New Deal because to nurture all of these technologies to a point that they really scale would be a huge industrial project. If you have put a windmill in your yard or some solar panels on your roof, bless your heart. But we will only green the world when we change the very nature of the electricity grid -- moving it away from dirty coal or oil to clean coal and renewables. And that is a huge industrial project -- much bigger than anyone has told you. Finally, like the New Deal, if we undertake the green version, it has the potential to create a whole new clean power industry to spur our economy into the 21st century.
\
To spark a Green New Deal today requires getting two things right: government regulations and prices. Look at California. By setting steadily higher standards for the energy efficiency of buildings and appliances -- and creating incentives for utilities to work with consumers to use less power -- California has held its per-capita electricity use constant for 30 years, while the rest of the nation has seen per-capita electricity use increase by nearly 50 percent, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council. That has saved California from building 24 giant power plants.
\
Had Ronald Reagan not rolled back the higher fuel efficiency standards imposed on Detroit, we might need no Middle East oil today. High standards force innovation, and innovation leads to conservation at scale.
\
But prices also matter. I don't care whether it is a federal gasoline tax, carbon tax, BTU tax or cap-and-trade system, power utilities, factories and car owners have to be required to pay the real and full cost to society of the carbon they put into the atmosphere. And higher costs for fossil fuels make more costly clean alternatives more competitive.
\
""The regulated utilities are the most important consumers from the perspective of long-term investment, and if they are not required to value carbon reduction then they will under-invest in energy efficiency and renewable energy,"" Peter Darbee, chairman of Pacific Gas and Electric, said to me.
\
This isn't rocket science. Government standards matter. They drive innovation and efficiency. And prices matter. They drive more and cleaner energy choices. So when the president unveils his energy proposals, if they don't call for higher efficiency standards and higher prices for fossil fuels -- take your socks off yourself. It's going to get hot around here.

"
166,"In a Dec. 29 op-ed column, ""Scientific evidence builds to counter global warming,"" John Brinson stated, over-simplistically, that one fact can undo a consensus. So, then, can one fact undo the undoing of a consensus? If so, here is a fact from a recent article in the same journal (International Journal of Climatology) that Brinson and others have turned to in order to try to discredit the scientific consensus on anthropogenic global warming (AGW): ""There is likely to be an influence of enhanced greenhouse gas concentrations on (southeastern Australia's) climate, at least on temperature."" (B.F. Murphy and B. Timbal, ""A review of recent climate variability and climate change in southeastern Australia"").\Science doesn't work this way. As Andrew Revkin, environmental writer for The New York Times, said so well, individual studies, or even collections of studies, are not what's important. It's the ""trajectory of understanding"" that's important. This trajectory is produced through the accumulated scientific knowledge generated by testing, supporting, or refuting alternative hypotheses (i.e., true scientific debate), and then building on these findings to develop, test, support or refute new hypotheses. As Mr. Revkin (correctly) stated, ""The trajectory of understanding is clear and has been building for more than 100 years: more carbon dioxide (and other heat-trapping gases) = warmer world = less ice = higher seas (and lots of shifting climate patterns).""\I think Mr. Brinson also misrepresented what happened at the U.N.-sponsord climate talks in Bali. He stated, ""But, the nations of the world refused to commit to CO2 reductions because the consequences to their economies would have been truly disastrous. Perhaps the scientific evidence that man-made global warming does not exist somehow sneaked into the conference.""\In fact, the nations of the world did agree. The following was reported by Reuters: ""Nearly 200 nations agreed at U.N.-led talks in Bali on Saturday to launch negotiations on a new pact to fight global warming after a reversal by the United States allowed a historic breakthrough."" This new pact is a ""roadmap for two years of talks to adopt a new treaty to succeed Kyoto (i.e., cut emissions of greenhouse gases) beyond 2012, widening it to the United States and developing nations such as China and India. Under the deal, a successor pact will be agreed at a meeting in Copenhagen in late 2009."" The meeting ran one day over schedule not due to new ""scientific evidence,"" but because of U.S. reluctance.\But why wait until 2009? Again, Reuters reported ""Agreement on a pact in 2009 would give governments time to ratify the pact and give certainty to markets and investors."" Clearly, the U.N. and the attending delegates were mindful of how any of these changes will affect the world's economies.\James Connaughton, chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, said in Bali, that ""This is not a step taken alone by America. This is a step taken by all the countries that the time had come to open a new chapter."" Clearly, it is time for all of us to support the global effort.\I don't usually quote politicians, but former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee might have said it the best when he said, ""I don't try to get into the middle of the science of global warming. ... There may be (a human role in climate change). But whether there is or there isn't, it doesn't release us from the responsibility to be good stewards of the environment. It's the old Boy Scout rule: You leave your campsite in as good or better shape than how you found it. It's a spiritual issue."" (Gov. Huckabee, a Republican candidate for president, supports a mandatory cap and trade system to reduce CO2 emissions.)\So, whether you agree or not with the trajectory of understanding of human-caused global warming (a.k.a, scientific consensus), you cannot deny that energy conservation and investment in research and development of, and movement towards, alternative fuels are necessary for our economic (and homeland) security and to maintain our role as a global leader in the development of new technology. It is time for us to become not only good stewards of the environment but of our (and the global) society as well by agreeing that energy conservation and a reduction in carbon emissions and a move away from a fossil-fuel based economy is a good, and necessary, idea.\John A. Cigliano, Ph.D. is associate professor of biology and director of Biodiversity & Conservation Biology at Cedar Crest College in Allentown.

167,"Due to newsroom front-end system production difficulties the entire text could not be electronically captured for the online archive, please see microfilm for the complete graphics.\ Environmental legislation passed a decade and a half ago and the threat of stricter rules to come are prompting PPL Corp. to spend more than a half-billion dollars to clean up three coal-fired power plants.\ The Allentown electric company announced Wednesday that it will install ""scrubbers"" on the two plants at its Montour facility north of Danville and the largest of its Brunner Island plants south of Harrisburg.\ The additions will remove acid rain-causing sulfur dioxide.\ ""We are making this investment because it makes good business sense, and because it's the right thing to do,"" PPL Chief Executive William Hecht said at a news conference at a nature preserve next to the Montour plants.\ Hecht stressed that PPL's initiative is voluntary. But the main reason doing the right thing makes goods business sense today is the Clean Air Act, signed into law by President George H.W. Bush in 1990.\ That legislation, the model for the current Bush Administration's proposed Clear Skies Act, instituted a market-based approach to pollution control.\ Utilities could reduce their emissions by using cleaner coal or installing scrubbers. Otherwise they would have to buy from better- performing utilities a limited number of allowances to pollute the air.\ Under that emissions-trading system, the price of allowances to emit sulfur dioxide has tripled over the last year, reaching an all- time high of $740 a ton, according to Evolution Markets, a broker in White Plains, New York.\ As result, installing scrubbers at coal-fired plants, which generate half of U.S. electric power, has suddenly become cheaper than the long-term cost of buying allowances.\ ""Scrubbers are actually lower cost to us than consuming $700-a- ton emission allowances,"" William Hecht, PPL chairman, said on a Feb. 2 conference call with analysts and investors. ""So our objective now is to get scrubbers in as soon as we practically can so that we can actually sell surplus allowances we have.""\ The expectation of new environmental restrictions has been blamed for contributing to the rise in the price of sulfur dioxide allowances.\ President Bush has touted cap-and-trade markets such as the sulfur dioxide allowance program as the cheapest way to regulate air pollution. The Clear Skies Act, first proposed in 2002 and still under consideration by Congress, would double the number of allowances a utility must buy for each ton of sulfur dioxide it emits starting as early as 2010.\ Other utilities, including Southern Co. and Allegheny Energy, are taking steps to limit emissions.\ More than $12 billion in planned plant upgrades have been announced in the past year.\ ""The scrubber wave is beginning,"" said James Stone, a vice president at closely held Foster Wheeler in Clinton, N.J., one of the three biggest suppliers of pollution control equipment.\ PPL's scrubber construction will begin early next year and is expected to be completed in 2008 for Montour and 2010 for Brunner Island.\ Those sites are PPL's largest coal-fired generating units in Pennsylvania, and they account for the vast majority of the company's sulfur dioxide emissions.\ Together, they spew about 180,000 tons of sulfur dioxide into the air every year.\ The scrubbers are capable of capturing nearly all through a chemical process that uses pulverized limestone.\ PPL said it has plans to reuse the byproducts from the scrubbers in an as-yet unannounced money-making venture.\ ""This scrubber installation is much more than an environmental project,"" said Hecht. ""It demonstrates that what's good for the environment also can be beneficial for a company and its shareowners.""\ The projects will create 15 to 20 permanent positions and hundreds of construction jobs over a five-year period, according to PPL.\ ""What we have here with this project is a triple win, one for the power industry, one for the local economy and a very big one for the environment,"" Pennsylvania Environmental Protection Secretary Kathleen McGinty said during her visit to the site.\ Environmental groups, too, lauded PPL's initiative.\ ""It doesn't get better than this,"" said John Stanton, senior council with Clear the Air in Washington, D.C. ""It will save lives and will even help with fly fishing -- and it will create jobs.""\ PPL is not planning similar upgrades at its two Lehigh Valley coal-fired power plants. Rather, the company intends to permanently shut down the two units at its Martins Creek facility in 2007.\ The site's two other power plants, which use natural gas and oil, will continue to generate electricity.\ PPL controls about 12,000 megawatts of power production in the United States, serves 1.3 million electric and gas customers in Pennsylvania, and has more than 2,300 workers in Lehigh and Northampton counties. It also owns major electric companies in the United Kingdom, Chile and Bolivia.\ It earned $698 million in 2004.\ PPL stock rose 67 cents per share, or 1 percent, to close at $53.90 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.\ sam.kennedy@mcall.com\ 610-820-6517\ Reporter Dan Shope and Bloomberg News contributed to this story.\ ***"
168,"
Last month, a state utilities board voted to allocate $15 million in federal stimulus money for grants to make businesses more energy efficient.
\
The money for the program, which seeks to lower New Jersey residents' utility bills by reducing demand from the biggest users of the electric grid, should have come from a fee assessed on major commercial and industrial users since 2003.
\
But the Retail Margin Fund, which holds that revenue, is empty - among the consequences of hundreds of millions of dollars in diversions from ""dedicated"" funds to help the state close a multibillion-dollar budget gap.
\
Budget documents show that environmental and clean-energy programs designed to reduce New Jersey household and commercial utility bills are being hit particularly hard, with about $400 million rerouted into the state's general fund.
\
The state raided $128 million from the Retail Margin Fund, which is generated by fees from commercial and industrial users, in the fiscal year that ended June 30, and will take $14 million under the $29.4 billion budget signed into law last week.
\
Greg Reinert, spokesman for the Board of Public Utilities, said the fund had never spent the money collected over the years.
\
Today, he said, ""there's nothing left in it.""
\
Just last year, the state enacted a law authorizing the fund to spend $60 million on combined-heat-and-power grants for businesses. The program aimed to help the state develop 1,500 megawatts of cogeneration capacity by 2020.
\
Assemblyman Upendra Chivukula (D., Somerset), a primary sponsor of the 2009 law, criticized the shift of $15 million in stimulus money to fund the cogeneration program as a one-shot fix.
\
The fund is paid into by business customers ""who are hurting with higher energy costs. By taking their money away and not giving it back to them, to balance the budget, it's totally inappropriate,"" he said.
\
Chivukula grilled the sponsor of the bill authorizing the diversions from that and other environmental funds on the Assembly floor during last Monday's marathon legislative session. Yet Chivukula provided one of the handful of Democratic votes needed to pass the measure, citing ""the spirit of bipartisanship.""
\
""Given the dire circumstances we're facing in New Jersey with revenue shortfalls, we have little or no choice"" but to look to other areas ""to make this budget balanced,"" Assemblyman Joseph Malone (R., Burlington), the bill's sponsor and a previous critic of budget raids, told Chivukula.
\
The moves concern lawmakers and environmental advocates alike.
\
""One of the problems is that this isn't taxpayer money. . . . It was ratepayer money that had been set aside and dedicated to clean energy that helps people save money and helps create jobs and helps reduce pollution, so it was a no-win situation for the environment, the economy, and the people of New Jersey,"" said Matt Elliott, the global-warming and clean-energy advocate for Environment New Jersey.
\
""Once they get used to robbing these funds,"" said Jeff Tittel, director of the New Jersey Sierra Club, ""they may continue to rob them because it becomes easy and that is going to mean higher electric costs for consumers, fewer jobs in a time when we need to grow our economy, and more air pollution.""
\
The largest diversion comes from the Clean Energy Fund, which annually takes in about $250 million, an average of $20 per New Jersey household, through a charge on utility bills. The fee stems from the 1999 utility deregulation under Republican Gov. Christie Whitman.
\
Revelations that the administration of Gov. Jon S. Corzine rerouted $30 million from the fund in 2009 drew outrage from several South Jersey lawmakers. Assemblymen Vincent Polistina and John Amodeo, Republicans from Atlantic County, lambasted the move as ""Exhibit A of budget-balancing gimmicks."" Sen. Diane Allen (R., Burlington) called for an end to the practice.
\
But those same lawmakers closed out fiscal 2010 by voting to authorize a $158 million diversion from the fund, and an additional $10 million this fiscal year.
\
In interviews, the three legislators said they continued to oppose raiding funds, but described their votes as necessary in a difficult fiscal climate.
\
Polistina blamed the Democratic Corzine administration, saying it had ""overestimated revenues so badly that we were left with very little options, and at this point it seemed like the best way to try to close the shortfall that was created by Corzine.""
\
The moves have also upset the industry: The Mid-Atlantic Solar Energy Industries Association sued the Christie administration in May, saying diversions of clean-energy money were unconstitutional.
\
Reinert said the impact of the diversions from the Clean Energy Fund had been softened by the BPU's recapturing $61 million that had been set aside but never spent on various projects. He said the BPU had actually increased funding for a successful home energy audit program.
\
Taking money from dedicated funds is a longtime, if controversial, practice under administrations of both parties in Trenton. State leaders gave approval last week to dip into funds dedicated to spinal-cord and breast-cancer research, disability payments, and economic development.
\
They authorized diverting $10 million set aside to make state buildings more energy efficient, and tapping the recycling fund for $7 million, the same amount diverted last year. The budget also says that ""all revenues from fees and fines collected by the Department of Environmental Protection . . . shall be deposited into the state general fund without regard to their specific dedication.""
\
States from California to Connecticut are raiding dedicated funds to offset enormous budget deficits.
\
Rhode Island this year decided it was a violation of state law to divert cap-and-trade revenue from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which is an agreement among 10 Northeast states to cut carbon emissions.
\
New York and New Hampshire, however, took millions from their RGGI funds this year. New Jersey is redirecting $65 million in RGGI money to its general fund.
\
Sen. Jeff Van Drew (D., Cape May) said the moves meant a lack of investment in the future, given that New Jersey has been ""on the cutting edge of clean energy."" He withheld his support for the budget last year out of numerous concerns about raiding dedicated funds, and has sponsored a resolution to bar the practice through a state constitutional amendment.
\
He nonetheless voted to authorize the diversions last week, explaining: ""We have to move forward in New Jersey. We have to put out a message that we can't have a [government] shutdown.""

169,"PRESIDENT OBAMA talked jobs in a Lehigh Valley visit and later in Washington. We asked Democrat John Callahan, Republican incumbent Charlie Dent and Independent Jake Towne, all U.S. House candidates for the Lehigh Valley seat, for their views.\""It was mentioned that I was in Allentown, Pennsylvania, this past weekend, and went to a job center where people were engaged in job search. And it ran the spectrum -- blacks, whites, Hispanics, young people who were just starting their careers, individuals 50, 60 years old, looking for a job. And they were putting a brave face on it, confident that eventually things would work out, but you could also see the sense of anxiety, the fear that perhaps this time it was different. Sometimes it's hard to break out of the bubble here in Washington and remind ourselves that behind these statistics are people's lives, their capacity to do right by their families. It speaks to an urgent need to accelerate job growth in the short term while laying a new foundation for lasting economic growth.""\-- President Barack Obama, reflecting on his Lehigh Valley visit during a speech days later in Washington\Invest in middle class\Over the last six years, Bethlehem has undergone a tremendous economic revitalization. We have shown what rolling up our sleeves and working together can produce for a city. Now we need Washington to do the same for this country.\I'm committed to taking my experience driving economic growth as mayor and translating that into results for the entire Lehigh Valley as a congressman.\It is not the role of government to create jobs. But by creating the right environment, government can be a catalyst for private sector job creation. Small businesses are responsible for creating two out of every three new jobs in America and government needs to do more to help them be successful.\I understand how government can help create jobs. In Bethlehem we have cultivated the right environment for business investment and this has resulted in $2 billion in economic development and 5,000 new jobs. By making government investments in environmental remediation and infrastructure, a barren steel mill is now a new industrial park. Its shovel-ready sites are attracting new developments that are creating jobs to replace those once provided by Bethlehem Steel.\In Bethlehem, we welcome business with open arms by offering technical assistance, low interest ""gap"" financing, tax abatement, enterprise zone incentives and a loan pool providing up to $2 million for new and existing businesses. As a result, Fortune Small Business ranked Bethlehem among the top 100 places in America to live and launch a new business.\Similar types of programs are needed nationally to jump-start our job market and get people back to work. As the president proposed, we need to do more to encourage investment in small businesses, such as completely eliminating the capital gains tax on small business investors for one year. We also should waive government fees and increase guarantees for Small Business Administration-backed loans to get small business the credit they need to open or expand.\I agree with what Jim Gallagher, the CEO of Allentown Metal Works, told President Obama last week during his visit to the Lehigh Valley: there needs to be an increase in demand for his steel products so he can hire more workers. Government can help. By boosting our investment in infrastructure projects like repairing or rebuilding bridges and roads, we can directly create construction jobs. Even more critical, the demand for raw materials needed to complete these projects will also increase private sector manufacturing jobs like the ones at Allentown Metal Works.\As mayor I've always believed in the saying that there is no Democratic or Republican way to fix a pothole -- you either do it or you don't. The same can be said for turning our economy around and creating jobs.\As your next member of Congress, I would bring the same common-sense work ethic to Washington. We need to put aside partisan bickering and come together behind American solutions to overcome our economic challenges. No longer can we afford career Washington politicians who allow for high times on Wall Street while ignoring tough times on Main Street. We need results for everyday Americans. We need to invest in small business and the middle class, the true drivers of our economy.\John Callahan\Hurting, not helping\The president began a public relations effort to promote his economic policies right here in the Lehigh Valley. Our region was appropriate because we have emerged from difficult periods with a stronger, more vibrant and increasingly diverse economy.\But right now, the policies being advanced in Washington are impeding, not promoting, job creation.\In February, the president signed the so-called stimulus bill, legislation that borrows too much, spends too much and delivers too few jobs. Today, nearly 10 months later, 3 million more Americans are out of work and the jobless rate is at a 26-year high, over 10 percent.\The congressional majority is turning a blind eye. The Senate is considering a misguided national energy tax called ""cap and trade"" that will cost thousands of jobs in Pennsylvania and increase energy costs.\In the controversial health care legislation, a 5.4 percent surtax on income and an employer mandate with an 8 percent penalty will mean job losses. Also, a proposed medical device tax imperils innovation and endangers jobs at local companies like Olympus and B. Braun Inc.\Proposed ""card-check"" legislation will eliminate secret ballots for union elections and impose higher costs through binding arbitration.\Ignoring record deficits, Congress has pushed through a budget that doubles the national debt in five years and triples it in 10. And Congress has passed appropriations bills increasing domestic discretionary spending more than 11 percent.\This type of job-killing legislation, coupled with the unprecedented growth of government, has frightened many businesses from investing in growth.\Now there is talk of a ""second stimulus."" It's time for Washington to come back to reality. Sustainable jobs are not created by the president, Congress, governors, mayors, czars, or any other government official. Jobs are created by businesses. With that in mind, I support common-sense solutions:\Provide small businesses (employing 500 or less) with a tax deduction equal to 20 percent of their income.\Remove barriers to all domestic energy production, including nuclear, oil and gas and renewables to reduce reliance on foreign oil and create sustainable jobs.\Cut taxes for lower-income, working Americans by reducing the 15 percent income-tax rate to 10 percent and reducing the 10 percent rate to 5 percent. Prevent looming tax increases on capital gains, income, married couples, and estates; extend the child tax credit.\Reverse the course of increased deficits to restore confidence among job creators. Apply unused Troubled Asset Relief Program funds toward deficit reduction rather than for new spending.\Fast-track military replacement purchases to provide an immediate boost to the struggling manufacturing sector.\Reauthorize the expiring surface transportation bill for real infrastructure investment.\Approve bilateral trade agreements with our allies Colombia, South Korea and Panama, boosting exports by 1 percent and creating 250,000 American jobs.\If we want to create jobs, we must support the private sector and invest federal dollars sparingly and wisely. Otherwise we are doomed to a downward spiral of debt payments, inflationary pressure and taxation.\Charlie Dent\Less is more with jobs\Far from fixing the economy, the two-headed, one-party political system is ruining Main Street. We need look no farther than our backyards for evidence. Recently, the hardware store in Nazareth, my hometown, announced it was closing. Meanwhile, the stimulus plan awarded over $7 million to local universities for research on topics like hot lava and Ice Age climate shifts. This was more than the amounts allotted to Allentown, Bethlehem or Easton.\What is going on here?\It is nothing more than the principle of the ""seen"" and the ""unseen"" at work. What is normally ""seen"" is government's pet projects, whether the Hoover Dam, hot lava research or banker bailouts. Some projects may even have some utility, like new roads or bridges. These are held up as examples of how the government is doing its very best to help you -- with your taxes, that is.\However, what is typically NOT SEEN is local hardware stores failing -- the businesses that didn't make the government's gravy train list. What is NOT SEEN is firms that never start due to government interventions. What is NEVER SEEN is the employment these businesses would be providing and what is CERTAINLY NOT SEEN is what would happen if people were not plundered by government in the first place, either via payroll taxes or the insidious hidden tax of inflation.\We must recognize that when the government says that the path to prosperity rests in destroying used cars and giving cash incentives to stimulate purchases of new cars, they are instead saying that the path to prosperity rests with creating false demand, more taxes and the destruction of economic goods. When the government says the way to prosperity is to increase the price of milk, it is like saying the way to prosperity is to make food more expensive.\When the government says the way to national wealth is to pay out governmental subsidies, they are in effect saying the way to national wealth is to increase taxes. When politicians say the main objective is to stimulate jobs by providing government-paid salaries, they are instead saying that excessive taxation and placing an immense burden of debt on future unborn generations is really the main objective.\America's sails are set on a hazardous course. The good news is the path to prosperity is simple. We need to return to what America does best.\America needs to restore individual liberties.\America needs to restore the rule of law per the Constitution.\America needs balanced budgets with a sound currency to impose discipline on government.\America needs very low taxes.\America needs a strong national defense while avoiding undeclared wars, military bases on foreign soil and nation-building missions.\America must act to bring about a separation between the state and the economy.\Jake Towne\Credit: By President Barack Obama, John Callahan, Charlie Dent and Jake towne, Special to The Morning Call - Freelance\Credit: By President Barack Obama, John Callahan, Charlie Dent and Jake towne, Special to The Morning Call - Freelance"

Two things seem obvious. Energy will cost more and government is going to have to cost less.
\
Fortunately the two complement each other -- like the ends of a seesaw, an obsolete playground device, one end of which went up and the other down with children in the more nervy past.
\
There's no way energy costs can go but up, though. All forms of energy. Young people despairing of a career should come out of the dumps and get into the energy field.
\
If British Petroleum capped its spewing well in the Gulf of Mexico tomorrow, the cost of drilling in the stained blue water would rise. Because every oil well drilled hereafter will have to be safer.
\
Therefore more valves, collars, funnels and scoops, more technology, more backup systems will be deployed into the deep. On every gas well, too, facing the same sub-sea pressures.
\
No doubt all wells on land as well. They're probing deeper, stranger environments frequented by wildlife large and large; we daren't extract our hydrocarbons at the expense of the critters, nor of property owners with water wells on the Marcellus gas shale.
\
Coal mines also must be safer, much safer, since the recent fatal explosion in West Virginia. And this is not even to count the huge costs involved in a cap-and-trade law, should Congress be crazy enough to pass one.
\
Nor can nuclear power be truly trusted. Another $1 billion or so of fail-safe redundancies and 10- to 15-year construction timetables per power plant might -- might -- quiet the terrors that keep environmentalists tossing at night.
\
What all this tells you is that electric bills must go up, especially when millions of government-subsidized hybrid cars start plugging-in overnight. Fossil fuels have been too ""cheap,"" that's the trouble, we're told.
\
But there's an upside to the downside. As power costs rise, all the ""sustainables"" get closer to being sustainable (without too obvious tax breaks).
\
Wind, sun, tide and geothermal, all those irresistible forces of nature -- aided and abetted by ""green"" industries and their lobbyists -- should enjoy bigger markets. Their energy outputs probably will come down relatively in cost, and technical breakthroughs ought to be made. Let's hope so.
\
But how to pay in the meantime? Higher costs for energy will be just that, higher outlays of real money. They might as well be tax increases. They're bound to weigh on the economy and all of us.
\
To argue as the president does, that America can ""lead the world"" in the energy of the future means we lead the world in higher costs first.
\
So one conclusion looks inescapable. If energy in the 21st century has to cost more, government will have to cost less.
\
And by sweet coincidence, the public may be coming to see this. A national debt ballooning by $1 trillion a year scares and offends sensible people. A Congress that can't quit spending seems as dangerous as an oil spill. Especially since so much of the spending is on gilt-edged public employee pay and pensions, protected by bullying unions at far higher levels than in the private sector.
\
Now there's a leak that's got to be plugged.

It will take a change in the chilly U.S. House environment for Nancy Pelosi to get climate-change legislation -- her signature issue -- to a vote before the August recess.
\
Oh, there's no deadline per se, Madam Speaker tells Capitol Hill reporters. But she also knows that if the business-stifling, job-killing, solution-in-search-of-a-problem bill doesn't come to a vote this summer, it surely will get passed over by other big-ticket items from Democrats -- proposals that don't aggravate lawmakers' base constituencies in industrial states.
\
The measure seeks to mitigate the presumed threat from greenhouse gases. What isn't presumed is the punishing cost this legislation would extract from industries and consumers.
\
Already the games have begun. Two committees -- Agriculture and Ways and Means -- will be allowed to mark up the contentious cap-and-trade bill. But at least six other House committees that surely have a stake in the legislation have agreed not to do their own markups, reports The Hill newspaper. Isn't that curious.
\
Whatever emerges, it's going to have to get past staunch Republican opposition that's supplemented by some Democrats, who aren't keen about capping their own careers with the commerce-killing legislation. Mrs. Pelosi is going to need every vote she can wrangle.
\
The legislation deserves to die. And from the heat it's generated, this portends to be a long, hot summer for Nancy Pelosi.

Environmentalism's smug altruism obscures what's most ""green"" about it: the money that special-interest businesses pay ""revolving door"" Washington lobbyists to secure financial benefits.
\
Consider Democrat Steve McBee -- a former key staffer for a House Appropriations Committee member -- the poster boy for those who taint lobbying by feathering their own nests at ""green"" clients' and taxpayers' expense. His lobbying firm is ""ground zero"" of the ""green-industrial complex,"" writes The Washington Examiner's Timothy P. Carney.
\
Mr. McBee's clients include Boeing, JPMorgan Chase, Google and what Mr. Carney calls ""built-for-subsidy startups."" He's widely believed responsible for Congress repealing a ""down payment"" requirement for renewable-energy recipients of federal loan guarantees -- such as California's Solyndra, which cut jobs and closed a plant after getting a $535 million guarantee.
\
Such lobbying, Carney writes, shows that Democrats who label cap-and-trade opponents as big-business shills are hypocrites -- and that ""green"" policies ""are more likely skewed toward the bottom line of ... Big Business"" than toward ""helping the environment.""
\
Remember that inconvenient truth whenever Democrats tout supposed advantages of going ""green.""

\
President Obama had some positive things to say about energy in his State of the Union, but I was disappointed he didn't recognize the need to start anew when it comes to energy and environmental legislation. Unfortunately, instead he called for Senate passage of legislation that would increase energy costs and send energy business (and jobs) overseas.
\
The new taxes that are included in the cap-and-trade legislation would give companies incentives to take their operations overseas. We cannot afford to lose more jobs and more investment in this country, particularly as we are striving to rise above the economic turmoil of the past year or two.
\
Some people seem to think that these proposed taxes would just hit huge oil and gas companies that somehow can afford it. The truth is that small, independent operators produce most of the oil and gas in Pennsylvania and across the nation. In order to pay higher taxes, these companies would need to cut investments and jobs, which would just hurt our economy even more.
\
We can all aspire to the development of new sources of energy, particularly clean energy, as President Obama said. But the government should provide positive incentives for the growth of these businesses, not negative incentives in the way of new and higher taxes for companies that already are part of our local economy.
\
It's time to rethink this energy legislation and come up with a replacement that will be good for the environment as well as good for our economy.

174,"As 2030 approaches, I fear that climate disruption could threaten my children's entrance into adulthood.\Gov. Tom Wolf is now calling for measures to protect the quality of our air, create a cap and trade program, and get 10 percent of our power from solar by 2030. These goals, however, are way too low. Wolf needs to understand the science and abide. We can and must adapt our economy to preserve our human health and our living environment. Our children's lives and livelihoods depend on it.\We need a just transition from the short-term economic illusion of an extraction-dependent society to one that uses climate change as an opportunity to empower a healthy, just and equitable society.\Tammy Murphy\Philadelphia"
175,"TO THE EDITORS:\President Obama's State of the Union message included a challenge to make the conversion to clean, renewable energy follow the template of the ""race for space"" from my childhood.\In that situation, everyone from our NASA scientists down to the kids on my block, threw their support into the task. We all took pride in putting the first man on the moon.\Today, the stakes are even higher: No less than ensuring a viable environment for our nation, for the world, for all species on Earth and for generations into the future.\Some members of Congress might not be aware that already a plan is in the formative stages that uses the natural forces of our open market economy to achieve this goal. It is not cap and trade, but ""fee and dividend.""\How it works is: CO2-creating energy producers are charged a fee for the amount of CO2 pollution generated by their processes, at the sources of materials withdrawal. This money offsets the cost increases that companies might pass on to consumers, since the collected money fund is distributed across the board, equally to all citizens in the form of a dividend.\The goal is to make it more appealing and cost-effective to research and produce clean, renewable energy than the climate-destroying fossil-fuel energy.\Between the record heat and numerous climate-related disasters that unfolded in 2012, it's clear that our nation must take steps to reduce the greenhouse-gas emissions that are warming up our planet.\Lacking a legislative solution, the president will turn to regulation.\Republicans, who abhor regulation, should answer the climate challenge with the free-market approach of a revenue-neutral carbon tax. I think ""fee and dividend"" fits. Exxon, Shell and BP have expressed support for a price on carbon.\What's holding Congress back? Many conservative economists support a revenue-neutral carbon tax, including Art Laffer, economic adviser to President Reagan, and Greg Mankiw, economic adviser to President George W. Bush and candidate Mitt Romney.\Stated another way, returning revenue from a carbon tax to consumers would speed the transition to clean energy without inflicting economic pain on American households. Border-adjustment tariffs on goods from nations that don't price carbon would protect American businesses and give other countries a strong incentive to follow our lead.\Toveah Mirot\Lancaster"
176,"TO THE EDITORS:\Environmental terrorists sponsored by the Obama administration are now poised to attack the American people with immunity.\Similar attacks have recently taken place in California where the terrorists favored supposedly endangered fish over farmers and cut off their water supply and ability to grow crops.\Now, Lisa Jackson, EPA administrator, and Cass Sunstein, regulatory czar, are conspiring to regulate everything you cherish, including the air you breathe.\Using the lie of global warming as a justification, even as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change manipulated data and conclusions are being discredited throughout the world, Jackson and Sunstein have designated CO2 a hazardous gas, and plan to regulate it.\The president and Democratic Congress, slobbering to pass cap and trade, are colluding to perpetuate these lies. They are doing it in the face of studies by many scientists outside of the IPCC that show that these regulations will do little to effect climate conditions.\Nor is toxicity to individuals an issue outside of a closed environment. Toxic levels of CO2 do not exist in nature (unless you live next to a volcano) and cannot be increased to such levels by manmade emissions.\Collateral damage of these regulations will include more traffic fatalities (lighter cars), further decimation of the auto industry (no one wants these cars), loss of jobs in the energy sector (coal plants too expensive to operate) and major increases (up to 50 percent) in utility bills.\The ultimate goal of these terrorists is complete regulation of your life, including penalizing you for not winterizing your home, controlling your thermostats, and taxing you for every activity that uses CO2 above normal.\How would you feel about an exercise tax, a tax on eating meat, taxes on lawn mowers, to name a few? Sounds ridiculous, but anything is possible under a government whose socialist agenda is complete control over your life, taxing you for your supposed ""excesses,"" and then redistributing your wealth to the special interest groups running the Obama administration.\Kenneth G. Taylor\Mount Joy"
177,"
The Obama administration and Congress say they want to secure America's energy independence. And yet they would block the most expeditious course to that goal.
\
Last summer, Americans demanded relief from $4-a-gallon gas. And the Bush administration responded by lifting two long-standing drilling bans for most of the Outer Continental Shelf.
\
New offshore oil leases could net a conservative estimate of 19 billion barrels of oil. That's about 30 years of Saudi Arabian imports.
\
Then the price of oil dropped.
\
Now a new White House and a more liberal Congress are shoving aside offshore drilling leases. Congress is considering reinstituting some of the drilling bans. And Interior Secretary Ken Salazar has suggested that any surviving plan for drilling offshore would be limited.
\
Why, America must invest in alternative fuels, the chorus clamors. Yes, but in the meantime the United States runs on oil. President Obama cannot achieve the former without reliance -- for years to come -- on the latter.
\
And what will be his recourse when oil prices eventually rebound? A return to windfall-profits taxes that inevitably sap production?
\
Exacerbating the problem even further is the renewed push in Washington for a ""cap-and-trade"" policy (see below) on emissions, which succeeds only in feeding Big Government's tax lust without benefit to consumers or the environment.
\
Mr. Obama and the Democrat Congress cannot fuel America's future on empty ideas.

179,"A debate is unfolding over the size of our federal government. Simply stated: Do we want bigger or smaller government? \The United States is being torn apart by the very government we elected to support and defend the Constitution. Progressive Republican and Democratic administrations this decade have passed bill after bill that have created an unsustainable debt and loss of freedoms which will erode the very fabric of this country. Self-reliance, integrity, and honesty mean nothing. Finding a way to stay in power mean everything. Failure is being rewarded through bailouts. Success is being punished through wealth redistribution. Much of the wealth inequality we see is associated with individual choice. How else do you explain varying wealth of siblings who grew up in the same environment? Look at what happened in the housing bubble collapse, Katrina, and the recent Tennessee floods. You cannot rely on the government, the big bureaucratic machine, to protect you. \Now it's time to make new individual choices. Do you support the lack of accountability of government officials? Do you support the government taking away more individual freedom and property rights? Do you support the ever-hastening march to socialism? Do you support increasing government spending, adding to our trillion dollar debt, and raising taxes that will fail to pay down an unsustainable debt? \Ethic issues abound in government. We are a nation of laws. When those laws are broken by anyone, they should be held accountable and punished accordingly. Failure to do so will lead to an erosion of law and order. Increasing taxes on businesses will result in higher consumer prices and decrease reinvestment. Increasing our taxes will reduce consumer spending and savings. Cap and Trade will increase our energy prices. Cradle to the grave entitlements will bankrupt the country, lead to complacency and shackle the entrepreneurial spirit. \Cory Meyers \Marion\Credit: Public Opinion Online"

181,"Perhaps the most unsettling of the many problems with the cap-and-trade bill passed by the House recently is the condescending dishonesty under which it has been marketed. We have been told repeatedly that this legislation will help to create jobs in America. But the question remains: How will making American goods more expensive make them more appealing at home and abroad? \Increasing the cost of energy will increase the cost of all goods and services produced in America. For every new plant making wind turbines or solar panels, there will be a steel mill that is priced out of the market, a town killed when its coal mine is shuttered, a restaurant that can't pay its utilities and thousands of families who have to stretch their dollars a little further to cover the higher costs of everything from food to transportation. \The Congressional Budget Office estimates a per-family cost of $175, but notes specifically that this number does not take the inevitable adverse economic impact into account. According to the Heritage Foundation, the real cost of this legislation will be $1,870 a year per family. Hardly inconsiderable. \If the Obama government wishes to proceed down this road, let them do it honestly. Do not conceal the costs, but in the manner of Roosevelt and Kennedy, call on America to make the sacrifices needed to help our environment and end a foreign policy afloat on a river of oil.

President Obama's call for new nuclear power development recognizes a perfect storm of problems and opportunities.
\
Obama always has favored renewed nuke development, but his proposal to guarantee financing for nuclear plant construction is a major step that adds urgency to the process.
\
America's 104 nuclear power plants in 31 states produce 20 percent of the nation's power, but 70 percent of the nation's power that does not produce greenhouse gases. Worldwide, electricity produced by nuclear plants would create 2.5 billion tons of carbon pollution if produced by coal.
\
Adding nuclear generating capacity quite simply is the only way to meet the nation's increasing energy demands while holding the line on carbon emissions, or reducing them.
\
Other forms of non-polluting energy production are important, including wind and solar, but nuclear plants are the only non-polluting source that can produce massive amounts of power 24 hours a day regardless of weather conditions.
\
New nuke construction also would be a form of long-term job creation, in terms of design, construction and plant operation and support.
\
Politically, nuclear plant construction is more viable that at any time since the industry went into hibernation following the 1979 accident at Three Mile Island. Congress has not embraced the administration's complex cap-and-trade proposal for greenhouse gas reductions. Nukes ensure reduced emissions and reliable power production, and the proposed guarantees offer a basis for a compromise on other aspects of environmental and energy legislation.
\
Congress already has authorized $18.5 billion in loan guarantees for new plants. The money is not in the form of direct spending; rather it enables nuclear plant developers to obtain financing.
\
The key question regarding nuclear plants is waste disposal. In addition to authorizing new plants, Congress and the administration also should embrace reprocessing techniques that allow most fuel to be reused and rendered incapable of being used for weapons.
\
Nuclear power is a partial answer to many questions facing the economy and environment. The administration, Congress and the industry quickly should jump start its renewal.

Reviving the industry also is important because some older plants will have to come off line at the end of their operating lives, just as power demand justifies new plants. The industry will not only construct new plants but replace old plants.

With an average-size lawmaker facing a massive former NFL lineman, the Third District's congressional race brings a little Middle Earth to South Jersey. Perhaps its disorienting proportions are to blame for its fun-house sensibility.
\
The miniature donkeys in the campaign, for example, are not a figurative reference to the comparatively tiny Democratic incumbent, Rep. John Adler. They are actual (and probably adorable) animals being raised for tax purposes by the elephantine Republican, Jon Runyan.
\
And the tea partyer on the ballot is by most accounts not a conservative maverick, but a Democratic decoy.
\
Beyond the high jinks, though, is a substantive contrast.
\
Runyan offers little more than lightweight antigovernment rhetoric compared with the carefully considered record of JOHN ADLER, whom The Inquirer endorses for reelection.
\
The Third, which stretches from Cherry Hill through Burlington County to the Shore, elected Adler to his freshman term in the Democratic wave of 2008. With trends now favoring the GOP, it's toss-up territory again.
\
A Cherry Hill attorney and former state senator, Adler supported the cap-and-trade bill and defends the stimulus package. But he broke with most of his party in supporting an extension of tax rates that favor the wealthy and voting against health-care reform.
\
Unlike Runyan, however, Adler wants to fix rather than repeal the health-care law. Though his nuanced position may smack of political triangulation to some critics, he offers a reasonable policy rationale, objecting to the bill's lack of cost controls and a public option.
\
Runyan, for his part, is a reliable opponent of almost everything Congress has done over the past two years. But he is short on alternatives that go beyond platitudes.
\
The former Eagle's donkey husbandry, which qualifies part of his Mount Laurel estate for a low agricultural tax rate, is at worst a small sin, albeit a very funny one.
\
The campaign of NJ Tea Party candidate Peter DeStefano, apparently concocted by Adler's allies, is a more troubling reminder that the region's Democrats are tainted by their organization's penchant for dirty tricks and worse.
\
Just to the north in New Jersey's Fourth District, which extends from Trenton and Burlington County to the Shore, longtime Republican Rep. Chris Smith of Hamilton faces an energetic challenge from Lakewood trial lawyer Howard Kleinhendler, who advocates ending the Bush tax cuts and spending the revenue on infrastructure.
\
Kleinhendler charges that Smith's involvement in international issues such as human trafficking shows he has lost touch with the district, but that's a misguided attempt to turn an asset into a liability. CHRIS SMITH, a principled and effective congressman on issues ranging from veterans to the environment, deserves reelection.

185,"State Sen. Wayne D. Fontana is a Democrat from Brookline (www.senatorfontana.com).\ My vote in favor of the Clean Air Mercury Compliance Act (Senate Bill 1201) has recently been questioned. Let me be clear: I strongly support mercury emission reductions that protect the health of Pennsylvania's residents, particularly our children. That being said, I was not convinced that the Department of Environmental Protection's proposal did any more to protect public health than the existing federal regulations.\ I am not alone in my thoughts on this issue. The vote was 40-10 in favor of the bill, which rejected the Rendell administration's attempt to set standards on mercury emissions more stringent than the federal government's. Only one of 10 members of the Environmental Resources & Energy Committee voted against reporting the bill out of committee.\ As a former member of that committee, I had the opportunity to review testimony from three separate public hearings on the topic. While opinions varied greatly, let me share with you what was clear during the hearings and review of materials.\ * First, there is a lot of misinformation and misrepresentation about mercury and its effects.\ A person is not exposed to mercury by inhalation or physical contact. People must eat non-farm-raised fish in massive quantities. Robert Wayland of the EPA testified that most fish consumed in this country is caught in the open waters of the North Atlantic or Pacific. Neither the federal nor DEP's proposed rule would make any change to the level of mercury in those fish. The concern is with domestic fish. No one disagrees that unsafe mercury levels can affect human health; however, actually attaining this level must be taken into consideration.\ The Centers for Disease Control found no instances where a person had unhealthy blood mercury levels, while the blood mercury levels in U.S. women of child-bearing age have been shown consistently to fall below levels associated with known adverse health effects.\ * Second, some witnesses indicated the DEP rule would actually cause more problems in reaching goals. Forbidding emissions trading would prevent sources from minimizing their compliance cost and compound the negative impact on power plant output, jobs and local energy costs. Cap-and-trade programs have seen the largest sources reaching compliance quicker than required.\ Simply put, no credible information demonstrated that the proposed rule would result in any measurable additional benefits.\ * Third, Mr. Wayland of the EPA testified that mercury can be naturally released through volcanic eruptions as well as man-made activities.\ Once emitted into the atmosphere, it travels long distances. Many studies are incomplete, have not been peer reviewed and, in at least one instance, are based on information from a different type of plant than the coal-fired power plants at issue in Pennsylvania. Both the federal and DEP rules accomplish the goal of reducing those emissions, just in different ways.\ * Finally, allowing power plants the ability to plan for such a cost without causing large spikes in consumer prices is a policy consideration that makes sense. Mercury emissions from Pennsylvania power plants are already down 33 percent since 1999. DEP's own data show that 90 percent of our generating capacity will have enhanced pollution controls in place in the coming years.\ I commend Department of Environmental Protection Secretary Kathleen A. McGinty, the DEP and its stakeholder group for the work done on this issue. Their ongoing interest in the environment and public health has been evidenced numerous times over my year in the Senate. I agreed with their sentiments on the Pennsylvania Clean Vehicles Program Act, and was one of 20 members to oppose the less- stringent federal regulations.\ In that case, I believed that the facts clearly showed a need to move to the more-stringent rule proposed by the DEP. I just have not seen that evidence in this debate."

In July, the Legislature passed the state's first global warming law, the Pennsylvania Climate Change Act.\In addition to reducing emissions, the law calls for an inventory of greenhouse gas pollutants and creation of a registry of power and other companies to track their emissions.

WASHINGTON - President Obama told wealthy donors in Florida on Monday that his critics have a ""selective memory"" about what he's accomplished in his first nine months in office.
\
The president took credit for pulling the economy back from ""the brink of a meltdown,"" citing a $787 billion economic stimulus package that he said has resulted in the largest investments in energy, research and education in history, and the biggest spending on infrastructure since the interstate highway construction of the 1950s.
\
The president may be correct in claiming his critics have political amnesia. But unemployment -- which may be the most important barometer of the 2010 elections -- keeps inching up toward 10 percent, with economists predicting it will stay there for some time.
\
And a year after he was elected president, Obama still faces five challenges that, cumulatively, are no less significant than what confronted him in January:
\
- The economy: While Obama argues that taxpayers pulled banks and Wall Street back from a financial precipice, concerns over unemployment and government deficits have ballooned. In Florida, unemployment has topped 11 percent.
\
In polls, Obama is getting mixed marks on the economy so far. The public does not share his belief that the bailout has worked.
\
- Health care. The president is correct in saying Congress is closer to reforming the nation's health system than at any time in recent memory. But there remain substantial obstacles to passage of something that meets his goals of cheaper, more widespread coverage.
\
More than any other issue, the prolonged health care debate has exposed tensions between liberals and centrists in the Democratic Party.
\
- The environment. The administration's push to tax polluters, central in ""cap and trade"" legislation, has been overshadowed by the health care debate. It's also drawn concentrated opposition from business and industry, whose leaders say any tax increases would devastate a reeling economy.
\
- Afghanistan. The commanding general in Afghanistan, Stanley McChrystal, has asked for tens of thousands more troops to defeat the Taliban and stabilize the country. Obama has balked, and critics say his unwillingness to push forward with the request puts troops at risk and makes the United States look indecisive in a war that Obama himself has said the nation must win.
\
Recent polls show the country split almost in half on whether to send more troops. So no matter what Obama ultimately decides, half the country will be against it.
\
- The political climate. Despite campaign pleas to get beyond the politics of divide and conquer, Obama has largely abandoned that peace offering. His emissaries have gone after the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in the health care debate and depicted Republicans as ""the party of no"" almost since he came into office.
\
If unemployment remains high by next fall's elections, his fellow Democrats could be in for a bad ballot-box result.

Taxing power plants for their carbon emissions doesn't kill jobs, it creates them, according to a report issued Wednesday by a New Jersey environmental policy group.
\
New Jersey's participation in a regional effort to decrease greenhouse-gas emissions brought the state $151 million in economic benefits, including nearly 1,800 jobs, over three years, according to the study issued by Environment New Jersey Research and Policy Center.
\
The nonprofit group urged Gov. Christie to support a bill that would have the state rejoin the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), a consortium of nine mid-Atlantic and Northeastern states that aim to reduce carbon emissions by 10 percent in their states by 2018. Christie pulled New Jersey out of the program last year, saying the cap-and-trade-system burdened businesses and did not work.
\
New Jersey would benefit environmentally and economically from rejoining the initiative, according to the center. During the three years New Jersey participated in the program, it cut gas emissions by 13,100 metric tons annually - equivalent to taking 2,500 passenger vehicles off the road each year. If it stayed in the program until 2018, the state would reduce the average monthly electricity bill by $25 per residential customer and $181 for every business customer, according to the report.
\
""Even if you didn't believe in global warming . . . the solutions make sense because there's all kinds of benefits,"" said David Pringle, campaign director for the nonprofit NJ Environmental Federation.
\
But a state environmentalism official called the economic benefit of RGGI ""minuscule"" and said New Jersey does not need to belong to the program in order to clean the air.
\
""We have made significant strides in reducing carbon emissions,"" said Larry Ragonese, press director for the Department of Environmental Protection. The economic benefits of RGGI, he said, ""are far offset by the negative impact on businesses. . . . It adds a level of bureaucracy.""
\
States that participate in RGGI require fossil-fuel-burning power plants to buy allowances for carbon emissions, essentially paying in proportion to the amount they pollute. The money is invested in renewable energy and energy efficiency projects.
\
Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont are program participants.
\
Christie said in May that New Jersey was withdrawing from the consortium, calling the program a tax on electricity. He pulled the state out at the end of the year and vetoed a legislative attempt to rejoin it.

Bloggers, politicians and pundits on both sides - and even the company at the center of the crisis - were quick to respond to President Obama's Oval Office speech last night.
\
'IT'S STARTLING': ""It was a great speech if you were on another planet for the last 57 days,"" said Keith Olbermann, host of MSNBC's ""Countdown with Keith Olbermann."" ""I don't think he aimed low; I don't think he aimed at all. It's startling.""
\
NO NEW TAXES: Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said that the White House should keep its focus on stopping the spill and cleaning up the mess, rather than thinking about clean-energy legislation, as Obama suggested. ""Until this leak is plugged, [the American public isn't] in any mood to hand over even more power in the form of a new national energy tax to a government that, so far, hasn't lived up to their expectations in its response to this crisis,"" McConnell said in a statement.
\
GLAD HE'S PUSHING: Sens. John Kerry, D-Mass., and Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., issued a joint statement applauding Obama's use of the address to push clean-energy legislation. ""There can be no doubt that the president is rolling up his sleeves to ensure we establish a market mechanism to tackle carbon pollution, create hundreds of thousands of new jobs each year, strengthen energy independence and improve the quality of the air we breathe,"" the senators said. ""We will continue working with colleagues from both sides of the aisle to pass comprehensive reform this summer.""
\
NOT FAR ENOUGH?: Joshua Green, senior editor of The Atlantic, wrote that Obama didn't go far enough in his push for climate-change legislation. ""Not once did he utter the phrase, 'It's time to put a price on carbon.' And that suggests to me that this speech was primarily about containing the damage to his administration, and was not the pivot point in the energy debate that many people were hoping for.""
\
BP RESPONDS: BP responded with a brief statement a few moments after the speech, saying that it shared Obama's goal of cleaning up the oil and helping the people and environment affected by the spill. The company said that it was looking forward to its meeting with Obama today ""for a constructive discussion about how best to achieve these mutual goals.""
\
RESPECT THE OFFICE: Daniel Foster, a blogger for National Review Online, asked if this was the best use of Obama's first Oval Office address. ""I have to admit I was somewhat surprised to see President Obama use his first Oval Office address to repeat populist platitudes about 'making BP pay' and hit the bullet points, for the umpteenth time, of the Democrats' ill-advised cap-and-trade scheme. Oval addresses are best reserved for wars and resignations.""

I read with great interest David Conti's recent articles ""Observers mixed on grid backup amid carbon rules, natural gas uncertainty"" (July 28 and TribLIVE.com) and ""EPA hearings to bring coal debate to Pittsburgh streets"" (July 29 and TribLIVE.com). Our region is clearly at a crossroads with regard to our energy future and the direction we take will determine the strength of our economy for years.
\
The history of Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania is built on a foundation of coal. In the 19th century, coal helped drive the industrialization that put Pittsburgh on the map; it fueled the steel industry that made Pittsburgh the city it is today.
\
Roughly 40 percent of the commonwealth's power comes from coal-fired plants, which provide affordable, reliable electricity. That affordable electricity, combined with a pro-business environment and an outstanding workforce, makes Pittsburgh an attractive home for the diverse and energy-intensive businesses of the Steel City's economy.
\
It is not just businesses that benefit. For consumers, coal-fired power means paying less to heat their homes. That was particularly important during last winter's polar vortex, when plunging temperatures drove demand for electricity through the roof. Industry experts have stated that the vast majority of this demand was met by coal-fired power. And although some consumers were shocked by their utility bills, without coal it would have been far worse.
\
Despite this, however, the federal Environmental Protection Agency has announced it will pursue new rules that would effectively force coal plants out of business -- and to do so, it's bypassing Congress and going through President Obama's pen. The EPA's decision isn't surprising. After all, what it's proposing is similar to the gargantuan ""cap and trade"" bill that Congress rejected in 2009 -- and the current Congress is no more likely to pass anything like it.
\
It's also unsurprising given that when he was running for the White House, Barack Obama promised the public a plan ""under which electricity prices would necessarily skyrocket."" He's finally delivering. A future with no coal means a future with fewer jobs -- not just jobs at coal plants that will be destroyed, but also jobs of workers who will be laid off when small-business owners are forced to choose between making payroll and keeping the lights on.
\
If we can't use coal, we'll be forced to turn to alternatives like ""renewable"" wind and solar and natural gas. The Marcellus Shale has been an economic boon for our state. But whereas coal is used almost exclusively for power, natural gas is used for power, heat, as a feedstock in the chemical industry, and to power vehicles. As a result, and even with the bounty of the Marcellus, some experts wonder whether we've got enough gas to meet all of our needs. Worse, the environmentalists who are leading the crusade against coal have made it clear that gas is their next target.
\
That leaves us with ""renewables."" These sources can't generate power on demand like coal. We have nothing else that can generate power affordably and reliably, while supporting thousands of good-paying jobs. No wonder concerned citizens are gathering this week to unite their voices and tell the EPA that they, their families and their communities count on coal every day.

192,"One's reaction was ""hypersensitive."" The other's efforts were ""desperate.""\The tone of the U.S. Senate race in Pennsylvania has taken a sharp turn down negative lane. Say farewell to a positive, issues-only campaign between Republican Pat Toomey and Democrat Joe Sestak.\After a Pittsburgh newspaper reported Thursday that two television stations there -- at the Sestak campaign's request -- pulled off the air an anti-Sestak commercial that was paid for by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Toomey campaign wasted little time expressing its displeasure.\Toomey, a former U.S. House member from the Lehigh Valley, held an impromptu conference call with reporters and led off saying that Sestak had a ""hypersensitive reaction"" to the Chamber's ad.\""This is about Joe Sestak denying that he's in lockstep with Nancy Pelosi, which is shocking to me,"" Toomey said. ""It's very interesting and illustrative the lengths Joe Sestak will go to try and mislead the Pennsylvania voters.""\The ad, which is not running in either the Lehigh Valley or Philadelphia, says Sestak voted 100 percent of the time with Pelosi. The Sestak campaign charged that is false, citing examples of when he voted against Pelosi.\""Congressman Toomey's frantic efforts to defend these lies are a desperate attempt to distract voters from his own record on the issues,"" Jonathon Dworkin, Sestak's spokesman said.\It's all semantics, the Toomey's camp said, calling Sestak's complaint laughable. Whether Sestak voted with Pelosi 100 percent of the time or 97 percent of the time doesn't change that he votes most often with her, Toomey said.\And the Chamber itself is pushing back. J.P. Fielder, its spokesman, said he expects the ad will be back up on the air.\""The argument is that the ad is factually accurate,"" Fielder said. ""The point that really should be highlighted is the content of the ad and where Joe Sestak's votes were with Nancy Pelosi. What we're really trying to do with this ad is where Joe Sestak has been on various job-killing pieces of legislation.""\The ad says, ""Joe Sestak gives it 100 percent to Nancy Pelosi."" It cites his votes on the health care reform bill and cap and trade legislation.\The Sestak campaign sent letters to all the stations airing the Chamber's anti-Sestak ad. The campaign has also sent similar letters to stations airing an ad by a pro-Israel group that sharply accuses Sestak of not standing up for Israel causes.\In the letters, Sestak's general counsel for the campaign writes that the ad ""knowingly misstates"" Sestak's record. It cites a FCC licensing requirement that says the stations must ""protect the public from false, misleading or deceptive advertising.""\Mark Nevins, a Democratic consultant from Philadelphia, said it's not unusual for a campaign to call into question the accuracy of an ad produced by a special interest.\""You have to hold the person making the ad accountable to ... you can't just get close to accurate,"" Nevins said. ""For the Sestak campaign, their mission is accomplished. If you're a voter you have to question whether you can believe what the Chamber is saying about Joe Sestak.""\But Republican consultant Charlie Gerow of Harrisburg said Sestak's argument would not hold up in a ""high school debate class.""\""I'm never ceased to be amazed by the odd decisions made by the Sestak campaign,"" Gerow said. ""I think it's a bizarre position to make. He is objecting to the implication of the ad, not the recitation of the facts.""\For all the back and forth, there appears to be only one absolute: The campaigns are not going to be able to resist getting dirty. And there's still more than three months to go.\""The initial comments that we're going to have a spirited but gentlemanly contest, I predicted this would turn into an ugly, knockdown, drag out contest,"" said G.

On Tuesday, the Bush administration released its plans for reducing mercury emissions from coal-burning power plants.
\
As many observers expected, it sets a limit on how much mercury pollution can be released, and allows companies to trade within those limits. Whether or not that's a good thing depends on who you talk to industry representatives or environmental activists.
\
George Lewis is a spokesman for PPL, which owns the Brunner Island power plant in East Manchester Township. Lewis said PPL executives still haven't decided how the new standards would effect Brunner Island or any of their plants. But he said PPL officials believe Bush's plan amounts to a practical balance reducing pollution without putting too much of a burden on industries.
\
""We think it's a good, workable solution,"" Lewis said.
\
But Nathan Willcox, energy and clean air advocate for PennEnvironment, said his statewide environmental group had already started a campaign for tougher state regulations than what the administration proposed Tuesday. Advance word told them it would be necessary.
\
""It was, unfortunately, close to what we were expecting,"" Willcox said. ""Now it really is a matter of focusing on the state level.""
\
The regulations that the Environmental Protection Agency released Tuesday are the first mercury controls on coal-burning power plants. The EPA was trying to meet a court-ordered deadline in a settlement with the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group that sued the agency 13 years ago to regulate hazardous air pollutants from power plants.
\
The rules call for the country's 450-plus coal-burning power plants, which now produce a total of 48 tons of mercury each year, to cut that amount to 31.3 tons in 2010, 27.9 tons in 2015 and 24.3 tons in 2020.
\
The ""cap and trade"" policy allows some plants to pollute more, in exchange for buying unused pollution allowances from other plants.
\
Willcox said that approach might work with other types of pollutants if the EPA is trying to improve air quality over a large area. The problem with mercury is that it tends to stay in one area. So reducing overall mercury emissions statewide or nationwide won't help people around a plant that's still polluting.
\
PennEnvironment and a number of other environmental and sportsmen's groups have submitted a petition to state officials requesting a 90 percent reduction in mercury emissions in Pennsylvania by 2007, which they claim is possible with existing technology.
\
Lewis, however, argues that reducing air pollution is something better handled on a national level, because emissions can drift across state borders.
\
""It might not help the environment in that state,"" he said of PennEnvironment's proposal. ""But what it might do is cause serious economic handicaps on power plant owners in that state.""

President Barack Obama's call for new nuclear power development recognizes a perfect storm of problems and opportunities. Obama always has favored renewed nuke development, but his proposal to guarantee financing for nuclear plant construction is a major step that adds urgency to the process.
\
America's 104 nuclear power plants in 31 states produce 20 percent of the nation's power, but 70 percent of the nation's power that does not produce greenhouse gases. Worldwide, electricity produced by nuclear plants would create 2.5 billion tons of carbon pollution if produced by coal.
\
Adding nuclear generating capacity quite simply is the only way to meet the nation's increasing energy demands while holding the line on carbon emissions, or reducing them.
\
Other forms of nonpolluting energy production are important, including wind and solar, but nuclear plants are the only non-polluting source that can produce massive amounts of power 24 hours a day regardless of weather conditions.
\
New nuke construction also would be a form of long-term job creation, in terms of design, construction and plant operation and support.
\
Politically, nuclear plant construction is more viable than at any time since the industry went into hibernation following the 1979 accident at Three Mile Island. Congress has not embraced the administration's complex cap-and-trade proposal for greenhouse gas reductions. Nukes ensure reduced emissions and reliable power production, and the proposed guarantees offer a basis for a compromise on other aspects of environmental and energy legislation.
\
Congress already has authorized $18.5 billion in loan guarantees for new plants. The money is not in the form of direct spending; rather it enables nuclear plant developers to obtain financing.
\
Another advantage of renewed nuclear construction is that it is still an American industry. Companies such as Westinghouse and General Electric are global leaders, but have had to rely on foreign markets.
\
Reviving the industry also is important because some older plants will have to come off line at the end of their operating lives, just as power demand justifies new plants. The industry will not only construct new plants but replace old plants.
\
The key question regarding nuclear plants is waste disposal. In addition to authorizing new plants, Congress and the administration also should embrace reprocessing techniques that allow most fuel to be reused and rendered incapable of being used for weapons.
\
Nuclear power is a partial answer to many questions facing the economy and environment. The administration, Congress and the industry quickly should jump start its renewal.

Despite signs of economic improvement, the steel industry faces challenges this year -- ranging from legislation aimed at reducing greenhouse gases, to unfair foreign trade, to the cost of energy and raw materials, analysts said.
\
The biggest issue this year is proposed climate-change legislation pending in Congress, said steel-industry analyst Charles Bradford of Affiliated Research Group LLC of New York.
\
Congress is working on a compromise bill -- a controversial cap-and-trade proposal that would set limits on emissions but allow companies to trade or sell to other companies the permits necessary to emit greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
\
Climate-change legislation and other industry concerns will be discussed in Pittsburgh when steel-industry executives meet at the Iron & Steel Technology Conference and Exposition, which opens Monday in the David L. Lawrence Convention Center, Downtown. The event is expected to draw 5,500 representatives of producers, suppliers and distributors.
\
U.S. Steel Corp. CEO John P. Surma is scheduled to deliver a keynote address Tuesday.
\
The industry is recovering from a disastrous 2009, when production, shipments and profits plunged.
\
The three largest U.S. producers -- Nucor Corp. of Charlotte, N.C.; U.S. Steel of Pittsburgh; and AK Steel Holdings Corp. of Middletown, Ohio -- lost a combined $1.76 billion.
\
Posting first-quarter profits this year are Allegheny Technologies Inc. of Pittsburgh; Steel Dynamics Inc. of Fort Wayne, Ind.; Nucor; and AK Steel.
\
U.S. Steel, on the other hand, reported a loss of $157 million, although it is the company's smallest quarterly loss since December 2008.
\
The industry is lobbying in Washington to ensure that its voice is heard on the climate-change issue and that approved legislation takes ""a global approach,"" said Nancy Gravatt, a spokeswoman for American Iron & Steel Institute, a Washington trade group representing domestic producers.
\
Bradford said steel can't be made without using carbon and emitting-carbon dioxide. He noted that forcing the industry to meet stricter environmental standards ""is deadly.""
\
A bill that would limit greenhouse gases not only would be a ""disaster"" for the steel industry, but would affect how steel is moved into and around the country -- adding to costs, said David Phelps, a president of the American Institute for International Steel Inc., a McLean, Va., trade group supporting free trade.
\
Although the U.S. steel industry has reduced energy usage by 31 percent since 1990, and its greenhouse emissions by about one-third in the same period, any climate-change bill would hurt the industry's competitiveness and hurt jobs, Gravatt said.
\
If manufacturers are less competitive, then business likely would go to China or India, where environmental regulations are more lax and global pollution would increase, Gravatt said.
\
""We'd lose on both fronts -- the jobs first and then the environment,"" Gravatt said.
\
Unfair trade has been a big issue for the industry, which won several complaints it has filed with the Department of Commerce against China for dumping steel products in the United States at prices below fair-market value or for selling products subsidized by China.
\
Surma said this week in Pittsburgh that U.S. Steel supports free trade. The company can compete and get its share of the market, as long as it is fair trade.
\
The industry needs the federal government to address the issue of China manipulating its currency -- allowing it to remain cheaper than the dollar -- so that its imports are less expensive here, Gravatt said.
\
""China is manipulating its currency for its exports, and that's quite an advantage for their manufacturers,"" Gravatt said.

197,"This should be the summer of our discontent, with heat waves, drought and other troublesome weather affecting large parts of the nation. Instead, Americans are hot but apparently not bothered about what it all might mean.\According to a new Washington Post-Stanford University poll, just 18 percent of Americans interviewed named climate change as the world's top environmental problem. In 2007, when Al Gore's warning documentary and a United Nations report were making headlines, 33 percent called climate change the top issue.\Like so much on this topic, the findings of the poll are contradictory. It's not as if people don't care about the environment; the top concern, as expressed by 27 percent of those surveyed, was polluted water and air -- certainly real challenges.\And those polled don't dismiss climate change or even mankind's hand in it; in fact, nearly three-quarters believe that the Earth is warming and approximately the same number think temperatures will continue to rise if nothing is done. Many want government and businesses to do more.\The poll and follow-up interviews suggest that people are looking to Washington, D.C., for leadership and action, although, after seeing little or none, they are not consumed by a sense of urgency.\For its part, the Republican Party is filled with climate change skeptics who claim that global warming is an environmentalist plot to justify higher taxes and limit freedom. Hardly a week goes by in Congress without a new conservative attack on the Environmental Protection Agency's duty to curb greenhouse gases. This, in turn, has stymied the Obama administration and congressional Democrats, who have attempted, so far unsuccessfully, to pass ""cap and trade"" legislation to limit pollution.\The oddity is that, while reactionary politics rule in the nation's capital, ordinary Americans have embraced green initiatives, from using recycled bags at the grocery story to buying fuel-efficient cars. Green buildings are increasingly the norm, a trend in which Pittsburgh, formerly the smoky city, has been in the vanguard.\People get it, but the politicians and talking heads lag behind. Indeed, Americans have to be wilfully stubborn or obtuse not to get it -- increasingly it's about whom you are going to believe, Rush Limbaugh or the evidence of your own eyes (not to mention the vast body of scientific opinion).\One doesn't have to look far. Pittsburgh, which has been in the grip of furnace-like heat, has recorded the warmest first half of the year since records began in 1948. From January to June, the average temperature has been 51.3 degrees, 4.7 degrees above average. Slightly less than 56 percent of the country is in a drought.\Nobody can say with certainty that this or that day is the result of global warming (the inexact term for climate change, which includes other types of severe weather, tornadoes, hurricanes, even snowstorms). But the trends will tell the tale, and it seems the predictions for climate change are being fulfilled.\Public complacency on this issue comes at just the wrong time. This is a presidential election year and it should be a referendum on a number of key issues, including health care reform. Add to the list the health of the planet, which shows every sign of being wracked by fever."
198,"Even those who don't believe in global warming are now forced to acknowledge its power. For the first time, it became the decisive issue in a high-profile presidential endorsement.\New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg last week endorsed President Barack Obama, saying that Superstorm Sandy had reshaped his thinking about the race and climate change was the main reason. The mayor, a Republican turned independent, referred to efforts Mr. Obama has made to curb greenhouse gases.\In linking the storm's impact to global warming, Mr. Bloomberg joined New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who said earlier in the week, ""Anyone who says that there's not a dramatic change in weather patterns I think is denying reality.""\The devastation hit some 19 states, causing homes to collapse, 8.5 million people to lose power and more than 100 people to die. It brought storm surges of an unprecedented 14 feet. But some conservative websites pounced on the idea of a link to global warming. ""Famed climatologists Mike Bloomberg and Andrew Cuomo blame Sandy on climate change,"" scoffed one. Fox News offered the headline ""Scientists dispute politicians' claims that global warming grew Sandy,"" while linking to a New York Times blog post that's far more nuanced.\Here's how the president-elect of the American Meteorological Society, J. Marshall Shepherd, explains such denials. Quoting author Upton Sinclair, Mr. Shepherd told New York blogger Kevin Powell: "" 'It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on him not understanding it.' There are sectors of our society that have a vested interest in creating confusion and misinformation on the topic, even as the overwhelming majority of scientists and published literature are clear.""\So what is the superstorm's connection to global warming? I write this, at the risk of being mocked as another ""noted climatologist,"" because, like many other non-scientists, I've been struggling to understand the recent spate of severe storms, tsunamis, tornadoes, hurricanes and cyclones, and the warm winters, dry springs and other sometimes-cataclysmic weather anomalies.\To synthesize what I've learned: Hurricanes, tornadoes and other storms are caused by changes in heat and water evaporation. Scientists believe that as air and sea temperatures rise, hurricanes will be stronger and wetter. That's because water expands with heating, oceans absorb more heat than land does, and warmer air can hold more moisture. Melting glaciers also add to rising sea levels. The temperature in the western Atlantic Ocean reportedly is 5 degrees above normal for this time of year.\Frances Beinecke, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, blames climate change for ""swelling our seas, so that storm surges are higher and cause more flooding."" In a blog she wrote, ""From Norfolk, Va., to Boston, sea levels are rising four times as fast as the global average. Hurricane Sandy cut right along those swollen seas.""\Though climate changes occur naturally, the pace has been accelerating so transformations that took tens or hundreds of thousands of years now happen over decades. That's because of increased greenhouse gases from the release of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and chlorofluorocarbons. They result from burning coal and gasoline, cutting down rainforests that act as shields and dumping methane gases from animal waste (such as hog confinements) into the environment.\That's 90 million tons of global-warming pollution every day, according to former Vice President Al Gore.\Carbon pollution can be cut by replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy. But the Natural Resources Defense Council says, ""First, we need national leadership that will stop ignoring what the Earth and scientists are telling us about climate change.""\Mr. Shepherd calls on the public to press policymakers for solutions, such as cap and trade, carbon taxes and carbon capture. Most Americans now believe in global warming. While deniers may have a vested interest in cutting back on fossil fuels, even leaders who court business and industry should consider the financial costs. The damage from Sandy is now expected to reach $50 billion."
199,"
Sometimes, it's possible to do well by doing good. Legislation currently under consideration in Congress to address climate change would do just that. It would be good for our magnificent environment, our local economy, and our future -- all while doing good for the whole world. It's time for both of Pennsylvania's senators to step forward and do right by Pennsylvania as they do the right thing.
\
I am neither an engineer nor a climate scientist, but as a leader in the Jewish community, I join with many faith leaders across Pennsylvania and the rest of our nation in recognizing climate change as one of the most daunting moral challenges of our time. As Jews, we are called to be faithful to God ""l'olam va-ed"" -- forever and further; we keep our covenant ""l'dor va-dor,"" from generation to generation. It is both unwise and unethical for us to squander energy today and to leave our children's generation to clean up the mess we leave.
\
Gradual pollution reduction
\
Fortunately, bipartisan legislation in the U.S. Senate sponsored by Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.), Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) and John Warner (R-Va.) would cut carbon emissions 2 percent per year. The plan would accomplish this by rewarding innovation through a cap and trade policy, under which companies could reduce pollution themselves or if they cannot meet their required reduction, they could buy credits from companies which have cut pollution more than required.
\
As has been the case with all our most important environmental laws, such as the Clear Air Act, Endangered Species Act, Clean Water Act, this plan has substantial support from both Democrats and Republicans. However, one of our senators, Arlen Specter, is not supporting this bipartisan measure.
\
Why should Mr. Specter and Pennsylvanians, in general, support the Lieberman-Boxer-Warner plan? It cuts the carbon pollution that comes from burning oil and frees the market to pick the best way to do it. This would encourage businesses to invest in innovation and create economic opportunities, while making us less dependent on foreign oil.
\
Under this new cap, companies would be rewarded for shifting away from fuels like oil, which give off high levels of greenhouse gases, to cleaner energy sources including wind power, biodiesel, and solar. An increased demand for energy efficiency would spur businesses to cater to the new market by developing new, energy- efficient products, and creating new manufacturing jobs in Pennsylvania, in addition to across the country.
\
Even before the Lieberman-Boxer-Warner bill is passed, businesses across Pennsylvania are already developing new technology and renewable fuels. This has created new opportunities for companies like Lake Erie Biofuels, which produces biodiesel and HydroGen, near Pittsburgh, which manufactures hydrogen fuel cells. Wind energy company Gamesa has set up manufacturing plants in Bucks and Cambria counties and solar power company Mesa Energy LLC has set up shop in Chester County. With the help of the Lieberman-Boxer-Warner plan, Pennsylvania could become one of the nation's powerhouses of clean energy - and workers across our state would benefit.
\
Natural assets at risk
\
If, on the other hand, we do nothing, Pennsylvania's great natural beauty, enjoyed by so many of us and supporting some 60,000 jobs, will surely suffer. A poll of Keystone State sportsmen shows fully three-quarters have observed changes in climate conditions where they live, such as warmer, shorter winters, hotter summers, earlier spring and less snow. Hunting, fishing, hiking, gardening, farming, even our glorious fall foliage will all be harmed. Worse, if we don't act, one study predicts higher temperatures could mean a near doubling of heat-related deaths annually in Philadelphia, and a more than doubling of bad air quality days in Pittsburgh, worsening respiratory conditions, such as asthma.
\
The Book of Proverbs teaches the prudent person sees trouble and takes cover, while the foolish one keeps going and pays the penalty. We hope that Mr. Specter takes the prudent course, while there is still time to reverse the destructive effects of global warming and reduce carbon emissions. Help keep faith with future generations by contacting Mr. Specter, and urging him to do the right thing by supporting the Lieberman-Warner climate change bill in the United States Senate.

I read with great interest David Conti's recent articles ""Observers mixed on grid backup amid carbon rules, natural gas uncertainty"" (July 28 and TribLIVE.com) and ""EPA hearings to bring coal debate to Pittsburgh streets"" (July 29 and TribLIVE.com). Our region is clearly at a crossroads with regard to our energy future and the direction we take will determine the strength of our economy for years.
\
The history of Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania is built on a foundation of coal. In the 19th century, coal helped drive the industrialization that put Pittsburgh on the map; it fueled the steel industry that made Pittsburgh the city it is today.
\
Roughly 40 percent of the commonwealth's power comes from coal-fired plants, which provide affordable, reliable electricity. That affordable electricity, combined with a pro-business environment and an outstanding workforce, makes Pittsburgh an attractive home for the diverse and energy-intensive businesses of the Steel City's economy.
\
It is not just businesses that benefit. For consumers, coal-fired power means paying less to heat their homes. That was particularly important during last winter's polar vortex, when plunging temperatures drove demand for electricity through the roof. Industry experts have stated that the vast majority of this demand was met by coal-fired power. And although some consumers were shocked by their utility bills, without coal it would have been far worse.
\
Despite this, however, the federal Environmental Protection Agency has announced it will pursue new rules that would effectively force coal plants out of business -- and to do so, it's bypassing Congress and going through President Obama's pen. The EPA's decision isn't surprising. After all, what it's proposing is similar to the gargantuan ""cap and trade"" bill that Congress rejected in 2009 -- and the current Congress is no more likely to pass anything like it.
\
It's also unsurprising given that when he was running for the White House, Barack Obama promised the public a plan ""under which electricity prices would necessarily skyrocket."" He's finally delivering. A future with no coal means a future with fewer jobs -- not just jobs at coal plants that will be destroyed, but also jobs of workers who will be laid off when small-business owners are forced to choose between making payroll and keeping the lights on.
\
If we can't use coal, we'll be forced to turn to alternatives like ""renewable"" wind and solar and natural gas. The Marcellus Shale has been an economic boon for our state. But whereas coal is used almost exclusively for power, natural gas is used for power, heat, as a feedstock in the chemical industry, and to power vehicles. As a result, and even with the bounty of the Marcellus, some experts wonder whether we've got enough gas to meet all of our needs. Worse, the environmentalists who are leading the crusade against coal have made it clear that gas is their next target.
\
That leaves us with ""renewables."" These sources can't generate power on demand like coal. We have nothing else that can generate power affordably and reliably, while supporting thousands of good-paying jobs. No wonder concerned citizens are gathering this week to unite their voices and tell the EPA that they, their families and their communities count on coal every day.

201,"The majority of Pennsylvanians support decisive action on climate change and a steady transition to renewable energy, a new poll indicates.\Seventy-three percent of Pennsylvanians surveyed in mid-February said they're concerned climate change will ""negatively impact"" their children and grandchildren, according to a poll conducted by Susquehanna Polling and Research and released by Clean Jobs for Pennsylvania and PennFuture.\The results mirror those of similar surveys conducted in the past year, suggesting that Keystone State residents are willing to make personal sacrifices in favor of alternative energy.\Nearly half of respondents were registered Democrats – and 39% Republicans – although more than one-third considered themselves independent or politically unaffiliated.\When asked if they would support a clean energy standard in Pennsylvania if it increased their electric bills by less than $5 a month, 65% of the 700 people surveyed said yes, including 87% of Democrats, 35% of Republicans and 71% of self-identified ""swing"" voters surveyed.\""Support for stronger state action is broad-based and includes majorities of voters in all political parties,"" said James Lee, president of Susquehanna Polling and Research in Harrisburg, in a statement.\As Pennsylvania moves to join the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a cap-and-trade program presented by Gov. Tom Wolf, 59% of those polled said they would support a proposed fund to help displaced fossil fuel workers during the transition. Additionally, 70% said they want lawmakers to better assist local communities hurt by layoffs at coal-fired power plants.\""...This poll shows that Pennsylvanians are serious about transitioning to a clean energy economy,"" said PennFuture President and CEO Jacquelyn Bonomo.

U.S. Rep. Tim Holden's decisive victory in Tuesday's election wasn't about the national mood, experts say.
\
It wasn't even about his stances against unpopular Democratic legislation like health care reform.
\
Holden, D-17, won by more than 23,000 votes mostly because of his personality, according to G. Terry Madonna, director of the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Franklin & Marshall College, Lancaster.
\
""He's Mr. Everyman,"" Madonna said of Holden in an interview Wednesday afternoon. ""He understood his problem right from the start and went after it. He knew what he had to do - he had to present the point that he's a local guy.""
\
In Tuesday's general election, Saint Clair native Holden defeated another Schuylkill County son, state Sen. David Argall, R-29, by a huge margin.
\
In the duo's home county, Holden won by more than 12,000 votes. Holden also racked up huge totals in Dauphin County, beating Argall by nearly 14,000 votes.
\
Argall won the three other counties in the 17th Congressional District - Lebanon County and parts of Berks and Perry - but those victories weren't enough to mitigate losses in Dauphin and Schuylkill.
\
Holden's victory came amid massive Democratic losses in House races across the country. The GOP recaptured control of that body, including victories over nearby incumbent U.S. Reps. Paul Kanjorski and Chris Carney, both Democrats.
\
At this point in his political career, Holden is all but invincible, according to Christopher Borick, political analyst and associate professor of political science at Muhlenberg College, Allentown.
\
""It sure looks like he's in that nearly unbeatable position. Surviving in horrific conditions for Democrats rather easily ... is a sign of strength,"" Borick said in an interview Wednesday. ""Holden has always been seen as someone who is ethically strong. He's looked at as an honest guy. He's about as squeaky clean as they come.""
\
The GOP strategy of pitting a popular Schuylkill County Republican - Argall has served 25 years in the state Legislature; until Tuesday, he'd never lost an election - against Holden to counter the incumbent's local popularity didn't work, leading some to believe that no matter the Republican momentum, Holden can't be beat.
\
""Is he unbeatable in a hostile national environment? Yes,"" Madonna said.
\
While his personality played a big role, Holden's voting record was equally important.
\
Unlike Kanjorski and Carney, Holden voted against health care reform and the cap-and-trade energy legislation.
\
""Tim Holden voted against health care, the big issue that was capable of creating enormous problems for him,"" Madonna said.
\
""In a year where a lot of Democrats paid a price for their votes in Congress, Holden's ability to insulate himself by casting conservative votes made all of the difference,"" Borick said.
\
That calculated vote, Madonna said, was part of a three-pronged re-election strategy.
\
In addition to his ""everyman"" image and opposing unpopular Democratic initiatives, Madonna said the other key to Holden's win was money.
\
Just after conceding to Holden on election night, Argall admitted he had been outspent ""4 or 5 to 1"" in television and radio advertising.
\
Argall raised $319,702 while Holden raised $1.2 million, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission.
\
After Tuesday's election, Holden reiterated his desire to reach across the aisle and work with Republicans. Because the GOP will now control the House, Holden will no longer be chairman of the House Conservation, Credit, Energy and Research subcommittee. Instead, he'll be the ranking Democrat.
\
Still, Holden said he has already spoken with Republican colleagues on the House Agriculture Committee, including U.S. Rep. Frank Lucas, R-Okla.
\
""He said, 'You've always treated me with respect,'"" Holden said Wednesday, recounting a conversation with Lucas shortly after Tuesday's election returns came in.
\
Holden also said he plans to continue his career in Congress and work with Republican counterparts ""as long as the people of the 17th District want to me to do it.
\
""I enjoy what I'm doing,"" he said.

"
203,"Gov. Tom Wolf wants to cut carbon emissions from the electricity sector by joining the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), a cap-and-trade system across 11 Northeastern states that puts a price on carbon emitted by their electric power plants. Members of the business community are skeptical because pricing carbon will raise electricity prices for households and businesses. (The state estimates that auctions of RGGI emissions rights will raise some $300 million a year in revenue.) Republicans in the state legislature are skeptical, too. If they win the governorship in 2022, then they could withdraw from RGGI, meaning that the next few years will be filled with exactly the kind of uncertainty that paralyzes business investment and economic growth.\There might be a way to avoid all this drama, a way to make progress on climate change that respects the budget constraints facing Pennsylvania households and businesses. It’s faster and stronger than RGGI, and in the long run, it will reduce regressive taxes on electricity. Accomplishing all that may sound impossible, but it might be done with a simple tax reform two-step.\The first step is to cut taxes: eliminate the state’s 5.9% gross receipts tax on electric utilities. Although this tax is formally levied on the utilities, they pass the tax along to consumers. (If you need convincing, just look at your bill.) Eliminating this tax will save taxpayers some $900 million a year, according to the state Tax Compendium.\The second step — and this is where the carbon reduction happens — is to impose a carbon tax on electric utilities in Pennsylvania based on the carbon content of the power they deliver to customers. A carbon tax of $20 per metric ton of CO2, for example, amounts to about 2 cents per kilowatthour of coal-fired power, half that for natural gas, and nothing for wind, solar, hydro, or nuclear power. That’s more than double the carbon price that’s likely to come from RGGI, where prices are stuck in the single digits. (At least one RGGI state, New York, is considering layering an additional carbon price on top of RGGI.)\Putting a strong price on carbon will give utilities a financial incentive to speed up the shift to renewables. Until that shift is complete, though, utilities would have to pay the carbon tax, a burden that would likely get passed along to customers. As it turns out, a $20 carbon tax on electricity in Pennsylvania would generate about $900 million a year. In the short run, then, you’d move one step forward and one step back: $900 million in carbon taxes instead of $900 million in gross receipts taxes.\As time passes, though, the carbon tax will push utilities to shift away from fossil fuels. If and when they do so entirely, there will be no more electric-sector carbon emissions, and consequently, no more $900 million in tax revenue. That’s a long-term victory for taxpayers, especially low-income households. It’s doubly good for emissions reductions: carbon-free electricity is a huge win, and electrifying other sectors like transportation will be easier if electricity is cheaper. It’s also a manageable budget problem for state legislators. Pennsylvania’s General Fund takes in over $30 billion in taxes every year, so they’ll have to adjust to a long-run revenue loss of about 3%. (That’s roughly equal to the value of the state’s sales tax exemption for groceries. While taxes on groceries disproportionately burden the poor, taxes on residential electricity are even more regressive.)\Republican legislators could pass this tax swap as part of a package deal that also blocks RGGI, for example, by requiring legislative approval to join. Democrats, including Gov. Wolf, could support it as a way to supercharge climate action while also cutting regressive taxes. The business community would get a policy environment with less uncertainty and more efficiency. It’s not a free lunch, but it’s pretty close.\Yoram Bauman is an environmental economist who focuses on state-level climate policy. Will Delavan is an associate professor of economics at Lebanon Valley\College."
204,"In a political season full of tumult and angst for Democratic incumbents, U.S. Rep. Mike Doyle is sitting pretty.\The lawmaker from Forest Hills is seeking his ninth term representing the 14th Congressional District, which includes Pittsburgh and parts of western, southern and eastern Allegheny County -- an overwhelmingly Democratic constituency of 50 communities.\Unlike many pols who have been in office a long time, there are no hints that Mr. Doyle, 57, is approaching his expiration date. Still, even an effective congressman should expect a challenge on Election Day, and in a year when it seems anything can happen in politics, Mr. Doyle's two opponents are a caution against complacency.\Melissa Haluszczak, the Republican nominee, is running to become ""a new voice in Washington,"" a theme that may resonate more outside her district than inside. The paralegal from Coraopolis has never held elected office and she says she isn't beholden to her party, describing herself as a ""small R"" Republican.\While downplaying her GOP allegiance, Ms. Haluszczak, 42, was a tea party organizer in 2009. She favors repeal of the federal health insurance reform and supports extension of the Bush-era tax cuts, including those to rich Americans, whom she calls the ""job creators."" She doesn't believe the science on global warming is settled and says pro-environment proposals like ""cap and trade"" would only raise energy prices. She advocates tough immigration legislation with no amnesty for illegals and would like to see the overturn of the Roe v. Wade abortion decision.\The third candidate is Ed Bortz, 62, of the North Side. Although the Green Party activist worked as an electrician for most of his life, he spends much of his time writing poems and essays. Like the Republican, he is a political newcomer. He would address the budget deficit by slashing military spending 50 percent and bringing the troops home from Iraq and Afghanistan immediately. He favors a single-payer system for health insurance and leniency on immigration. Mr. Bortz believes global warming is man-made and that fossil fuels, along with nuclear power, must be phased out.\Such opposition leaves Mr. Doyle the moderate in the race. As a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, he helped draft legislation aimed at reducing global warming without hurting jobs. He insists that the United States must lead in the development of green energy technologies instead of leaving the field to other countries. He says that coal, gas and oil should not be shut down, but reduced over time as major sources of energy; he favors more reliance on nuclear power and renewable sources.\While an advocate of single-payer health insurance, he defends the strides made by the Obama reform, like allowing young adults to stay on their parents' policies longer and barring pre-existing conditions from being a barrier to coverage. He acknowledged the law's complexity, though, and said Congress must work on the issue of cost.\He agreed with Ms. Haluszczak that the United States should not spend any more time nation-building in Afghanistan and with Mr. Bortz that the Bush tax cuts should be extended for everyone except those in households with incomes of $250,000 or more. He and Mr. Bortz are comfortable with Roe v. Wade.\Mr. Doyle has used his tenure to become an effective and outspoken advocate for his district and a legislator with the kind of seniority to shape critical legislation. That makes his service a real benefit to Pittsburgh-area constituents. Mike Doyle has earned the Post-Gazette's endorsement."
205,"
To the Editor:
\
I am writing in response to the article in Monday's Republican-Herald titled ""Climate bill spurs concern."" I feel compelled to correct what I feel are many ""mistruths"" that were stated in that article.
\
First of all, global warming is a very real and scary threat to all humanity that should not be taken lightly or put on the back burner behind the private interests of the coal industry. Facts are facts, and science is science and cannot be disputed. Most scientists have come to the consensus that global warming is very real. It is also a fact that carbon emissions are the biggest cause of global warming, and the coal industry is the biggest contributor, responsible for approximately one-third of the United States' carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions (contrary to what was stated in Monday's article, oil is second, but substantially more depleted in supply).
\
The head of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies reported to Washington in December 2008 and stated that coal is responsible for as much atmospheric CO2 as all other fossil fuels combined and is even more of a long-term threat given the earth's enormous coal reserves.
\
As far as other countries go, in a perfect world they, too, would implement the same standards as the United States hopefully will, but since 25 percent of the Earth's greenhouse gasses come from the U.S. and we make up only 5 percent of the world's population, I think we should take the lead. The United States has always been a world leader and could take the lead on clean energy initiatives as well. If we wait for everyone else to do it first, it could be too late.
\
Coal companies are owned by a handful of already very wealthy people who only stand to gain millions, even billions more at the expense of all living things. The lure of jobs and money should NOT compensate for the harm that could result. I, too, had family who worked tirelessly in the coal industry for pay that did not make up for the health problems and long-term results. Today, cheaper and far cleaner energy alternatives exist which would also generate jobs and improve the economy. These initiatives cannot move forward or be made more affordable and accessible without a push from government to cap and trade CO2 emissions or require them to be captured and stored (which no commercial plants presently do.)
\
Each day as I pass the sign on Route 61 near Pottsville which states ""Clean Coal, Mother Nature's Fuel"" it is an insult to my intelligence, and should be to every other person who reads it. There is no such thing as clean coal, and without the passing of The American Clean Energy and Security Act, HR 2454, it will be even further from reality. Please, Rep. Holden, reconsider your stance on HR 2454 for the health and welfare of your constituents. And just for arguments' sake, let's say there is only a miniscule chance that global warming is real and potentially very harmful to humanity. I ask, why would we take that chance?

206," The state Senate this week passed legislation it claims will clean up Pennsylvania's environment without raising electric customers utility bills. The bill aims to block the Rendell administration's attempt to impose stricter mercury cleanup regulations on coal-fired power plants than the federal government requires. On this one, the Senate is wrong and the Rendell administration is right.\ The administration favors a ""state-specific"" approach. The Senate version parallels the federal appproach. The Senate legislation passed 40-10, a vote that should make the state's electric companies temporarily happy. But, by adopting the federal mercury rules, the Senate doesn't pave the way for a cleaning up Pennsylvania. Instead, it creates a situation where mercury pollution here could go unaddressed. That's because the Bush administration's interpretation of the Clean Air Act would allow electric companies to buy ""credits"" from electric generators in other states that already meet mercury standards without having to do anything about emissions here.\ The Senate's decision to push through its bill doesn't make sense for other reasons. For instance, it tries to preclude independent hearings on the matter scheduled next month by the state Environmental Quality Board. Worse, it ignores the fact that Pennsylvania has joined more than a dozen other states in challenging the Bush administration's interpretation in federal court.\ At issue is a regulatory tool known as ""cap-and-trade,"" which allows polluters to buy credits, and avoid the expense of cleaning up their own operations, from companies that more than meet pollution standards. This technique might make sense globally, but not in just one state. And, the way the Clean Air Act is written, this tool is supposed to be used for ""criteria"" pollutants such as sulfur, but not ""toxic"" pollutants, such as mercury.\ There's good reason for this. Mercury is a neurotoxin capable of affecting the development of fetuses and permanently impairing a child's mental development. Although mercury is a naturally occurring element, when it's emitted by coal-fired power plants, municipal and hospital waste incinerators, and cement kilns, it's in a form that can pollute water and be absorbed by fish and plants that people eat. Pennsylvania has the second-highest level of mercury contamination in the nation. There already are health advisories on how much fish people can safely eat from many of the state's waterways.\ The Senate passed the bill even though physician groups, environmentalists, sportsmen and other concerned citizens argued against it. Fortunately, Rep. William F. Adolph Jr., R-Delaware, chairman of the House Environmental Resources and Energy Committee, said Tuesday, ""We must do better than the federal regulation."" Area Democratic Reps. Bob Freeman of Easton and Jennifer Mann of Allentown are members of this panel. The House must lead the way to a compromise that better protects the health of Pennsylvanians."
207,"""KOCHLAND: THE SECRET HISTORY OF KOCH INDUSTRIES AND CORPORATE POWER IN AMERICA"" By Christopher Leonard. Simon & Schuster ($35)\Koch Industries is one of the largest privately owned companies in the world. The conglomerate's businesses include oil refineries, nitrogen fertilizer, microchips, paper products, fibers, building materials, greeting cards and derivatives trading. Annual revenues are larger than Facebook, Goldman Sachs and U.S. Steel combined. Charles and the recently deceased David Koch (pronounced Coke), who own 80% of Koch Industries, are worth about $120 billion.\The Koch brothers are best known, of course, for creating and funding a constellation of think tanks, university-based programs, a political proxy group (Americans for Prosperity) and lobbyists to protect and promote their interests and their philosophy of unfettered free market capitalism.\In ""Kochland: The Secret History of Koch Industries and Corporate Power in America,"" business reporter Christopher Leonard draws on dozens of interviews with current and former employees of Koch Industries, politicians, regulators, bankers and competitors, and internal company documents, legal transcripts and government records to provide an extraordinarily detailed, illuminating and, at times, terrifying account of the massive impact of a corporate industrial giant on American society.\""Kochland"" is not without flaws. A skilled copy editor should have corrected Mr. Leonard's grammatical mistakes and shaved the manuscript by at least 100 pages. And, at times, Mr. Leonard seems to accept at face value the claims of people he interviewed.\That said, ""Kochland's"" examination of the culture, norms and practices of Koch Industries is a tour de force of investigative journalism. Mr. Leonard acknowledges that Charles Koch, chairman and CEO, is a brilliant businessman, willing to subordinate quarterly profits and revenue targets to a long view, with a management philosophy grounded in a reverence for free-market capitalism.\Most of the book, however, reveals the price our country has paid for the concentration of economic power in the hands of men like Charles Koch. Mr. Leonard documents how the company made millions in the 1980s by underreporting the amount of oil its gaugers removed from Indian reservations in Oklahoma.\He tells the story of Heather Faragher, a wastewater engineer at Koch Industries' Pine Bend refinery, who tried to stop the company from violating limits on hazardous waste and water pollution. As she ""saw firsthand how toxic a workplace could become when everyone spoke the same language and thought the same way,"" Ms. Faragher challenged the culture from inside, took her concerns to the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, was shunned by management, negotiated a severance package, and never found another job in Minnesota, where she had hoped to raise her infant daughter.\Mr. Leonard reads into the record other incidents of lawbreaking (including illegal sales of electricity by Koch traders in collaboration with their counterparts at Enron), all of them caused by ""a bias toward maximizing profits and by a general disdain for government."" He chronicles the decline of the once powerful Inland Boatman's Union, whose leaders found they no longer had any leverage in contract negotiations with Koch's lawyers. And Mr. Leonard provides statistical evidence of the dramatic increase in injuries (and its close correlation with a speedup in production) at Georgia-Pacific, a wood and paper products company acquired by Koch in 2003.\""Kochland"" also includes an in-depth analysis of the company's outsized influence on government legislation. To defeat the Waxman-Markey cap and trade bill, designed to limit carbon emissions, Mr. Leonard reveals, Koch lobbyists put pressure on moderate Republicans in the U.S. House and Senate by packing town hall meetings with angry constituents, who had been coached to shout that global warming was ""a hoax.""\Five years after the bill died in the Senate, carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere hovered around 400 parts per million, well above the levels needed to avoid destructive impacts on the environment. These days, Koch works closely with EPA staff to roll back regulations on greenhouse gases.\To defeat President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act, lobbyists coached town hall protestors to exclaim that the legislation allowed the federal government to plant microchips in the bodies of patients to allow officials to monitor the population. Although the ACA passed, Koch lobbyists continue their efforts in state legislatures, Congress and the courts to gut it.\Charles Koch, Mr. Leonard emphasizes, continues his battle to ensure that American society reflects his values. ""Kochland,"" however, makes a compelling case that, in contrast to the iconic ad for a carbonated beverage, things do not go better with Koch.\CREDIT: By Glenn C. Altschuler

REVIEW"
208,"
Political conventions aren't as glamorous as you might think.
\
On TV, the conventions are all about the slick packaging of beautiful people. But on the streets outside the convention hall, the gathering looks an awful lot like the creature cantina scene from Star Wars - you know, the bar on Mos Eisley where all the freaky aliens drink and argue and get into fights.
\
This year's event in Denver is packed with even more aliens than usual. There's the impeachment crowd, wandering the city's streets with dueling placards.
\
Some call on Congress to ""Impeach Bush."" Others urge that we ""Impeach Cheney First."" There are the Code Pink activists, who meandered through the popular 16th Street Market over the weekend with giant, carnival-style puppets, which are somehow supposed to symbolize a call for world peace.
\
Then there are the hard-core protesters. Denver's Gumm Mixed Martial Arts Gym has been offering self-defense training to radical groups such as DNC Disruption '08.
\
The radicals believe they need to protect themselves from the police because the city recently converted a warehouse on the far end of town to serve as a processing facility for people who get themselves arrested this week.
\
Protesters actually showed up a week before the convention to protest the jail they might get sent to for later protesting. They've dubbed the facility ""Gitmo on the Platte.""
\
But here's the really freaky part: These groups are all made up of people who believe that Barack Obama's Democratic Party - which wants to raise taxes, ensure abortion on demand, create a crippling carbon cap-and-trade regime, commence a rapid pullout from Iraq, and abandon U.S. allies from Israel to Georgia - isn't liberal enough.
\
Of course, like all towns that host conventions, the Mile High City is trying to put its best foot forward. To that end, a panel of local officials passed a nonbinding resolution urging police to ""refrain from arresting or citing pot smokers during the convention.""
\
They know their audience.
\
To be extra hospitable, the city is trying to keep its socially conscious, pot-smoking guests from having to encounter any of Denver's great unwashed.
\
Local groups have given away movie and zoo tickets to the city's homeless for the week - as well as bus passes. For any homeless who decline to make themselves scarce, a downtown salon is giving free haircuts and shaves to the indigent. Imagine the outcry if Republicans tried this sort of thing.
\
Being a Democrat means never having to feel embarrassed. Every spare bit of convention paraphernalia and signage here is hectoring people about being ""green.""
\
Yet convention officials are zipping around town in big, black SUVs. Don't worry, though, the Democrats assure us, they're hybrids. To highlight this fact, each SUV has the word HYBRID stenciled under the door panels in giant letters.
\
Of course, if the Democrats really cared about the environment, Obama wouldn't be giving his acceptance speech Thursday in front of 75,000 people at Invesco Field. Just think about the impact: transportation for 50,000 extra attendees, additional power usage for the giant stadium, the need to create redundant logistical systems for setup, credentialing, security, etc. I suppose it's a small price to pay for what blogger Scott Johnson playfully dubbed the Democratischeparteitag der Einheit und Starke, or ""Democratic Party Rally Day of Unity and Strength.""
\
The question is how much unity there will be. Today is Hillary Day at the convention, and the senator will give an afternoon speech to Emily's List and a prime-time performance on the PepsiCenter's main stage. She has endured a string of snubs from Obama and his supporters in recent weeks, including the disclosure that she was not even considered for the vice-presidential slot.
\
What will she do?
\
Yesterday, Clinton made her first appearance at the convention. She said all the right things - calling for unity and claiming that it was important to elect a Democratic president. But she had not a single positive recommendation to make for Obama himself.
\
It looks as if her remarks may be designed to assuage conventiongoers, but not Democratic voters who have substantive concerns about Obama. It's a delicate dance.
\
Never a dull moment at the creature cantina.

be for community water supply systems that straddle the Basin boundary.
\
Establish a state water resources inventory for each member state within five years.
\
Require any person/entity seeking to withdraw 100,000 gallons or more of water from the Great Lakes Basin within an average 30-day period to register this activity with the appropriate state.
\
Each state and province will establish a program, including thresholds, to manage or regulate new or increased withdrawals, consumptive uses and diversions; establish water conservation and efficient use programs; and conduct periodic assessments of the cumulative impacts.
\
Create the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Basin Water Resources Council, consisting of the governors of the member states. In collaboration with Ontario and Quebec, the Council would assist with the coordination of activities and programs of the states, including providing advice and consultation.
\
Empire State Development Chairman Charles A. Gargano said, ""The formal enactment of the Compact is an important next step in the ongoing effort to preserve these tremendously valuable resources. Governor Pataki's leadership in helping to forge the agreement has been pivotal in moving this issue forward. The Great Lakes have been central to the life of their communities for generations, and this Compact will help to ensure that the Great Lakes will continue to be a popular tourist destination."" State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) Commissioner Denise M. Sheehan said, ""Governor Pataki is committed to improving the health of Lake Erie, Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River Basin because of its importance to New York State's economy, recreational opportunities, and ongoing enhancement of natural resources. Implementation of the Compact in New York State is another significant step in continuing to foster the protection of fish and wildlife, water quality, and habitat throughout the Great Lakes region.""
\
State Agriculture Commissioner Patrick H. Brennan said, ""Agriculture in Central and Western New York would not be what it is today without the clean water provided by the Great Lakes. Farmers in the region rely on nutrient rich soils lining the lakes, as well as lake effect precipitation to nourish their crops. I am pleased Governor Pataki has signed onto the Great Lakes Compact to ensure that farmers and New Yorkers will continue to be able to enjoy the lakes' beauty and all of their benefits.""
\
Henry Tepper, The Nature Conservancy's New York State Director said, ""The Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Basin Water Resources Compact is an historic opportunity to protect the world's largest fresh water ecosystem. The Nature Conservancy thanks Governor Pataki for his environmental leadership and looks forward to working with our government and non-government partners to implement the principles of the Compact so that sustainable water management practices are put in place. The outcome of the process is essential to millions of current and future New Yorkers who depend on the state's magnificent waters and abundant water-dependent natural resources."" John W. Lincoln, president of New York Farm Bureau, said, ""New York farm families rely on the productive soils of our state and the abundant water of the Great Lakes Basin to sustain our industry. Our member approved policy is clear, 'We support programs that will protect the water resources of the Great Lakes Basin from diversion to other parts of the country.'
\
To this end, we thank Governor Pataki for his continued defense of our industry.""
\
In 2001, Governor Pataki hosted the Great Lakes governors and premiers in Niagara Falls, where they signed the Great Lakes Annex 2001 amendment to the Great Lakes Charter. This document outlined the states' and provinces' commitment to develop and implement a common, resource-based conservation standard and apply it to new water withdrawal proposals from the Great Lakes Basin.
\
Following several years of extensive negotiations, the governors and premiers delivered on that promise and signed the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Basin Sustainable Water Resources Agreement in 2005. The Compact will enact this Agreement into New York State law is necessary to accomplish the commitment to protect the Great Lakes as a vital water resource.
\
Governor Pataki is a strong supporter of collaborative efforts to protect regional resources that are critical to our environment. In December 2005, he announced that New York and six other Northeast states had reached agreement on the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), the nation's first mandatory cap-and-trade program for carbon dioxide (CO2) emission from power plants in U.S. history. In addition to New York, other states signing the regional Memorandum of Understanding for RGGI are: Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, New Hampshire, New Jersey, and Vermont.

President Obama was soothing and hopeful on the economy during his State of the Union address. But reading between the lines, it was clear that Americans likely would suffer further pain but for little real gain.
\
A defiant Obama reasserted his determination to push on with his unpopular and divisive health care legislation, with the costly cap-and-trade energy policy and with a vastly expanded entitlement for all Americans to attend college. Without any realistic mention of costs or their financing, a damaging impression was given of incompetence and unreality.
\
The president, however, did highlight job creation and exports as key to national revival.
\
Job creation, or rather encouragement, is vital to the restoration of consumer demand, which currently makes up about 70 percent of the U.S. economy. Exports are key to cutting the massive trade deficit and the resulting drain on the nation's wealth.
\
There are two main economic types of jobs. The first is a real job that yields an economic added value net of all costs including financial reward and all benefits, use of space and equipment and management time and allocated fixed overhead. These jobs most often are created in the private sector and particularly by small businesses.
\
The only role that government can play is to encourage employers to expand, thereby opening more job opportunities. This is achieved by creating a vibrant economy, with healthy financial markets, low levels of regulation and the long-term continuity shown by clear leadership that allows entrepreneurs to see profitable opportunities and to plan expansion to meet them.
\
In short, government usually does not create real jobs. They can be encouraged only by a government offering a healthy economic environment that yields reasonable after-tax profit potential to risk-taking employers. These so-called private sector jobs are key to exports, the generation of national wealth and well-being.
\
However, government can create real jobs in the private sector by purchasing goods and services, for example, in defense or infrastructure. These jobs can be highly expansionary, acting as multipliers for economies. However, they must be financed by government sales -- such as road tolls or defense exports. Failing this, the private sector jobs created act as a drain on national wealth.
\
Public sector jobs, created by government, cost rather than earn money. So, when politicians talk of creating jobs, they are encumbering private sector wealth creators with more taxation and debt.
\
Despite their cost, the average American public sector employee earns about $71,000 per year with very liberal, often inflation-protected benefits. Yet the average American private sector employee earns only about $46,000 per year with far less generous benefits. Obama now intends to add to this favoritism of the public sector by skewing his lending terms for his universal college education in their favor.
\
It is estimated that America's infrastructure needs an investment of $1 trillion to meet current safety standards. On the bright side, it would create 3.5 million real jobs. Furthermore, the infrastructure requires a further $1 trillion to make it internationally competitive, leading to a further 3.5 million jobs. This total of 7 million real jobs would eradicate almost all the core level of unemployment and restore the vital consumer demand that the economy so desperately needs for healthy recovery.
\
The president has shown no inclination to concentrate on infrastructure spending but rather to plow further borrowed public dollars into expanding wealth-depleting entitlement programs. Meanwhile, real total unemployment has risen to 20 percent and is still rising.
\
Obama assured Americans that he would double exports within five years. The last time this was achieved was during a period of explosive world growth and it took 12 years.
\
Having exported most of America's manufacturing jobs, it is difficult to see the source of a massive increase in exports.
\
Speeches that sound good often are unsound in content. There is an urgent need not for fine speeches but for clear action pointing to smaller government, to free up a vast amount of money for investment in private sector jobs in infrastructure.
\
Only then will the pain inflicted on Americans be worthwhile.

211,"
In an ideal world, the vice presidential search would be a serious interview for the smartest expert, the most savvy policymaker, the most trusted adviser and the most dignified statesperson in the land. Here's the understatement of the year: Politics is not an ideal world.
\
Still, let us see how Joe Biden and Sarah Palin live up to these expectations.
\
The most important issues on the domestic agenda are the big E's: energy and the economy. As an Alaskan, Palin is no stranger to energy or the environment, both major issues at high latitudes. Despite this exposure, she sticks to the outdated, extreme school of thought that advocates drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and denies global warming is manmade -- despite evidence that the former would lower oil by only 75 cents 10 years from now and the latter has been repeatedly proven. Biden, on the other hand, follows the mainstream Democratic line: cap-and-trade, no drilling, and reduced oil subsidies.
\
Speaking of subsidies, Palin, supposedly the McCain-esque anti-spending crusader, just boasted of a new $500 million subsidy for a natural gas pipeline. Maybe you can live with a little hypocrisy, but what if I told you that she lobbied for $1,000 per capita in earmarks when she was mayor of Wasilla? Or that the state over which she now presides receives more money per capita in earmarks than any other state?
\
Not that Biden is much better after voting for this year's gargantuan farm bill. Just don't let Palin tell you she is a lifelong anti-pork warrior destined to slash Washington budgets.
\
On the economy, neither candidate stands apart from their party. Biden has a long record of working to end the Bush tax cuts, adopt universal health insurance and balance the budget -- all goals that this column has shown to be necessary. Palin's record is one of tax cuts and ... well, that's about it. To her credit, she did reduce spending in Alaska, though this column cannot report what programs were cut.
\
When it comes to foreign policy, Biden is a widely respected statesman, though not without his flaws. I could waste ink laying out Biden's positions, but I have nothing to compare them to. You would think that the media would have spent the last week prodding Palin and her aides for her positions on Iraq, Iran, Russia, China, military spending and the like. No, they are far too busy debating electoral math and teen pregnancy.
\
Given what we know now, Biden has a clear advantage in the ""smartest expert"" column. Let's hope that the moderators in the vice presidential debate dive deeper into the issues so we can make a better assessment.
\
On the ""most savvy policymaker"" count, Biden brings a quality reminiscent of Lyndon Johnson to Obama's Jack Kennedy. Johnson had more sway over the Senate than Biden has, but his influence throughout Congress is still a major asset to a President Obama working to pass big legislation.
\
Palin brings nothing of the sort to the McCain ticket. In her short time at the helm in Alaska, her only major legislative achievement was an ethics reform bill. This column fervently hopes she could bring a similar wake-up call to Washington, but Biden has a far better chance of passing Obama's ethics reform package than Palin's odds of doing the same for McCain.
\
As for ""most trusted adviser,"" all firsthand accounts suggest that McCain only met Palin a few times before selecting her. Though probably not best friends, Obama and Biden have worked together for the past few years in the Senate. Advantage Biden, though not by much.
\
Few vice presidents fit all categories perfectly, but every second-in-command must serve as the face of the administration to faraway countries and local town halls. And we ought not forget the vice president's only Constitutional obligation: Should the necessity arise, they can become the first-in-command.
\
Which is why most Americans place special importance on the ""most dignified statesperson"" role. We could debate this one endlessly because there is no yardstick for such a measurement. All we can do is watch their speeches and hope the debate gives them an opportunity to show their true colors.
\
But waiting for politicians to show their true colors is akin to asking them to put politics aside in choosing a vice president. They both belong to that imaginary ideal world.

212," President Bush has rejected imposing limits on carbon dioxide emissions, putting him at odds with a group of business and industry leaders who urged him yesterday to target pollution linked to global warming.\ Mr. Bush, in his State of the Union address tonight, will focus instead on promoting alternatives to fossil fuels, White House spokesman Tony Snow said. ""There's been some talk about, sort of, binding, economy-wide carbon caps in the speech, but they are not part of the president's proposal,"" he said in a briefing in Washington.\ Mr. Snow's comments came on the same day that executives of companies including General Electric Co., Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and Duke Energy Corp. put their support behind creation of a ""cap-and-trade"" system and setting a target of reducing so-called greenhouse gases by as much as 30 percent within 15 years.\ While Mr. Bush has acknowledged the need to address climate change, the president has resisted mandating limits on carbon dioxide emissions, arguing that it would be too costly\ The executives supporting the caps said reducing pollution linked to global warming can be done without harming the economy and may present opportunities for growth.\ ""There's a convergence between the science"" and ""what I would call a tapestry of regulatory activities going on,"" GE Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Immelt said at a Washington news conference yesterday. There's an overall ""mood change that people want to see action taking place.""\ Solutions to global warming ""will pose not only challenges, but also a number of opportunities,"" Lehman Chief Executive Richard Fuld said.\ GE, the world's No. 2 company by market value, and New York- based Lehman, the fourth-largest U.S. securities firm by market value, are among 10 companies in the newly formed U.S. Climate Action Partnership.\ The coalition's members also include Peoria, Illinois-based Caterpillar Inc., the world's largest maker of earthmoving equipment; as well as electric utilities Duke Energy, with headquarters in Charlotte, N.C.; San Francisco-based PG&E Corp.; Juno Beach, Fla.-based FPL Group Inc. and Albuquerque, N.M-based PNM Resources Inc.\ DuPont Co., the third-largest U.S. chemical maker, which is based in Wilmington, Del., , and New York-based Alcoa Inc., the world's biggest aluminum maker, also are part of the coalition. London- based BP Plc, Europe's second-largest oil company, is the one non- U.S. member.\ The companies say they want a standard on greenhouse gases, so they know how to proceed with their long-term investments.\ They also argue that they will seek to profit by developing technologies to curb emissions and by participating in new, market- based efforts to combat climate change.\ Scientists say carbon dioxide spewed from cars, power plants and other human sources is causing average global temperatures to increase, leading to a rise in sea levels and erratic and extreme weather.\ Leaders in the new Democratic-led Congress say legislation to deal with climate change will be a priority in coming months. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., last week announced creation of a new congressional mmittee that will focus solely on global warming.\ Exelon Corp., the largest U.S. utility by market value, and five other U.S. power producers are part of another business group that has endorsed emissions-cap legislation proposed by Democratic Sens. Dianne Feinstein of California and Tom Carper of Delaware.\ The group that includes GE and Lehman hasn't endorsed specific legislation.\ There are several other Senate initiatives to tackle global warming, including a measure introduced earlier this month that has the support of two potential presidential contenders --Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Democratic Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois.\ Mr. Snow said Mr. Bush wants an approach driven by innovation. ""The president has always believed, when it comes to climate change, that the best way to achieve reductions is through innovation, and to figure out ways to come up with energy sources that are going meet our economy's constant demand for energy and at the same time in a way that's going to be friendly for the environment,"" he said."
213,"Pennsylvania's climate action plan arrived just in time for Christmas, but it's already a year late. \The draft document -- an update of a 2009 plan to decrease greenhouse gas emissions in the state -- comes out of the Department of Environmental Protection. It's based on workplans recommended by a 15-person committee representing industry, government and nonprofits. \The legislation that required this report said the update should have been issued at the end of 2012. \The latest climate action plan proposes expanding natural gas distribution pipelines to give more Pennsylvanians access to the fuel. It also advocates encouraging operators of coal mines to capture some of the methane vented into the air before, during, or after mining activity. \Cecil-based Consol Energy is involved in two such projects, one active and one pending. The captured methane from its mines is being converted to carbon credits that will be sold in California, which has the only cap and trade market in the U.S. \Patrick Henderson, Pennsylvania's energy executive, ruled out the possibility of establishing a statewide carbon trading market, which would involve setting a cap on carbon emissions. \While the 2009 climate action plan set a 30 percent reduction target for emissions by 2020, the current draft has no such goal, which disappointed committee member Christina Simeone, director of the PennFuture Energy Center for Enterprise and the Environment. \""A greenhouse gas goal is kind of part of the definition of what a greenhouse plan is,"" Ms. Simeone said. ""We just have an emissions inventory and a bunch of workplans,"" many of them hinging on voluntary initiatives. \Setting an emissions target wasn't part of the climate action committee's mission, said Eric Shirk, a spokesman for the DEP. \""The work groups identified many different paths you can take to bring emissions down,"" he said. ""It was more important to show options rather than just set a goal."" \The DEP's secretary, newly-sworn-in Chris Abruzzo, generated some controversy at his confirmation hearing earlier this month when he said he isn't aware of any ""adverse impacts to human beings or to animals or to plant life at this small level of climate change."" \Mr. Shirk clarified that while climate change is occurring and having impacts, ""Pennsylvania is doing its part"" and can't fix the problem alone. \The climate action workplans drafted by the committee touch on a variety of emission reduction strategies, including increasing gas generation from landfills, manure and municipal solid waste. \Several items focused on building performance. One would require building systems to be fine-tuned regularly to make sure they're functioning efficiently. \Another would commit all new buildings and major renovations to be designed to consume up to 80 percent less fossil fuels than the regional average. \If all the workplans suggested by the committee were implemented, the DEP calculated that more than 17,000 jobs would be created by 2020, but gross state product would decline by $4.5 billion. In 2009, the DEP had said implementing the recommendations of that plan would create 65,000 new jobs and add more than $6 billion to the state economy. \It's not expected that all suggestions would be advocated, and the DEP, with the exception of nine legislative recommendations, isn't taking positions on which plans should be pursued. \Among its recommendations, the DEP called for clarification on who would be liable for carbon dioxide captured and sequestered underground, if that became a necessary or viable option. \The question is ""Who owns it long term?"" Mr. Henderson said. ""Nobody's ever really done this. What if it leaks? Does the generator own it in perpetuity? Does the Commonwealth step in and say, 'This is of such consequence, we'll step up and take it on?' "" \Neither the DEP nor the administration is bound by the findings of the report, which is expected to be delivered to the governor before the end of the year, and some were hesitant to suggest that the recommendations would translate into policy. \""The process has been nebulous,"" said J. Scott Roberts, former deputy secretary of the DEP who joined the committee last year. \""You have a committee that doesn't have a very clear mandate, doesn't have particularly strong leadership, and is guided by DEP that continually maintains that this is an advisory committee, and they're not bound by its recommendations,"" he said."

Intelligent people agree that, absent immediate radical action regarding global warming, the human race is sunk. That is a tautology because those who do not agree are, definitionally, unintelligent. Britain's intelligent Prime Minister Gordon Brown gives scary precision to the word ""immediate."" By his reckoning, humanity now has about 30 days to save itself. He says that unless a decisive agreement is reached at the 192-nation summit on climate change that opens Dec. 7 in Copenhagen, all is lost.
\
So, all is lost. The chances of a comprehensive and binding treaty are approximately nil.
\
The fourth of five parlays preparing for Copenhagen occurred in Bangkok from Sept. 28 through Oct. 9, with delegates from about 180 nations participating. Remember diplomat George Kennan's axiom that the unlikelihood of reaching an agreement is the square of the number of parties at the table? The meeting adjourned with, as usual, essentially no progress toward an agreement on reduced emissions by developed nations or on the money such nations should pay to finance developing nations' efforts against global warming.
\
The New York Times reports that ""the United Nations Adaptation Fund, which officially began operating in 2008 to help poor countries finance projects to blunt the effects of global warming, remains an empty shell, largely because rich nations have failed to come through with the donations they promised."" The fund has a risible $18 million, which might not cover the cost of the Copenhagen conference.
\
There they will experience more futility because of, among other things, two stubborn facts -- the two most populous nations. On Oct. 21, China, the world's leading emitter of greenhouse gases, and India, which ranks fourth -- together they account for 26 percent of emissions -- jointly agreed: They, with their combined one-third of the world's population, will not play in what increasingly resembles a global game of climate-change charades. Neither nation is interested in jeopardizing its economic growth with emission caps of a sort that never impeded the growth of the developed nations that now praise them.
\
But do not really embrace them. Recently, the U.S. House of Representatives took time out from fending off the world and exempted large cattle, dairy and hog producing operations from an Environmental Protection Agency requirement for reporting greenhouse gas emissions. And 13 Great Lakes cargo ships were exempted from a proposed mandate requiring the use of low-sulfur fuel. When constituents' interests conflict with global grandstanding, Congress' rule is ""act locally, think globally tomorrow, maybe.""
\
In their new book, ""Super Freakonomics,"" Steven D. Levitt, a University of Chicago economist, and Stephen J. Dubner, a journalist, worry about global warming but revive some inconvenient memories of 30 years ago. Then intelligent people agreed (see above) that global cooling threatened human survival. It had, Newsweek reported, ""taken the planet about a sixth of the way toward the Ice Age average."" Some scientists proposed radical measures to causeglobal warming -- for example, covering the arctic ice cap with black soot that would absorb heat and cause melting.
\
Levitt and Dubner also spoil some of the fun of the sort of the ""think globally, act locally"" gestures that are liturgically important in the church of climate change. For example, they say the ""locavore"" movement -- people eating locally grown foods from small farms -- actually increases greenhouse gas emissions. They cite research showing that only 11 percent of such emissions associated with food are in the transportation of it; 80 percent are in the production phase and, regarding emissions, big farms are much more efficient.
\
Although the political and media drumbeat of alarm is incessant, a Pew poll shows that only 57 percent of Americans think there is solid evidence of global warming, down 20 points in three years. Gallup shows that only 1 percent of Americans rank the environment as their biggest worry. Two reasons are:
\
They are worried about their wages, which will not be improved by clobbering a weak economy with the costs of a cap-and-trade carbon-reduction regime.
\
And climate Cassandras are learning the wages of crying ""Wolf!""
\
In 2005, global warming worriers warned, as they tend to do after all adverse or anomalous environmental events, that Hurricane Katrina was caused by global warming and foreshadowed an increase in the number and destructiveness of hurricanes. As this year's Atlantic hurricane season ends, only three hurricanes have formed -- half the average of the last 50 years -- and none have hit the United States.

215,"For two years before he resigned as the top government official in charge of fossil fuels, Chuck McConnell found himself between a rock and a hard place. The rock was coal. The hard place was the Obama administration and Congress, which holds the purse strings for research into the promise of clean coal. \Many in the administration and some Democrats in the legislature wanted federal energy dollars steered toward renewables like solar and wind, he said. Many Republicans, living in ""climate change denial,"" saw clean-coal research as a concession that a problem exists. \It didn't help that Mr. McConnell's chief mission at the U.S. Department of Energy was to promote the use of carbon dioxide sucked from coal-fired power plants as a fracking enhancer to force more oil out of shale wells. \""The Democrats were arguing with me that I was trying to subsidize the oil business,"" Mr. McConnell, who now leads the Energy and Environment Initiative at R?ice University, recalled. \What he was trying to do, Mr. McConnell said, was shift the economics of dealing with carbon pollution away from the utilities and toward potential customers for carbon dioxide. \""This really changes the paradigm,"" he said. ""It says, look, if I'm an oil company and I can get hold of inexpensive CO2, now I want to partner with utilities."" \New uses for carbon dioxide \Carbon dioxide utilization is a small but growing field of research at the National Energy Technology Laboratory in Pittsburgh and Morgantown, W.Va. \There are a few projects looking at using CO2 to grow algae, which could then be used to make biofuel, pharmaceuticals or vitamins. Aloca, in Pennsylvania, and a California company have proposed turning carbon dioxide into a building material. \""Re-use is a great idea,"" said Lynn Brickett, NETL's carbon capture technology manager, ""but as long as people understand that it's going to be a niche market only. \""When you're talking about these large concentrations (of CO2), the re-use market isn't going to take it."" \For that, you need to pump it into geological storage or send it into the oil fields, she said. \Before he was tapped as assistant secretary for fossil fuels in Washington, Mr. McConnell oversaw the carbon management business at Battelle Memorial Institute, a research and development nonprofit which was helping Ohio-based utility AEP Corp. build the first ever integrated carbon capture and sequestration plant. \Hundreds of millions of dollars were committed to the project, which would have trapped more than 90 percent of carbon dioxide from burning coal and pumped it into a reservoir a mile and a half underground. \In 2009, when it looked like Congress would pass legislation that would limit carbon emissions and set up a cap-and-trade system, eyes were on AEP's project and several others like it across the country. The same year, carbon capture and sequestration research got a $3.4 billion jolt from the federal stimulus package. \But the effects of the recession, which stifled energy demand, the rise of cheap natural gas, and the dead-in-the-water carbon cap effort overwhelmed coal companies and utilities. They were forced to rein in their budgets. \In 2011, having spent $114 million on a pilot project, AEP canceled its program. \Last week, the Department of Energy said it would return an unspent $1.27 billion, or 37 percent of the stimulus funds slated for carbon capture and sequestration projects to the U.S. Treasury. The companies that stood to get that money didn't meet program milestones, the agency said. \Oil to the rescue? \His experience with AEP's aborted effort convinced Mr. McConnell that there needs to be a stable and lucrative market for carbon dioxide, and that carbon capture plants should be located near oil fields to capitalize on their demand. \NRG Energy Inc., a New Jersey energy company that owns power plants across the U.S., seized the opportunity. It announced three carbon capture and utilization projects that would pipe the pollutant to oil and gas producers nearby. To manage them, it started a subsidiary called Carbon360. \Then, the price of oil collapsed. \Last month, NRG's CEO David Whipple Crane told investors ""the concept of carbon capture to enhance oil recovery as a distinct business opportunity, which made both strategic and economic sense to NRG at $75 to $100 a barrel (oil), obviously does not currently make economic sense at $30 to $40 a barrel."" \Instead, NRG partnered with Canada's Oil Sands Innovation Alliance in a splashy new innovation contest through the XPRIZE Foundation, which claims credit for having founded a ""new private space travel industry"" ten years ago. XPRIZE Carbon is a $40 million competition for ways to turn carbon dioxide into a salable product, launching new markets for the pollutant."
216,"In 2015, while he was in Paris for the climate change conference, Bill Gates wondered, ""Can we really do this?""\In ""How to Avoid a Climate Disaster: The Solutions We Have and the Breakthroughs We Need,"" the co-founder of Microsoft and co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation explains why it's urgently necessary - and really hard - to get to net-zero emissions of greenhouse gases. Drawing on his understanding of technology, innovation, the roles of government and private enterprise, he presents a comprehensive plan for keeping the Earth bearable for everyone.\Immensely informative and accessible, this book is a superb primer on the most important challenge facing humanity.\The human activities that produce the vast majority of greenhouse gases, Gates indicates, are making things (cement, steel, plastic); plugging in (electricity); growing things (plants and animals); getting around (cars, trucks, ships, planes); and temperature control (heating, air conditioning, refrigeration).\In these areas, the costs of solutions are more expensive than the existing ""dirty"" technologies. Gates estimates the ""Green Premiums"" we will have to pay in the short run, a difficult task because the prices of fossil fuels do not reflect the environmental damage they cause, or subsidies governments grant to gas and oil producers.\Some climate change work consists of going after low-hanging fruit (like electric cars). But we also need to focus - now - on the problems for which technological fixes are not yet available, too costly or politically unpalatable.\Sun and wind, for example, don't generate electricity 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Nuclear power is clean and always available, but after Three Mile Island and Chernobyl, construction of reactors ended in the United States. Emissions connected to production of cement - limestone plus heat equals calcium oxide plus carbon dioxide - cannot now be avoided, short of shutting down this part of the manufacturing sector.\The methane cows burp and fart out each year accounts for 4% of all global emissions; animal poop is the second biggest cause of emissions in agriculture. Trucks going on diesel can travel 1,000 miles without refueling; electrified 18-wheelers need batteries that weigh 35 times more than the gas and can travel 600 miles if they jettison 25% of their cargo. Battery-generated power is even more problematic for cargo ships and airplanes.\Ironically, Gates emphasizes, the developing countries that have done little to cause climate change will suffer the most from it. And they are turning to greenhouse gases as the least expensive way to address the energy needs of their growing populations.\Nonetheless, the author remains optimistic. His book is awash in solutions, big and small, already implemented and still on the drawing board. Energy-efficient air conditioners, he points out, are readily available. Gas-powered furnaces and water heaters can be replaced by heat pumps. Smart glass windows automatically turn darker when rooms need to be cooler and lighter when they need to be warmer. Mangrove forests save the world $80 billion by reducing storm surges, preventing coastal flooding and protecting fish habitats.\According to Gates, direct air capture, an unproven technology, has the potential to absorb carbon dioxide on a large scale, no matter when or where it was produced. DACs' price tag, a whopping $5.1 trillion a year, 6% of the world's economy, is still cheaper than shutting down sectors of the economy, as so many countries have done during the pandemic.\Gates makes a compelling case that governments have pivotal roles to play in resolving the climate crisis. He recommends that public investment in research and development of clean energy increase five-fold in the next decade. It's currently $22 billion a year, 0.02% of the world's economy, about as much as Americans spend on gasoline in one month.\Gates believes governments should set clean energy and fuel standards and level the playing field by mandating that fossil fuel companies pay for the damage they cause to the environment by, for example, levying a tax on carbon or implementing a cap-and-trade system.\Acknowledging that these days it's difficult to be hopeful about the future, Gates concludes (perhaps naively) that it isn't naive to believe we can ""bridge political divides"" and unite behind realistic, fact-based plans to eliminate greenhouse gases and ""preserve the planet for generations to come.""\BY BILL GATES KNOPF ($26.95)\CAPTION: PHOTO: Knopf: Bill Gates, author of ""How to Avoid Climate Disaster: The Solutions We Have and the Breakthroughs We Need.""\CREDIT: By Glenn C.

217,"
In the genuine historical miracle of Barack Obama -- it was only 43 years ago, half a historical eye-blink, when African-American voting rights remained unsecured -- the political and personal miracle of John McCain has been largely overshadowed.
\
A year ago this summer, the McCain campaign was a bankrupt political joke; the political class only mentioned it to speculate when it would be mercifully euthanized.
\
What followed was one of the most improbable comebacks of American political history.
\
The electoral stars aligned into a powerful, unpredicted syzygy: The surge in Iraq worked, the immigration issue faded, the conservative movement did not coalesce around a single opponent.
\
McCain won by shedding his early, bloated campaign structure and emphasizing his own large personality.
\
The style and approach of general election campaigns are often conditioned by the method of victory in the primaries. The Obama team ends the season like a battle-worn Army division -- organized, relentless and skilled at fundraising, registering voters and getting them to the polls.
\
Members of the McCain team feel more like survivors of a near-death experience -- convinced that the virtues of their candidate and the blessings of the political gods matter more than the money, phone banks and door-knocking of traditional politics.
\
This worries some Republican strategists. One recently described the McCain campaign to me as the political equivalent of a Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland movie: Every morning a few guys get together and say, ""Let's put on a show!""
\
McCain's state campaign organizations, coalition outreach and get-out-the-vote efforts are weak or nonexistent. But McCain campaign officials are convinced that they will win -- if they win -- in a different manner than the methodical Bush campaigns of 2000 and 2004.
\
McCain will either catch fire, or he won't -- and traditional efforts to boost turnout, in this view, are not likely to make the difference.
\
Given its history, the McCain campaign is understandably proud of its stripped down, seat-of-the-pants, insurgent campaign style. But it may eventually be useful to have a serious campaign organization in, say, Colorado.
\
The personal miracle of McCain's presidential run is even more extraordinary. It is obvious -- and therefore often unstated -- that the journey from a 4-by-6-foot Viet Cong cell to the 36-by-29-foot Oval Office would be unprecedented.
\
It would be as though George Washington were captured by the British, who snapped his legs in a torture cell; or Ulysses Grant were nearly starved to death at Andersonville Prison; or Dwight Eisenhower had been interrogated and beaten by the Gestapo in a German Stalag.
\
All three, I imagine, would have been honorable, defiant and arrogant enough to survive. But McCain has proved it.
\
McCain's experience, unlike some war stories, grows more shockingly impressive upon examination. Physical courage and mental toughness may not be requirements for the presidency, but they are at least as relevant as service in the Illinois Legislature.
\
And McCain's election as president would, in its own way, be historic -- finally and fully honoring the lessons of heroism that came out of America's conflicted experience of Vietnam.
\
All these experiences, political and personal, have created a unique candidate -- a man more driven by instincts of honor than ideology, predisposed to believe in his own virtue, equally predisposed to confuse opposition with dishonor.
\
At its worst, this approach has alienated many of his Senate colleagues and reportedly led McCain to the brink of leaving the Republican Party in 2001, more out of pique than principle.
\
At its best, this approach has seemed like a populist, reform-minded conservatism, aimed at breaking up concentrated, selfish interests that threaten the public good -- from his campaign against big tobacco, to his anger at inflated corporate salaries, to his disgust with congressional earmarks and pork-barrel spending, to his support for increased automobile fuel efficiency standards and a cap-and-trade system to limit carbon emissions.
\
Bill Galston of the Brookings Institution calls McCain's policy agenda ""a promiscuous heap of interesting ideas that will not cohere in one administration"" -- a judgment some Republicans share.
\
Up to this point in the campaign, the charge has not been much of a problem -- in this environment, a reliable, robotic Republican of the Romney-sort would be nowhere near Obama in the polls.
\
But the personality- and destiny-driven McCain campaign of the primaries is reaching its natural limits.
\
Eventually a presidential campaign needs a national organization. And eventually McCain must define McCainism.

218,"Many observers seem baffled by Republican fealty to President Donald Trump - the party's willingness to back him on all fronts, even after severe defeats in the midterm elections. What kind of party would show such support for a leader who is not only evidently corrupt and seemingly in the pocket of foreign dictators, but also routinely denies facts and tries to criminalize anyone who points them out?\The answer is, the kind of party that, long before Mr. Trump came on the scene, committed itself to denying the facts on climate change and criminalizing the scientists reporting those facts.\The GOP wasn't always an anti-environment, anti-science party. George H.W. Bush introduced the cap-and-trade program that largely controlled the problem of acid rain. As late as 2008, John McCain called for a similar program to limit emissions of the greenhouse gases that cause global warming.\But McCain's party was already well along in the process of becoming what it is today - a party that is not only completely dominated by climate deniers but is hostile to science in general, that demonizes and tries to destroy scientists who challenge its dogma.\Mr. Trump fits right in with this mind-set. In fact, when you review the history of Republican climate denial, it looks a lot like Trumpism. Climate denial, you might say, was the crucible in which the essential elements of Trumpism were formed.\Take Mr. Trump's dismissal of all negative information about his actions and their consequences as either fake news invented by hostile media or the products of a sinister ""deep state."" That kind of conspiracy theorizing has long been standard practice among climate deniers, who began calling the evidence for global warming - evidence that has convinced 97 percent of climate scientists - a ""gigantic hoax"" 15 years ago.\What was the evidence for this vast conspiracy? A lot of it rested on, you guessed it, hacked emails. The credulousness of all too many journalists about the supposed misconduct revealed by ""Climategate,"" a pseudo-scandal that relied on selective, out-of-context quotes from emails at a British university, prefigured the disastrous media handling of hacked Democratic emails in 2016. (All we learned from those emails was that scientists are people - occasionally snappish, and given to talking in professional shorthand that hostile outsiders can willfully misinterpret.)\Oh, and what is supposed to be motivating the thousands of scientists perpetrating this hoax? We've become accustomed to the spectacle of Mr. Trump, the most corrupt president in history leading the most corrupt administration of modern times, routinely calling his opponents and critics ""crooked."" Much the same thing happens in climate debate.\The truth is that most prominent climate deniers are basically paid to take that position, receiving large amounts of money from fossil-fuel companies. But after the release of the recent National Climate Assessment detailing the damage we can expect from global warming, a parade of Republicans went on TV to declare that scientists were only saying these things ""for the money."" Projection much?\Finally, Mr. Trump has brought a new level of menace to American politics, inciting his followers to violence against critics and trying to order the Justice Department to prosecute Hillary Clinton and James Comey.\But climate scientists have faced harassment and threats, up to and including death threats, for years. And they've also faced efforts by politicians to, in effect, criminalize their work. Most famously, Penn State's Michael E. Mann, creator of the famous ""hockey stick"" graph, was for years the target of an anti-climate science jihad by Ken Cuccinelli, at the time Virginia's attorney general.\And on it goes. Recently, a judge in Arizona, responding to a suit from a group linked to the Koch brothers (and obviously not understanding how research works), ordered the release of all emails from climate scientists at the University of Arizona. To forestall the inevitable selective misrepresentation, Mr. Mann has released all the emails he exchanged with his Arizona colleagues, with explanatory context.\There are three important morals to this story.\First, if we fail to meet the challenge of climate change, with catastrophic results - which seems all too likely - it won't be the result of an innocent failure to understand what was at stake. It will, instead, be a disaster brought on by corruption, willful ignorance, conspiracy theorizing and intimidation.\Second, that corruption isn't a problem of ""politicians"" or the ""political system."" It's specifically a problem of the Republican Party, which has burrowed ever deeper into climate denial even as the damage from a warming planet becomes more and more obvious.\Third, we can now see climate denial as part of a broader moral rot. Donald Trump isn't an aberration, he's the culmination of where his party has been going for years. You could say that Trumpism is just the application of the depravity of climate denial to every aspect of politics. And there's no end to the depravity in sight.\Paul Krugman is a columnist for The New York Times."
219,"Like many environmentalists, I was dismayed when the U.S. Senate failed to pass a cap-and-trade bill two years ago. It looked like we would never get our act together to reduce greenhouse gases. Get ready to have beachfront property in Vermont, I thought.\But it turns out that our greenhouse emissions dropped anyway, from 6 million metric tons to 5.2 million -- the lowest level since 1992. We even beat the European Union, where the Green Party actually has members.\So how did we do it? One big reason, ironically, is a Texas oil man named T. Boone Pickens, who perfected the art of squeezing natural gas out of shale rock by blasting huge quantities of water at it.\People already knew that America sits on huge reservoirs of natural gas embedded in shale. But nobody had a cost-effective way to get it out. As Mr. Pickens and others mastered this technique -- known as ""fracking"" -- natural gas became unbelievably cheap. Everyone started switching away from sulfur-burping coal plants to gas.\People started swooning about gas: It comes from economically depressed parts of Pennsylvania and Ohio, not the deserts of Iraq. And it releases about half the greenhouse gases that coal does. Finding that out was like discovering that ice cream cures cancer.\Gas was going to save America, economically and environmentally. It was going to be ""one of the five great story lines of the 21st century,"" said Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass.\It seemed too good to be true -- until people started insisting that it was, and started blaming fracking for everything from bad water to sick cows.\It started with the documentary ""Gasland,"" made by a filmmaker who suggests, among other things, that fracking causes breast cancer. (According to epidemiologists, it doesn't.)\Then Matt Damon made his new movie ""Promised Land,"" about how fracking turns lush farmland brown. (While there are credible cases of tainted water, fracking seems to coexist safely with farming in much of America.)\And then there is the new television show ""Dallas,"" where the good cousin Chris Ross pushes for alternative energy, while JR's evil son focuses on fracking. (In reality, both alternative energy and gas are part of the climate change solution.)\Another movie -- this time in support of fracking -- is rumored to be on the way.\But maybe we need less Hollywood and more science. For all the millions of Google hits that ""fracking"" brings up, remarkably little research has been done on what its risks actually are and whether they can be mitigated.\""There is a huge discrepancy between what we talk about and what we know,"" said Avner Vengosh, a Duke professor who co-wrote one of the few peer-reviewed papers on fracking's impact on water quality.\Fractivists may have gone overboard in their claims. But the gas industry also suffers from an aversion to science. After Mr. Vengosh discovered evidence that private wells near fracking sites were contaminated with methane gas, he says he was denied access from shale sites in Pennsylvania.\""The fracking industry is in total denial,"" he said.\The truth is that there are plenty of reasons to fret about fracking: Cheap, easy gas could slow our progress toward more affordable solar power and wind. And methane gas can leak into the atmosphere, curbing the greenhouse gas benefit. Scariest of all, geologists believe that fracking could produce minor earthquakes.\Even so, Mr. Vengosh doesn't believe in a ban. That would only make people stick to coal, which is far worse for the environment and human health.\""It's important to see the big picture,"" he said. The United States is pioneering a new technology that will set an example for the rest of the world, including China and India, where shale gas could play a huge role in reducing emissions. America's regulations for fracking should set the standard.\There are ways to make fracking safer, like ensuring that it happens far from private wells, that water is disposed of properly and that methane isn't allowed to leak out.\But neither the gas industry nor the fractivists seem particularly interested. The industry insists that the practice is already safe, while fractivists insist that it never will be.\The website NoFracking.com even suggests that frackers are deliberately poisoning America's water supply, so that T. Boone Pickens will make more money selling clean water.\If that sounds like a plot out of Hollywood, stayed tuned. It just might be."
220,"
On Sunday, The Inquirer will begin to publish Family Tree, a comic strip by Signe Wilkinson, the Pulitzer Prize-winning editorial cartoonist of its sister newspaper, the Philadelphia Daily News.
\
Like so many people, the Trees are trying to do right by Earth and by one another. Wilkinson, an avid gardener, answered a few questions this week about the strip, which will appear on Sundays only.
\
Question: When did you start drawing and writing your comic strip?
\
Answer: Well, it actually hit the papers in 2008, but I had been working on it for a year and a half beforehand. . . . So in my exquisite timing, it started just as papers really went into psycho mode.
\
Q: So, was it hard?
\
A: Yeah, it's been really hard. I have a nice list and it's slowly growing. I'm thrilled to be in the Sunday Inquirer.
\
Q: Why did you start drawing it?
\
A: Well, I love my daily cartoons, but I've always wanted to draw things that weren't about day-to-day politics because I really think people don't live their lives as Democrats or Republicans. They live their lives as a soccer mom, a baseball mom, a field-hockey mom, or the mom of the cello player.
\
In my editorial space, I don't get to do cartoons about lots of things I'm interested in, like mulch, like braces, like school plays.
\
The other thing is, in politics, when you talk about the environment, you talk about cap and trade, you talk about global warming. At home, you talk about who left the water running or who turned the thermostat up or down. That's where environmental issues get fought on a day-in and day-out basis. And that's greatly interesting territory.
\
Q: How do you do the drawing?
\
A: I do a rough, totally by hand, and draw the final drawing with ink on paper. I scan that into the computer, then add color in the computer.
\
Q: You won the Pulitzer Prize for editorial cartooning in 1992; what parenting awards have you won?
\
A: What are the parenting awards? How about both kids [two daughters] graduated from high school? Both graduated from college and are going to have health care.
\
Q: How do you describe each character?
\
A: The daughter named Twig is sort of the animation of the strip. She's the teenage daughter, eco-conscious kid. Her little brother, Teddy, holds her feet to the eco-fire. The dad, Ames, runs a nursery, Tree's Trees, and the mom, Maggie, works. Maggie's mother, Agatha, is a retired schoolteacher and sort of a force of common sense in a world gone crazy - I identify with that the older I get. She's pretty skeptical, but she's a major gardener.
\
Q: Is Agatha you?
\
A: My mother thinks it's her. But I tend to identify with Agatha - because I'm always right and so is Agatha.
\
Q: Do your daughters fight over who's Twig?
\
A: No, no. I did one last week on the spring play and my one daughter was in plays at school and the other one wasn't. But then, I do other things that the other daughter didn't.
\
Q: Where does Teddy come from?
\
A: Actually, I've gone over and witnessed the teenage sons of friends to see exactly how they slouch in front of the TV, exactly how they hold the video game consoles.
\
Q: Do you ever say anything jaundiced about gardening or environmentalists?
\
A: Oh, yeah. The problem with teenagers is that they're very earnest but they're not necessarily very consistent. So, for example, Twig is all for organics - except when it comes to her hair products.
\
So, nobody's perfect. . . . I think most people try to do a good job and know they could do better and someday they'll get around to doing better.

221,"
Americans are a practical people. We will rally to a new, compellingly communicated cause, but, after the dust settles, we tend to take a hard look at what is being pitched, who is doing the pitching, and how it fits in with what we know to be true.
\
Witness the recent reconsideration of both the Iraq war and Barack Obama's presidential campaign.
\
Yet, it's still surprising that, according to a recent ABC News poll, only 33 percent of Americans believe man-made global warming is the world's most serious environment crisis.
\
This finding comes after years of global-warming propaganda, the ""conclusive"" evidence in news reports, Al Gore's Nobel Prize, claims of melting ice caps endangering polar bears, and the hysterical drum beat from UN scientists and liberal politicians around the world.
\
The media hype has had an impact - environmentalism is in. Most of us skeptics are perfectly fine with the going-green movement's practical side. I recycle. I constantly turn lights off around my house (although I think that is just a dad thing). I bought a fuel-efficient car, and I am more conscious of taking care of God's creation.
\
As for solutions like carbon taxes, cap-and-trade legislation and other government efforts to control our energy consumption, however, I think most Americans don't believe Al Gore and the hysterics (good rock band name) have made the case.
\
Could it be that Americans know that over time the Earth goes through natural cooling and heating cycles?
\
Could it be that they recognize that most of the doomsday scenarios are not scientifically supported and that even the ""consensus"" projections are just that - projections based upon highly interactive questionable assumptions over long periods of time?
\
Or could it be they suspect that no one really knows the role that man-made carbon dioxide plays in the larger scheme of climate change?
\
Perhaps Americans know that China will burn more coal this year than the United States, the European Union and Japan combined but has refused to participate in any carbon-reduction effort - all the while taking advantage of the attendant cost savings to steal more American jobs.
\
Or maybe Americans are coming to understand that global temperatures have actually cooled over the last 10 years and are predicted to continue cooling over the next 10.
\
Or that these proposed remedies would have a devastating effect on our economy.
\
A National Association of Manufacturers study suggests that the Lieberman-Warner climate-change bill now before the Senate could increase gas prices to close to $10 per gallon. In Pennsylvania, it could result in the loss of 139,000 jobs by 2030?
\
But my hunch is that the public's skepticism about global-warming doomsdayism comes from a well-founded can-do confidence that American ingenuity will figure out how to cope with climate change through innovation instead of government regulation.
\
We are practical. Why not use technology to lower carbon emissions? And we can by building more nuclear power plants and developing and deploying clean-coal technology, which has already reduced emissions by 70 percent since 1970.
\
There is that dirty word: coal.
\
Those lumps of carbon turn the lights on in 50 percent of American homes.
\
In an age when energy independence is not only important for our economy, but also vital to our national security, we can't afford not to use this plentiful domestic resource.
\
Our presidential candidates consistently talk up ""green-collar jobs."" If they're serious, we can develop more technologies that will lower carbon dioxide emissions from burning coal.
\
If they would stop reflexively bowing to the anti-fossil-fuels crowd, we could boost investment in carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology that captures and stores carbon dioxide from coal-powered electrical plants.
\
CCS separates and captures carbon dioxide at the power plant before it is emitted. It is then liquefied, transported by pipeline and injected deep underground into geological formations for permanent storage.
\
Contrast this down-to-earth, commonsense approach with Barack Obama's other-worldly proposal. He's calling for a mandatory 80 percent cut in carbon emissions by 2050.
\
This would reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions to the same level as Third World nations.
\
By rejecting technologies like CCS, a President Obama would have Pennsylvania's blue-collar communities clinging to more than their guns and religion. They would be clinging to the last cent in their pockets.
\
I confess, I have a soft spot for Pennsylvania's industrial sector. My grandfather was a Pennsylvania coal miner, and I've lived most of my life in steel country.
\
We can't let what's left of the industrial heartland fall prey to the latest attempt by Washington to raise taxes and pick politically correct winners and losers in our economy while at the same time stifling American ingenuity.
\
If our next president and Congress let this happen, mill towns across the country will have cause to be truly bitter.

222,"If you can't measure it, you can't change it, the lightly edited saying goes.\Oil and gas companies know that. They've been measuring lots of things that tell a story of how well they operate and how much impact they have on the environment and the communities that host them.\How much water is needed to fracture a well. How many trucks are needed to haul it. How much gas goes through which pipelines.\All measurements. All central to the bottom line.\But so are the many ""intangibles,"" as Mason Gregory, senior analyst with Boston-based MFS Investment Management, put it.\A company's brand. Its reputation. Its social license.\""These issues [are] not found on the balance sheet, but they're affecting the balance sheet,"" Mr. Gregory said earlier this month during a virtual panel on corporate responsibility in the natural gas industry, hosted by Washington and Jefferson College.\When his company evaluates a natural gas business, it wants to see that it's ""managing some of the environmental externalities of their business - such as fugitive emissions.""\Fugitive emissions, or leaks, are the ""elephant in the room,"" along with natural gas's place in the energy transition, said Will Jordan, senior vice president and general counsel at EQT Corp., who also appeared on the panel. These are the topics that come up most often when environmentally and socially minded interests take up the virtue of natural gas.\As he spoke, EQT was two weeks away from announcing that it would start producing ""responsibly sourced gas"" and selling it to a European buyer of liquified natural gas.\The nation's largest natural gas producer said on Thursday that a Colorado company will install continuous emission monitors at two EQT well pads to track fugitive emissions, so as to prove that they are very low and that natural gas customers, even the more environmentally minded European ones, can feel good about using the fuel.\""If you want to achieve the goals of the Paris accord, you have to replace coal with gas,"" Mr. Jordan said during the panel discussion. ""In order to achieve that, we have to keep a clean house.""\In recent months, EQT has homed in on the message that ESG, or environmental, social and corporate governance, metrics will set some gas companies apart from others. The oil and gas industry is facing consolidation, stubbornly low gas prices, tight capital markets and environmental pushback.\And Chris Romer, CEO of Project Canary, the company that will be tracking EQT's emissions on the recently announced pilot, echoes that mentality.\""That data will be used to prove what we already know,"" he said, which is that shale wells in Appalachia have a lower leak intensity than in other oil and gas basins.\""The real hope is that the pilot will help to certify that this gas is very clean and really deserves a seat at the table in climate discussions,"" Mr. Romer said.\The ""responsibly sourced gas"" movement began with another Appalachian gas driller, Southwestern Energy Co., which got several of its wells certified according to a standard that ranks things like emissions and water sourcing. Southwestern sold that gas, at a premium, to a gas utility in New Jersey and another in Virginia.\Since then, the company that does these certifications merged with Project Canary.\If change requires measurement, then so, too, does monetization.\His company, Mr. Romer said, is doing the carbon accounting in advance of when all companies will need to do it - when there is a price of carbon, which Mr. Romer, who described himself more than once as a ""well-known Democrat for fracking,"" believes is near.\Pennsylvania, for example, is debating joining the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a multistate carbon cap and trade scheme, that would end up punishing heavy emitters and incentivizing low and non-emitting sources.\If natural gas companies can set themselves apart in terms of low emissions, Mr. Romer said, they can benefit not just in terms of reputation but also with utility contracts, investments from environmentally conscious pension funds, and maybe even cash from carbon credits.\But while fugitive emissions are a high-profile target - this is in part because studies have shown there are super-emitters, or very large undetected leaks that spew methane into the air -- they are generally just a small fraction of an oil and gas company's emission profile, EQT's Mr. Jordan said during the corporate responsibility panel.\""At EQT, 3% of our emissions are result of leakage. Ninety-seven percent is the exact same as any other industrial business - it's running big machines,"" he said.\Anya Litvak: alitvak@post-gazette.com.\CAPTION: PHOTO: Courtesy of Kristi Wiebe/EQT: Project Canary plans to install these continuous emission monitors at two EQT well pads.\CREDIT: By Anya Litvak Pittsburgh Post-Gazette"

U.S. Rep. Tim Holden's decisive victory in Tuesday's election wasn't about the national mood, experts say.
\
It wasn't even about his stances against unpopular Democratic legislation like health care reform.
\
Holden, D-17, won by more than 23,000 votes mostly because of his personality, according to Dr. G. Terry Madonna, director of the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Franklin & Marshall College, Lancaster.
\
""He's Mr. Everyman,"" Madonna said of Holden in an interview Wednesday afternoon. ""He understood his problem right from the start and went after it. He knew what he had to do - he had to present the point that he's a local guy.""
\
In Tuesday's General Election, Saint Clair native Holden defeated another Schuylkill County son, state Sen. David Argall, R-29, by a huge margin.
\
In the duo's home county, Holden won by more than 12,000 votes. Holden also racked up huge totals in Dauphin County, beating Argall by nearly 14,000 votes.
\
Argall won the three other counties in the 17th Congressional District - Lebanon County and parts of Berks and Perry - but those victories weren't enough to mitigate losses in Dauphin and Schuylkill.
\
Holden's victory came amid massive Democratic losses in House races across the country. The GOP recaptured control of that body, including victories over nearby incumbent U.S. Reps. Paul Kanjorski and Chris Carney, both Democrats.
\
At this point in his political career, Holden is all but invincible, according to Dr. Christopher Borick, political analyst and associate professor of political science at Muhlenberg College, Allentown.
\
""It sure looks like he's in that nearly unbeatable position. Surviving in horrific conditions for Democrats rather easily ... is a sign of strength,"" Borick said in an interview Wednesday. ""Holden has always been seen as someone who is ethically strong. He's looked at as an honest guy. He's about as squeaky clean as they come.""
\
The GOP strategy of pitting a popular Schuylkill County Republican - Argall has served 25 years in the state Legislature; until Tuesday, he'd never lost an election - against Holden to counter the incumbent's local popularity didn't work, leading some to believe that no matter the Republican momentum, Holden can't be beat.
\
""Is he unbeatable in a hostile national environment? Yes,"" Madonna said.
\
While his personality played a big role, Holden's voting record was equally important.
\
Unlike Kanjorski and Carney, Holden voted against health care reform and the cap-and-trade energy legislation.
\
""Tim Holden voted against health care, the big issue that was capable of creating enormous problems for him,"" Madonna said.
\
""In a year where a lot of Democrats paid a price for their votes in Congress, Holden's ability to insulate himself by casting conservative votes made all of the difference,"" Borick said.
\
That calculated vote, Madonna said, was part of a three-pronged re-election strategy.
\
In addition to his ""everyman"" image and opposing unpopular Democratic initiatives, Madonna said the other key to Holden's win was money.
\
Just after conceding to Holden on election night, Argall admitted he had been outspent ""four or five to one"" in television and radio advertising.
\
Argall raised $319,702, while Holden raised $1.2 million, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission.
\
After Tuesday's election, Holden reiterated his desire to reach across the aisle and work with Republicans. Since the GOP will now control the House, Holden will no longer be chairman of the House Conservation, Credit, Energy, and Research subcommittee. Instead, he'll be the ranking Democrat.
\
Still, Holden said he has already spoken with Republican colleagues on the House Agriculture Committee, such as U.S. Rep. Frank Lucas, R-Okla.
\
""He said, 'You've always treated me with respect,' "" Holden said Wednesday, recounting a conversation with Lucas shortly after Tuesday's election returns came in.
\
Holden also said he plans to continue his career in Congress and work with Republican counterparts ""as long as the people of the 17th District want to me to do it.""
\
""I enjoy what I'm doing,"" he said.

224,"The spin is in. Here's how the webzine Politico expressed the conventional wisdom about the outcome of the special election for what had been Jack Murtha's seat in Pennsylvania's 12th congressional district:\""In the only House race that really mattered to both parties ... Republicans failed spectacularly, losing on a level playing field where, in this favorable environment, they should have run roughshod over the opposition,"" wrote Jonathan Martin and Charles Mahtesian.\If this is widely believed, it may turn out to be a good thing for Republicans that Democrat Mark Critz, a former Murtha aide, defeated Republican Tim Burns in PA 12.\First, there'll be no more smugness among Republicans about coasting to a takeover of the House in November.\Second, Democrats in swing districts may now underestimate how much trouble they could be in.\Mr. Martin and Mr. Mahtesian have a curious notion of what constitutes a ""level playing field."" Democrats outnumber Republicans 2 to 1 in Pennsylvania's 12th district and Democratic turnout was goosed by competitive primaries for U.S. senator and governor, while the GOP statewide primaries were yawners.\The surge for Rep. Joe Sestak against Sen. Arlen Specter in the Democratic Senate primary is mainly what did in Mr. Burns, an analyst for the National Republican Congressional Committee told Jim Geraghty of National Review.\""Sestak's surge ... drove a sudden interest in voting among the Democratic base. This analyst thinks these Sestak-driven voters amounted to 8,000-10,000 voters, roughly the size of Critz's margin of victory,"" Mr. Geraghty said.\Mr. Burns wanted to make the election a referendum on Obamacare and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, but Mr. Critz wouldn't play ball. He presented himself as a pro-life, pro-gun moderate who opposed Obamacare and carbon taxes.\This approach should serve Mr. Critz well in the general election. But it will be difficult for Democrats who voted for the stimulus bill, cap and trade and Obamacare to emulate it.\And, noted Sean Trende of RealClear Politics, more than 60 seats held by Democrats are more favorable to Republicans than is Pennsylvania's 12th.\Though he must be considered the favorite, Mr. Critz is by no means a shoe-in in the fall. There were 82,710 votes cast in the simultaneous Democratic primary in the 12th district, but Mr. Critz got just 70,710 in the special election (with 99.83% of precincts reporting). That means 14.5 percent of those who voted in the Democratic primary didn't vote for Mr. Critz in the special election.\There were only 45,809 votes cast in the Republican primary, but Mr. Burns got 60,587 votes in the special election. Mr. Burns got 32.3 percent more votes than were cast in the Republican primary.\Republican optimism for November has been based mostly on opinion polls indicating independents are leaning heavily toward the GOP. But little of Mr. Burns' support in the special election came from independents. Only 6,295 votes more were cast in the special election -- 4.7 percent of the total -- than were cast in the Democratic and Republican primaries combined.\Pennsylvania's primaries are closed. Independents can't vote in them. Consequently, Pennsylvania has a smaller proportion of unaffiliated voters -- 11.6 percent -- than do most states. That's more than twice the proportion of unaffiliated voters who voted in the special election in the 12th district. Independents can vote in November.\What this means is that virtually all of Mr. Burns' additional votes came from Democrats. How many other Democratic candidates in swing districts could suffer that high a proportion of defections and survive?\Two who probably can't are Reps. Kathy Dahlkemper in Pennsylvania's 3rd district, and Paul Kanjorski in the 11th district.\Just 47,183 votes were cast in the Democratic primary in Ms. Dahlkemper's district, of which she got 34,534. In the Republican primary, 54,055 votes were cast, despite no statewide races to draw GOP voters to the polls.\There were also more votes in the Republican primaries than in the Democratic primaries in the districts represented by Democrats Patrick Murphy, Chris Carney and Tim Holden, and in the district currently held by Rep. Sestak.\Rep. Kanjorski could muster just 49.3 percent of the vote against two opponents in his primary. For an incumbent, that's a recipe for toast come November."
225,"It took more than a month for the container ship Ebba Maersk to steam from Germany to Guangdong, China, where it unloaded cargo on a recent Friday -- a week longer than it did two years ago.\But for the owner, the Danish shipping giant Maersk, that counts as progress.\In a global culture dominated by speed, from overnight package delivery to bullet trains to fast-cash withdrawals, the company has seized on a sales pitch that may startle some hard-driving corporate customers: Slow is better.\By halving its top cruising speed over the last two years, Maersk cut fuel consumption on major routes by as much as 30 percent, greatly reducing costs. But the company also achieved an equal cut in the ships' emissions of greenhouse gases.\""The previous focus has been on 'What will it cost?' and 'Get it to me as fast as possible,' "" said Soren Stig Nielsen, Maersk's director of environmental sustainability, who noted that the practice began in 2008, when oil prices jumped to $145 a barrel. ""But now there is a third dimension,"" he said. ""What's the CO2 footprint?""\Traveling more slowly, he added, is ""a great opportunity"" to lower emissions ""without a quantum leap in innovation.""\In what reads as a commentary on modern life, Maersk advises in its corporate client presentation, ""Going at full throttle is economically and ecologically questionable.""\Transport emissions have soared in the past three decades as global trade has grown by leaps and bounds, especially long-haul shipments of goods from Asia. The container ship trade grew eightfold between 1985 and 2007.\The mantra was, ""Need it now."" But the result is that planes, ships, cars and trucks all often travel at speeds far above maximum fuel efficiency.\Slowing down from high speeds reduces emissions because it reduces drag and friction as ships plow through the water.\Of course, mile per mile, shipping even at conventional speeds is far more efficient than road travel. Shipping a ton of toys from Shanghai to northern Germany churns out less emissions than trucking them south to Berlin afterward.\Some carriers initially resisted the idea of slowing down, arguing that speed was indispensable to serving their clients.\""There was initially a lot of skepticism,"" said Philip Damas, director of liner travel at Drewry Shipping Consultants of London. ""All ships are built with the expectation they'd have to sail fast.""\But now, he said, carriers from Germany to Israel to China are starting to embrace the slow strategy. Today more than 220 vessels are practicing ""slow steaming"" -- cruising at 20 knots on open water instead of the standard 24 or 25 -- or, like Maersk's vessels, ""super slow steaming"" (12 knots).\And many companies find that the practice allows them to cut prices in an ever more competitive market, even at a time when oil prices hover around $80 a barrel.\Any rise in fuel prices or taxes would enhance the appeal of slow steaming. At the international climate conference in Copenhagen in December, Connie Hedegaard, now the European Union's climate minister, proposed a tax on fuels used in shipping, saying the proceeds could be used to help poor countries adapt to rising temperatures.\China and India objected, saying it would increase the price of their exports to the West.\There are practical obstacles to a tax. For one thing, longstanding international agreements intended to promote global trade exempt airline and shipping fuel from taxation.\And even if nations were to accept emission ceilings under a so-called cap-and-trade system, there is enormous disagreement over how the accounting would work. Should the Ebba Maersk's emissions appear on Denmark's balance sheet, even though it travels from China to Germany and back?\While slowing speeds is a good idea, said David Bonilla, senior research fellow at the transport studies unit at Oxford University's School of Geography and the Environment, he maintains that it cannot on its own arrest the emissions growth resulting from today's trade patterns, in which vast amounts of goods are produced in Asia but consumed in Europe or the United States.\To make a difference, he said, fuel costs for long-distance shipping must rise to the point where carriers are forced to invest in new, far more efficient boats or shift to shorter routes.\Yet in shifting hundreds more ships to its slow steaming program last year, Maersk considered itself prescient: It is convinced that a carbon tax or tighter shipping rules are on the horizon.\""This is not going away, and those of us who are starting now will be ahead of regulations,"" Mr. Nielsen said."
226,"Political junkies now have their own summer sequel to ponder: Tea Parties 2, Independence Day.\Local conservative and libertarian political activists, who threw ""tea party"" protests on April 15, will rally again Friday in Easton as part of hundreds of demonstrations across the nation this weekend.\While their numbers are smaller this time around, their target is again big government, in particular President Barack Obama's cap and trade energy proposal and plan to overhaul health care.\Kim Schmidtner, one of the group's leading local organizers, said she thinks more people are beginning to embrace the concerns her group raised more than two months ago.\""A lot of the language in Washington and some of the polls are showing more and more Americans are becoming concerned about the spending and the deficit,"" said Schmidtner, of Lower Saucon Township.\The goal of Friday's protest -- to be held 7 p.m. in Easton's Centre Square -- is to remind politicians of that, she said.\How much political weight do the tea party activists wield? That remains to be seen, said political experts.\They evoke supporters of past third-party candidates such as John Anderson and H. Ross Perot, said G. Terry Madonna, director of the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Franklin and Marshall College.\""It's kind of an outlet for people who in the past might have congealed around a third party, and it's not there,"" Madonna said. ""There is no Ross Perot on the scene. You get the sense that its roots kind of lie in the Perot discontent.""\While Perot ultimately failed, his focus on federal deficits forced Democrat Bill Clinton and Republican President George H.W. Bush to address the issue in the 1992 campaign, he said.\As it looks to revive the party after a rough 2008, the GOP should heed the tea party protestors, said Harrisburg Republican consultant Charlie Gerow.\""I think these tea parties are a significant political movement, and anybody who fails to pay attention to them does so at their own political risk,"" Gerow said.\Less sophisticated than Obama's Organizing for America volunteer group, the networks the tea party protestors are building could be help the party in 2010 and 2012 elections, he said.\""It's a movement that percolates underneath the radar screen,"" Gerow said.\Nationally, the organizations promoting the events are a hodgepodge, ranging from Freedom Works, an advocacy group headed by former GOP House Majority Whip Dick Armey, to the Christian conservative American Family Association.\Local activists affiliate with a variety of efforts, from radio talker Glenn Beck's ""9/12 Project"" to local taxpayers associations.\Lehigh County Democratic Party Chairman Rich Daugherty said he appreciates the tea party protesters' right to express their opinions and their focus on containing costs.\But he said some government programs are helpful. Some provide important protection to the environment, or regulate financial markets. Medicare, for example, makes it possible for senior citizens to afford medical care, he said.\""I think [the tea party protesters] tilt it in the other direction so far that it doesn't make sense any more,"" Daugherty said. ""In terms of socialism, I don't see Obama doing anything in that realm.""\Schmidtner said she has an e-mail list of about 900 people and growing, and expects about 100 people at the Friday rally in Easton. The group has set up a page on the Meetup Web site and has a Facebook page with 44 members.\Members are involved in a variety of efforts, including researching politicians' records.That doesn't mean the group will be recommending its members get behind a particular politician.\""I don't know if support is the right word, but we are trying to find them and give them an individual rating,"" Schmidtner said.

227,"
In their second and final debate, the two candidates running for Congress in the Sixth District argued Tuesday over the economy, the tea party, the Islamic center near ground zero, and how the United States should handle Iran.
\
But they argued most fervently over the matter most pressing to voters: the economy.
\
Republican U.S. Rep. Jim Gerlach, running for his fifth term, chastised his Democratic opponent, Manan Trivedi, for supporting a repeal of the Bush tax cuts for those who make more than $250,000 annually. Repeal will hurt small business owners, he said.
\
""They are the people that create the jobs,"" Gerlach said. ""If you're really serious about putting a $900 billion tax on them in this recession, with 9.7 percent unemployment, it's goofy, frankly.""
\
Trivedi, 36, a physician from Birdsboro, Berks County, blamed Republican ideas of trickle-down economics for the country's problems.
\
""I'm still waiting for it to trickle; it just doesn't work,"" he said. ""How did we get here? Because of these wrong tax cuts for the uber-wealthy, because of the deregulation of these kinds of industries.""
\
Elections usually run close in the sprawling Sixth District, which includes parts of Chester, Montgomery, Berks, and Lehigh Counties. About 200 people attended the debate at the Main Line Reform Temple-Beth Elohim in Wynnewood. Their first debate was Sunday in Chester County.
\
Trivedi, who served in Iraq as a surgeon with the Navy, said he thought the uproar over the plan for the mosque in Manhattan was an example of politicians lacking courage.
\
""I fought in Iraq to defend the Constitution, and one of the rights in the Constitution is for religious freedom, and that was what they were doing up in New York when they proposed to build that mosque,"" he said. ""These are some of the rights that were in the Constitution, and that's a principle I stand behind.""
\
Gerlach, 55, of Chester Springs, compared the issue to the pastor who threatened to burn the Quran on Sept. 11, 2010. ""Just because you can do it doesn't mean you should,"" he said.
\
Trivedi partly blamed President George W. Bush's execution of the war on terror, including opening the front in Iraq, for the country's current struggles to limit Iran's nuclear capabilities.
\
""We took our eye off the ball of Iran, and they became this mess because of so many of our failed foreign policies,"" he said.
\
Gerlach shot back, ""We've gotten in this situation because you have a nut who is the head of Iran called Ahmadinejad. He is supported by a regime of radical Islamists who have a totally different view of the world.""
\
While Gerlach had no harsh words for the tea party, a movement that has largely benefited Republicans, Trivedi said the group espoused ""dangerous ideas for our country.""
\
On energy matters, Gerlach said he did not support cap-and-trade legislation because he believed it would put an undue burden on businesses during a tough economic time. Trivedi said Congress could protect the environment and jobs at the same time. ""It's a false choice to say, 'It's either jobs or cutting carbon emissions,' "" he said.
\
Gerlach voted against the federal stimulus, which he said put money in the wrong places and did not create enough jobs. He voted against the health-care bill, which he called a bad policy that didn't curb rising costs.
\
""We need a different direction for this country that focuses on fair tax policy, lower cost and lower spending in the federal government, and health care that works for the people,"" Gerlach said, referring to major bills coming from the Democratic-controlled Congress.
\
Trivedi said the health care bill was imperfect, but a step in the right direction. He agreed that the stimulus was ""horribly implemented,"" but said Congress had to do something to stop the economy's downward spiral.
\
""We were headed over a precipice,"" he said.

228,"Western Pennsylvania is home to several contentious congressional races, but the incumbents in the 12th and 14th districts should survive. Reps. John Murtha of Johnstown and Mike Doyle of Forest Hills are the better choices on Election Day, and if you could interview their challengers you'd understand why.\* * *\Mike Doyle, 55, is in his seventh term in the 14th District, which includes Pittsburgh and 50 communities in the heart of Allegheny County between Monroeville and Coraopolis and between Reserve and Elizabeth. He is an ardent critic of the Iraq war and supports a mix of solutions to the nation's energy challenges. In September he voted for the sweeping bill that would roll back tax breaks to oil companies, invest in renewable energy sources, require the administration to sell 10 percent of the strategic petroleum reserve and allow limited offshore oil drilling. Last year he voted to raise fuel efficiency standards for U.S. automakers.\He backed the $700 billion economic bailout because he felt it was necessary to stabilize credit markets and that taxpayers eventually will get their money back. As to Iraq, Mr. Doyle says he would remove U.S. troops earlier than his party's presidential nominee, Barack Obama. He believes one of the unfortunate consequences of that war has been loss of control in Afghanistan and Pakistan, where he says the next administration must focus attention.\His challenger is Christopher Titus North of the Green Party, an adjunct professor at Pitt and financial editor with Thomson Reuters who ran two years ago. The son of a peace activist, he faults the Democratic and Republican parties for ""pulling the country apart"" and fomenting a militarism that ""is trying to control the world.""\Mr. North, 47, of Squirrel Hill has a strong concern for the environment and interest in sustainable energy. He favors a carbon tax, rather than a cap-and-trade system, to curb emissions and he wants to phase out the use of coal, gas, oil and nuclear power. He also wants an Apollo-style program to build a renewable energy infrastructure.\He would have voted against the Wall Street bailout, saying it gives the treasury secretary czar-like powers and Congress only ""spectator oversight."" He said he would pull out all U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan and reduce the number of military bases abroad.\While we commend Mr. North for his passion, we're afraid it would meet with a brick wall in Washington. Mike Doyle is more practical and better suited to working with the range of views in the House, and we endorse him for a new term.\* * *\John Murtha is having to fight harder for his seat because the words of the 17-term congressman have gotten him into hot water.\Last week, while analyzing the presidential race in Pennsylvania for the Post-Gazette editorial board, he said, ""There's no question Western Pennsylvania is a racist area."" Two years ago he said the 2005 killings of Iraqi civilians by U.S. troops were done in ""cold blood,"" which drew a defamation suit from a Marine.\If Mr. Murtha, 76, should take more care with his words, he should do the same with his behavior. Known as a master of congressional pork, Mr. Murtha led his House colleagues with 30 earmarks for his district in a spending bill that passed last month; the items totaled $111 million, including $24.5 million for the National Drug Intelligence Center in Johnstown. Last Sunday The New York Times reported, in a story published in the Post-Gazette, that defense contractors, who vie for the congressman's attention as chairman of the Appropriations defense subcommittee, are major contributors to the Johnstown symphony, a favorite Murtha cause.\All that must be weighed against Mr. Murtha's outspoken criticism of the Iraq war, his support for expansion of the State Children's Health Insurance Program, his vote in July to save hundreds of thousands of homeowners from foreclosure and his work on bills to counter global warming.\His challenger, Republican William Russell, is making his first run for office. Recently retired from the Army after 28 years of active and reserve service, he says the incumbent, despite a long career of support for the military, has ""encouraged the enemy"" with his inflammatory remarks.\Mr. Russell, 46, of Johnstown adheres to a less-is-more philosophy of government. He opposed the economic bailout and said much of the crisis was due to an unwarranted social agenda to promote homeownership. He said the market should be allowed to heal itself, which means ""some people will lose homes, some will lose businesses and things are going to go down. But when you start trying to protect everybody, that's when trouble begins.""\The challenger says government should focus on infrastructure, national defense and law and order. ""It's not the government's role to ensure that everyone gets equality of outcome,"" he said. This survival-of-the-fittest approach may work for Mr. Russell, but not for many residents of the 12th District, which includes Greene County and parts of Allegheny, Armstrong, Cambria, Indiana, Somerset, Fayette, Washington and Westmoreland counties.\The incumbent may have his warts, but the challenger is not a promising alternative. We endorse John Murtha for another term."
229,"
Gov. Christie on Tuesday outlined a vision for New Jersey's energy future that focuses on nuclear, natural gas, and commercial solar power, and retreats from ambitious renewable energy goals.
\
The governor introduced a long-awaited energy master plan at a news conference more than a year after his administration said it would revise the document developed under the previous administration to reflect the economic downturn.
\
The release follows the governor's controversial announcement last week to pull New Jersey out of a multistate cap-and-trade agreement for greenhouse gas emissions, a key part of Gov. Jon S. Corzine's energy plan.
\
Some environmental advocates said the plan, coming so soon after the withdrawal from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), would damage the state's leadership on green energy, but a chamber of commerce lobbyist called it business-friendly.
\
The Board of Public Utilities will hold hearings over the summer on the plan.
\
Christie's 141-page blueprint calls for reconsideration of other energy programs, including solar power, which New Jersey has been a national leader in promoting.
\
At the news conference, the governor pledged his support to developing renewable energy, but said the administration wanted to decrease the percentage of renewable sources in its portfolio to 22.5 percent because the 30 percent required under Corzine was not achievable.
\
He called it a ""pie-in-the-sky"" sop to special interests with no way to be achieved. Christie said he was ""trying to create an entire basket of options."" Those include everything from harnessing offshore wind to converting waste to energy through incineration.
\
Nuclear power also must play a role in the state's energy policy, he said, if it is serious about meeting its goals to reduce carbon emissions and generate more electricity in state. He left open the possibility of building a replacement for the Oyster Creek nuclear facility, set to go off-line by the end of the decade.
\
A new nuclear plant must be considered given that more than 50 percent of the state's power is generated from nuclear sources, Christie said.
\
His energy plan also emphasizes generating electricity from natural gas-fired plants and expanding natural gas pipelines.
\
On solar energy, the Christie administration was critical of a program allowing people who install solar panels to sell solar credits to utilities, which are required to make ""compliance alternative payments"" if they do not buy the required number of credits.
\
The report recommends lowering the alternative payments and suggests reevaluating the costs and benefits of the program, saying that the administration opposes ""the unreasonable transfer of wealth"" from ratepayers to solar developers and other participants. The plan also encourages large-scale commercial solar projects over residential ones.
\
It also criticized parts of the state's energy efficiency programs, including rebates subsidizing purchase of efficient home appliances, saying those policies should be reevaluated. It is unclear, the report said, ""if nonparticipants reap sufficient benefits in the form of cleaner air or lower power prices to offset the additional costs"" on their utility bills.
\
That could pave the way for the eventual reduction or elimination of the Societal Benefits Charge, which costs on average just over $50 a year per household and pays for energy efficiency, clean energy, assistance for low-income customers, and other programs. The Christie administration signaled that it would seek to replace the charge with a revolving loan fund.
\
These proposals pose challenges for how the state will fund green energy programs, given that emitters of greenhouse gases had put up millions of dollars in allowances through the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative to help pay for them. A fiscal crisis last year also led Christie to divert $400 million from dedicated environmental funds into the general budget, including those set aside for clean energy.
\
Environmental advocates say Christie's policies are shifting New Jersey from being a leader in green energy to a state that is sending a message to those in the industry that it would be wiser to invest in other states.
\
His emphasis on natural gas and nuclear power, among other things, ""could mean that we're pushing out renewable energy. We'll remove the incentive to be as aggressive as possible on wind, solar, and other emerging technologies for renewable energies,"" said Matthew Elliott, the global warming and clean energy advocate for Environment New Jersey.
\
Dennis Wilson, president of the Mid-Atlantic Solar Energy Association, said New Jersey's solar industry had grown rapidly and the cost of generation had dropped significantly.
\
He criticized the decision to lower the percentage of renewable energy sources in the state's portfolio, saying it should be increased. The move could cost thousands of jobs, he said.
\
""There are big consequences to rolling this back,"" Wilson said.
\
But Michael Egenton, a lobbyist for the state Chamber of Commerce, said the master plan was business-friendly and considered energy costs for all customers, large and small.
\
""If we can change the equation to go toward some of the renewable, that's great, but nobody's come to the table showing . . . absolutely that wind and solar can do it alone,"" said Egenton, saying the state needs a combination of sources including nuclear power. ""It can't.""

230," Reliant Energy Inc.'s Keystone Plant in Indiana County ranked first among the 359 largest U.S. power plants in emitting the most sulfur dioxide last year, contributing more of the soot that triggers asthma attacks and acid rain than any other coal-fueled generator, the Environmental Integrity Project said in a report.\ Two of PPL Corp.'s Pennsylvania power plants were listed among the top 50 polluters, although the Allentown company recently unveiled plans to overhaul both facilities.\ Its Montour plant north of Danville ranked No. 8, and its Brunner Island plant south of Harrisburg was No. 22 in terms of sulfur dioxide emissions. The two spewed a combined 219,000 tons of sulfur dioxide into the air.\ Power plants owned by Cinergy Corp. and Southern Co. also topped the list. Keystone emitted 171,309 tons of sulfur dioxide in 2004, up from 163,493 tons in 2003. It was also the ninth least-efficient generator, emitting 27.88 pounds of sulfur dioxide per megawatt- hour produced. A spokesman for Houston-based Reliant wouldn't immediately comment on the report.\ ""The real tragedy for the health of Americans and our environment is that most of this problem is already preventable,"" Eric Schaeffer, director of the Environmental Integrity Project of Washington, said during a media briefing Wednesday.\ Utilities have announced plans to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions, which are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency under a cap and trade system, over the next few years by installing more than $12 billion in controls called scrubbers. Plants also can reduce pollution by burning coal with a lower sulfur content.\ Total emissions of sulfur dioxide decreased by 330,000 tons last year even as some plants spewed more. Some of the worst polluters are concentrated in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Indiana. Pennsylvania had four of the 10 worst polluters, including PPL's Montour plant.\ PPL's scrubber construction will begin early next year and is expected to be completed in 2008 for Montour and 2010 for Brunner Island.\ The Clean Air Act, signed into law by President George H.W. Bush in 1990, has given energy companies a financial incentive to clean up their act. That legislation, the model for the current Bush Administration's proposed Clear Skies Act, instituted the market- based approach to pollution control.\ Utilities could reduce their emissions by using cleaner coal or installing scrubbers. Otherwise they would have to buy from better- performing utilities a limited number of allowances to pollute the air.\ Under that emissions-trading system, the price of allowances to emit sulfur dioxide has tripled over the last year, rising above $700 a ton. As a result, installing scrubbers at coal-fired plants, which generate half of U.S. electric power, has suddenly become cheaper than the long-term cost of buying allowances.\ ""Scrubbers are actually lower cost to us than consuming $700-a- ton emission allowances,"" PPL Chief Executive Officer William Hecht said on a Feb. 2 conference call with analysts and investors. ""So our objective now is to get scrubbers in as soon as we practically can so that we can actually sell surplus allowances we have.""\ Environmental Integrity's report found found that Southern's Bowen Plant in Georgia, the highest sulfur dioxide emitter in 2003, increased emissions even as it dropped to third place among the biggest polluters. The company plans to install scrubbers at two of the Bowen units and one in Alabama over the next few years.\ The report used Energy Department data to also rank the top 50 emitters of carbon dioxide, linked to global warming, nitrogen oxide, the main cause of smog, and mercury, which causes brain damage in fetuses. The owners of the polluting plants have benefited from relaxed enforcement of air-pollution laws by the Bush administration, the report said.\ Edison Electric Institute, a power industry lobbyist, said utilities have reduced sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide emissions by 40 percent since 1970 and plan to cut pollution from those gasses and mercury by two thirds over the next 15 years.\ For carbon dioxide, the Coleto Creek plant in Texas had the highest rate of emissions, generating 4,527 pounds per megawatt- hour, or more than 5 million tons, during the year. The plant was owned by American Electric Power, which sold it in July to Sempra Energy and the Carlyle Group. AEP's Pirkey plant in Texas was the largest emitter of mercury.\ PPL's Colstrip plant in Montana ranked 12th in terms of total carbon dioxide emissions, sending nearly 18 million tons into the air.\ Nitrogen oxide emissions were greatest at Pinnacle West Capital Corp.'s Four Corners plant in New Mexico, with 40,742 tons. Total U.S. emissions of the gas decreased to 3.7 million tons, from 4.1 million tons in 2003, as utilities installed controls at coal- fueled plants.\ PPL's Colstrip plant also ranked 12th in terms of total nitrogen oxide emissions.\ Morning Call reporter Sam Kennedy and Christopher Martin of Bloomberg News contributed to this story.\ ***"

WASHINGTON
\
Intelligent people agree that, absent immediate radical action regarding global warming, the human race is sunk. That is a tautology because those who do not agree are, definitionally, unintelligent.
\
Britain's intelligent Prime Minister Gordon Brown gives scary precision to the word ""immediate."" By his reckoning, humanity now has about 30 days to save itself. He says that unless a decisive agreement is reached at the 192-nation summit on climate change that opens Dec. 7 in Copenhagen, all is lost.
\
So, all is lost. The chances of a comprehensive and binding treaty are approximately nil.
\
The fourth of five parlays preparing for Copenhagen occurred in Bangkok from Sept. 28 through Oct. 9, with delegates from about 180 nations participating. Remember diplomat George Kennan's axiom that the unlikelihood of reaching an agreement is the square of the number of parties at the table?
\
The meeting adjourned with, as usual, essentially no progress toward an agreement on reduced emissions by developed nations or on the money such nations should pay to finance developing nations' efforts against global warming.
\
The New York Times reports that ""the United Nations Adaptation Fund, which officially began operating in 2008 to help poor countries finance projects to blunt the effects of global warming, remains an empty shell, largely because rich nations have failed to come through with the donations they promised."" The fund has a risible $18 million, which might not cover the cost of the Copenhagen conference.
\
There they will experience more futility because of, among other things, two stubborn facts -- the two most populous nations. On Oct. 21, China, the world's leading emitter of greenhouse gases, and India, which ranks fourth -- together they account for 26 percent of emissions -- jointly agreed: They, with their combined one-third of the world's population, will not play in what increasingly resembles a global game of climate-change charades.
\
Neither nation is interested in jeopardizing its economic growth with emission caps of a sort that never impeded the growth of the developed nations that now praise them. But do not really embrace them.
\
Recently, the U.S. House of Representatives took time out from fending off the world and exempted large cattle, dairy and hog producing operations from an Environmental Protection Agency requirement for reporting greenhouse gas emissions.
\
And 13 Great Lakes cargo ships were exempted from a proposed mandate requiring the use of low-sulfur fuel. When constituents' interests conflict with global grandstanding, Congress' rule is ""act locally, think globally tomorrow, maybe.""
\
In their new book, ""SuperFreakonomics,"" Steven D. Levitt, a University of Chicago economist, and Stephen J. Dubner, a journalist, worry about global warming but revive some inconvenient memories of 30 years ago. Then intelligent people agreed (see above) that global cooling threatened human survival.
\
It had, Newsweek reported, ""taken the planet about a sixth of the way toward the Ice Age average."" Some scientists proposed radical measures to cause global warming -- for example, covering the Arctic ice cap with black soot that would absorb heat and cause melting.
\
Levitt and Dubner also spoil some of the fun of the sort of the ""think globally, act locally"" gestures that are liturgically important in the church of climate change. For example, they say the ""locavore"" movement -- people eating locally grown foods from small farms -- actually increases greenhouse gas emissions. They cite research showing that only 11 percent of such emissions associated with food are in the transportation of it; 80 percent are in the production phase and, regarding emissions, big farms are much more efficient.
\
Although the political and media drumbeat of alarm is incessant, a Pew poll shows that only 57 percent of Americans think there is solid evidence of global warming, down 20 points in three years. Gallup shows that only 1 percent of Americans rank the environment as their biggest worry. Two reasons are:
\
They are worried about their wages, which will not be improved by clobbering a weak economy with the costs of a cap-and-trade carbon-reduction regime. And climate Cassandras are learning the wages of crying ""Wolf!""
\
In 2005, global warming worriers warned, as they tend to do after all adverse or anomalous environmental events, that Hurricane Katrina was caused by global warming and foreshadowed an increase in the number and destructiveness of hurricanes.
\
As this year's Atlantic hurricane season ends, only three hurricanes have formed -- half the average of the last 50 years -- and none have hit the United States.
"
232,"Thomas L. Friedman is a syndicated columnist for The New York Times.\ OK, class, it's time for another news quiz. I'll give you the question and you tell me who asked it and why it was significant. Ready? Here goes:\ ""Mr. President, how would you rate yourself as an environmentalist? What specifically has your administration done to improve the condition of our nation's air and water supply?""\ You'll never get it. The questioner was James Hubb, a member of the audience at the second presidential debate between George W. Bush and John Kerry at Washington University in St. Louis on Oct. 8, 2004.\ What's the significance? It was the only direct question about energy or environmental policy that was posed in any of the three presidential debates in 2004. Hard to believe when you consider the salience of these issues today. Is it any wonder we still don't have a serious energy policy?\ We can't afford to make this mistake again. In this election cycle, we need to hold a ""Green Debate,"" devoted only to energy and environmental questions. I would suggest Tulane University in New Orleans on Aug. 29, 2007 -- the second anniversary of Katrina. That would give the candidates, Republicans and Democrats, all summer to develop positions and it would give the voters all fall to examine them before the big primaries in February 2008.\ I would like to see each party's candidates questioned separately, so Republican voters and Democrats can each focus on their primary candidates. The questioning should be done by a three- person panel consisting of one climate scientist, one energy investor and one college student, since young people will be the ones most affected by global warming.\ We can't let ethanol-promoting farmers in Iowa determine our energy policy anymore by virtue of the early Iowa primary. For too long, all we've had in this country is energy politics, not energy policy, and that is why we have this incoherent mess of energy systems, standards and fuels.\ ""A new conversation has started in the country -- a new energy economy is what the people want,"" said Carl Pope, director of the Sierra Club. To get there, though, we need to force politicians to start thinking about going ""green"" as part of our national security strategy, as a Plan B for disengaging from Iraq and still driving reform in the Middle East, as an economic opportunity, as a way to restore U.S. leadership and as an answer for climate change.\ Since addressing all these issues will require a carbon tax, or a really serious cap-and-trade system, or tighter mileage and efficiency standards -- i.e., sacrifice -- we need our candidates to be talking about such things in the campaign so they have a mandate to act if elected.\ A group of environmental entrepreneurs, including Andrew Shapiro of GreenOrder and Jesse Fink of Marshall Street Management, just created a Web site, GreenPrimary.org, to host online forums where, after the Green Debate, voters can study the different candidates' policy positions and even vote for the one they think is most serious. ""The 2008 presidential campaign will present the first opportunity for a national candidate to make sustainability a breakthrough electoral issue,"" Mr. Shapiro argues.\ A new survey released last week by the Democratic polling firm Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research, conducted for the Center for American Progress, underscores that large majorities of independents (59 percent) and Democrats (76 percent) support action now to stop global warming and make the U.S. energy-independent, along with a significant bloc of Republicans (41 percent).\ ""Only 27 percent of people feel that our energy policy is headed in the right direction, while 65 percent say our energy policy is seriously off on the wrong track,"" the Greenberg firm said. ""Moreover, a majority of Americans (52 percent) believes the U.S. is either falling or has fallen far behind other countries in developing clean, alternative energy. Only 14 percent of people believe we lead the world in developing these technologies.""\ They're right. The biggest energy deficit we have right now in America is the energy to lead on this issue -- to overcome all the entrenched interests that have tied us in knots and left our country with what the energy expert Gal Luft calls ""the sum of all lobbies"" instead of the sum of the best energy practices.\ The best way to overcome that is to elevate the issue during the campaign to a level that forces everyone to put a serious energy/ environment platform on the table and builds a real mandate for the next president."
233,"
In December, the nations of the world agreed once again to do nothing about climate change.
\
And just as the science of climate change is more clear than ever, so too are the politics: Whether led by President George W. Bush or Barack Obama, the United States is thwarting meaningful action on climate change. As people around the world lose faith in the U.S. government, it's long past time for individual Americans to think rationally - about both science and economics. It's time to act with compassion toward those whose lives are already being affected by climate change.
\
Following the closing of the United Nations climate talks in Cancún, Mexico, I shared an airport shuttle with a woman from South Africa. Delegates from every country except Bolivia had just agreed again to delay action on everything from carbon emissions reductions to funding adaptation projects in developing countries, where the impacts of climate change are most severe. She's disappointed. ""They agreed last night that they were pleased to be going home,"" she said.
\
Adapting to climate change isn't about saving the environment, she says. It's about economics and survival. But the American people tell their leaders not to act, she says. In a democracy, after all, elected leaders carry out the wishes of citizens.
\
That wasn't the first conversation I had in Cancún with someone baffled by U.S. behavior. Time and again, whether riding the bus, standing in security lines, or eating dinner, I met people from across the world who asked me what is happening in America.
\
They do not understand why the U.S. government has for 20 years challenged a binding international agreement to cut carbon emissions, mitigate the impacts of climate change and help developing nations deal with drought, rising seas, or floods that destroy infrastructure. People from Senegal, Ghana, Zimbabwe, Panama, Columbia, India and across the European Union asked me why the American people don't care about climate change.
\
Despite the actions of my government, I try to explain that many Americans do care about climate change.
\
States like California are trying to lower greenhouse gas emissions and create incentives that to help both businesses and regulators by reducing emissions and boosting the clean energy economy. A new rule in New Mexico ensures that soon the state's polluters will have to reduce their carbon dioxide emissions by three percent a year from 2010 levels. And the state approved a separate proposal paving the way for participating in a cap-and-trade plan under which 11 states and Canadian provinces have agreed to establish a regional, market-based emission reduction program.
\
In November eight municipalities - Boston, Cambridge, Grand Rapids, Florida's Lee County, Flagstaff, Miami-Dade, San Francisco and Tucson - received funding from a nonprofit organization to participate in a program to help local governments prepare for eli mate -change impacts that are already occurring. Connecticut, Maine, Colorado and Florida already have statewide action plans to deal with climate change; others are studying its impacts and economic consequences.
\
In the United States, the significant action on climate change - whether state laws mandating the use of renewable energy or municipal improvements to public transportation systems and bike routes - is happening at a local level. But it's not nearly enough. Citizens need to urge the federal government to act. And we each have work to do within our own lives.
\
Speaking during the U.N.'s opening ceremony, the chair of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Rajendra Pachauri, said that the warming of the climate system is unequivocal. But he also pointed out that lifestyle changes can contribute to climate change mitigation.
\
In other words, individual choices matter. Each of us can cut our consumption of electricity and fossil fuels. Consumer choices matter, as do investments in companies that act responsibility and reduce their carbon footprints.
\
Most of the people I met in Cancún have already accepted that the U.S. government will never lead on climate change. But they still wonder why the American people fall for the histrionics of industry-funded climate change deniers when the science of climate change is clear. They are waiting for Americans to pay attention to the rising seas, the Amazon's burning forests and the glaciers melting from mountains across the globe. They n re waiting for citizens to demand that the United States become a responsible member of the international community.
\
But they're not going to wait for long. That became painfully clear to me as I headed toward the airport with my fellow South African passenger.
\
""Everyone used to want to be like America,"" she said. ""I think that is not the case anymore.""
"
234,"
LOS ANGELES -- Republican front-runner John McCain picked up the endorsement of actor-turned-governor Arnold Schwarzenegger on Thursday and predicted the backing of more political stars is on the way.
\
""You will see a flood of endorsements across this country from both liberals and conservatives,"" McCain said.
\
The California governor joins Florida Gov. Charlie Crist and former presidential contender Rudy Giuliani, who dropped out of the race Wednesday, on the list of big-name Republicans to back McCain in recent days. The Arizona senator is trying to take command of the GOP race during the contests being held from California to New York on Tuesday.
\
Some analysts say endorsements help in individual states, but may be more valuable in creating a sense of inevitability. ""It just greases the axles of the bandwagon,"" said John Pitney, a former House GOP aide who teaches at Claremont McKenna College near Los Angeles. ""People want to be with a winner.""
\
Mitt Romney, who is chasing McCain for the nomination, played down Schwarzenegger's support. ""Their views are similar on a number of subjects,"" he said.
\
In addition to lauding his ""incredible credentials in national security,"" Schwarzenegger praised McCain for his efforts to ""end wasteful spending.""
\
He cited McCain's environmental policies during an event at a company that makes solar-paneled roofing. McCain has been a vocal supporter of a plan that would cap greenhouse gas emissions and allow companies to trade emission allowances, known as ""cap and trade."" The senator wants such a program to be mandatory.
\
Schwarzenegger lauded McCain for being able to work with Democrats to get things accomplished. Some conservatives say McCain has been too cozy with Democrats and has adopted their positions on the environment, immigration and other issues.
\
""He's spent a decade now essentially 'dissing' conservatives,"" said David Keene, chairman of the American Conservative Union.
\
Meanwhile, Mitt Romney compared rival McCain with Richard Nixon yesterday, accusing McCain of persistently misrepresenting Romney's position on the Iraq war for political gain in a style ""reminiscent of the Nixon era.""
\
Romney's sharp criticism spilled over from the GOP debate in California the night before, where he said McCain was resorting to old-style ""dirty tricks"" by claiming Romney supported a timetable for troop withdrawal.
\
McCain leveled the troop-withdrawal charge the weekend before Tuesday's Florida primary, which he won, and repeated it at the debate. But Romney has persistently said he does not support a timetable for withdrawal.
\
""I think he took a sharp detour off the straight-talk express by stooping to the attack he did, and then of course by him continuing to say it is a very strange thing. And as I mentioned last night, every independent voice that I've seen has pointed out that what he's done is disingenuous and not honorable,"" Romney said in Long Beach, Calif.
\
""Had he a question about this he could have raised it any time between April and now, but to raise it outside a debate and to do it ... to people in Florida was something reminiscent of the Nixon era and I don't think I want to see our party go back to that kind of campaigning.""
\
Romney is locked in a taut contest with McCain, and is trying to derail the Arizona senator's mounting momentum off his wins in Florida, South Carolina and New Hampshire.
\
Romney's campaign announced yesterday it would be going on air in several major states voting Feb. 5, when 21 states hold GOP contests.
\
Initial indications show support for McCain is increasing following his win in the Florida presidential primary and the subsequent withdrawal of Giuliani.
\
Gallup Poll Daily tracking data from Jan. 28-30 shows McCain with a 15 percentage point lead over Romney. McCain is the top choice of 37 percent of Republican voters nationwide, compared with 22 percent for second-place Romney.
\
In Wednesday's release, the gap between McCain and Romney was 11 points (32 percent and 21percent, respectively).
\
Mike Huckabee is holding steady in third place at 17 percent. Giuliani was included in the Jan. 28 and 29 interviewing, but removed from the ballot Wednesday. The one-night interviews from Jan. 30 -- with Giuliani out of the race -- show a substantial increase in McCain's support, suggesting his lead will likely expand in the coming days.
\
Yesterday in San Francisco, Huckabee insisted he remains in it to capture the nomination.
\
""I'm staying in the race because I still think I can win,"" the former Arkansas governor told the Commonwealth Club of California during a midday appearance at the Fairmont Hotel.
\
He said he expects Super Tuesday success in Bible Belt states such as Arkansas, Georgia, Missouri, Oklahoma and Tennessee, and to pick up some delegates in conservative California locales such as San Diego; he was scheduled to campaign there later yesterday with former candidate Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., who has endorsed him.
\
Earlier, he told the audience of about 200 he's not angling to be the vice presidential nominee, noting his campaign signs clearly say ""Huckabee for President.""
\
""I will not quit. If somebody beats me, that's how they'll get me out of the race.""

235,"
The Christie administration on Wednesday officially moved to block the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's implementation of new clean-energy rules, blasting them as ""unprecedented regulatory overreach.""
\
Gov. Christie, who is seeking the Republican presidential nomination, announced his opposition to the rules immediately after President Obama unveiled them last month as part of an ambitious effort to combat climate change.
\
On Wednesday, Christie's top environmental regulator, Bob Martin, wrote to EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy requesting a stay of implementation and a proceeding for reconsideration of the rules.
\
The regulation ""punishes states, including New Jersey, that have already achieved significant reductions in carbon emissions, by setting even stricter goals for them, even though many other states have made much less progress in reducing emissions and are given less stringent emission targets than New Jersey,"" Martin wrote.
\
The state Department of Environmental Protection made similar arguments against draft rules proposed last year.
\
Carbon dioxide accounts for 82 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to global warming, according to the EPA. Power plants that generate electricity from fossil fuels, such as coal, are the largest source of U.S. carbon emissions.
\
Christie's office said New Jersey was the first ""clean energy"" state to file its objection with the EPA.
\
""This is a fundamentally flawed plan that threatens the progress we've already made in developing clean and renewable energy in New Jersey without the heavy-handed overreach of Washington,"" Christie said in a statement Wednesday.
\
The Obama administration's plan, announced Aug. 3, seeks to combat climate change by reducing carbon emissions from the nation's power plants and creating incentives for investing in clean energy.
\
By 2030, Obama's plan would require New Jersey to reduce its carbon emissions by about 26 percent from 2012 levels, or from 1,091 pounds per megawatt-hour to 812.
\
Nationwide, by 2030 power plants would have to cut their carbon pollution 32 percent below 2005 levels.
\
EPA spokeswoman Laura Allen said the plan was ""based on a sound legal and technical foundation, and it was shaped by extensive input from states, industry, energy regulators, health and environmental groups, and individual members of the public.""
\
She added that the EPA and Justice Department would ""vigorously defend"" the plan in court to ensure its ""significant health benefits and progress against climate change are delivered to all Americans.""
\
New Jersey says it reduced carbon dioxide emissions from its power sector by 33 percent from 2001 to 2012. Nuclear power, which does not emit carbon, accounts for about half the Garden State's energy production. And New Jersey ranks third in the nation, behind California and Arizona, in total installed solar capacity, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
\
The state generates less than 5 percent of its electricity from coal, down from 20 percent in the 1990s, the federal agency says.
\
Christie last month said he was ""totally opposed"" to the new rules. ""This is, again, the overregulation of the Obama administration,"" he said then on Fox News' America's Newsroom.
\
Christie added, ""This is the greatest regulating administration in the history of the United States, and it is going to kill American businesses and jobs, as it has.""
\
Christie has taken other steps to try to roll back environmental regulations in New Jersey. In 2011, he pulled the state out of the nation's first regional cap-and-trade program for greenhouse gases.
\
The Obama administration established carbon reduction targets for each state and is requiring the states to develop plans to meet those goals. States must meet interim goals between 2022 and 2029 and final ones by 2030. They are required to submit initial plans by September 2016 and final ones by 2018.
\
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) has urged governors to not submit plans. Last month, West Virginia and 14 other states filed an emergency petition with the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington seeking a stay of the rule.
\
Other states, including New York, say that filing was premature and have vowed to defend the rules in court once they are published in the Federal Register.
\
Environmentalists say New Jersey in particular could benefit from the new regulations, given warnings about rising sea levels associated with climate change. They say New Jersey can meet the goals by expanding solar production and investing in wind-powered energy.
\
Jeff Tittel, director of the New Jersey Sierra Club, accused Christie of ""siding with polluters against the interests of the people of New Jersey"" and ""using his national political ambitions to hurt our environment.""
\
He added that other states' reduction in greenhouse gases would improve New Jersey's air quality. ""If New Jersey won't comply, then how do we get Pennsylvania to comply?"" Tittel said.

236,"
Even for people who don't believe in it, climate change just got real. It's about time.
\
The Obama administration's proposed new rule for existing power plants -- reducing heat-trapping carbon emissions by up to 30 percent by 2030 -- is ambitious enough to get anyone's attention. No, this one measure will not halt or reverse human-induced warming of the atmosphere. But the rule is necessary in the context of seeking international consensus on solutions -- and also significant in its own right.
\
Before Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Gina McCarthy could announce the new rule Monday, critics were already bellowing about higher energy rates and lost jobs. They pretended not to see that President Obama -- as with health care reform -- is taking what ought to be seen as a Republican-friendly approach.
\
The rule, which will not become final until next year, gives states great flexibility in how they reach the target. They are not forced to immediately begin shutting down the aging coal-fired power plants that constitute one of the biggest sources of carbon pollution. Rather, each state can take the path that best fits its circumstances -- ramping up the generation of energy from renewable sources such as wind and solar, for example, or entering regional cap-and-trade agreements.
\
Ultimately, however, hundreds of those aging, dirty, coal-fired plants will have to close. If the planet could speak, it would say good riddance.
\
Many of those who do not believe in climate change also reject the idea that carbon dioxide can be called a pollutant, since it is a natural and necessary component of the air we breathe. But direct measurement shows that the concentration of carbon dioxide in atmosphere has increased by an astounding 40 percent since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, when humankind began burning fossil fuels in earnest. As with any poison -- or pollutant -- it's the dose that counts.
\
This thickening pall of human-generated carbon dioxide -- which traps heat, according to universally accepted principles of physics and chemistry -- has coincided with a long-term rise in average temperatures that agrees with climate scientists' predictions. The big unanswered question isn't scientific, it's political: Will we continue to turn up the thermostat?
\
The question that some skeptics like to pose -- ""Why should the United States take such a big step on its own?"" -- is meaningless, when you think about it.
\
China is the world's largest emitter of carbon dioxide. Emissions are rising sharply in India and other rapidly industrializing countries. Nothing the United States does unilaterally, or even in concert with Europe and Japan, can solve the problem. What we really need is a global solution.
\
All this is true, but one less ton of carbon makes an incremental difference, however slight. Obama's major energy initiatives -- higher fuel economy standards for vehicles, plus the new power plant emissions rule -- will mean billions of tons less of carbon dioxide in the air. It is true that we cannot save the planet on our own. But it is also true that if warming-induced disaster is inevitable, it will arrive sooner if we fail to act.
\
Meanwhile, Chinese and Indian universities are full of scientists who are warning their own governments about the negative impacts of carbon emissions. China has already signaled its intention to move away from coal, and while this is easier said than done, Chinese officials have an added incentive: The noxious smog that shrouds major cities, most of it from coal-fired power plants, has stoked real anger among the country's burgeoning urban middle class. In other industrializing countries as well, as people get richer they will demand a cleaner environment.
\
Obama hopes that action by the United States, the richest country in the world, will make it possible for the other big carbon emitters to act. Some of the domestic critics who scoff at this notion also complain that Obama, in their view, does not sufficiently assert U.S. leadership around the globe. What do these people think leadership means, if not actually leading?
\
The bonus is that closing coal-fired power plants will encourage the development of cleaner energy sources. The power generation industry was already moving toward cheap, plentiful natural gas, which releases much less carbon. Gas should be seen as a bridge toward clean, renewable energy sources -- an industry that will be huge in the 21st century.
\
It's our choice. We can try our best to ensure that the next industrial revolution -- the one that ends dependence on fossil fuels -- happens here. Or we can watch it happen in China.

237,"
A much-anticipated federal proposal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions would cut coal production, shutter coal-fired power plants and raise electricity prices in the name of limiting climate change over the next 15 years, the Environmental Protection Agency said on Monday.
\
Coal supporters and political opponents accused the Obama administration of needlessly threatening jobs and the reliability of the power grid with a cap-and-trade policy. The push to get states to limit emissions to specified levels by 2030 gives governors and regional coalitions flexibility to hit those goals, though, which garnered at least initial support from some industry leaders and environmental advocates.
\
""We asked for the states to be in the driver seat on how we can best meet that goal. It appears that's exactly what they're promoting,"" said Jacob Smeltz, president of the Electric Power Generation Association in Harrisburg. ""Pennsylvania will be in a great position to write its own plan.""
\
The potential cost of that plan brought backlash, especially from the coal industry, which says it supports 63,000 endangered jobs in the state.
\
""Once again, federal regulators are pushing impractical standards without regard for their consequences,"" said John Pippy, CEO of the Pennsylvania Coal Alliance. ""Those consequences include driving up electricity prices and eliminating the most reliable power source from the nation's energy portfolio.""
\
Implementing the plan will cost as much as $8.8 billion a year, the EPA said. Critics worry that money will pay for nothing, as countries such as China continue to burn coal with little or no environmental regulations.

\
EPA administrator Gina McCarthy said the administration has a ""moral obligation to act on climate."" The proposal calls for states to hit reduced emissions goals compared to 2005 levels through efficiencies at plants, lowering electrical demand and shifting to cleaner energy sources.

Pennsylvania figures prominently in the debate as a top electricity and coal producer, advocates said. Coal mined in 30 counties is used to produce about 40 percent of the state's electricity. The state has more than 30 coal-fired power plants.
\
Critics said the rules would push power plants offline. The EPA's analysis predicted the rule would take about 25 percent of coal-powered electricity off the grid by 2030. It will increase retail electricity rates by as much as 6.5 percent by 2020, though the EPA said overall bills would drop with less usage.

238,"President Obama will have plenty of explaining to do when he arrives in Allentown today. More than 3 million Americans have lost their jobs in the nine months since he signed into law a trillion-dollar ""stimulus"" that was supposed to put people back to work ""immediately."" Only one in eight Pennsylvanians, according to a recent Franklin & Marshall College survey, feel they have benefited from ""national economic recovery efforts.""\It's not hard to figure out why. Instead of spurring job creation, the taxpayer dollars being spent on this ""stimulus"" have been directed to all kinds of questionable projects, including $800,000 to repave an alternate runway at Democratic Rep. John Murtha's Johnstown ""airport for nobody,"" which serves just a handful of people a week.\Having been promised much more than a ""jobless recovery,"" the American people are right to wonder whether Washington Democrats can be trusted to turn things around, especially when their costly policies are only making matters worse.\Washington Democrats' government takeover of health care -- priced at $1.3 trillion and counting -- is funded by new taxes that will fall heavily on small businesses that are trying to create new jobs, and harsh mandates that require employers to either provide ""government-approved"" coverage or pay another steep tax.\According to a methodology developed by a senior White House economist, these sorts of tax increases would result in as many as 5.5 million more American jobs lost over the next 10 years. The effects of this government-takeover-of-health-care bill will be felt not only in job losses, but in higher insurance premiums and fewer Medicare benefits for seniors.\Democrats also have in the works a ""cap-and-trade"" national energy tax, a bureaucratic nightmare that would make households, small businesses and family farms pay higher prices for electricity, gasoline, food and virtually every product made in America. One independent analysis determined that this national energy tax would cost our economy anywhere from 2.3 million to 2.7 million jobs each year for the foreseeable future.\The very prospect of these and other costly policies has caused employers large and small to hold off on hiring decisions, freezing the job market at the worst possible time.\Further complicating matters is the shaky state of our nation's balance sheet as President Obama and Democrats in Congress continue to pile unsustainable debt on our kids and grandkids. The national debt recently topped $12 trillion for the first time in U.S. history with no relief in sight: The Washington Democrats' budget doubles the debt in five years and triples it in 10.\All this government borrowing hurts job creation by undermining confidence in our economy and making it harder for small businesses to gain access to much-needed credit.\Washington Democrats continue to rely on more spending, more taxes and more government as the answer to every problem. Maybe that's because it's all they know. A whopping 90 percent of the Obama administration Cabinet's professional experience is in working for the government. This represents by far the least private-sector experience of any presidential Cabinet going back more than 100 years. As a former small businessman, I know what it takes to meet a payroll and a bottom line. America's entrepreneurs are being left behind by out-of-touch Washington Democrats' wrong-headed policies.\That's why Republicans have offered common-sense solutions to break down barriers to economic growth and help small businesses create jobs, starting with a recovery plan that would have helped create twice the jobs at half the cost, and a budget that would impose strict caps to limit federal spending. Instead of the national energy tax, Republicans would implement an ""all of the above"" strategy to create jobs, lower energy prices and clean up our environment.\In stark contrast to Washington Democrats' government takeover, Republicans have proposed the only health care bill that would lower premiums, cut the deficit and consistently reduce federal spending on health care over the next two decades.\President Obama may be willing to offer families asking, ""Where are the jobs?"" a shoulder to cry on, but only Republicans are providing answers and a responsible blueprint for action.\Republican John Boehner of Ohio is the House minority leader.\Credit: By Rep.

239,"If the long conservative era that began with Ronald Reagan's election is over, will the judges appointed during the right's ascendancy be able to block, frustrate and undermine the efforts of a new progressive majority? Consider this analysis from two influential journalists describing Supreme Court justices as ""the last hope of the conservative interests in the United States.""\Imagine, they write, that a new liberal approach to the country's problems ""had been overwhelmingly approved both in Congress and at the polling booths,"" so ""conservative interests resorted to the courts, starting literally thousands of actions to stay the government's hand."" Of the ensuing fight, they say: ""The liberal justices themselves called their conservative colleagues arbitrary and madly unwise. But while the liberals warned, the conservatives laughed ... ""\Yes, we may go back to the future. Those words are from a still-compelling 1938 book called ""The 168 Days"" by legendary Washington journalists Joseph Alsop and Turner Catledge. They were writing about the conservative Supreme Court that struck down so much of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal program and the effort by FDR to be given the power to name additional liberal justices to break the court's conservative majority.\Roosevelt's reach for expanded executive authority was unwise because he made it easy for his opponents to compare him to Hitler and Stalin. FDR lost the court-packing fight, but eventually got to name justices in the normal way, and conservative judicial dominance ebbed.\The spate of 5-4 conservative decisions during the Supreme Court term just ended should stand as a warning that we may soon revisit the fights of 70 years ago. Yet almost nobody is talking about this danger. To the extent that judges have been a campaign issue in recent elections, the focus has been on a few hot-button issues, notably abortion. After last week's sharply contested Second Amendment case, perhaps gun rights will join the list.\But the more important question is whether conservative judges will see fit to do exactly what conservative courts did for much of the New Deal era by using a narrow, 19th-century definition of property rights to void progressive economic, environmental and labor regulation.\Many judicial conservatives view the late-1930s period as a disaster because it marked the end of their power on the courts. After the court-packing battle, the Supreme Court began to defer to the democratically elected branches of government and their efforts to regulate the economy in the public interest. Property rights were well protected throughout this time, yet government was allowed to set rules on the uses of property that judicial conservatives of the pre-New Deal period viewed as suspect.\A new generation of conservatives wants to bring the old order back under the auspices of what's called the Constitution in Exile movement.\Their driving idea is that the thrust of jurisprudence since the late 1930s voided the ""real"" Constitution.\As legal scholar Jeffrey Rosen noted in The New Republic, this movement favors ""reimposing meaningful limits on federal power that could strike at the core of the regulatory state for the first time since the New Deal."" He wrote that ""justices could change the shape of laws governing the environment, workplace health and safety, anti-discrimination, and civil rights, making it difficult for the federal government to address problems for which the public demands a national response.""\It's not hard to imagine the cases that conservatives would bring against laws passed by a Democratic Congress and signed by a President Barack Obama. Why wouldn't a movement that has tried to eviscerate wetlands laws and the Endangered Species Act challenge cap-and-trade legislation aimed at dealing with global warming? If Congress ever passed a ""card-check"" law to make it easier for unions to organize, those who never much liked the minimum wage or collective bargaining would certainly try to overturn the new labor right in court.\And what would be the legal fate of new regulations on banking called forth by the economic devastation of the subprime mess, or bank bailouts that may be necessary to keep capitalism on track, or mandatory mortgage renegotiations to keep citizens from being thrown out of their homes?\The four conservatives on the Supreme Court, when empowered by the swing vote of Justice Anthony Kennedy, have already shown their willingness to overturn the will of Congress and local legislatures when doing so fits their political philosophy. The same majority could keep conservative ideas in the saddle long after the electorate has decided that they don't work anymore."
240,"Don Hopey can be reached at dhopey@post-gazette.com or at 412-263- 1983.\ Saying proposed federal regulations on mercury will be too weak and slow, several environmental and other interest groups are petitioning Pennsylvania to impose strict limitations on the toxic emissions from coal-burning power plants.\ Citizens for Pennsylvania's Future, called PennFuture, filed the petition for rule-making with the state Department of Environmental Protection in Harrisburg yesterday, asking the state to reduce mercury emissions from utility companies to protect the health and environment of Pennsylvanians.\ ""One in six women of childbearing age has so much mercury in her body that her nursing infant or fetus is in danger of brain damage,"" said Charles McPhedran, senior attorney for PennFuture. ""And our state's streams and fish are so contaminated with mercury that Pennsylvanians have been warned to restrict their consumption of fish to avoid being poisoned.""\ McPhedran said the technology to limit mercury emissions exists and the state can legally impose regulations that are tougher than those proposed by the Bush administration.\ ""The problem is ours to solve,"" he said. ""We're calling on the DEP to take immediate action.""\ Other petitioners are PennEnvironment, Pennsylvania Federation of Sportsmen's Clubs, Pennsylvania NOW, Pennsylvania State Building & Construction Trades Council, Pennsylvania Trout, Planned Parenthood Pennsylvania Advocates, Sierra Club Pennsylvania Chapter, Women's Law Project and WomenVote PA.\ The DEP has 30 days to review the petition. If deemed complete, it would be submitted to the department's Environmental Quality Board, chaired by DEP Secretary Kathleen McGinty, which would decide to accept or reject it.\ A final state ruling would not be implemented for another nine months.\ McGinty has called the Bush administration's proposal to give power plants up to 15 years to curb unhealthy mercury pollution an ""economic blow and a public health disaster."" But Kurt Knaus, a spokesman for the DEP, said the state plans to wait for the federal rule-making in March before acting on tighter mercury curbs.\ ""Yes, we want more stringent regulations on mercury, but we feel the most appropriate way is an aggressive federal rule that also deals with the transport and local concentrations,"" Knaus said. ""If the federal government chooses less stringent controls, then the state would look to other avenues to get greater mercury reductions.""\ He said the state is developing its own strategy for reducing pollutants, focusing on nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide in addition to mercury, and will also continue to move forward on a regional approach to pollution reduction.\ ""The PennFuture petition is another weapon for the state to ensure we will have stronger mercury reduction plans,"" Knaus said. ""We absolutely support its goals.""\ Mercury is released into the air when coal is burned. It then falls to the ground and is washed into streams and lakes where it enters the food chain, accumulating in the tissues of plants and animals as methylmercury, the most toxic and harmful form of mercury.\ Humans are exposed primarily by eating fish. Pregnant women, children and subsistence anglers are most at risk for health effects that include brain and nervous system damage in children and heart and immune system damage in adults.\ Because of elevated mercury levels, a one-meal-a-week consumption advisory for all fish caught in Pennsylvania waters has been in effect since April 2001. The state ranks third, behind Texas and North Carolina, for the amount of mercury released by power plants.\ Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Jersey and Wisconsin have already taken over regulatory control because of the Bush administration's proposal to reclassify mercury under a less stringent section of the federal air pollution law and back off imposing mercury controls at all of the nation's 1,100 coal- and oil-fired power plants.\ The administration has proposed using a ""cap and trade"" system that would allow utility companies to reduce mercury emissions from some power plants but not others. It would cost companies $5 billion to implement and its goals would be reductions of 14 million tons, or 30 percent, by 2010 and 70 percent by 2018.\ The Bush plan falls short of the 90 percent reduction in mercury emissions by 2008 proposed by the Clinton administration and endorsed by Bush's first EPA administrator, Christine Todd Whitman.\ The public comment period on the administration's proposal is over. Pennsylvania submitted comments that were highly critical.\ John Hanger, PennFuture president and chief executive officer, said many of the state's coal-fired power plants are old and extremely profitable because of a loophole in the 1990 amendments to the federal Clean Air Act that exempted older facilities from mercury controls. Other industries, including municipal and medical incinerators, have reduced emissions by 90 percent.\ ""Those old utility plants were supposed to be closed or cleaned up under the original intent of the Clean Air Act,"" Hanger said. ""This is the perfect time for responsible public officials to insist in the name of women, children and sportsmen that those plants reduce their mercury emissions."""
241,"
A much-anticipated federal proposal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions would cut coal production, shutter coal-fired power plants and raise electricity prices in the name of limiting climate change over the next 15 years, the Environmental Protection Agency said on Monday.
\
Coal supporters and political opponents accused the Obama administration of needlessly threatening jobs and the reliability of the power grid with a cap-and-trade policy. The push to get states to limit emissions to specified levels by 2030 gives governors and regional coalitions flexibility to hit those goals, though, which garnered at least initial support from some industry leaders and environmental advocates.
\
""We asked for the states to be in the driver seat on how we can best meet that goal. It appears that's exactly what they're promoting,"" said Jacob Smeltz, president of the Electric Power Generation Association in Harrisburg. ""Pennsylvania will be in a great position to write its own plan.""
\
The potential cost of that plan brought backlash, especially from the coal industry, which says it supports 63,000 endangered jobs in the state.
\
""Once again, federal regulators are pushing impractical standards without regard for their consequences,"" said John Pippy, CEO of the Pennsylvania Coal Alliance. ""Those consequences include driving up electricity prices and eliminating the most reliable power source from the nation's energy portfolio.""
\
Implementing the plan will cost as much as $8.8 billion a year, the EPA said. Critics worry that money will pay for nothing, as countries such as China continue to burn coal with little or no environmental regulations.

242,"WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama is pledging a provisional target for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, the first time in more than a decade that a U.S. administration has offered even a tentative promise to reduce production of climate-altering gases, the White House announced yesterday.\At the international climate meetings in Copenhagen next month, Mr. Obama will tell the delegates that the United States intends to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions ""in the range of"" 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050, officials said.\The figures reflect targets specified by legislation that passed the House in June but is stalled in the Senate. Congress has never enacted legislation that includes firm emissions limits or ratified an international global warming agreement with binding targets.\Mr. Obama will travel to the U.N. talks to deliver the promise in hopes of spurring significant progress there. He will appear Dec. 9, near the beginning of the 12-day session, on his way to accept the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo on Dec. 10, officials said.\By making the pledge in an international forum, Mr. Obama is laying a bet that Congress will complete action on a climate bill next year and will be prepared to ratify an international agreement based on the commitment.\But White House officials acknowledged that those outcomes were uncertain. They will depend in large measure on whether the legislation's Democratic sponsors can win 60 votes for a measure that is at the moment unpopular, and whether major developing nations -- notably, China and India -- deliver credible emissions reduction pledges of their own.\Mr. Obama has met over the past two weeks with the leaders of China and India, the fastest-growing sources of greenhouse gases, to discuss climate change and the Copenhagen conference. U.S. officials said both countries told the president that they would be prepared to announce steps to reduce the rate of growth of emissions if the United States put a pledge on the table.\Neither has done so yet, although Chinese officials have hinted that they will announce a near-term target for reducing energy use relative to economic growth, or ""carbon intensity,"" before the Copenhagen conference opens.\""Obviously, we hope other major economies will put forth ambitious action plans of their own,"" Carol M. Browner, the president's senior adviser for energy and climate change, said at a White House briefing yesterday morning.\Mr. Obama, who had not previously committed either to emissions targets or to going to Copenhagen, has been under pressure from other leaders and environmental advocates to reassert U.S. leadership on climate change.\Swedish Environment Minister Andreas Carlgren said Mr. Obama had now raised expectations for the Copenhagen talks, but he expressed a note of disappointment about his visit's timing. He said he hoped that Mr. Obama would come in the final days of negotiations, when dozens of other heads of government were planning to arrive. A White House official said a return trip was ""highly unlikely.""\It was unclear what effect Mr. Obama's promise of domestic emissions reductions would have on the slow progress of climate legislation through Congress. Until now, the administration's negotiators have said they will not get ahead of Congress in making promises in an international forum. But Mr. Obama has now essentially adopted the targets of a climate and energy bill that passed the House in June.\The House bill aims at greenhouse gas reductions of 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 and sharper cuts in the following decades, through a cap-and-trade system that includes most of the nation's major sources of carbon dioxide emissions. Last month, a Senate committee passed a measure calling for a 20 percent cut by 2020, but that is expected to be weakened as the legislation moves through other Senate committees and onto the floor, perhaps next spring.\""By putting a serious number for U.S. emission reductions on the table, the president has just called the world's bet and then raised it for our negotiating partners,"" said Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., a co-sponsor of the House legislation.\Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., a co-sponsor of the Senate legislation, said he believed the president's actions would give a boost to the Copenhagen talks and help move the Senate bill. He called the decision on a U.S. target a ""game changer,"" domestically and internationally.\""By announcing a provisional target, contingent on the support of Congress, the president has defined a path to an international agreement that challenges the developed and developing nations to fulfill their obligations,"" he said. ""It lays the groundwork for a broad political consensus at Copenhagen that will strip climate obstructionists here at home of their most persistent charge, that the United States shouldn't act if other countries won't join with us.""\But Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., the Senate's most outspoken skeptic on climate change, said Mr. Obama's public pledge would do little to speed an international agreement. Mr. Inhofe said Senate climate legislation was ""dying on the vine,"" and that the Senate would never ratify a treaty that did not require strong emissions reductions from major developing countries.\""The U.S. Senate has made clear on numerous occasions that unilateral action by the United States is unacceptable, because it will harm our economy and have virtually no effect on climate change,"" Mr. Inhofe said."
243,"
Following the death of Sen. Edward Kennedy, Democrats in the Massachusetts state legislature rushed to change a procedural rule thus allowing Democratic Gov. Deval Patrick to replace Kennedy with an interim and Democratic senator. During the 2004 presidential election this same august body had taken that power away from Republican Gov. Mitt Romney fearing he would appoint a Republican should their junior senator, John Kerry, become president. The maneuver displays the arrogance of the left. So significant is their agenda that changing the rules in the middle of the game is justified. Arrogance also leads them to dismiss disgruntled Americans as racists and dimwitted ""tea baggers."" It is arrogance of the strongest sort that leads them to believe their policy solutions divinely inspired such that they say openly that Americans will take the medicine of the new left and learn to like it.
\
Last week, Massachusetts voters humbled Democrats by reversing the decision of their state legislators and electing Republican Scott Brown to a U.S. Senate seat that has been held by Democrats for all but six years since 1926. Tuesday's vote provided definitive proof that ""God don't like ugly. And he ain't too fond of cute.""
\
As Republicans anticipate the mid-term elections and what appears like an opportunity to shift the balance of power in the Congress, it is wisdom the GOP would be wise to remember. The special election in Massachusetts was not solely a referendum on the health care boondoggle the new left is attempting to force down America's [clearly unwilling] throat; it was also a clear refutation of the president's economic policy as well as a refutation on the free spending ways of the previous administration. It would be arrogance of the Democratic sort for Republicans to imagine that Tuesday's repudiation of Democratic over-reaching was an endorsement of Republican congressional governance of the sort America witnessed during the first decade of the 21st century.
\
To say that voters were not enamored with Republican spending during the Bush administration is an understatement. In a relatively short time the Obama administration, along with a Democratic Congress, has made Bush look like a miser They have expanded the federal budget by $1 trillion; tripled the deficit; is on track to add $1 trillion per year to the national debt for the foreseeable future; accelerated spending on social entitlement programs and proposed another trillion dollar takeover of the health care industry all the while holding a cap and trade tax in its hip pocket. ""We are fed up!"" is the message voters delivered last November and again in Massachusetts on Tuesday. To put it plainly, Americans are looking for responsible government.
\
The GOP must take care that they do not become the party of opposition. Rather, over these next months they must seek to define themselves as the party with an alternative plan for America's future-a plan based on common economic sense.
\
To whit: money borrowed must be repaid with interest; dollars printed reduce the value of dollars saved and public works projects initiated with the goal of stimulating the economy only succeed in diverting capital from one sector of the economy to another. Further, they are paid for by tax dollars and ultimately become a drag on economic growth. The jobs government creates are government jobs, which are paid for through tax dollars. What government can do through prudent regulation and streamlining of bureaucratic processes is to create a hothouse environment friendly to entrepreneurs and small business owners, who are the true source of job creation and economic stimulus.
\
For instance, in this country there is an enormous amount energy in a variety of forms: off our shores lays an estimated, 19 billion barrels and substantial natural gas reserves. The hinterlands of Alaska contain another 16 billion barrels of crude. There are another almost two trillion barrels available in oil shale. And we have not even mentioned our vast resources of coal, out capacity to produce nuclear energy and the ongoing development of solar and wind power.
\
An ""all of the above"" energy policy that would continue to encourage the development of alternative energy while at the same time reducing bureaucratic and activist roadblocks to our abundant natural resources would literally create millions of jobs, add trillions of dollars to our GDP, substantially lower consumer costs and aid in our national security with little or no cost to the American taxpayer.
\
Or we could borrow another trillion dollars and pass another ""stimulus bill.""
\
The voters of Massachusetts expressed their dissatisfaction with government over-reaching and fiscal irresponsibility with a loud and courageous voice. They showed great wisdom on Tuesday. With any luck some of that insight will find its way to Nevada and the streets of San Francisco in November.

244,"WASHINGTON -- Former Vice President Al Gore sharply criticized President Barack Obama as lacking leadership on climate change in a magazine essay published online Wednesday, saying his policies had been little more effective than those of former President George W. Bush.\In the 7,000-word article in Rolling Stone, Mr. Gore said Mr. Obama clearly understood the threat to the planet posed by global warming, and that he had appointed a number of committed environmental advocates to key positions.\But Mr. Gore said that in the face of well-financed attacks from fossil-fuel industries and denial and delay from Republicans in Congress, Mr. Obama had failed to act decisively to alter the nation's policies on climate change and energy. \Addressing climate change on national and international levels will require forceful U.S. leadership, he said.\""Yet President Obama has never presented to the American people the magnitude of the climate crisis,"" Mr. Gore wrote. ""He has simply not made the case for action. \He has not defended the science against the ongoing, withering and dishonest attacks. Nor has he provided a presidential venue for the scientific community -- including our own National Academy -- to bring the reality of the science before the public.""\A White House spokesman defended Mr. Obama's record in a written statement. \""The president has been clear since Day 1 that climate change poses a threat domestically and globally, and under his leadership, we have taken the most aggressive steps in our country's history to tackle this challenge,"" said White House press officer Clark Stevens.\Under Mr. Obama, he said, the United States has spent billions of dollars on clean-energy technology, imposed tough new emissions standards for cars and trucks and taken the lead in international climate-change talks.\Mr. Gore's extended outburst of frustration signals a public turning point for him, and perhaps for other environmental advocates who have been quietly seething for months over what they view as the administration's timidity.\Mr. Gore, who shared a Nobel Peace Prize for his climate advocacy, praised some of the president's actions, including the new vehicle standards and the investments in green technology. \But in recent months he has told friends that the president has been too passive on climate change and has not been sufficiently supportive of Lisa P. Jackson, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, who has tried to advance greenhouse-gas regulation against stiff congressional opposition.\Much of Mr. Gore's essay is devoted to criticism of the media as failing to report accurately on the scientific consensus that climate change is real, and that it is most likely caused by human activities. \He said the media had been cowed by an aggressive lobbying and public relations campaign financed by the oil, gas and coal industries, or had presented ideological entertainment in the guise of news reporting.\Mr. Obama has tried to move the country away from fossil fuels and has made the connection between oil imports and national security, Mr. Gore wrote. \""But in spite of these and other achievements, President Obama has thus far failed to use the bully pulpit to make the case for bold action on climate change,"" he said. ""After successfully passing his green stimulus package, he did nothing to defend it when Congress decimated its funding. \""After the House passed cap-and-trade, he did little to make passage in the Senate a priority.""\Paul Bledsoe, a former Clinton White House energy aide and now senior adviser at the Bipartisan Policy Center, said: ""I entirely disagree with Gore here. Obama has consistently made a compelling case for climate action based on the science and has fought in Congress and internationally for robust policies to cut emissions and promote clean energy. The administration's failing on climate has, in fact, been political.""\Mr. Gore also turned to public officials of both parties. ""Many politicians, unfortunately, also fall into the same two categories: Those who cheerlead for the deniers and those who cower before them,"" he wrote. ""The latter group now includes several candidates for the Republican presidential nomination who have felt it necessary to abandon their previous support for action on the climate crisis; at least one has been apologizing profusely to the deniers and begging for their forgiveness.""\Mr. Gore does not name them, but former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, former Utah Gov. and ambassador to China Jon M. Huntsman Jr., and former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty have backtracked on their support for state and federal action to address global warming.\Near the end of the article, Mr. Gore acknowledged that he might be hobbling a president trying to do the right thing in a difficult environment.\""All of his supporters understand that it would be self-defeating to weaken Obama and heighten the risk of another step backward,"" he wrote. But he said he felt compelled to speak out because the stakes were incalculable.\""The climate crisis, in reality, is a struggle for the soul of America,"" he concluded, using the voice of prophet and teacher that he has assumed on this topic for more than 20 years.\""It is about whether or not we are still capable -- given the ill health of our democracy and the current dominance of wealth over reason -- of perceiving important and complex realities clearly enough to promote and protect the sustainable well-being of the many.

245,"WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama turned to experienced political hands Monday to fill his Cabinet, choosing a high-ranking Environmental Protection Agency official as the nation's top clean air and water watchdog, and a Clinton administration veteran as his energy secretary.\Gina McCarthy, now an assistant administrator in charge of air and radiation, would replace Lisa Jackson, the well-liked but controversial EPA leader in Mr. Obama's first term. The president tapped Ernest Moniz, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology physicist, to replace Steven Chu at the Department of Energy. Both must be confirmed by the Senate.\Mr. Obama, who held his first Cabinet meeting of his second term Monday, also announced a new budget director: Sylvia Mathews Burwell. He said his EPA and Energy Department picks will be charged with investing in American energy and creating jobs and economic opportunity, as well as ""doing everything that we can to combat the threat of climate change.""\""They are going to be a great team,"" Mr. Obama said. ""And these are some of my top priorities going forward.""\In his first term, the EPA implemented standards for mercury pollution, tightened rules on soot pollution and established tougher emissions standards for new power plants. It also set higher fuel-economy standards for automobiles, which the administration boasts will do more to reduce global greenhouse-gas emissions than any action taken by other nations.\Ms. McCarthy, who played a major role in developing the tougher fuel standards, earned praise from clean-air advocates for her work on air pollution. She is a former state environmental regulator who once worked for Mr. Obama's 2012 election opponent, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney.\Environmental groups praised Ms. McCarthy's appointment. They wanted the EPA to be led by someone who would uphold the agency's authority to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act, and they got that with Ms. McCarthy, said Frances Beinecke, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council. She ""knows what it means to protect our air, water, land and health, and stand up to the growing threats we're seeing from climate change,"" Ms. Beinecke said.\But industry offered fainter praise, as did lawmakers from states where energy dominates the economy. American Petroleum Institute President Jack Gerard said in a statement that he was concerned about pending regulations that could raise the price of gasoline, rules for greenhouse-gas emissions from refineries, and new ozone standards. ""President Obama says his top priority is creating American jobs, and we will continue working with the EPA and the administration to help avoid jeopardizing that goal,"" he said. ""The problem is that EPA, in many cases, is not proposing regulations that meet this goal.""\Republican lawmakers, who have attacked the EPA for what U.S. Chamber of Commerce president Tom Donohue called ""burdensome permitting requirements,"" are expected to put up more of a fight. Ms. McCarthy's predecessor was a lightning rod for criticism from manufacturers and utilities, who were concerned that the agency had overstepped its regulatory authority.\Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, the top Republican on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said she wanted the leaders of both agencies to consider energy security. ""I'm willing to work with both DOE and the EPA to address the shared challenges we face, but it truly must be done in a way that recognizes the benefits of an energy supply that is not only clean, but also abundant, affordable, diverse and secure,"" she said. ""My support will depend on both nominees demonstrating that they can lead DOE and the EPA in a way that restores balance to these objectives.""\It was no coincidence that Mr. Obama announced his top energy and environment picks the same day he announced a new White House Office of Management and Budget director. Congress wasn't able to pass cap-and-trade legislation in 2010 and is unlikely to take up a sweeping climate bill again. So the challenging and politically fraught work of curtailing greenhouse-gas emissions likely will continue within the executive branch, where the Office of Management and Budget will be a key part of the deliberations.\The administration is finalizing emission rules for new power plants. Its next fight could be writing rules that would target existing power plants, which will pose the political challenges of regional energy interests as well as pressure from big polluters and the influential energy sector.\Mr. Moniz, whom Mr. Obama called ""another brilliant scientist,"" drew a ringing endorsement from the nuclear power industry. But he is opposed by some environmental groups for describing domestic natural gas production, which commonly uses a process known as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, as a bridge to lower-carbon sources of energy.\""The next secretary of energy will play a key role in deciding how we address climate change, and President Obama needs to appoint an actual proponent of green energy to guide our nation's energy future,"" said Wenonah Hauter, director of the environmental group Food & Water Watch.\Mr. Moniz served as both a scientific adviser and an Energy Department undersecretary during President Bill Clinton's administration. In his time at the Department of Energy, he oversaw science and energy programs and led a comprehensive review of nuclear weapons stockpile stewardship. He also served as the secretary's special negotiator for Russian nuclear materials disposition programs."

CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Jim Rogers wants to do something about global warming. But the chief executive of Duke Energy Corp. also has a growing customer base that needs power now, and he says that means building more coal-fired plants.
\
It's a dilemma faced by many in a position to significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions, and one highlighted by President Bush's visit to North Carolina yesterday to tout cellulosic ethanol -- a fuel that has the potential to reduce gasoline consumption but remains years away from widespread use.
\
""My job is, when you throw on the switch, I need to be there,"" Rogers told The Associated Press. ""My No. 1 job is to make sure there is a reliable supply of energy for our customers.
\
""While I've devised a plan to assure reliability, I also have to do the right thing for the environment.""
\
The United States is by far the biggest emitter of carbon dioxide and other gases blamed by scientists for global warming, and for years, Rogers has been one of the few utility executives to speak out publicly about the need to reduce carbon emissions.
\
Last month, he joined chief executives of nine other major U.S. corporations -- including BP America Inc. and General Electric Co. -- to push Bush and Congress to address climate change. The group, known as the United States Climate Action Partnership, wants a nationwide limit on carbon dioxide emissions that would lead to reductions of 10 percent to 30 percent over the next 15 years.
\
Their announcement came a day before Bush -- who for years said there wasn't enough known about global warming to act, and that efforts to cut back greenhouse gases emissions would harm the U.S. economy -- proposed reducing gasoline consumption by 20 per-
\
cent in 10 years during his State of the Union address.
\
Bush's administration has also set a goal of reducing ""greenhouse gas intensity,"" which measures the ratio of greenhouse gas emissions to economic output, by 18 percent by 2012.
\
""That's good, but more can and should be done,"" Rogers said.
\
Need better tools:The problem, Rogers and others said, is that the technology and infrastructure for alternative energy doesn't yet exist to substantially satisfy the energy demands of a country dependent on cars, computers and all kinds of modern electrical conveniences.
\
""There is no way we can supply the electricity that keeps our lifestyle going in the United States with alternative energy sources right now,"" said CreditSights bond analyst Dot Matthews. ""The technology and resources aren't enough.""
\
Cellulosic ethanol, which Bush promoted yesterday, is made from waste, wood, plants and other biological products. While experts said the entire process from harvest to production to actually burning cellulosic ethanol instead of gasoline would lead to a 70 to 90 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, it remains experimental and commercial-size refineries are several years away.
\
""The next couple of years will be a test,"" said Steve Bantz, a senior engineer with the clean vehicles program at the Union for Concerned Scientists. ""We will then see if they can really make this happen and make it economical.""
\
At Duke, the new nuclear power plants the company has suggested building -- hardly a favorite of the same environmental and consumer groups upset with Duke's desire to expand its coal-burning capacity -- are about a decade away from coming online.
\
Increased demand:In the meantime, Rogers has 3.9 million customers spread across several states. In North Carolina alone, Duke expects a 50 percent increase in demand from 2000 to 2030 due to new homes, new businesses and what Rogers called a ""love affair with anything electronic.""
\
To meet that demand, Duke -- the nation's third-largest consumer of coal -- wants to spend $3 billion to build two coal-fired units at its existing Cliffside Steam Station in western North Carolina.
\
Opponents worry about the plant's effect on air quality and say Duke hasn't taken enough steps to generate more capacity through conservation.
\
""I think it's a contradiction,"" said state Rep. Paul Luebke, a Democrat from Durham. ""It's a contradiction for Mr. Rogers to be in the international press talking about Duke's commitment to fighting global warming while at the level of North Carolina the company seems to be committed to moving full steam ahead (on the Cliffside project).""
\
Rogers said Duke is working to avoid the adverse impact of its disproportionate reliance on coal, but the new plants are necessary to meet a booming market with a growing need for power -- a need he said he can't yet serve solely with clean technology.
\
In the interim, he supports a so-called cap-and-trade system, which he said would create a financial incentive for reducing emissions by assigning a cost to polluting. It is one of a few ideas floating around on Capitol Hill, a place Rogers has been recently visiting -- sometimes weekly -- to talk with lawmakers about the issue.
\
""I've gotten past the problem,"" Rogers said. ""I'm focusing on the solutions.""

247,"Incumbents, beware.\Fourteen-term West Virginia congressman Alan Mollohan was crushed in the state's Democratic primary Tuesday, three days after three-term U.S. Sen. Bob Bennett, R-Utah, was bounced by his party. The anti-incumbency fervor in the state next door underscores the sense of uncertainty about U.S. Sen. Arlen Specter's primary bid next week -- where multiple polls show the six-term incumbent in a dead heat with challenger Joe Sestak -- and the special election looming across its border in Pennsylvania's 12th District.\Mollohans have represented northern West Virginia's 1st District since 1969. Robert Mollohan served there for seven terms (after a previous two terms in the 1950s), then groomed his son Alan to take over in 1983. But state Sen. Mike Oliverio, D-Morgantown, wiped the years away on a fiscally conservative message calling for change in Washington, and it carried him to a mighty 56-44 percent win.\The rebuke of Mr. Mollohan, an Appropriations Committee member, is all the more remarkable in the home state of nine-term U.S. Sen. Robert Byrd, a place that values politicians with Capitol Hill seniority and the porcine largesse that marks the species.\""The irony is what kept Mollohan in office so long was incumbency and the delivery of money and projects that comes with it,"" said Robert Rupp, a West Virginia Wesleyan College political science professor. ""Fourteen terms is part of what kept him out of a fifteenth.""\The race reflects the high tide of anti-incumbency sentiment nationwide. A Washington Post/ABC News poll late last month found the share of registered voters who want to replace their members of Congress at its highest rate since the early 1990s.\Mr. Oliverio ran against Washington as much as he did Mr. Mollohan. The Army veteran and five-term state legislator launched his congressional bid outside the Bureau of the Public Debt offices in Parkersburg and his campaign featured an iPhone application with a national debt clock.\""My message was clear. The state's financial house was in trouble and we had to make tough choices to get it in order,"" he said in an interview yesterday. ""My goal is help do my part for that on the national level.""\That criticism may not be what national Democrats want to hear, but it spoke to socially and fiscally conservative Democrats in West Virginia, who may fit the profile of many in southwest Pennsylvania, said supporter Frank DeCarlo, a Pittsburgh attorney and boyhood friend of Mr. Oliverio.\The results were also an affirmation of Mr. Oliverio's skill as a campaigner. \The congressman had not faced a competitive race in years and perhaps lacked the metabolism for the tough race Mr. Oliverio gave him -- the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee sent him strategic support late, to no avail. Republicans sensed weakness in the incumbent too, running three candidates this year after allowing him to be unopposed in 2008. Wheeling Republican David McKinley will face Mr. Oliverio in November.\Democrats have a 2-to-1 registration edge over Republicans in the West Virginia district, though it voted for John McCain in the 2008 presidential race. That profile tracks the fellow coal-country 12th Pennsylvania District across the border, where Republican Tim Burns is battling Democrat Mark Critz in Tuesday's special election.\Mr. Critz is not an incumbent but he is closely tied to his late boss, John Murtha, who held the seat for 36 years before his death in February. \In the West Virginia contest, Mr. Oliverio criticized Mr. Mollohan on health care reform and cap-and-trade energy policy, despite the fact that the incumbent ultimately voted against the environmental bill, while being a late vote in favor of the health measure. That, too, is a sign of the times. \""In this political environment,"" said Dr. Rupp, ""it isn't enough for a congressman to vote against a bill. He has to be seen as actively acting against it."""

Law shouldn't shield corruption
\
Editor: Judge Richard Caputo's recent ruling that former Luzerne County judges Mark A. Ciavarella and Michael Conahan are not liable for their actions from the bench may be legal but it isn't right.
\
Slavery and segregation were at one time legal but they were never right. Judge Caputo cites Supreme Court cases dating back to 1871 that established judges cannot be civilly sued for their actions from the bench even if they act in bad faith. That is ludicrous.
\
This is a law that definitely needs changing and I hope that the plaintiffs pursue this all the way to the Supreme Court. Throughout our history, decisions of the Supreme Court have been reversed or altered for the better. The Supreme Court's decision of 1896 in the case of Plessy v. Ferguson served as the organizational legal justification for racial segregation for over 50 years. In 1954 in the case of Brown v. The Board of Education the Supreme Court dismantled the legal basis for racial segregation in schools and other public facilities.
\
The decisions of Ciavarella and Conahan regarding the incarceration of so many juveniles were absolutely immoral and were based on their selfish greed for money. Shame on them. Our judicial system is a good one but there is definitely room for improvement and this would be a good case with which to start.

Oil dependency hurts economy
\
Editor: The Nov. 23 letter from Peter J. Sepp of the National Taxpayers Union claims that our best possible energy policy is to continue an overreliance on foreign oil. But all that does is dim the light on the truth: Our addiction to foreign sources of energy is costly to our economy, our environment and our security.
\
The clean energy (sometimes called cap-and-trade) legislation under debate in Washington has the potential to create 1.7 million new jobs across the country, including 70,000 here in Pennsylvania. Developing technologies like wind, solar and hydroelectric power will save average Pennsylvania families nearly $1,100 in annual household energy costs. And a transition to a clean energy economy will allow major reductions in carbon emissions that, left unchecked, cause volatile weather patterns, agricultural failure and ruined ecosystems.
\
While big oil companies and their lobbyists would have us believe otherwise, the U.S. dependency on foreign oil hurts our economy, aids our enemies and puts our national security at risk. And the oil industry certainly doesn't cry the blues when gas hits $4 a gallon.
\
One thing is certain -- this issue isn't dead. Clean energy and climate reform will put us back to work, protect our climate for future generations and make us safer and more secure. I hope you'll join us in continuing to urge Sens. Bob Casey and Arlen Specter to pass this legislation and put America on the path toward energy independence.

Cool counterpoints on climate change
\
Editor: Over the past few days, articles from ""mainstream media"" sources, such as Associated Press, have been carried in The Times-Tribune, which have presented an increasingly hysterical portrayal of the alleged crisis in ""climate change."" These articles take for granted that the earth is warming up, and that mankind is the culprit, due primarily to a ""greenhouse"" effect caused by increasing carbon dioxide emissions.
\
What is particularly outrageous is the complete lack of coverage on the part of the ""mainstream media"" of those climatologists, not a small number, who do not share in this assessment. These latter scientists hold firmly to the conviction that the various warming and cooling periods that the earth has experienced have been the results of the activity of the sun, and not anything that mankind has done.
\
These climatologists are pointing out that, for the past several years despite increased carbon dioxide emissions, the earth has been cooling down. About a year ago, one Russian climatologist went so far as to say that we are entering another ""ice age.""
\
To add more fuel to the fire, according to the Washington Times, it was announced Thursday that computer hackers had obtained e-mails from the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia in England. Those e-mails involved communication among many scientific researchers and policy advocates with similar ideological positions all across the world. Those purported authorities were brazenly discussing the destruction and hiding of data that did not support global-warming claims.
\
Professor Phil Jones, the head of the Climate Research Unit, and professor Michael E. Mann, at Pennsylvania State University, who has been an important scientist in the climate debate, have come under particular scrutiny.
\
One must raise the question as to whether the hysteria generated over alleged man-made ""global warming"" is supporting some greater global agenda, such as a political power-grab.

249,"In Soldiers&Sailors Memorial Hall&Museum, where many of the region's war veterans are commemorated, people gathered Wednesday to kick-start a battle they believe must be won quickly to mitigate the impact of climate change.\""Climate change is a global threat that will change our lives dramatically, but we can take smart, proactive steps to combat it,"" said U.S. Rep. Mike Doyle, D-Forest Hills, who hosted the town hall-style meeting. ""But we must take those steps rapidly to avoid the most dire consequences of climate change.""\Although many in the audience of about 400 appeared to be members of a knowledgeable climate change choir, the meeting was one of the first opportunities for residents of the region to learn more about the issue and potential pathways to address it.\""It's an important issue and I hope to gain a better understanding of the nuts and bolts of how climate policy will be developed in the U.S.,"" said Mike Roth, a doctoral student in the engineering and public policy program at Carnegie Mellon University, before the meeting started.\""It doesn't seem the current administration is very receptive to cap and trade or a carbon tax - two of the main proposals that have been hopping around. But delay will be costly, and the sooner we act the less costly it will be to address the issue.""\That sense of urgency was a common theme. Mr. Doyle said the U.S. must achieve zero net carbon emissions by 2050 and become ""carbon negative"" after that.\Patricia DeMarco, an author, biologist and member of Forest Hills council, said the globe is on track for 2019 to be the warmest year ever recorded, and climate change is already affecting human health, infrastructure, emergency services and the natural environment. She said it's costing the nation billions of dollars a year.\""It's real, it's happening now all over the world and in Western Pennsylvania, too,"" she said. ""The latest report by U.S. agencies says we need to reduce carbon emissions by 40% by 2030. We don't have time to dilly-dally. We need to reframe the climate change debate, to acknowledge the cost of not acting on climate change is huge.""\There is scientific certainty that the global climate is warming at an unprecedented rate and that the primary cause is human activity, including the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil, that increases the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping greenhouse gases.\On a warmer planet, growing seasons will be longer in some areas, increasing crops. But most effects will impact human populations negatively.\As temperatures continue to rise, scientists say there will be more droughts and heat waves, more severe storms and stronger hurricanes. Sea levels will rise by 1 to 4 feet by 2100, the Arctic is likely to become ice free in summer and glaciers will melt.\Two panels of experts addressed climate change topics, including how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; the workforce needs of a renewable energy economy; the development of technology to mitigate climate change impacts; and government actions at the federal, state and local levels.\Jay Whitacre, director of CMU's Wilton E. Scott Institute for Energy Innovation, said hundreds of researchers at CMU and the University of Pittsburgh are working on climate change, but more financial support is needed to get emerging research into the hands of big corporations with the means to implement the new technology.\Ron Gdovic, chief executive officer of WindStax Energy, a 2012 startup that manufactures hybrid wind and solar systems in Pittsburgh, said ""new technologies can drive a new economy"" in the region.\Ashleigh Deemer, of PennEnvironment, a statewide environmental advocacy organization, said it has been conducting a lobbying effort to educate state legislators about the perils of climate change and the need for quick action to fill the federal void, but she said it's still ""a heavy lift.""\Another recurring topic was economic justice for displaced workers. Jami Bey, a panel moderator and chief executive officer of UrbanKind, said, ""People have to see themselves as successful in the new economy.""\In a news release prior to the meeting, a coalition of 11 local organizations announced their support of the meeting, which they hoped would be the first of many to draw attention to and help speed action on the issue.\""[The meeting] comes at an opportune time, as there is a push from the American people to greater prioritize climate change during the presidential debates, and every day more studies emerge about how little time we have to act as climate change affects our food, air, water, health and supersizes weather events in more dire ways than previously thought,"" the coalition stated\The coalition also encouraged other members of the Pennsylvania congressional delegation to follow Mr. Doyle's example by holding town halls of their own on climate change.\""While we believe it's important to broaden the understanding about the severity and widespread impact of climate change, it's equally important for our elected officials at all levels of government to transition this knowledge into finally doing something,"" the coalition stated. ""We will look for further opportunities to hold our decision makers accountable and push them to enact meaningful policies.""\Mr. Doyle said he's optimistic about enacting a robust climate change policy, but admitted it will require ""changing a lot of faces in the Senate and, most importantly, in the White House.""\Art Fleming, a retired ophthalmologist, and his wife, Sharyn, who have 24 grandchildren, left the meeting feeling optimistic.\""It was great to hear people talking about all this stuff and the concerns about climate change,"" Mr. Fleming said. ""People are involved. I'm hopeful. They're working on a lot of stuff. I think it will happen eventually. It has to.""\Don Hopey: dhopey@post-gazette.com or 412-263-1983.

Basking in apathy
\
Editor: Granted, our area's weather has been chilly this winter, but our planet's climate is getting hotter.
\
According to NASA, 20 of Earth's warmest years occurred since 1981 and 10 occurred in the past 12. The number of record high temperature events in the U.S. has increased, while the number of record low temperature events has decreased. Arctic, Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are melting and glaciers are retreating. During this century, global sea levels rose twice as much as they did during the last century.
\
If the Earth continues to heat up, extreme weather will further destabilize the delicate balance that makes life on the planet possible.
\
So what should we do? According to Rep. Tom Marino, nothing. Mr. Marino opposes regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, the establishment of a ""cap and trade"" system, environmental regulations and the establishment of international emissions targets aimed at reducing the effects of climate change, strengthening fuel efficiency standards, and enacting environmental regulations aimed at reducing the effects of climate change.

End payroll tax
\
Editor: Lately there has been a lot of talk about the minimum wage. Those who call for an increase in the minimum wage are convinced that such action will help low-income Americans. There is a much better way to aid the working poor.
\
Eliminating the federal payroll tax is a much better way to help lower-income employees than raising the minimum wage. The poor and middle class will benefit if the payroll tax is abolished. The federal payroll tax falls disproportionately on lower- and middle-income Americans. This is a very unfair tax.
\
A large segment of the middle class will be hurt by a minimum wage increase. What often gets overlooked is that small-business owners make up a significant portion of the middle class. Raising the minimum wage will erode the profits of many small and midsize employers. If small and midsize business owners have lower profits, this will cut into the employment opportunities available to the working poor. In short, a minimum wage increase will hurt almost everyone, including the poor.
\
Why increase the minimum wage when there is a much better way to help those with lower incomes? Doing away with the payroll tax will result in lower wage earners having a net pay that is nearly equal to their gross pay. This is, in effect, a raise for lower- and middle-income employees. Eliminating the payroll tax is a win-win idea for all Americans.

Bogus priority
\
Editor: With his approval ratings sagging and Pennsylvania ranking 46th in job growth, Gov. Tom Corbett needs to distract voters as he faces re-election. That seems to be at least part of his motivation for supporting bills in the Legislature that would prevent public workers like teachers, firefighters, nurses and others from voluntarily having their union dues deducted from their paychecks. What a crock.
\
Payroll deduction of union dues is easy, accomplished with almost zero cost. Yet, the bills' supporters are making the ridiculous claim that they are motivated by fiscal responsibility. And contrary to misinformation spread by some of the bills' supporters, dues collected from public workers cannot be used to contribute to political campaigns or directly support candidates for public office.
\
So why are Mr. Corbett, some legislators and even some county commissioners spending so much time and effort trying to keep public employees from having their dues automatically deducted?
\
Maybe they want to please wealthy and powerful donors to their campaigns. Right-wing, out-of-state donors like the Koch brothers and groups like the Commonwealth Foundation have become notorious for writing bills to weaken the ability of workers in the private and public sectors to protect their wages and benefits from being arbitrarily reduced by their employers, to have a voice on the job.
\
Of course, the bills won't touch deductions that are made to big banks, insurance companies and financial companies even though they use the money to spend heavily on lobbying and politics.
\
Rather than pushing this and other divisive measures that hurt the state's wage earners, like right-to-work laws, cuts in education funding and the privatization of the state's liquor stores, Mr. Corbett and his allies in the Legislature should reach out and bring citizens together.

The biggest problem facing the next president will be preserving and creating manufacturing jobs in the United States, says United Steelworkers President Leo W. Gerard.
\
""To get the economy moving in the right direction again, we need to reinvest in our industrial base and in new technologies that will create good-paying manufacturing jobs,"" said Gerard, who heads the Pittsburgh-based USW, which has 850,000 members in the United States and Canada.
\
""American workers and companies both need to know how Sen. (Barack) Obama and Sen. (Hillary) Clinton will deal with this most serious problem,"" said Gerard, whose union represents workers in the nation's major manufacturing industries.
\
The USW chief and steel executives such as Allegheny Technology Inc. CEO L. Patrick Hassey will have an opportunity to question Democrats Clinton and Obama on their plans for strengthening the U.S. manufacturing sector during a forum this morning at the David L. Lawrence Convention Center, Downtown.
\
The event will not be a debate and is not open to the public. Obama is scheduled to speak first and leave, followed by a panel of labor-management representatives, and then Clinton, said Scott Paul, director of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, a nonprofit labor-management association in Washington. Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona was invited to speak but was unable to attend, Paul said.
\
""Energy, taxes, health care and trade are all issues ... that should be viewed through the framework of how it will affect our competitiveness and growth of manufacturing jobs,"" Paul said.
\
Paul said the alliance, which includes the USW and the country's major steelmakers such as Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel Corp. and Allegheny Technologies Inc., wants to know how the candidates would enforce trade laws, particularly against China, which subsidizes its industries.
\
Pennsylvania has lost 78,000 manufacturing jobs to China since 2001, while overall the state has seen about 200,000 manufacturing jobs disappear in that time, the alliance says.
\
""American manufacturers can compete against other industries in the world, but not against China,"" which has subsidized its steel industry with $50 billion in government aid over the past decade, said Nancy Gravatt, spokeswoman for the American Iron and Steel Institute in Washington.
\
Clinton, McCain and Obama say they would fight for fair trade.
\
""Our economy worsens as American manufacturers operate on an unlevel playing field created by bad trade laws,"" Gerard said. ""We cannot continue to lose hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs to countries like China that manipulate currencies, subsidize industries and dump products in order to capture markets.""
\
Obama has said the oft-criticized North American Free Trade Agreement, passed when Bill Clinton was president, should be amended. He has promised to work with leaders of Canada and Mexico to fix NAFTA.
\
Hillary Clinton said she would work to strengthen NAFTA's labor and environmental provisions, protect U.S. workers and provide stronger enforcement mechanisms.
\
McCain's campaign said the Republican favors multilateral regional efforts to reduce trade barriers. McCain representatives said there must be a level playing field and effective enforcement of global trading rules.
\
All candidates favor various measures to improve the environment.
\
The Alliance's Paul said environmental measures enforced against U.S. companies make it tougher to compete against foreign competition.
\
""How is it really possible to compete against China, when they spend just 10 percent of what a U.S. company spends on environmental controls?"" Paul said.
\
The Steel Institute wants a ""global carbon intensity standard"" on emissions that a steelmaker must meet for each ton of steel produced. That would require steel produced in China to meet the same pollution rules as that made by American companies, Gravatt said.
\
Phil Smith, spokesman for the United Mine Workers of America, which represents about 11,000 active miners and retirees in Pennsylvania, said his union's primary concern is ensuring a future for coal.
\
McCain's approach to coal use would cut the number of Eastern coal jobs -- including those in Pennsylvania -- by 30 percent by 2025 because of a climate change bill he has introduced, Smith said. Both Democrats are in favor of a cap-and-trade emission system, in which companies hitting a federally set emissions cap in one area could buy emission credits from manufacturers elsewhere that have not reached their cap.
\
""They're all getting out in front of the technology. They're making rules that will cut coal jobs, power rates will go up and power demand will not be met,"" Smith said.
\
The UMW wants more research and development into technology for capturing carbon emissions and injecting them into the ground rather than the air, Smith said. ""It really needs a whole lot of funding to get this off the ground.""
\
Obama wants to develop job-training programs for clean-manufacturing technologies. His campaign said he believes a requirement that 25 percent of American electricity be derived from renewable sources by 2025 would create jobs.
\
The Steel Institute wants an energy policy that promotes affordable alternative forms of increasing the energy supply, such as offshore drilling, nuclear power and a pipeline from Alaska's natural gas reserves to the lower 48 states, Gravatt said.
"
252,"Conservative activists are preparing to do battle with allies of Sen. John McCain in advance of this summer's GOP convention, hoping to prevent his views on global warming, immigration, stem cell research and campaign finance from becoming enshrined in the party's official declaration of principles.\Mr. McCain has not yet signaled the changes he plans to make in the 2004 Republican platform. But many conservatives say they fear wholesale revisions could emerge as candidate McCain seeks to put his stamp on a document that is currently a paean to the policies and principles of President Bush.\""There is just no way that you can avoid anticipating what is going to come. Everyone is aware that McCain is different on these issues,"" said Jessica Echard, the executive director of the conservative Eagle Forum. ""We're all kind of waiting with anticipation because we just don't know how he's going to thread this needle.""\Mr. McCain has spent the last year and a half trying to straddle the philosophical schism in the modern Republican Party. During the GOP primaries, he stressed his conservative credentials, but since clinching the nomination he has often reminded voters of his more moderate stances while also professing his fealty to conservative positions.\A platform fight at the convention threatens to disrupt that carefully choreographed effort by highlighting the stark differences in vision for the party separating Mr. McCain from some of the GOP's most dedicated activists.\The battle may not be avoidable. The current GOP platform is a 100-page document, and only nine of those pages do not mention Mr. Bush's name. Virtually the entire platform will have to be re-written to lessen the imprint of the current president, who has the highest disapproval rating of any sitting president since Richard Nixon.\It is the prospect of a total rewrite that worries some.\Mr. McCain is ""really out of step with the strong majority of his party,"" said Myron Ebell, the director of energy and global warming policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, which opposes Mr. McCain's positions on climate change. ""He might get what he wants. And he might get a change. But I don't think it's going to sit well with a lot of Republicans.""\RNC and campaign officials say they share a great deal of common ground with conservatives. They said their conversations as they approach the convention suggest there will not be a nasty platform fight.\""We are confident that this process will produce a platform that all Republicans will enthusiastically support,"" said Joe Pounder, a McCain spokesman. ""Our party is united and will continue to work together to elect John McCain in November.""\But such assurances are not enough for activists like Ms. Echard, who have been on the front lines of GOP platform fights for years. She will be traveling to Minneapolis for two weeks in August with the primary goal of making sure the 2008 platform is a document that reflects conservative principles.\One of Ms. Echard's main concerns is immigration. The current plank on that issue calls for a temporary worker program, something that Mr. Bush and Mr. McCain both supported but which many conservatives view as an unwarranted amnesty for people who arrived in the country illegally. She would like a much tougher position, but is wary of Mr. McCain, who has been vilified by some conservatives for his support of a temporary worker program.\""Our job is to make sure that the grassroots continue to have a say,"" she said.\Activists are also keeping a close watch on what the platform says about the environment. The current document has only one paragraph about global warming, which talks about using ""markets and new technologies"" to solve the problem of climate change and flatly states that the United States ""strongly opposes"" the Kyoto Protocol to curb emissions globally.\That contrasts sharply with Mr. McCain's message on the campaign trail. Government action to address global warming is a centerpiece of his campaign. He supports a cap-and-trade emissions plan that many conservatives oppose. And he has talked about trying to reach a global emissions agreement that includes China and India.\""It is something that we are very concerned with,"" said Don Devine, the vice chairman of the American Conservative Union, which will have a convention operation to monitor proposed changes to the platform. In past years, the ACU has produced an alternative conservative platform to offer as a guide to those working on the real one.\Mr. Devine said he is hopeful that the environmental planks in the platform will focus on Mr. McCain's support for nuclear power plants and his willingness to revisit offshore oil and gas drilling. But he's prepared for the worst.\""There's no question it's going to be changed radically,"" he said of the platform.\Most of the platform fights at past Republican conventions have centered around the abortion plank. Mr. McCain is campaigning as an abortion opponent, but conservative activists say they are not going to take anything for granted.\Colleen Parro, the executive director of the Republican National Coalition for Life, said her group will ""cause problems"" if Mr. McCain or his allies try to change that plank. But she's also focused on stem cell research, where Mr. McCain differs with many anti-abortion activists.\The current platform merely ""recognizes"" Mr. Bush's support for a limited amount of research on embryonic stem cells and praises his opposition to federal funding for the effort. Mr. McCain, by contrast, supports embryonic stem cell research."
253,"NEW DELHI -- For five hours every day, Ranjit Kumar and his 10-year-old son rummage through a giant pile of rotting trash with their bare hands, filling bags with pieces of metal, plastic and glass to take by cart to the recyclers market nearby.\But an incinerator under construction not far away may mean that he and other waste workers will lose access to the trash, he said, which fetches his family a little more than $5 a day.\The incinerator is one of two projects in New Delhi aimed at turning the city's trash into electricity and earning carbon credits under the Kyoto Protocol, the global climate pact designed to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. Local politicians have hailed the projects for addressing the city's chronic problems of excess untreated waste and a shortage of electric power.\But for almost 300,000 workers in the city engaged in waste collection, sorting and recycling, the plants mean the loss of their livelihood.\""If all the trash goes to the plants to be processed, how do we feed our stomachs?"" Mr. Kumar said as foul-smelling fumes rose from the trash and dark-brown water trickled past him. ""My work may look dirty, but it keeps my family alive.""\Waste-worker communities have mobilized in Brazil, Colombia, South Africa and India to campaign on behalf of trash dumps and the livelihoods they provide, and against the idea of burning waste. The United Nations, however, has been encouraging incinerator projects that burn waste -- rotting trash produces the potent greenhouse gas methane -- to produce energy.\Under the Kyoto Protocol, nations can earn carbon credits for such projects; the credits can be used to offset the emissions of coal-fired power plants elsewhere.\This month, hundreds of waste workers gathered outside the U.N. office in New Delhi to protest 21 municipal waste projects for which India has applied for carbon credit. The projects, not all completed, use biodegradable, combustible and inert waste. They include trash-to-compost, incinerators and refuse-derived fuel.\Waste-worker groups appealed to climate negotiators when they met in Mexico, Germany and China in the past year, and they are preparing to protest at the climate meeting in Durban, South Africa, set to begin next week.\Waste workers want access to the United Nations' $30 billion Green Climate Fund -- the effort by developed countries to help the developing world prepare for climate change -- for their role in mitigating climate change by recovering recyclable materials from waste.\But advocates of the trash-to-energy projects say that India's growing population, changing consumption patterns and urban boom have created a waste problem that must be addressed in a scientific manner.\""It is not an us-versus-them situation. We must frame the debate differently. Do we want the ragpickers to continue working in inhuman, hell-on-Earth, unhygienic conditions at these untreated dump sites? Should their sons and daughters do the same, too?"" asked Mahesh Babu, chief executive of IL&FS Ecosmart, which heads several trash-to-energy projects across India, including the incinerator near Mr. Kumar's neighborhood. ""The solution lies in integrating some of the waste-workers into the processing activities of the plants.""\But India has a staggering 1.7 million waste workers, and any effort to mainstream them is often just a drop. Mr. Babu's project in the central city of Nagpur has given jobs to 70 people to collect trash, out of a total of 1,700 waste workers in the city.\""The waste pickers are at the lowest rung of the occupational ladder and often the most marginalized, hence they do not have alternative livelihood options to which they can move,"" Prema Gera, assistant country director of the U.N. Development Program, said in an e-mail, referring to a study.\Bhojahari Paramni, 41, has worked with waste for 25 years. He removes dirt and twigs from balls of human hair in his home in a large slum of waste workers.\""You cannot take away my job and expect me to become a successful electrician, plumber or mason overnight,"" he said. There is no regulatory protection for waste workers in India.\Waste workers say that 80 percent of Indian trash is wet, organic waste and that 30 percent contains recyclable material.\""To run an incinerator, they will burn everything, including the recyclables like plastics. Is that good for the environment?"" asked Shashi Bhushan Pandit, secretary of the All India Waste Workers Union. This year, New Delhi residents protested another new incinerator because they feared emissions of dioxin and other toxic gases.\Two Indian waste workers will represent their country at next week's protest in Durban, which will demand that poor people be factored in climate policies.\Although the Kyoto Protocol, which the United States has not signed, is facing an uncertain future when it comes up for renewal in 2012, analysts say that its key component, carbon trading for emissions reductions, may survive in some form.\Countries such as China, Japan and New Zealand are developing carbon markets. California recently announced the nation's first state-run cap-and-trade program. This year, India launched an exchange program for renewable-energy certificates.\""We are hoping that the carbon-trading market will continue in some form -- both within India and bilaterally with other countries, even if the multilateral arrangements under the Kyoto Protocol are not renewed,"" Mr. Babu said.\He said carbon credit prices have fallen more than 50 percent in the past year because of the euro-zone economic crisis."
254,"
There is much in the House cap-and-trade energy bill that just passed that I absolutely hate. It is too weak in key areas and way too complicated in others. A simple, straightforward carbon tax would have made much more sense than this Rube Goldberg contraption. It is pathetic that we couldn't do better. It is appalling that so much had to be given away to polluters. It stinks. It's a mess. I detest it.
\
Now let's get it passed in the Senate and make it law.
\
Why? Because, for all its flaws, this bill is the first comprehensive attempt by America to mitigate climate change by putting a price on carbon emissions. Rejecting this bill would have been read in the world as America voting against the reality and urgency of climate change and would have undermined clean energy initiatives everywhere.
\
More important, my gut tells me that if the U.S. government puts a price on carbon, even a weak one, it will usher in a new mind-set among consumers, investors, farmers, innovators and entrepreneurs that in time will make a big difference -- much like the first warnings that cigarettes could cause cancer. The morning after that warning no one ever looked at smoking the same again.
\
Ditto if this bill passes. Henceforth, every investment decision made in America -- about how homes are built, products manufactured or electricity generated -- will look for the least-cost low-carbon option. And weaving carbon emissions into every business decision will drive innovation and deployment of clean technologies to a whole new level and make energy efficiency much more affordable. That ain't beanbag.
\
Now that the bill is heading for the Senate, though, we must, ideally, try to improve it, but, at a minimum, guard against diluting it any further. To do that we need the help of the three parties most responsible for how weak the bill already is: the Republican Party, President Barack Obama and We the People.
\
This bill is not weak because its framers, Reps. Henry Waxman and Ed Markey, wanted it this way. ""They had to make the compromises they did,"" said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign, ""because almost every House Republican voted against the bill and did nothing to try to improve it. So to get it passed, they needed every coal-state Democrat, and that meant they had to water it down to bring them on board.""
\
What are Republicans thinking? It is not as if they put forward a different strategy, like a carbon tax. Does the GOP want to be the party of sex scandals and polluters or does it want to be a partner in helping America dominate the next great global industry: ET -- energy technology? How could Republicans become so anti-environment, just when the country is going green?
\
Historically speaking, ""Republicans can claim as much credit for America's environmental leadership as Democrats,"" noted Glenn Prickett, senior vice president at Conservation International. ""The two greatest environmental presidents in American history were Teddy Roosevelt, who created our national park system, and Richard Nixon, whose administration gave us the Clean Air Act and the Environmental Protection Agency."" The elder George Bush signed the 1993 Rio Treaty, to preserve biodiversity.
\
Yes, this bill's goal of reducing U.S. carbon emissions to 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 is nowhere near what science tells us we need to mitigate climate change. But it also contains significant provisions to prevent new buildings from becoming energy hogs, to make our appliances the most energy efficient in the world and to help preserve forests in places like the Amazon.
\
We need Republicans who believe in fiscal conservatism and conservation joining this legislation in the Senate. We want a bill that transforms the whole country not one that just threads a political needle. I hope they start listening to green Republicans like Dick Lugar, George Shultz and Arnold Schwarzenegger.
\
I also hope we will hear more from Obama. Something feels very calculating in how he has approached this bill, as if he doesn't quite want to get his hands dirty, as if he is ready to twist arms in private, but not so much that if the bill goes down he will get tarnished. That is no way to fight this war. He is going to have to mobilize the whole country to pressure the Senate -- by educating Americans, with speech after speech, about the opportunities and necessities of a serious climate/energy bill. If he is not ready to risk failure by going all out, failure will be the most likely result.
\
And then there is We the People. Attention all young Americans: Your climate future is being decided right now in the cloakrooms of the Capitol, where the coal lobby holds huge sway. You want to make a difference? Then get out of Facebook and into somebody's face. Get a million people on the Washington Mall calling for a price on carbon. That will get the Senate's attention. Play hardball or don't play at all.

THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN writes for The New York Times.
"
255,"
President-elect Barack Obama is set to nominate New Jersey's Lisa P. Jackson, Gov. Corzine's chief of staff and for nearly three years his top environmental official, to lead the federal government's environmental protection efforts, according to published reports.
\
Jackson, who has a master's degree in chemical engineering from Princeton, would bring to the job more than 20 years of experience as an environmental officer at federal, regional and state levels. She will be the first African American to head the Environmental Protection Agency.
\
She was New Jersey environmental protection commissioner for nearly three years, winning praise as a consensus-builder from business groups and some environmentalists.
\
Others said Jackson too often bent to the will of industry groups and failed to follow through on some of her biggest environmental initiatives.
\
After Corzine trumpeted his plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent over the next 12 years, Jackson's department missed its summer deadline for detailing how to meet his goals. That report is expected next week.
\
Former N.J. Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, the EPA administrator from 2001 to '03 before she quit in frustration, called news of the appointment ""great.""
\
She said she was impressed with Jackson's ""ability to work with people, her intelligence, and her balance. She is a strong environmental advocate, but she's someone who can work with people to find the common ground.""
\
Whitman said Jackson's first priority should be to ""restore morale . . . She needs to be able to look the people in the agency in the eye and say, 'We're back on track . . . and we're going to be supporting the science.' ""
\
But Frank Maisano, an energy specialist from Washington who works with refineries, utilities and wind developers, predicted that the agency under Jackson could be ""a tough sled"" for industry. The EPA, he said, is ""not going look on our issues as favorably, perhaps, as some past administrations.""
\
Jackson, 46, became Corzine's chief of staff Dec. 1. She cochaired Obama's energy and natural resources transition team, which included the EPA. She declined interview requests for this article.
\
Corzine's chief counsel, Ed McBride, will become chief of staff, said three Democratic officials with knowledge of the administration's plans.
\
In a densely packed state where business is continually straining against regulations and environmentalists are trying to preserve what land is left, Jackson impressed many people with her open-minded style.
\
""What she's been terrific at is listening,"" said Sen. Robert Smith, a Middlesex County Democrat who chairs the state Senate Environment Committee.
\
New Jersey is home to about 20,000 contaminated sites; 114 are listed among the most polluted in the nation, more than in any other state. The largely progressive electorate makes open-space preservation and global warming popular issues in the Garden State.
\
""If you can handle environmental problems in New Jersey, since they've got more than any other place, you can do it anywhere,"" said Jeff Tittel, executive director of the New Jersey chapter of the Sierra Club and one of Jackson's supporters.
\
Before coming to New Jersey in 2002, Jackson worked for the EPA in Washington and then in New York, overseeing cleanups at some of the most polluted sites in New York and New Jersey.
\
When she took over New Jersey's DEP in 2006, it had been gutted by former governors and legislators.
\
""Lisa inherited an agency that was destaffed, that had a growing mandate and a shrinking resource pool, and despite those was remarkably effective,"" Eric Stiles of New Jersey Audubon said.
\
When Corzine, in a nod to business demands, extended the life of expiring building permits, Jackson was credited with forcing changes that eased what environmentalists saw as the plan's worst aspects.
\
And in what business groups cite as an example of her evenhandedness, Jackson worked to smooth a proposal to let private engineers supervise pollution cleanup in New Jersey, potentially freeing them from bureaucracy and speeding the process.
\
That has been welcomed by the business community, but loathed in environmental circles, even among those who support Jackson.
\
Michael Egenton, an environmental lobbyist for the N.J. Chamber of Commerce, said the proposal started with rules so tight that engineers were scared off. He said that Jackson listened to concerns and adjusted the plan, now working its way through the Legislature.
\
""She really believed in the stakeholder process,"" Egenton said.
\
Some of Jackson's harshest critics are grassroots activists outside Trenton who say she has helped make more headlines than substantive progress.
\
""Lisa Jackson is probably a nice, personable person who does not have a skeleton in her closet. But the record that she compiled when she headed the agency was a horrendous record,"" said Jeff Ruch, executive director of Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, a frequent Jackson critic.
\
Among Jackson's worst failures, Ruch said, was the agency's response to the discovery of mercury contamination at a Gloucester County day-care center, Kiddie Kollege, which had been a thermometer factory.
\
""The worst was her agency didn't tell the parents or the workers for months that they were in danger,"" Ruch said.
\
Jackson served as vice president of the executive board of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a 10-state cap-and-trade coalition aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
\
But the state missed the initiative's first-of-its kind regional auction earlier this year because its regulations weren't ready in time. It was one of four states in the coalition that did not participate.
\
In June the EPA's inspector general issued a report chastising the federal agency and New Jersey for allowing 38 polluted sites to sit on the nation's Superfund list for 20 years with no final cleanup.
\
The report placed blame on the state and the regional EPA office where Jackson spent 16 years, part of it overseeing the New York regional Superfund program before joining New Jersey's environmental agency in 2002.
\
""It's been an abysmal track record and it's something that scares me and scares many activists in New Jersey,"" said Robert Spiegel, executive director of the Edison Wetlands Association in central New Jersey.

256,"In Soldiers&Sailors Memorial Hall&Museum, where many of the region's war veterans are commemorated, people gathered Wednesday to kick-start a battle they believe must be won quickly to mitigate the impact of climate change.\""Climate change is a global threat that will change our lives dramatically, but we can take smart, proactive steps to combat it,"" said U.S. Rep. Mike Doyle, D-Forest Hills, who hosted the town hall-style meeting. ""But we must take those steps rapidly to avoid the most dire consequences of climate change.""\Although many in the audience of about 400 appeared to be members of a knowledgeable climate change choir, the meeting was one of the first opportunities for residents of the region to learn more about the issue and potential pathways to address it.\""It's an important issue and I hope to gain a better understanding of the nuts and bolts of how climate policy will be developed in the U.S.,"" said Mike Roth, a doctoral student in the engineering and public policy program at Carnegie Mellon University, before the meeting started.\""It doesn't seem the current administration is very receptive to cap and trade or a carbon tax - two of the main proposals that have been hopping around. But delay will be costly, and the sooner we act the less costly it will be to address the issue.""\That sense of urgency was a common theme. Mr. Doyle said the U.S. must achieve zero net carbon emissions by 2050 and become ""carbon negative"" after that.\Patricia DeMarco, an author, biologist and member of Forest Hills council, said the globe is on track for 2019 to be the warmest year ever recorded, and climate change is already affecting human health, infrastructure, emergency services and the natural environment. She said it's costing the nation billions of dollars a year.\""It's real, it's happening now all over the world and in Western Pennsylvania, too,"" she said. ""The latest report by U.S. agencies says we need to reduce carbon emissions by 40% by 2030. We don't have time to dilly-dally. We need to reframe the climate change debate, to acknowledge the cost of not acting on climate change is huge.""\There is scientific certainty that the global climate is warming at an unprecedented rate and that the primary cause is human activity, including the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil, that increases the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping greenhouse gases.\On a warmer planet, growing seasons will be longer in some areas, increasing crops. But most effects will impact human populations negatively.\As temperatures continue to rise, scientists say there will be more droughts and heat waves, more severe storms and stronger hurricanes. Sea levels will rise by 1 to 4 feet by 2100, the Arctic is likely to become ice free in summer and glaciers will melt.\Two panels of experts addressed climate change topics, including how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; the workforce needs of a renewable energy economy; the development of technology to mitigate climate change impacts; and government actions at the federal, state and local levels.\Jay Whitacre, director of CMU's Wilton E. Scott Institute for Energy Innovation, said hundreds of researchers at CMU and the University of Pittsburgh are working on climate change, but more financial support is needed to get emerging research into the hands of big corporations with the means to implement the new technology.\Ron Gdovic, chief executive officer of WindStax Energy, a 2012 startup that manufactures hybrid wind and solar systems in Pittsburgh, said ""new technologies can drive a new economy"" in the region.\Ashleigh Deemer, of PennEnvironment, a statewide environmental advocacy organization, said it has been conducting a lobbying effort to educate state legislators about the perils of climate change and the need for quick action to fill the federal void, but she said it's still ""a heavy lift.""\Another recurring topic was economic justice for displaced workers. Jami Bey, a panel moderator and chief executive officer of UrbanKind, said, ""People have to see themselves as successful in the new economy.""\In a news release prior to the meeting, a coalition of 11 local organizations announced their support of the meeting, which they hoped would be the first of many to draw attention to and help speed action on the issue.\""[The meeting] comes at an opportune time, as there is a push from the American people to greater prioritize climate change during the presidential debates, and every day more studies emerge about how little time we have to act as climate change affects our food, air, water, health and supersizes weather events in more dire ways than previously thought,"" the coalition stated\The coalition also encouraged other members of the Pennsylvania congressional delegation to follow Mr. Doyle's example by holding town halls of their own on climate change.\""While we believe it's important to broaden the understanding about the severity and widespread impact of climate change, it's equally important for our elected officials at all levels of government to transition this knowledge into finally doing something,"" the coalition stated. ""We will look for further opportunities to hold our decision makers accountable and push them to enact meaningful policies.""\Mr. Doyle said he's optimistic about enacting a robust climate change policy, but admitted it will require ""changing a lot of faces in the Senate and, most importantly, in the White House.""\Art Fleming, a retired ophthalmologist, and his wife, Sharyn, who have 24 grandchildren, left the meeting feeling optimistic.\""It was great to hear people talking about all this stuff and the concerns about climate change,"" Mr. Fleming said. ""People are involved. I'm hopeful. They're working on a lot of stuff. I think it will happen eventually. It has to.""\Don Hopey: dhopey@post-gazette.com or 412-263-1983.

257,"
If you want to see the most schizophrenic, mistreated and vital issue on the table during this election, check out our energy policy.
\
Most people, including the candidates, think our oil troubles began with gas lines in the 1970s. There is a price to pay for how much history we forget these days.
\
The real story dates back to 1945 when President Franklin D. Roosevelt made a deal with the devil, so to speak. He guaranteed American protection of the Saudi Arabian royal family in return for access to their oil wells. Fifty-six years later, Osama bin Laden listed American military presence in Saudi Arabia as one of the top reasons for hijacking four airplanes on Sept. 11, 2001.
\
The story picks up again in 1971 when President Richard Nixon instated wage and price controls, which did nothing but stall the economy for three years. Today, economists are having flashbacks to those days of stagflation, with the average consumer shelling out an extra $1,500 for gas this year.
\
The price controls finally ended in 1981 when President Jimmy Carter bargained with Congress to institute a windfall profits tax in their place. Today, Barack Obama wants to institute just such a tax, but he never mentions that Carter tried it -- because it only made us more dependent on foreign oil. Surprise, surprise.
\
Carter didn't stop there with his mindless energy policies. In 1980, he told the world that Persian Gulf oil was a ""vital interest"" to the United States and that we would protect that interest ""by any means necessary, including military force."" Today, we spend over $138 billion each year for this protection. Good thing we don't have a $400 billion budget deficit or anything else that needs money, like infrastructure or health care.
\
The conclusion is obvious: Independence from foreign oil should be our number one economic and national security priority.
\
This is the issue of the future, folks. Unfortunately, our presidential candidates seem more interested in continuing our nightmarish past.
\
Obama's plan is just pointless. Karl Rove's criticism is on the money: ""Why should we stop with oil companies? They make about 8.3 cents in gross profit per dollar of sales. Why doesn't Mr. Obama slap a windfall profits tax on sectors of the economy that have fatter margins? Electronics make 14.5 cents per dollar and computer equipment makers take in 13.7 cents per dollar, according to the Census Bureau. Microsoft's margin is 27.5 cents per dollar of sales. ...
\
""It's not the profit margin, but the total number of dollars earned that is the problem, Mr. Obama might say. But if that were the case, why isn't he targeting other industries? Oil and gas companies made $86.5 billion in profits last year. At the same time, the financial services industry took in $498.5 billion in profits, the retail industry walked away with $137.5 billion, and information technology companies made off with $103.4 billion.""
\
Indeed, his outrage would be more justifiable if it weren't so hypocritical, a dangerous precedent and a proven waste of time.
\
And it doesn't stop there. Next, he wants to pour more taxpayer money into corn ethanol. Let's review that idea, shall we? Corn ethanol is too expensive, worse for the environment than almost any other alternative fuel, and hikes food prices with its government subsidies. But Senator Obama, the man who will ""change"" Washington, gets a lot of his support from the ethanol industry, so he thinks it's swell.
\
John McCain is no better. Once upon a time, this column showed how his gas tax holiday was an egregiously bad idea and a craven political pander.
\
Uh oh, he's at it again. This time the senator from Arizona thinks drilling offshore is worth the gamble. He is counting on you to be so distracted with gas prices that you don't notice that this idea won't do squat.

Thankfully, the pork-busting, corruption-ridding maverick is opposed to all subsidies, including ethanol. Take that, Barack Obama. Hang on, it seems he is willing to make an exception for nuclear power. That's right, all subsidies must go, except for the nuclear industry because they pay his campaign bills. Well, isn't that convenient?
\
Yes, the United States has a long, storied history of energy mistakes, and it looks like the candidates are taking up that mantle just fine. Fortunately, there is hope: Both candidates want to create a cap-and-trade program to wean us off foreign oil. The difference is McCain's plan uses the failed European model that imposes a massive government bureaucracy to allocate emission permits based on which lobbyist pays the most -- instead of a simple auction or a carbon tax.
\
Now why doesn't that surprise me?

258,"Carbon fee way to go on climate \The Jan. 22 letter ""Earth has a fever; a cure is available"" recommends a carbon fee as the best way to move from fossil fuels to clean energy. \The states of Oregon and Washington are now planning to enact a carbon tax, and California already has a carbon cap-and-trade program. \The only question is: Which plan works best? California's plan has led to real emissions cuts, and the state's economy has prospered, but it is complex and leaves loopholes for cheaters. \A carbon-pollution fee on all fossil fuels - one that's refunded, directly and entirely, to every American - is the plan that most economists agree is best. \In British Columbia, this kind of revenue-neutral carbon fee has worked well, cutting taxes, creating jobs and increasing gross domestic product. This can serve as a good model for the U.S. \State-by-state measures will do virtually nothing to affect climate change. Only a national carbon fee will enable the U.S. to impose import fees to induce China and other countries to adopt their own carbon reduction plans. That, after all, is a key reason to pursue carbon taxing in the first place. \Karen Davis \Citizens Climate Lobby volunteer \Manheim Township \U.S. budget far too war-oriented \This country is in deep trouble. Our Congress votes 57 percent of our discretionary budget for war (wars of aggression only - they don't make us any friends either, rather they increase our enemies by several orders of magnitude). In 2014, the U.S. and Israel bombed eight Muslim countries. No wonder they hate us. Unfortunately, weapons manufacturers need wars in order to sell their products. \Meanwhile, the U.S. has the highest poverty rate, the greatest inequality of incomes, the lowest social mobility, the highest expenditure of health care as a percentage of GDP, yet accompanied by the highest infant mortality rate, the highest prevalence of mental health problems, the highest obesity rate, the highest percentage of people going without health care due to cost, the highest consumption of antidepressants per capita and the shortest life expectancy at birth, the highest homicide rate, the largest prison population, the highest carbon dioxide emissions, the lowest spending on international development and humanitarian assistance as a percentage of GDP (except for Japan and Italy), the highest military expenditures both in total and as a percentage of GDP. This comes from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which compared with 20 of the world's democracies. \According to James Gustave Speth, ""These deplorable consequences are not the result of economic and technological forces over which we have no control. They are the results of political decisions made over several decades by both Democrats and Republicans who have had priorities other than strengthening the well-being of American society and our environment. Many countries, obviously, took another path - one that was open to us as well."" \In the U.S., the people are becoming ever more poor as increasing amounts of discretionary government funds go into destroying the villages and lives of persons in other countries because the defense companies need to sell ever more weapons to fatten their bottom lines and pay their CEOs ever larger bonuses so they can finance the re-election campaigns of their ever more obedient representatives in Congress. \Would that U.S. Rep. Joe Pitts and Sens. Pat Toomey and Bob Casey would rearrange their priorities and vote for programs that benefit the citizens of the U.S. rather than the fat cat corporations. What doth it profit a person if he/she has to sell his/her soul to the devil in order to be re-elected over and over again? \Daniel Riehl \Manheim Township \It's time to help hungry families \One in seven U.S. households faces hunger. Even when families can scrape together enough money, a balanced and healthy diet is often beyond their reach. \We need to create hunger-free communities and improve the nutrition, health, economic security and well-being of low-income residents. Ensuring that every eligible person benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (food stamps) is core to hunger solutions. \The Food Insecurity Nutrition Incentive Grant Program is a new competitive grant program within the Agriculture Act of 2014 (commonly known as the Farm Bill). Its goal is to increase the purchase and consumption of fruits and vegetables among SNAP participants. \This double-up-style program makes it easier for low-income households to purchase and eat fresh fruits and vegetables while supporting family farmers and growing local economies. \There are food banks throughout the county, yet no Gleaning Network has ever been established. Our neighbor to the north, Lebanon County, has had a Gleaning Network serving a number of their food banks for well over 15 years. \Gleaning, a biblical practice to combat hunger, is thousands of years old. Hunger is an age-old problem which has devastating effects on those who suffer from it. \It's time for the kind-hearted, caring, honest, good natured and faith-based citizens to start addressing hunger solutions for those less fortunate - children, senior citizens, people with disabilities and others truly in need of food. \John Mackley \Elizabethtown \Hold Harrisburg accountable \I am grateful that the cities are standing up to Harrisburg (""NRA sues city over gun law,"" Jan. 15). \I hope that not only will Lancaster, Pittsburgh and Philadelphia win the case, but that National Rifle Association and all plaintiffs will have to pay all costs and that all responsible for the state law prohibiting cities from regulating guns in any way can be held accountable for misuse of their public office to obstruct the law, and sued accordingly. \This mindset that common sense efforts to protect the public from criminal and mentally disabled minds is a violation of Second Amendment rights, has got to end. \Joel Moore \Narvon"
259,"CHICAGO -- Republicans in Illinois hold no statewide offices, are minorities in both chambers of the state Legislature and struggle some years to recruit viable candidates even at the top of the ballot.\But the election this month of a long-shot Republican, Scott Brown, to the Senate in Massachusetts, a similarly blue state, has invigorated Republicans here. Tuesday's statewide primaries -- the first in the nation this year -- have suddenly turned into a pep rally for November and could provide a window into what is to come nationally as the 2010 primary season unfolds.\""Illinois is next,"" said Pat Brady, chairman of the state Republican Party. ""The political environment is worse here for Democrats than it was in Massachusetts.""\Rep. Mark Steven Kirk, the front-runner in the Republican primary for the U.S. Senate seat once held by President Barack Obama, has even taken to echoing Mr. Brown's campaign remarks. ""No one should make the mistake by calling this the Obama seat,"" he said in an interview. ""This is the seat of the people of Illinois.""\Democratic leaders here discount direct comparisons to Massachusetts -- for starters, the race there was a special election, not a primary -- and they point out distinctions from this state's candidates, voting blocs and alliances. And perhaps most of all, they mention their sense that Illinois voters still carry a special allegiance to Mr. Obama.\Still, the message from Massachusetts is resounding among Democrats, too. In interviews, several candidates quickly proclaimed themselves ""outsiders."" The party is trying to hold onto the Senate seat, the governor's mansion and a few House seats that Republicans say they are especially confident about winning.\A televised forum among the three top Democrats in the Senate race seemed to become a scuffle over which one would be the least likely, come November, to lose in an upset similar to the one in Massachusetts. Along the way, they struck notes that sounded not so unlike Mr. Brown.\One candidate, Cheryle Jackson, who led the Chicago Urban League, said the Massachusetts vote had reflected the lack of jobs and the suffering of people -- ""precisely,"" she added, ""the reason I have decided to run.""\Another candidate, David Hoffman, a former inspector-general for the city of Chicago, offered this pitch for himself as a way to dodge a Massachusetts outcome: ""We need to make sure that we have a nominee who is as independent as possible.""\Some argue that Mr. Kirk, as a five-term congressman and a moderate Republican with centrist-leaning views that have irked conservatives, may not benefit from voter unrest. Democrats also have their eyes on his House district in Chicago's northern suburbs.\""In a key way, Illinois is Massachusetts in reverse,"" said Kathleen Strand, a senior adviser to Illinois for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. ""Here, the Republican candidate is the Washington insider that voters are angry at, not the Democrat.""\In the view of some conservatives, Mr. Kirk, who supports abortion rights, fits right in with the Democratic candidates. They say that while he might gain unhappy Democratic voters and center-leaning Independents, he will lose the votes of a different segment -- some who consider themselves part of the Tea Party movement, anti-abortion advocates and others.\Conservatives often cite Mr. Kirk's vote in favor of cap-and-trade legislation intended to reduce carbon emissions; he has since reversed course, criticizing the legislation and saying he would vote against it as a senator. They also do not appreciate what they see as his effort to swerve to the right; some mocked his campaign for trying to win supportive words from former Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska when she was in Chicago recently.\""Mark Kirk has absolutely no Tea Party support,"" said Diane Benjamin, an organizer of a Tea Party group in McLean County, about 90 miles southwest of Chicago.\Several lesser-known candidates are in the primary, including Patrick Hughes, who has drawn praise from some conservatives and Tea Party supporters, though not Ms. Benjamin. But analysts say that opposition to Mr. Kirk has not amounted to a movement unified and motivated enough to defeat him; a Chicago Tribune poll released Monday showed Mr. Kirk with a wide lead in the primary race. Of those Republicans polled who said they agreed with the Tea Party movement, 48 percent favored Mr. Kirk, the newspaper said.\Some of the turmoil here is particular to Illinois. This is the first election for governor since Rod Blagojevich, a Democrat, was ousted after prosecutors charged him with secretly trying sell the Senate seat that is now up for grabs. Sen. Roland Burris, whom Blagojevich appointed to the seat, announced months ago that he would not run for election.\Democrats are queasy -- and Republicans giddy -- over the spectacle of Mr. Blagojevich's federal corruption trial, which is scheduled to begin here in June, the middle of campaign season.\Gov. Patrick J. Quinn, the lieutenant governor who was elevated to the state's top job in the aftermath of the scandal, and Dan Hynes, the state comptroller who is from a longtime Chicago political family, are battling in the Democratic primary for governor.\The Republican field is vast and relatively strong, in part, as one political analyst here said, because they ""see blood in the water."" The Republicans include Andy McKenna, former chairman of the state Republican Party; Jim Ryan, a former state attorney general; and two state senators, Kirk Dillard and Bill Brady.\The economy is a theme heard everywhere, but it is more pronounced in Illinois in every race. Residents complain about vanishing jobs. The state unemployment rate, at 11.1 percent, is higher than the nation's. They also complain about the state's failure to fix its budget, which has a deficit that some estimate at $13 billion. Illinois is failing to pay all sorts of bills and has $80 billion in unfunded pension liabilities, signs some experts say put the state in a class not so distinct from California.\""What we learned is that voters are incredibly angry,"" said Alexi Giannoulias, the state treasurer and a friend of the president who, according to Monday's Tribune poll, holds a double-digit lead over other Democrats vying for the Senate seat.\Mr. Obama has made no endorsement in the primary."

With oil, we're our
\
own worst enemy
\
Many people who decry and deplore the repressive regimes of Iran and Venezuela evade a critical question: Who is funding these regimes? The answer unfortunately includes us. The United States produces only about 42 percent of its oil needs internally. For the rest we must go to the world market. Both Iran and Venezuela are important oil producers, and the profits go directly to their governments, since, as with most oil-producing countries, their oil industry is owned by the state. (Only about 20 percent of the world's oil is produced by private enterprises). The U.S. motorist's support of President Hugo Chavez is particularly direct, since about 8 percent of our oil comes from Venezuela.
\
In other words, every time you put a gallon of gas in your tank, you could say that you're putting about 24 cents in Chavez's pocket. This adds up pretty fast. (You can't boycott Venezuelan oil, since there's no way of knowing where any particular gallon of gasoline is coming from.)
\
It's interesting that some of the most vociferous critics of Iran and Venezuela are the last to support, and in fact they often oppose, increased petroleum taxes, cap-and-trade arrangements, or any other practical program for reducing our dependence on oil and thus our support for these loathsome regimes.

It is an outrage that Kenneth Feinberg is acting as though he's BP's attorney by forcing people to make a choice that they were promised they wouldn't have to make: accept an immediate payment and, by so doing, forfeit their right to go to court and sue BP later for ongoing losses. This contradicts an earlier pledge by the Obama White House.

Female priests

are gifts from God
\
As an ordained deacon in the Roman Catholic Womenpriests Community, I would like to respond to the article ""Vatican revises sex-abuse laws"" (last Friday).
\
Pedophilia and the ordination of women were stated as grave offenses in a recent Vatican document. Linking these in the same document is misleading to society and misrepresents the intent of the women's ordination movement. Pedophilia is a criminal act in violation of the moral law of humanity. The ordination of women is an act of prophetic obedience to the spirit of God and is in response to a call from God and the community. It is in violation of an unjust, man-made church law.
\
Pedophilia gravely harms children; women's gifts in ordained ministry serve the community.
\
The distinction is clear.

Sign language is
\
more than just signs
\
I am a bilingual (English and American Sign Language) high school student with profound hearing impairment. I would like to correct a common misconception presented in Monday's article ""Signs first, then speech.""
\
The article implies that simply learning sign-language vocabulary is tantamount to learning sign language. However, just as it takes daily exposure in one's natural environment or years of study to learn Spanish, it takes the same degree of immersion to learn ASL. Learning ""baby signs"" does not constitute learning ASL, which includes complex rules of syntax like any language.
\
For years, well-meaning people have approached me claiming to know ""some sign language"" because they were familiar with the ASL alphabet and a few signs. While I appreciate the good intention behind these encounters, it is unfortunate that so many kids are misled into believing that ASL is merely a string of words rather than a rich language.

Taxpayers will
\
foot the jobless bill
\
The media have described the passage of a bill to extend unemployment benefits as merely a battle between Republicans and Democrats. In fact, it deals with fundamental choices we must make.
\
The federal government has a law, ""PayGo,"" that requires all new spending to be offset by new revenues (taxes) or cuts to existing programs. The law can be bypassed only in an emergency. Expiration of unemployment benefits was a predictable event, and clearly not an emergency. This bill has been passed, with no funding to pay for it.
\
Extension of unemployment benefits would not be so popular if citizens were told, for instance, that their income taxes would increase, or Medicare fundingcut.
\
But these are the kinds of choices we have to make to restore fiscal sanity to our government. Sen. Jim Bunning (R., Ky.) made this unpopular choice clear in March.
\
The refusal of our federal government to act responsibly, while pretending to be compassionate, is leading us down the path tofinancial ruin.

Firehouse cutbacks are hazardous to city's health
\
Mayor Nutter's recent announcement about ""rolling closures"" of fire companies in Philadelphia is dangerous and ill-conceived (""Nutter cuts city budget by $47 million,"" July 15).
\
His decision to close fire-suppression companies on a daily and regular basis is tantamount to playing Russian roulette with the lives and property of the citizens of Philadelphia. It also jeopardizes the lives of emergency responders.
\
Does he even know the difference between an engine company and a ladder company, and what their capabilities and duties are? I highly doubt it. It's all about dollars and cents to this administration, and safety is taking a backseat. Rolling closures will adversely impact everyone's safety.
\
This decision was made without any fire-service industry study on the effects of such closures, much like last year's decision to close seven companies.
\
Redeployment of resources should be done in a methodical manner, not in a shoot-from-the-hip style. An often-heard phrase in the firehouse is one voiced by a previous fire commissioner, Harold Hairston: ""You cannot do more with less; you can only do less with less.""
\
Firefighters know there is a fiscal crisis in Philadelphia and would willingly work with the administration if it developed an industry-supported redeployment of needed fire-suppression forces.

Smart grid trumps more dumb lines
\
Editor: Long-distance interstate transmission lines are part of an inefficient transmission line system designed to export power to other states for profit, not benefit the residents of Pennsylvania. Global warming requires us to have better transmission line siting policies, with the goal of reducing energy consumption while maximizing the use of local nonpolluting renewable energy resources.
\
Ratepayers will absorb the billion-dollar price tag for overbuilt interstate transmission lines, like PPL's proposed Susquehanna Roseland Line B.
\
Ironically, Pennsylvania utility companies are required by Act 129 to reduce demand at the very same time they propose to build an infrastructure to accommodate an increase in demand. According to the Energy Information Administration, in 2008 electric demand actually fell by 1.6 percent and is expected to fall by another 1.8 percent this year. Peak demand declined for 2008 for the intended service area of the transmission line and further declines are predicted.
\
Recent testimony before a House subcommittee on energy and the environment revealed that smaller, locally distributed generation projects, which benefit the Pennsylvania consumer and economy most, require little transmission line upgrade and can be developed faster than traditional utility scale generation.
\
In addition, new cap and trade policies emphasize investment in smart grid technologies that utilize new digital technology for better demand-side management. These technologies, along with compatible appliances and equipment, can help identify when and where energy demand is high, enabling users to adjust how much energy is used, and when.
\
Unfortunately, Pennsylvania utilities continue to submit proposals for individual transmission lines without regard to regional carbon reduction, efficiency initiatives, smart grid technologies or the new green economy.
\
More than 50 percent of our nation's power is already fueled by dirty coal and environmental groups predict that these massive power lines will rely on even more coal-generated power. To realize President Obama's vision of the development of smart grid for renewable energy, a priority for any massive transmission line investments should focus specifically on supporting off-shore wind development for the East Coast, and appropriately scaled upgrades for in-state distributed energy generation.
\
Please attend the public meeting Thursday from 5 to 8 p.m. at the Abington Community Library in Clarks Summit to show your support for regional planning that truly creates a new Pennsylvania Smart Grid, not more dumb lines.

Halt power play
\
Editor: I agree with Martha McAndrew's June 29 letter concerning the proposed 500-kilovolt power line that PPL is seeking to build from the Berwick area, north and east across the region and into the New York City metro area.
\
It is not too late to halt this monstrosity, which will do little, if anything, to benefit local residents. The only beneficiaries will be those in the metro area, who will have the least invested.
\
The reasons for the new line cited by David G. De-Campli, president of PPL Electric Utilities, in his May 31 op-ed, are vague at best. It lacks specific details as to how the line will benefit Northeast Pennsylvania.
\
Ten acres (including a pond and wetlands) upon which I live will be permanently disrupted if this project proceeds. This does not include tens of acres more adjoining the right-of-way, which will become virtually worthless due to their proximity to the gargantuan towers. Nor does this include the tens of acres for a proposed housing development on the opposite side of the line. A neighbor's home will be directly under the line (if he is allowed to keep it), and a dozen or more families in the area will have their property values reduced to pocket change if the line is built.
\
I would oppose the new line even if it did not directly impact my home. Anyone who has a view of West Mountain and the other mountaintops comprising the view for much of the county will be negatively impacted. The new towers to be built alongside the current power line and towers that scar the ridges will dwarf the current towers.
\
If the health, aesthetic, environmental and property values aren't enough of a concern, the new line will cost hundreds of millions of dollars, most of which will be borne by PPL customers who are about to be hit with a massive rate increase. Yet the local benefits, as put forth by PPL, will be minimal at best, with the lion's share of the power going to New York and New Jersey residents.
\
It is obvious that the potential harms from this project far outweigh the benefits (if any) to the region as a whole.
\
The next PUC hearing on the proposed line will be Thursday at 5 p.m. in the Abington Community Library in Clarks Summit.

Cuts too severe

Editor: Public broadcasting in the United States is a unique endeavor. This is largely true because it draws support, unlike commercial television, from multiple sources: federal and state funding, business sponsors and especially public subscriptions.
\
This enables it to be independent and unbiased in its programming. However, this is now threatened by a state budget that is eliminating PBS funding. In difficult times, a reduction in support may be justified, but elimination of all support puts in jeopardy the entire enterprise.

There is an answer to this dilemma. Pennsylvania has one of the largest, most costly state governments. We have more state representatives and senators, with larger incomes and expense accounts, than we need. They get cars, mileage allowances and they get paid an extra ""per-diem"" just to show up.

262,"The day after the November 2010 elections made clear that President Barack Obama's greenhouse-gas legislation was doomed, he vowed to keep trying to curb emissions linked to global warming. There's more than one way of ""skinning the cat,"" he told reporters. \Since then, Mr. Obama has used his executive powers -- including his authority under the 1970 Clean Air Act -- to press the most sweeping attack on air pollution in U.S. history. He has imposed the first carbon-dioxide limits on new power plants, tightened fuel-efficiency rules as part of the auto bailout and steered billions of federal dollars to clean-energy projects. He also has proposed slashing mercury emissions from utilities by 91 percent by 2016. \Mr. Obama's end run around Republican opposition has delighted environmentalists, but it has drawn the ire of business groups and conservatives who argue he is crippling the coal industry, driving up energy costs and hurting the overall economy. \""Environmental regulation should be about protecting public health, and not about creating green jobs and mitigating hypothetical risk,"" said Diane Katz, research fellow in regulatory policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation. ""Being unemployed and poor from overregulation, or zealous regulation, is a greater risk than global warming."" \When Mr. Obama was elected in 2008, environmentalists were confident their most-cherished goals -- ending coal-fired power plants, limiting greenhouse-gas emissions and invoking new protections for public lands -- were finally within reach. \Following up on a campaign promise, the president backed legislation that would slash America's carbon output by 80 percent by 2050. Under the proposed cap-and-trade legislation, companies would buy and sell emissions credits allowing them to pollute more. \The bill was passed by the House, which at the time was controlled by Democrats, but in June 2009 it was blocked in the Senate by Republicans and moderate Democrats. When Republicans won control of the House in the 2010 elections, the bill was dead. \The administration turned to the Clean Air Act, which Obama allies said the president became familiar with while serving on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. Using the law's extensive authority, the administration issued six major environmental rules, including ones that placed limits on toxic air pollutants, greenhouse gases, soot and smog-forming pollutants. \The strategy was bolstered by some outside factors. Its effort to limit carbon emissions was benefited by the natural gas boom; many utilities are switching from coal to natural gas, which is more economical and emits much less carbon. The automobile bailout gave Mr. Obama the leverage to impose tougher fuel-efficiency standards, and the Environmental Protection Agency faced several lawsuits pending from the Bush administration that needed to be resolved. \Mr. Obama's standards for new vehicles, said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, rank as ""the biggest move to get us off our oil dependence by any president ever."" The rules, which took effect this year, will require the U.S. auto fleet to average 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. \Heather Zichal, deputy assistant to the president for energy and climate change, said the administration's array of environmental rules go to the ""sweet spot of energy security, economic opportunity and reducing pollution,"" and fit into a favorite Obama theme during the 2008 campaign. \But the business community argues that the regulations are heavy-handed and are hurting the nation's economic security. \""The utility sector, which we consider a part of the manufacturing sector, has been hit extremely hard,"" said Ross Eisenberg, vice president of energy and resources at the National Association of Manufacturers. \Utilities, he said, are shuttering older plants and holding off expanding existing ones out of fear that the EPA will deny them permits. \Last month, urged on by several business and energy groups, the GOP-controlled House passed the Stop the War on Coal Act, which would reverse several Obama regulations and proposals. It would bar the EPA from regulating greenhouse gases, jettison the stricter fuel standards and give states primary authority over the storage and disposal of coal-combustion waste. But that bill has little chance in the Democratic-controlled Senate. \Because the administration, faced by partisan polarization, has moved ahead on its own, opportunities for compromise have been lost, some say. Mr. Eisenberg notes that during President Bill Clinton's second term, the two parties negotiated passage of such significant environmental laws as the 1996 Safe Drinking Water Act. \""The big difference is you had a Congress and an administration a little bit willing to work together on the issues, he said. \Mr. Obama has disappointed environmentalists in some cases. \In September 2011, he decided to pull back an EPA proposal to limit ozone emissions linked to smog, on the grounds that it would hurt the economy and the government would revisit the issue in 2013 anyway. The business community praised the move, while environmentalists said it was irresponsible. \The administration also has been criticized by some environmentalists for not moving to create new wilderness areas, in which development and energy extraction would be barred. Only Congress can designate wilderness, but the president can bestow similar protections by creating national monuments through the 1906 Antiquities Act. \""It's not something they're making a priority,"" said Heidi McIntosh, associate director for the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance. She said administration officials have been unwilling to overrule the objections of state and local officials on several key land-use issues. \Barring a last-minute development, the current Congress will be the first since 1966 to fail to designate a single wilderness area. Mr. Obama has recently declared a few national monuments based on their historic or cultural significance, including Colorado's Chimney Rock, and has forged private-public partnerships to preserve working landscapes in states such as Florida and Kansas. \Mr. Obama has spent only a brief amount of time visiting national parks, and the National Park Service budget has declined 6 percent in the past two years. \Both Obama friends and foes agree on one thing: The president will probably pursue an even more aggressive environmental agenda if re-elected. \House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Doc Hastings, R-Wash., said in a statement he would expect Mr. Obama to push for more national monument designations in a second term. ""From nearly day one,"" he said, ""the Obama administration has attempted to impose policies that would block public access to public lands and cause significant economic harm and job loss."" \When it comes to putting more public land off limits to development, he added, ""Such decisions should not be made by unilateral orders from the president"" using a 106-year old law. \Environmental leaders expect Mr. Obama to try to take tougher action on limiting greenhouse-gas emissions from existing power plants if re-elected. He hinted as much during a speech to a crowd of Colorado State University students in August."

WASHINGTON -- Opportunity is in season, and when Congress reconvenes in two weeks, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wants to start harvesting.
\
In a little more than two months, a new president has challenged a generation's worth of notions about government's proper scope, a divided Congress has approved unprecedented spending, hundreds of thousands of Americans have lost jobs, and an unsteady world has plumbed the depths of recession.
\
Bold action cannot wait, Pelosi said in an exclusive interview with the Tribune-Review in her Capitol office Friday.
\
Revitalizing the economy and health care and energy plans -- including efforts to sharply cut carbon emissions -- will top Congress' to-do list, said Pelosi, D-Calif.
\
The plans are sure to spark bitter partisan battles and again lay bare the country's ideological divides. President Obama's election in November, however, signaled the nation's call for change, Pelosi said, and both parties are compelled to answer.
\
""We've all failed if we cannot deliver for the American people,"" Pelosi said.
\
Momentum for health care reform peaked late last year before the economic collapse overwhelmed all other issues. Too much was promised to allow the moment to slip away, Pelosi said.
\
""There are no excuses that are possible on the health care issue,"" Pelosi said. Lowering health care costs will make businesses more competitive and will cut the federal debt by reducing Medicare and Medicaid costs, she said.
\
The fiercest debate likely will surround whether to create a public insurance plan to compete with private insurers, something Pelosi supports, she said.
\
""I see that as the biggest obstacle,"" Pelosi said.
\
Opponents fear a public plan will usher in government-run health care.
\
""I think it's a straw horse for a single-payer system,"" said Michael Tanner, health care scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute.
\
He estimated 118 million people -- about two-thirds of those privately insured -- would join a public plan. As the public plan grew, it would lower premiums, attracting more people.
\
""It's a death spiral for private insurers,"" Tanner said. ""Republicans oppose this. The insurance industry opposes this. The business community is going to oppose this. It quickly becomes a pretty bloody fight.""
\
Pelosi acknowledged the evolutionary possibility, saying a bill mandating single-payer health care ""is not going to happen.""
\
The debate could add fuel to opponents' claims that Democrats are undermining free enterprise. Such claims resurfaced last week when Obama forced General Motors CEO Rick Waggoner to resign as part of a plan to save the struggling automaker.
\
""I am not shedding a tear over Mr. Waggoner's departure,"" Pelosi said during a roundtable with reporters before the interview. ""How they could not foresee that they had to compete is beyond me. ... I don't know how these people have lasted so long.""
\
Saving the automobile industry -- and the technological and manufacturing capability it provides -- is a national security imperative, she said. But the government's interest ends with preservation, Pelosi said.
\
""We don't want to be running businesses,"" Pelosi told the Trib.
\
Republicans say that would happen with a public health insurance plan.
\
""A public option will destroy private health-care options,"" Kevin Smith, spokesman for House Republican leader John Boehner of Ohio, said in an e-mail.
\
Republicans can block House bills by filibustering in the Senate, where even a unanimous Democratic bloc is two votes shy of being able to force the issue through. To get around that, Pelosi has proposed using a legislative maneuver called reconciliation. It's the same process used to pass budgets, which cannot be filibustered -- and it's a last resort, Pelosi said.
\
""We have to find our common ground. We have a responsibility to do that. If we can't, we have to stand our ground,"" Pelosi said. ""We're not starting with reconciliation. We have it in as an option. I hope it's not necessary.
\
""They used it at the drop of a hat,"" Pelosi said of Republicans, who, when they controlled Congress, used the process to pass bills Democrats opposed, such as Bush's tax cuts. ""It's a way to get the job done.""
\
But it carries a price. Republicans can vote as one against Democratic measures, and they did against the February stimulus and Thursday's $3.55 trillion budget. If the measures don't work, Republicans can say they tried to stop it.
\
The argument is emerging.
\
""The speaker just passed the most profligate budget in history that doubles our debt in five years and (triples) our debt in 10 years,"" Smith said. ""She can't duck responsibility anymore. She and her fellow Democrats own the problem.""
\
Pelosi counters that the deficit is a holdover from the Bush administration.
\
""These are the people who drove up the biggest deficit in history,"" Pelosi said. ""You have to give them credit for the gall to even make the suggestion.""
\
Still, she said, GOP opposition is based on principle. She just disagrees with the principle.
\
""It's what they believe. They do not believe in government,"" Pelosi said. ""They do not believe in regulation, they do not believe in supervision, they do not believe in discipline and, when walls came tumbling down, they did not believe in intervention.
\
""I give them more credit than most people do. But they're wrong.""
\
Finding common ground, however, will be necessary to a successful reformation of the country's energy infrastructure, Pelosi said. Congress will take up pollution control legislation, including Obama's cap-and-trade proposal, this year, she said.
\
""Coal pollutes the environment. There's just no question about it,"" Pelosi said.
\
That's about the only part of the debate that's settled, Pelosi said.
\
She promised the final law would be a compromise -- among liberals, conservatives, coal companies, the United Mine Workers of America and others -- because the results will quickly spread from Capitol Hill into homes across the United States.
\
""You can't do this unless you have consensus -- even if you have the votes,"" Pelosi said.
\
Higher costs to coal producers mean higher prices for power companies, and power companies will increase utility bills, Pelosi said. Operating costs also would increase for domestic steel producers, heavy coal users who already work under stricter standards than many foreign competitors, she said.
\
""We can't go forward unless we make the (utility) rate-payer whole and mitigate ... the cost to production,"" Pelosi said during the roundtable.
\
It will be a season of battles, but one she said Democrats are best-positioned to fight now.
\
""The forces of the status quo are mighty, and they have deep pockets,"" Pelosi said. ""They will wait you out.""

Terror vulnerability
\
Editor: As Philadelphia Eagles season ticket holders since 1995, my son and I were in Veterans Stadium with 70,000 other football fans on Sunday, Sept. 9, 2001.
\
The horrific attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon just two days later often have made me wonder what might have been the result if a hijacked plane had been flown into an NFL stadium during a game. Thousands would have been killed, many more than the number killed on Sept. 11.
\
So it puzzled me to see footage of so-called enhanced security at NFL games on Nov. 15, two days after the terrible attacks in Paris. Spectators were wanded with metal-detecting devices, but, unlike what I have experienced at the Eagles' current site at Lincoln Financial Field, no spectator was asked to remove his hat to complete the search.
\
It would only take one deranged suicide bomber with an explosive device hidden in his hat to take out hundreds of people in light of such lax security. There are areas where thousands gather as they get in line to be searched, another area of concern.
\
To this point, our country probably has been lucky to avoid a suicide bombing attack at a sporting event, such as an NFL game, or even a bomber striking in a Friday night crowd on the sidewalks in New York's theater district, for instance.
\
I fervently pray our luck never runs out.

Progress on climate
\
Editor: I agree with the writer of ""Climate courage"" (Oct, 16) and applaud the Republican members of Congress who broke recently from party lines and pronounced that we need to address climate change.
\
Some of the greatest legislation for clean air was passed during the presidential administrations of George H.W. Bush, Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon.
\
But I fear in the current political climate that if we wait for other Republicans to come around, it might be too late.
\
Recently, I went to a hearing at the Massachusetts Statehouse about pricing carbon at its true social cost, in other words, the cost to our health and the environment. The hearing room was packed. For several hours, people took their three-minute turn to testify as to why they supported the bill, which is modeled after a successful plan in British Columbia that is revenue-neutral - returning proceeds to consumers - and thereby attractive to legislators on both sides of the aisle. In Massachusetts, we have a multistate cap and trade plan governing electricity, but nothing covering the 80 percent of emissions from transportation and heating.
\
I left the hearing thinking that with the stalemate in Washington, there was a real opportunity to get something done at the state level.

Backs power plant
\
Editor: If the proposed natural gas power plant goes through in Jessup, great.
\
The opposition to the plant seems very petty, and supporters of the plant outnumber opponents in Jessup.
\
This was proved by the recent election as plant opponents failed to unseat incumbents that they opposed. If the proposed natural gas power plant goes the way of the planned and then abandoned federal prison some years back in Jessup, at least I have no children or grandkids to leave the area because there's nothing here for them. If the young people want to spread their wings and fly, let them fly. I did when I was their age. At least I personally would not have contributed to their exodus.

Civics, anyone?
\
Editor: After reading an article in the Wall Street Journal, ""Ryan won't rule out shutdown,"" it becomes clear that many people, on both sides of the aisle in Washington, need a course in remedial civics, if they ever had one anyway.
\
Let's take Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, who at the beginning of the article states, in regard to the upcoming budget bill, ""There are a number of regulations being churned out of this administration that we think are killing jobs."" Later, in the same article, he states; ""Congress writes laws. The president does not write laws.""
\
Who, besides a lawyer or politician, can state the difference between a regulation and a law? For the record, the speaker is correct in the latter statement, but unfortunately Congress has ceded its law- and regulation-making authority over the generations.
\
As for ""shutting down the government,"" the phrase needs to be abolished since the government never really shuts down. Even in an apocalypse, zombie or otherwise, the government would somehow manage to stay open. In all seriousness, the government actually shuts down more for a federal holiday than it does during a budget impasse.
\
Finally, President Obama should be required to show due cause if he vetoes a budget bill, short of partisanship and personal ideology.
\
It's a matter of civics. Obama was elected in 2012 - in part due to our archaic and asinine two-party system, as well as a weak challenger - while most of the current Congress was elected in 2014. To follow the will of the people, Obama should follow the results of the most recent election, unless he can show due cause otherwise.
\
It's time to pass the budget bill and allow the people to deal with the fallout next year when a new president and Congress will be elected.

Editor: The state sales tax may be going from 6 percent to 7.25 percent, as the governor and lawmakers continue to negotiate a budget.

That would work out to be an increase of slightly less than 21 percent. My Social Security benefits will not go up in 2016 due to low inflation. I think we may have elected the wrong people.

265,"
The Democratic leader of the New Jersey Assembly said she was ""beginning to wonder if Gov. Christie is mentally deranged"" after an audiotape surfaced Wednesday of comments he made in June at a previously unheralded meeting.
\
On it, Christie is heard regaling an audience of GOP fund-raisers about how two days earlier he had nailed down Speaker Sheila Oliver's support for a controversial bill to have state workers pay more for their benefits.
\
The Republican governor says Oliver, an Essex County Democrat, told him she was worried about a challenge to her leadership post as she pushed through legislation opposed by the majority of her party. Christie says Oliver agreed to move the bill after he lined up support for her from the Assembly's 33 Republicans. No such challenge was openly made.
\
That statement, along with a call by Christie to cut Medicare benefits, was captured on tapes from an undisclosed trip that Christie made to Colorado on June 26. It was published online by the left-leaning magazine Mother Jones.
\
The event, a fund-raising and strategy session at which the governor was a keynote speaker, was sponsored by the controversial conservative financiers David and Charles Koch.
\
In an interview Wednesday, Oliver called the governor's statements about her ""outright lies"" and said, ""At no time did I ever, ever pick up the telephone, call Gov. Christie and ask him to 'save my leadership.' ""
\
She said the governor was engaged in a ""chest-thumping bravado entertainment session"" for Republican donors.
\
""That to me is a characterization of someone that is not fit to lead the state. . . . I think it's disgraceful,"" Oliver said.
\
A spokesman for Christie said the governor stood by his story.
\
Asked about a deal with Oliver at a news conference in Atlantic City, Christie described it as ""another example of the way we've found to work together.""
\
The trip to Colorado was not on Christie's public schedule. The state Republican Committee paid for his flight.
\
Such travels out of state are only likely to increase because the Republican Governors Association announced Wednesday that Christie had been elected vice chairman of the organization, boosting his fund-raising and party leadership responsibilities.
\
In June, Christie was introduced at the Ritz-Carlton Beaver Creek Resort by David Koch (pronounced Coke), who with his brother owns the second-largest privately held company in the country, Koch Industries, an energy and chemical conglomerate.
\
The brothers have reportedly spent more than $100 million supporting conservative causes, including Americans for Prosperity, which helps bankroll the tea-party movement, and are adamant opponents of the idea that human activity causes global warming.
\
David Koch said at the session that he and Christie met in his New York office five months earlier and spoke for two hours on problems in New Jersey government.
\
""At the end of our conversation I said to myself, 'I'm really impressed and inspired by this man.' He is my kind of guy,"" Koch said.
\
Americans for Prosperity has fought the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), a 10-state cap-and-trade agreement to reduce greenhouse gases.
\
In May, Christie announced that he would withdraw New Jersey from the pact, saying that while he believed humans cause climate change, he did not believe RGGI was effective in addressing the problem.
\
Business groups applauded the move, and environmental advocates said the withdrawal would set the state back.
\
On the tape, Koch praised the decision as attendees applauded.
\
""Another example of Gov. Christie's commitment to the free-enterprise system is that only a few weeks ago, he announced that New Jersey would be withdrawing from [RGGI], which would have raised energy costs, reduced economic growth, and led to very little, if any, benefit for the environment,"" Koch said.
\
Jeff Tittel, president of the New Jersey Sierra Club, said the tape ""shows that the governor and the Koch brothers have the same political agenda.""
\
Christie's speech did not touch on RGGI, though, and much of what he said was similar to what he has said to audiences of all political stripes in New Jersey - including doing an impression of former Gov. Jon S. Corzine.
\
At one point, however, Christie went further than usual in a call for the federal government to control spending.
\
""We're going to have to reduce Medicare benefits,"" he said. ""We're going to have to reduce Medicaid benefits. We're going to have to raise the Social Security age. We're going to have to do these things. We're going to have to cut all types of other government programs that some people in this room might like.""
\
He praised the audience, saying, ""I'm here because it will be you - the people in this room are the modern-day patriots who will save this country or let it go by the wayside.""
\
Christie talked at length about his efforts to solve New Jersey's financial problems, explaining how he pushed a controversial bill to overhaul public workers' health and pension benefits through the Democratic-controlled Legislature.
\
Recounting the hours before the vote in the 80-member Assembly, Christie said: ""The reports I was getting out of there were not positive about what was going on to my friend the speaker. She was taking a beating at the hands of her own party.""
\
Hundreds of angry union workers had gathered outside and in the gallery of the Assembly, deriding Democrats who supported the bill as traitors.
\
At 5:30 that evening, according to the governor, Oliver called and said to him, "" 'I want to post the bill but I think when I go on the floor, my own party's going to take a run at me to remove me as speaker.' . . . She said, 'I think the only way I survive is if the 33 Republicans in the chamber will agree to vote for me for speaker. Can you work it out?' ""
\
Christie said he went to the Republican Assembly caucus room and said, ""Probably for the only time in my governorship I'm going to actually ask you to vote for a Democrat. . . . If they take a run at her on the floor, I need all of you to vote for her for speaker.""
\
The Republicans, he said, looked at him in surprise, but agreed.
\
Assemblyman John Bramnick (R., Union) said that while there was Republican support for the governor and the speaker, he did not recall such a meeting.
\
A challenge to Oliver's leadership was rumored in June, as some Democrats fumed that the Assembly needed a leader who would more aggressively push back against Christie, but it never materialized. In question is whether she will have the votes to hold on to her post when her term is up in January.

266,"
Republican Mitt Romney, tieless, fired up a PowerPoint presentation in a University of Michigan classroom Thursday and set about the delicate task of trying to defuse a ticking threat to his presidential candidacy: the health-care plan he enacted as Massachusetts governor, his biggest accomplishment in office.
\
The gist of Romney's message was that his law featuring a mandate that individuals buy medical insurance was a righteous state-based experiment, while President Obama's health-care overhaul with the same individual mandate was a ""federal power grab.""
\
He pledged to repeal Obama's plan and offered nuanced critiques of how the national law raises taxes, fails to control costs, and burdens business. But in the short term, at least, Romney drew ridicule from the conservative punditocracy.
\
""I think we can all start referring to Romney as a 'former' presidential candidate,"" wrote Erick Erickson, the influential blogger behind RedState.com.
\
Last week was one of the busiest in the developing 2012 Republican presidential race, as three of the serious, ""first-tier"" potential candidates whom pundits have been crying for made moves. In addition to Romney's attempt to reframe his health-care quandary, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich announced his candidacy and Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels inched closer to running.
\
Together, they carry what one analyst termed enough baggage to fill the cargo hold of a 747, so the first order of business for each was to try to paper over electoral flaws.
\
Gingrich, for instance, is a serial adulterer now on his third marriage, but strategists say his biggest challenge as a candidate will be to curb his logorrhea. And Daniels has to deal with his marriage's unusual history.
\
""Truth is, all candidates have some past troubles, scandals, misstatements, or the like,"" said political scientist Larry Sabato of the University of Virginia, a scholar of campaigns and the trajectory of scandal. ""It's inevitable unless you had an immaculate conception shortly before announcing.""
\
What's important is how adroitly a candidate handles the problem, Sabato said, and also the political environment: Do opponents have even worse liabilities? Are your ideological positioning and background right for the times?
\
Romney was attempting the classic grit-your-teeth-and-bluff-your-way-through-it maneuver.
\
Hillary Rodham Clinton took that approach in the run-up to the 2008 Democratic primaries, when she refused to apologize for her Senate vote authorizing the Iraq war despite the overwhelming opinion of the party's base that the war was a mistake from the start.
\
Her advisers knew that position was heavy baggage, but so were the perceived need for the first potential female commander-in-chief to look hawkish on foreign policy and the desire not to remind voters of the flexibility of former President Bill Clinton's positions.
\
So Hillary Clinton stood by her decision. She lost in the end, but the race stayed close for a long time.
\
Romney's strongest moment in Thursday's speech was when he asserted that the individual insurance mandate was the right thing to do, and a conservative idea besides, because of the problem of ""free riders.""
\
And though he got hammered initially, in the long run, sticking to his position may help, mitigating his reputation for flip-flopping. In 2008, he abandoned his former support for abortion rights and gay rights, adopting conservative positions favored by the GOP's religious right.
\
Authenticity is perhaps a bigger burden for Romney than the health-care plan that conservatives love to hate because it was a model for Obama's. As one adviser to Romney, who asked not to be named, said: ""The far right doesn't like Mitt Romney, and he's not going to get most of them no matter what he says.""
\
Heartfelt renunciation is also a time-honored way for candidates to inoculate themselves against an inconvenient past.
\
Former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, for instance, apologized in the first GOP debate May 5 for having enacted a policy of caps on greenhouse-gas emissions in his state.
\
""It was a mistake, and I'm sorry,"" Pawlenty said. ""You're going to have a few clunkers in your record, and we all do, and that's one of mine. I just admit it. I don't try to duck it, bob it, weave it, try to explain it away. I'm just telling you, I made a mistake.""
\
Opposition to so-called cap-and-trade policies has become a tenet of faith in the modern Republican Party, on the grounds that they harm business and cost jobs.
\
Pawlenty is betting that he helped himself with his frankness and by getting the issue out of the way early.
\
""There is sometimes great joy in the church over a convert - or so Pawlenty hopes,"" Sabato said.
\
In the 2008 Democratic primaries, former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards said he had made a mistake in voting to authorize the Iraq war, and he apologized. He was criticized at the time for excessive calculation, but Edwards lost for a host of other reasons.
\
Gingrich had already moved to address the infidelity issue, saying in interviews that he had strayed because he was working so hard on the country's problems. That explanation drew laughter, but not the rest of the answer, first given on the Christian Broadcast Network - that he has repented and been forgiven by God, and has been faithfully married to Callista, his third wife, for 11 years.
\
Strategists say his bigger challenge will be his reputation as a loose cannon. Though Gingrich brings energy and intellectual firepower to the GOP campaign, he spits out dozens of ideas at a time, some of them clunkers, and tends to make controversial off-the-cuff remarks instead of sticking to a script.
\
""I think he will get relatively impatient giving the same speech a hundred times,"" Republican strategist Terry Holt told the Washington Post. ""You've got to quit making up new stuff and take your best thing. That will be Newt's true test.""
\
Daniels is waiting for his family's OK to join the race, and for once that's not the usual excuse politicians give. In 1993, his wife, Cheri, filed for divorce, moved to California (leaving behind their four daughters), married another man, then divorced again and returned to Indiana to remarry Daniels in 1997.
\
She hates politics, and already opponents are circulating questions about the gap in the couple's marriage. Neither has ever spoken of it publicly, except Mitch Daniels' quip to the Indianapolis Star in 2004: ""If you like happy endings, you'll love our story.""
\
The public may well see it as a story of the triumph of love, as Daniels' advisers hope.
\
It's possible to overcome even heavier baggage. Consider Bill Clinton, who during the 1992 presidential campaign faced evidence of draft evasion, marijuana use, and adultery.
\
""Americans wanted a change and rejected the other candidates for various reasons,"" Sabato said, ""and the rest is history.""

"
267,"WASHINGTON -- Lobbyists for coal-burning utilities such as Southern Co. and Duke Energy Corp. are consulting environmental advocates and holding strategy sessions as they seek a role in shaping President Barack Obama's plan to combat climate change.\Mr. Obama's emphasis on global warming in his inaugural address last week has led power and coal producers, which have fought the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, to begin crafting their own proposed rules.\""It was the hope of a lot of companies in this sector that the president would be defeated,"" Manik Roy, vice president for strategic outreach at the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions in Arlington, Va., an energy and environment policy group, said in an interview. ""Now that the president has raised this as such a high issue, you'd be absolutely nuts not to be in there trying to engage constructively.""\Groups such as the National Mining Association, which has sued to block or overturn Environmental Protection Agency rules in the past, appear to be taking a less confrontational approach this time. The association for producers such as Arch Coal Inc. and Peabody Energy Corp. called last year's EPA proposal that would effectively outlaw new coal-fired power plants that lack carbon-capture technology ""unprecedented and unlawful.""\For the next round of rule making, the group is considering creating its own proposals.\""We are looking at it internally here with our members to see if there are particular pathways that work better and can keep coal as a vibrant part of the electricity portfolio,"" Hal Quinn, the mining association's president, told reporters Jan. 28. ""That's a very important question.""\The association, based in Washington, D.C., donated $839,250 to federal candidates for the 2012 election with 92 percent going to Republicans. American Electric Power Co. and Southern, among the top coal-burning utilities in the U.S., gave about three quarters of their political donations in 2012 to Republican candidates and parties, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign spending. Coal producers as a group gave 90 percent of their donations to Republicans.\Those bets failed, and Mr. Obama was re-elected. The results have left coal companies and power producers pivoting from political foes to reluctant partners of Mr. Obama's.\""You'll see the full range of activities that are in the government relations tool chest,"" Scott Segal, a lawyer at Bracewell & Giuliani in Washington who represents coal- fired utilities, said in an interview. ""Everything from direct advocacy to negotiation to advertising and grass-roots engagement.""\In his inaugural address, Mr. Obama warned that failure to act on climate change ""would betray our children and future generations.""\""We didn't know what kind of emphasis EPA was going to put on it,"" Michael McKenna, an oil-industry lobbyist and president of MWR Strategies Inc. in Washington, said in an interview. ""What the inaugural address told us was it's going to be the most important rule making EPA is going to do in the second term.""\The coal industry is already under threat.\The Stowe Global Coal Index of 36 production, transportation and mine-service companies fell 27 percent in the past 12 months as low natural gas prices and mild weather led U.S. coal companies to cut output by millions of tons, shut mines and fire workers.\Relying on authority in the four-decade-old Clean Air Act and a 2007 Supreme Court decision applying the law to carbon dioxide emissions, the EPA is set to finalize rules for greenhouse-gas emissions from new power plants by the end of March. The agency will then face legal and political pressure to issue related standards for existing plants, the largest source of those pollutants.\The Natural Resources Defense Council issued recommendations in December, calling for the EPA to set guidelines for existing power plants that reflect a state's specific mix of power sources. For example, a state that gets most of its electricity from burning coal would have a different EPA guideline than one that has more of a split between coal, natural gas and oil.\Power producers could meet the reductions by shifting their fuel mix, buying credits or encouraging energy efficiency, which cuts demand for electricity. The New York-based group says that if the new standards were put in place, carbon emissions from plants would decline 26 percent in this decade from 2005 levels. Annual costs would amount to about $4 billion in 2020.\Since unveiling the proposal, staff members from the group have met with companies, such as Dominion Resources Inc. and Duke. The Edison Electric Institute, which represents power producers, is compiling a list of questions from its members for the NRDC and companies are analyzing the potential impact on their plants, David Doniger, policy director for environmental group, said in an interview.\Power producers like the flexibility that NRDC worked into its plan, Mr. Doniger said. ""It mirrors how companies operate a pool of power-plant assets,"" he said.\So far only Entergy Corp. offered public support.\""We plan to work with various stakeholders -- including the president, Congress, environmental advocacy organizations and industry groups -- to address the issue"" of climate change, said Ryan Frazier, a spokesman for Dominion, a Richmond, Va.-based electricity company.\Gina McCarthy, the EPA's top air regulator, told a conference in New York yesterday that the agency is set to issue final greenhouse-gas rules for new coal plants in March, and is beginning to talk with interested parties about the next set, which would apply to existing facilities.\EPA and the industry ""have never seen such good communication,"" Ms. McCarthy said, according to Bloomberg BNA.\It's not the first time that power producers have sought to shape Mr. Obama's climate policy. In 2009, a coalition of environmental groups and companies cooperated to push for legislation to cap carbon emissions and allow trading of carbon credits to meet those targets.\When the legislation stalled in the Senate, Mr. Obama distanced himself from cap-and-trade; the coalition, the U.S. Climate Action Partnership, hasn't issued any public statements since 2011.\""We just need to see what they come up with,"" Tom Williams, a spokesman for coalition-member Duke, said in an interview, when asked about Mr. Obama's inaugural pledge. ""Our whole intent was to have a predictable path going forward.""\About half of Duke's electricity comes from coal plants. The company, based in Charlotte, N.C., plans to close 50 coal-fired units, Mr. Williams said.\American Electric, based in Columbus, Ohio, also supported that legislative effort, going so far as building a carbon-capture plant in West Virginia in anticipation of the bill's passage.\""AEP will stay engaged on this issue and will share our concerns about the potential economic impact of greenhouse gas rules with the EPA, with the administration, with lawmakers, really with anyone who will listen,"" Nick Akins, American Electric's chief executive officer, said in an email.\If structured properly, new rules for existing plants could let the U.S. meet Mr. Obama's goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions 17 percent by 2020 at a cost of $4 billion in that year, according to a report last month from the NRDC. If not, they could stifle economic growth, Mr. Akins said.\""Now is not the time to burden our still tenuous economic recovery with overly stringent regulations that will further impede that recovery,"" Mr. Akins said.\At least one coal opponent isn't convinced talks with the industry will yield compromise.\""Their history is to resist any and all forms of government regulation,"" Tom Sanzillo, director of finance for the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, a group based in Belmont, Mass., that works with environmental organizations fighting coal. ""They want to have a fight to the death over something they can't win."""
268,"There is so much unwanted gas coming out of American coal mines - those that still produce coal and even those that have long quit - that federal data suggests it outpaces the carbon emissions footprint of the entire U.S. petrochemical industry.\It is more than the greenhouse gas impact of all iron, steel and coke plants in the country.\For environmentalists and entrepreneurs alike, this represents a huge, barely tapped resource for preventing these emissions and getting paid to do so.\""The potential is quite large in the U.S.,"" said Ben Apple, principal at Environmental Commodities Corporation, a Maryland-based developer of projects that generate carbon credits - like systems that prevent mine gas from getting into the atmosphere.\That gas is methane, which is many times more powerful than carbon dioxide at trapping heat over a shorter period of time. Estimates place it between 25 times and 84 times the warming threat of CO2.\Even burning that gas, not for power but just to get rid of it, is far better for the environment than doing nothing.\That's what Mr. Apple's company does a lot of. It pulls methane from coal mines and burns it in an oxidation chamber. The resulting emissions are steam and carbon dioxide.\Of course, that gas could be used for energy, if it's concentrated enough and there's a pipeline nearby. That's how CNX Resources has been selling the methane from the Buchanan Mine in Virginia - the ""gassiest"" mine in America - into a natural gas pipeline and to local power plant co-owned by the Cecil-based oil and gas company.\It's also how, CNX explained last week, it has been net carbon negative for years, as its rivals in the shale gas space set targets to get to net zero. The emissions it prevents from venting from Buchanan offset many times the emissions that CNX produces in its shale gas operations, the company said.\Preventing most of the gas at Buchanan from escaping avoided the equivalent of 9 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions in 2018, shows the latest data available from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which keeps an inventory of the 35 gassiest mines. Buchanan tops the list by a factor of 2.\According to the EPA, some 62 million cubic feet of methane came out of the sprawling mine each day in 2018. To put that into perspective, that's more than twice the daily volume of gas that CNX is pulling from all of its shale gas wells at the Pittsburgh International Airport, according to the latest data from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection.\Unlike its Marcellus gas, the methane from the Buchanan mine qualifies as a renewable energy resource under the Pennsylvania Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards. So, in addition to its retail price, CNX also gets paid for the alternative energy credits.\Soon, CNX plans to start generating carbon credits, too. This, from a company that has until now resisted talking about limiting carbon emissions.\""We didn't change. The world changed,"" CNX's chief excellence officer Yemi Akinkugbe said last week.\What CNX has been doing for decades to make money - harvesting gas from coal mines and selling it - is now an environmental commodity.\While it hasn't certified any of its carbon reductions from Buchanan so far, the company is actively developing other mine gas abatement projects and has submitted certain projects to be considered for carbon credits.\Mr. Akinkugbe expects that will further prepare CNX for when - ""not if but when"" - there is a price put on carbon emissions.\The gassiest mine in America\The Buchanan mine opened in 1983 and, until 2016, was owned by Consol Energy, the 150-year-old coal mining company that launched CNX as a subsidiary specifically to collect and sell mine methane from Buchanan. The two split in 2017.\Breaking up rock underground frees the methane embedded in it and creates a risk of explosion inside the space. Federal safety regulations require mine owners to vent that gas out of the mine. But no environmental regulation says they have to keep it from getting into the atmosphere, just as no federal law prohibits the emission of carbon dioxide.\Mine methane first became a commodity when companies like the old Consol realized they can sell it as fuel.\But when shale gas came along and oil and gas firms, CNX among them, turned their attention to drilling mileslong gushers and depressing the price of natural gas, mine gas was no longer the hot ticket it once seemed.\Around the same time as the Marcellus Shale rush was taking off, President Barack Obama declared it a priority to pass climate legislation that would limit carbon emissions.\In 2010, Consol Energy launched an effort to capture and destroy methane from its McElroy Mine in West Virginia. Its vice president of research and development at the time, Steve Winberg, said it would be a spring board for getting into carbon offsets.\But the climate bill didn't pan out and there is still no federal cap on greenhouse gas emissions.\Still, a cap and trade carbon market set up by the California Air Resources Board took off. In 2014, the board allowed coal mine methane projects to qualify for carbon credits.\That same year, Ben Apple launched Environmental Commodities Corporation, which dominates the coal mine methane field.\The company's name is all over the projects in this area.\When, in 2017, Consol launched a methane abatement effort at its Greene County Bailey Mine, it was Environmental Commodities that designed the system and worked on the credits.\When the shuttered 84 Mine in Washington County put in a mine gas incinerator last year, that was Mr. Apple's company, too.\His name appears on many of dozens of mine methane projects listed on the three main carbon registries where credits are verified and listed. One credit equals one metric ton of CO2 emissions avoided.\All together, those projects have prevented just shy of 8 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent from reaching the atmosphere.\But the impact isn't exactly groundbreaking. The Bailey Mine emits as much in three years, federal data shows. Meanwhile, the methane destruction effort at the mine has prevented some 226,292 million tons of greenhouse gasses from reaching the atmosphere, Consol's data show. The coal company plans to continue growing that effort and generating carbon offsets, its documents show.\Even at the Buchanan Mine, where the vast majority of the mine gas is captured in what is by far the largest mine methane abatement project in the country, close to 2 million tons of CO2 equivalent still vents into the atmosphere, according to the EPA. Buchanan is now owned by Australian company Coronado Global Resources.\CNX, which retained the gas rights to the mine, is likely to start burning some of that remainder to generate carbon credits. It already has a buyer for the future offsets: its Canonsburg neighbor, Equitrans Midstream Corp. The pipeline company announced earlier this month that it will buy $150 million worth of carbon credits to offset the greenhouse gas impact of its Mountain Valley Pipeline.\Such voluntary purchases are becoming much more common, Mr. Apple said.\But it's the nation's only compliance-based market place in California that has moved the needle, he said.\""California's program has caused more mine methane abatement than any other program globally,"" Mr. Apple said. ""I sat in the room with antagonists that said, 'Don't do this for coalbed methane. Don't give anybody a carbon credit because they should be regulated.'\""It was a very healthy debate,"" he said. But half a dozen years later, no regulations have been passed to regulate methane emissions from coal mines. But the methane vents just the same.\CAPTION: PHOTO: Jessie Wardarski/Post-Gazette: A conveyor at Consol Energy's Bailey Mine in Waynesburg.

269,"WASHINGTON -- When John Murtha came back from fighting in Vietnam in 1967, he thought that war still could be won with military might. His views on that subject soon changed.\So, too, have Pennsylvania's longest-tenured congressman's views changed about Afghanistan. In a recent interview, Mr. Murtha, a powerful foreign policy voice as head of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, compared America's nearly eight-year involvement in Afghanistan to its wars in Vietnam and Iraq, as well as the Soviet Union's failed Afghan invasion.\""We can't solve this militarily,"" the Johnstown Democrat said. ""The Afghans have to solve it themselves. The Iraqis have to solve it themselves. We can help them do it, but it has to be done diplomatically.""\The course of the war will be the cause of considerable debate in Washington in the coming months, joining health insurance, climate change, unionization and other controversies that await Congress when it returns tomorrow from summer recess.\It's going to be a hectic fall, and Western Pennsylvania's elected leaders will be in the middle of things, starting with the significant policy challenges presented in Afghanistan.\Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, President Barack Obama's new pick to head forces in Afghanistan, last week submitted a review of the war effort to the Pentagon that news reports depicted as sobering. Reports from the region suggest that the Taliban remain entrenched in many areas, while polls show the American public's desire to fight the war is dwindling.\The White House is scheduled to deliver a report on Afghanistan to Congress on Sept. 24, and if the president asks for more troops, legislators won't just acquiesce.\""I'm urging the administration to be extra careful about sending extra troops,"" Mr. Murtha said.\Sen. Bob Casey Jr., D-Pa., also has a legislative megaphone on the issue as chairman of the Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Near Eastern and South and Central Asian Affairs, which has jurisdiction over Afghanistan and Pakistan. During the August recess he led a Congressional delegation to the two nations. Although he said he was unimpressed with Afghan President Hamid Karzai -- whose future is in doubt as he faces allegations of election vote-rigging -- he praised Gen. McChrystal.\Mr. Casey said he was confident in the military counterinsurgency strategy and would be open to sending more troops if the White House could justify it.\""The president and his administration will have to give people a sense of what's going on, what the progress is, are we making the kind of progress the policy intended?"" Mr. Casey said. ""When things are not going well, I think we have to be honest about where we are.""\Climate change\The Senate likely will introduce legislation on climate change in the next few weeks, resuming the bitter battle that gripped the House over the summer on the bill and its controversial ""cap-and-trade"" provision.\In addition to setting lower greenhouse gas emissions targets, the House bill would create a market where businesses can swap the right to pollute above a certain cap, a system the bill's backers say would create powerful incentives to reduce emissions. Many conservatives and those in the business community have dubbed the bill ""cap-and-tax,"" and claim it will cause the nation's energy bills to skyrocket as utilities pass on their costs.\Both Pennsylvania senators have lined up behind the bill, with Republican-turned-Democrat Arlen Specter telling the Netroots Nation conference of progressive bloggers last month in Pittsburgh that he would vote for the bill. \""I took an assignment on the Environment and Public Works Committee because of the importance of the issue,"" Mr. Specter said. ""I wanted to have a seat at the table, and I'm working with Sen. [Barbara] Boxer, who's the chairman of the committee, to have a strong bill, and I support what President Obama wants to do.""\Mr. Obama wants to have a bill in place by December when he attends the environmental summit in Copenhagen. A bill that pledges to reduce emissions in the United States could help prod other nations toward aggressive policies, the administration argues.\The House bill passed narrowly, without the votes of many Democrats -- including Jason Altmire, D-McCandless, a member of the conservative Blue Dog caucus. \During the August recess the League of Conservation Voters took out a full-page advertisement in The Beaver County Times newspaper to assail Mr. Altmire's ""no"" vote on the climate bill, saying it cost Pennsylvania thousands of so-called green jobs in renewable energy fields. But when Mr. Altmire mentioned his opposition to the bill during a recent town hall meeting in Farrell, Mercer County, he was met with wild cheers.\Rep. Tim Murphy, R-Upper St. Clair, also opposed the bill and helped draft an alternative. In May, Mr. Murphy and Rep. Neil Abercrombie, D-Hawaii, introduced the American Conservation and Clean Energy Act, which would raise funds from existing offshore oil projects to fund cleaner coal and nuclear research, among other environmental projects.\In an interview last week, Mr. Murphy said the legislation would reduce emissions through greater efficiency while also investing in infrastructure by tapping into the offshore oil revenues.\The bill has gone nowhere in the House so far, but Mr. Murphy said the Senate climate bill is likely to be much more centrist, meaning some of the aspects of his bipartisan bill could make their way into the final version.\""There's no limit what you can do as long as you don't mind who takes the credit,"" Mr. Murphy said. ""In the end, America expects us to solve these problems and not sell our jobs out to other countries.""\Unions\In another closely watched battle, the Senate is due to take up the Employee Free Choice Act, a long-sought measure designed to make it easier to organize unions, this fall. The bill was dubbed ""card check"" by its opponents, but that could be a misnomer if the compromise brokered by Mr. Specter and other senators over the summer stands.\The legislation would allow workers to organize unions by signing a card rather than voting through secret ballot. Mr. Specter said he wants to keep the secret ballot rather than a rule that as soon as more than half of a workforce presents signed cards, management must recognize the union.\In an interview last week, Mr. Specter said that even without the bill's most controversial provision, it would be a big step forward for unions. \""I think we can provide what labor is interested in, in certification by the timetable on elections and giving labor people access,"" Mr. Specter said. ""Management now controls the situation, but I think labor ought to have a level playing field. Labor ought to have equal access to meetings on company time on company property.""\Mr. Specter said he supports criminal penalties for unfair labor practices and a ""last best offer"" method of arbitration, which is meant to bring two sides closer together. Mr. Specter said it is similar to the system used by Major League Baseball.\The importance of this vote to Mr. Specter's re-election campaign was underscored in late August when James Hoffa, president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, told Bloomberg News that his union might not support Mr. Specter in next year's election because he hasn't fully supported the measure. Mr. Specter switched from Republican to Democrat in April in part to avoid a primary challenge from conservative Pat Toomey, but he also faces a test in the Democratic primary from Rep. Joe Sestak of Delaware County.\Mr. Specter said he was aware of Mr. Hoffa's comments, but added, ""We've had talks with officials from AFL-CIO, who have been involved in our discussions, and I'm optimistic we can get labor support.""\As the final hours of Congressional recess tick away, members might be enjoying their last extended break for a while, thanks to a fall agenda jam-packed with controversial issues -- and eventually passing a budget.\""We'll be there until Christmastime,"" Mr. Murtha said. ""We usually like to leave early, but we'll be there probably through the end of the year."""
270,"CORRECTION: 7/22/2014 FOR THE RECORD (Published Tuesday, July 22, 2014) - The Nature Conservancy, which has done previous environmental projects with Walt Disney Co., has a contract with Disney to buy carbon credits from the Bethlehem Authority, via the carbon credit marketing agency Blue Source. A story in the July 13 paper was not clear about how the carbon credits were sold.\7/22/2014 FOR THE RECORD (Published Tuesday, July 22, 2014) - The Nature Conservancy, which has done previous environmental projects with Walt Disney Co., has a contract with Disney to buy carbon credits from the Bethlehem Authority, via the carbon credit marketing agency Blue Source. A story in the July 13 paper was not clear about how the carbon credits were sold. \The wonderful world of Disney will soon include a piece of Bethlehem.\The Walt Disney Co., whose fictional forests created cover for characters from Bambi to Snow White, has finalized an environmental deal involving the 20,000 acres of lush woods surrounding Bethlehem's water reservoirs.\Those aging cherry trees that loggers love and pitch pines where songbirds flock will be used to help offset the greenhouse gas pollution Disney generates from enterprises ranging from theme parks to cruise ships. It's all thanks to the voluntary carbon market.\The carbon market works much like a financial market, with carbon credits as the commodity. Each credit represents a certain amount of carbon. Companies voluntarily limit themselves on carbon emissions, and if they exceed the limit, they buy carbon credits from an entity that cuts down on pollution -- for example, through its trees that help clean the air. So the cost of buying credits gives companies a financial incentive to conserve as much as they can.\The Bethlehem Authority, stewards of the forest surrounding the watershed in the Pocono Mountains, entered the voluntary carbon market in 2012 with Chevrolet as its first customer. The authority got its first $50,000 check from Chevrolet last year and expects to get paid in the neighborhood of $120,000 this summer, water officials say.\When that contract ends next summer, the four-year contract Disney inked this spring will begin. The authority estimates the deal will bring in $140,000 to $170,000 annually. The deal helps Bethlehem gradually fatten its bank accounts for capital improvements for its aging water system and will help protect the watershed's fragile forest.\""Our No. 1 priority is the protection"" of the watershed and the quality of the city's drinking water, said Steve Repasch, executive director of the Bethlehem Authority. ""This lets us do that and gives us the money to do it.""\The payments are a small piece of Disney's global initiative to shrink its carbon footprint. Disney's campaign, which was announced in 2009, ranges from flashy projects such as fueling theme park trains with soy-based cooking oil, to the less obvious, such as using paper made from sustainable forestry practices.\But a multinational company like Disney, which took in $45 billion in revenue last year, can't eliminate all pollution and still leaves a significant carbon footprint. That's where the voluntary carbon market comes in.\Last year, the company used the voluntary market to offset 457,882 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions, according to company reports.\""Disney is one of the bigger players in the voluntary markets,"" said Gary Gero, president of Climate Action Reserve in California. ""There are a few headliners like Google and General Motors, and Disney is right up there as one of the most significant players in the voluntary carbon market.""\Last year, companies around the globe bought more than $379 million in carbon credits to offset 76 metric tons of greenhouse gases they emit, according to the annual State of Voluntary Carbon Markets report.\That's 26.7 million fewer metric tons than the previous year, but the nonprofit attributes the drop to emerging cap-and-trade pollution reduction markets, many in California, which are not tracked in the voluntary market.\Forestry projects alone accounted for 22.6 million metric tons and set a record with a 162 percent jump in million metric tons of carbon offsets sold, thanks to a reforestation project in Germany.\Disney finds those types of projects enchanting, even though reforestation is less cost-effective than other projects that offset pollution.\It costs more to regrow a forest than it does to dispose of a refrigerator or capture methane gas from landfills, Gero said.\Disney, responsible to investors paying $86.89 a share, is concerned about its bottom line like any large company, Gero said. So, Disney diversifies its portfolio.\Roger Williams, president of Blue Source, the company that marketed the credits for Bethlehem, said he could not speak for Disney but, in general, buyers like the idea of forestation because of what they see and because it has greater social benefits, such as watershed protection.\""There's a story to tell and it's something they can get their arms around,"" he said.\A Disney spokesperson did not provide a comment in time for publication.\Bob Antonoplis, assistant general counsel for Disney, talked about the company's carbon credit investments in September during a webinar hosted by Climate Action Reserve of California.\""We like projects that have co-benefits, side benefits in addition to just pure greenhouse gas benefits,"" he told participants in the hourlong webinar. ""We are really drawn to forestry projects, and we're really drawn to reforestation projects that in particular have watershed protection, habitat rehabilitation as well as a greenhouse component. So, a bulk of our money is spent on forestry projects.""\Those projects have ranged from reforestation efforts in the Amazon to reseeding Cuyamaca Rancho State Park, northeast of San Diego, after a 2003 wildfire ravaged the cedar forest.\Antonoplis said Disney likes to pick projects where it operates but it's not a rule.\""We don't only pick projects based on geography; obviously we don't have a whole lot going on with the Peruvian Amazon or the Lower Mississippi Valley,"" he said.\For Bethlehem, the investment is on parcels near Penn Forest and Wild Creek reservoirs, areas naturalists praise for their biodiversity in Carbon and Monroe counties.\The Nature Conservancy designated the Tunkhannock Creek Watershed, most of which belongs to the Bethlehem Authority, as one of the world's ""last great places."" Its flora, fauna and spring-fed creeks have attracted scores of scientific studies on the habitat that took root there thousands of years ago when the glaciers receded.\But, like forests across Pennsylvania, the woods are old. The thick, mature overstory is choking out the growth of young saplings in some areas, and invasive species are out-competing native cherry and oak trees in other areas.\The authority has embarked on selective timber cuts and controlled burning to bring back the forests and scrub oak barrens, home to valuable species like the snowshoe hare and golden-winged warbler.\All that costs money, so the authority partnered with the Nature Conservancy and Blue Source, a carbon credit marketing agency, in the state Working Woodlands Program.\The program includes a 10-year forest management plan that boosts the health of the forest and increases the value of the timber sold because it carries the Forest Stewardship Council label. The authority is timbering in an environmentally sensitive way, weeding out invasive species and leaving behind healthy natives to repopulate the forests.\The only other Working Woodland program in the state is with Lock Haven Authority, which owns a 5,000-acre watershed. Bethlehem's success, Williams said, is starting to draw interest from other municipalities.\As part of the Working Woodlands program, surveyors measure how much carbon is sequestered in its trees for the purpose of selling it on the voluntary market and it's validated by a third-party nonprofit.\This year's carbon survey is in progress, but Bethlehem water officials estimate it has 40,000-50,000 metric tons of carbon to sell.\While small in comparison to headline-grabbing projects in the Amazon, the Bethlehem watershed is exactly the type of project that turns the heads of Disney, Chevrolet and other corporate social responsibility buyers, according to Josh Parrish, the Nature Conservancy's director of conservation in Pennsylvania.\""They look across the globe for projects like ours that demonstrate not only the carbon benefits but the social benefits: enhanced water quality and sustainability, economic and ecological benefits,"" Parrish said. ""Bethlehem has the total package.""\But forestation projects can be tricky business. Critics caution that protecting a forest in one location just shifts timbering to another because it doesn't address the issue of demand. Nonprofits that oversee the voluntary market say they consider that when calculating carbon offsets.\Bethlehem and the Nature Conservancy are addressing the concern in its land management plan. The authority still plans to cut down trees, fulfilling some of the timber demand. But the trees are logged in a sustainable way, clearing the forest floor so that young trees have room to grow and replace those cut down. Ultimately, authority officials argue, the plan will lead to a healthier environment surrounding the city's water supply.\A diamond in the rough.\Credit: By Nicole Radzievich Of The Morning Call\Credit: By Nicole Radzievich Of The Morning Call"
271,"
Governor George E. Pataki announced recently in a press release that he has proposed legislation to adopt the provisions of a strategic plan agreed to by the eight Great Lakes states and two Canadian provinces to enhance the management and protection of the waters and natural resources of the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Basin.
\
In December 2005, Governor Pataki announced that New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin had reached agreement on the Great Lakes -St. Lawrence River Basin Water Resources Compact - a comprehensive management framework for achieving sustainable water use and resource protection. The proposed legislation by the Governor would formally enact the Compact in New York State law. The eight Great Lakes states reached a similar, non-binding agreement with the provinces of Ontario and Quebec at the same time, which the provinces will use to amend their existing water programs for greater regional consistency.
\
""The Great Lakes are a valuable resource for our nation, and because of its geographic location, New York has historically depended upon these waters for industry, transportation, trade, and recreation,"" Governor Pataki said. ""I am pleased that we have been able to forge collaborative agreements with the other Great Lakes states and Canadian provinces to protect these waters and ensure that they will remain a vital part of our livelihood now and into the future. The State Legislature has been a strong ally in this effort, and we will continue to work with them to ensure that the Great Lakes will remain a vibrant, healthy resource for generations to come.""
\
Senator Jim Wright said, ""The assurance of the long-term environmental well being of the Great Lakes is critically important to Central and Northern New York. Further, the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Basin provides an abundance of business and recreational opportunities that enhance our quality of life in the region. The collaborative effort by the states and Canadian provinces to protect the environmental integrity of the lakes speaks volumes to their importance. I applaud the Governor for his efforts to enact this historic compact.""
\
Senator Carl Marcellino, chair of the Senate Committee on Environmental Conservation, said, ""Fresh water is a natural resource that must be protected. This compact goes a long way to ensure that the Great Lakes will have enough water to protect their precious ecosystems, and that future generations will have the water they need.""
\
Senator George D. Maziarz said, ""The Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Basin Water Resources Compact is significant because eight states with diverse needs worked tenaciously until they came to agreement to pursue ecosystem health on behalf of future generations. The Great Lakes ecosystems are more fragile than they look, and our efforts need to be collaborative and proactive. I applaud Governor Pataki for his leadership role in this achievement.""
\
Assembly Majority Leader Paul A. Tokasz said, ""The Great Lakes comprise the largest body of freshwater in the world. While the magnificent beauty and bounty of these Lakes are unmatched, managing this precious resource is increasingly complex and challenging. I support the goals of these agreements and look forward to working with my colleagues to further preserve the Great Lakes for future generations.""
\
Assemblyman Tom DiNapoli, chair of the Assembly Committee on Environmental Conservation said, ""The quality and quantity of water in the Great Lakes Basin have a tremendous impact on the environmental health and economic vitality of New York State. I support the goals of the Compact as a means to protect the waters and water dependent resources of the Great Lakes region.""
\
Assemblywoman Teresa Sayward said, ""If we are to protect and preserve our natural resources, so wonderfully epitomized by the vastness of the Great Lakes, we must think globally. As partners with our neighbors, we can go beyond the boundary lines on our maps to ensure responsible and long range protections for generations to come.""
\
Assemblyman David Koon said, ""Protecting the Great Lakes is an absolute necessity. Through better management of these majestic waterways and natural resources, we will see endless benefits for our region's health, economy, and recreation.""
\
Assemblyman Darrel Aubertine said, ""As co-chair of the Great Lakes Commission and representative of the St. Lawrence Seaway and Thousand Islands region, I am pleased that New York State is moving forward with the Great Lakes Compact. This collaborative agreement will preserve and protect for years to come these pristine waterways that millions of people rely on for drinking water, recreational use, and their economic livelihood.""
\
The five Great Lakes comprise the world's largest surface freshwater system, spanning more than 750 miles of New York shoreline. The partners to the Compact have worked to develop a program to carefully manage and protect the freshwaters of the region.
\
The proposed legislation to codify the Compact will, when enacted by the Great Lakes states and consented to by the U.S. Congress:
\
Ban any new or increased diversion of Great Lakes water out of the basin, with certain limited exceptions. The exceptions granted would primarily be for community water supply systems that straddle the Basin boundary.
\
- Establish a state water resources inventory for each member state within five years.
\
- Require any person/entity seeking to withdraw 100,000 gallons or more of water from the Great Lakes Basin within an average 30-day period to register this activity with the appropriate state.
\
- Each state and province will establish a program, including thresholds, to manage or regulate new or increased withdrawals, consumptive uses and diversions; establish water conservation and efficient use programs; and conduct periodic assessments of the cumulative impacts.
\
- Create the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Basin Water Resources Council, consisting of the governors of the member states. In collaboration with Ontario and Quebec, the Council would assist with the coordination of activities and programs of the states, including providing advice and consultation.
\
Empire State Development Chairman Charles A. Gargano said, ""The formal enactment of the Compact is an important next step in the ongoing
\
effort to preserve these tremendously valuable resources. Governor Pataki's leadership in helping to forge the agreement has been pivotal in moving this issue forward. The Great Lakes have been central to the life of their communities for generations, and this Compact will help to ensure that the Great Lakes will continue to be a popular tourist destination.""
\
State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) Commissioner Denise M. Sheehan said, ""Governor Pataki is committed to improving the health of Lake Erie, Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River Basin because of its importance to New York State's economy, recreational opportunities, and ongoing enhancement of natural resources. Implementation of the Compact in New York State is another significant step in continuing to foster the protection of fish and wildlife, water quality, and habitat throughout the Great Lakes region.""
\
State Agriculture Commissioner Patrick H. Brennan said, ""Agriculture in Central and Western New York would not be what it is today without the clean water provided by the Great Lakes. Farmers in the region rely on nutrient rich soils lining the lakes, as well as lake effect precipitation to nourish their crops. I am pleased Governor Pataki has signed onto the Great Lakes Compact to ensure that farmers and New Yorkers will continue to be able to enjoy the lakes' beauty and all of their benefits.""
\
Henry Tepper, The Nature Conservancy's New York State Director said, ""The Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Basin Water Resources Compact is an historic opportunity to protect the world's largest fresh water ecosystem. The Nature Conservancy thanks Governor Pataki for his environmental
\
leadership and looks forward to working with our government and non-government partners to implement the principles of the Compact so that sustainable water management practices are put in place. The outcome of the process is essential to millions of current and future New Yorkers who depend on the state's magnificent waters and abundant water-dependent natural resources.""
\
David J. Miller, executive director of Audubon New York, said, ""The Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Basin Water Resources Compact is critical for the long term protection of the water resources of the Great Lakes Basin, which represents twenty percent of the world's freshwater. This Compact will allow the Great Lakes region to maintain control of its waters as demand continues to grow throughout the nation and worldwide, and we thank Governor Pataki for all his efforts in creating this strong and effective plan, and for working with the Council of Great Lakes Governors to make this important Compact a reality.""
\
Robert J. Moore, executive director of Environmental Advocates of New York, said, ""The Great Lakes are a natural treasure and irreplaceable
\
resource. With his introduction of the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Basin Water Resources Compact to the New York State Legislature, Governor Pataki has taken an historic step to safeguard the waters of the Great Lakes and the future of the three million New Yorkers who live within its watershed.""
\
John W. Lincoln, president of New York Farm Bureau, said, ""New York farm families rely on the productive soils of our state and the abundant water of the Great Lakes Basin to sustain our industry. Our member approved policy is clear, 'We support programs that will protect the water resources of the Great Lakes Basin from diversion to other parts of the country.' To this end, we thank Governor Pataki for his continued defense of our industry.""
\
In 2001, Governor Pataki hosted the Great Lakes governors and premiers in Niagara Falls, where they signed the Great Lakes Annex 2001 amendment to the Great Lakes Charter. This document outlined the states' and provinces' commitment to develop and implement a common, resource-based conservation standard and apply it to new water withdrawal proposals from the Great Lakes Basin.
\
Following several years of extensive negotiations, the governors and premiers delivered on that promise and signed the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Basin Sustainable Water Resources Agreement in 2005. The Compact will enact this Agreement into New York State law is necessary to accomplish the commitment to protect the Great Lakes as a vital water resource.
\
Governor Pataki is a strong supporter of collaborative efforts to protect regional resources that are critical to our environment. In December 2005, he announced that New York and six other Northeast states had reached agreement on the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), the nation's first mandatory cap-and-trade program for carbon dioxide (CO2) emission from power plants in U.S. history. In addition to New York, other states signing the regional Memorandum of Understanding for RGGI are: Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, New Hampshire, New Jersey, and Vermont.

272,"On Jan. 28, state Rep. Bryan Cutler, in support of his effort to weaken the voice of working Pennsylvanians, compared a completely legal process of bargaining for voluntary deduction of union dues and nonpartisan political contributions to the criminal acts involved in ""Bonusgate.""\Mr. Cutler's absurd comparison is the best evidence that his position on voluntary dues deduction and nonpartisan political contributions is not supported by facts. He has to rely on absurd and irrelevant comparisons to try and garner support.\The law has allowed for voluntary dues deduction to be negotiable since 1970 and voluntary nonpartisan political contributions since 1988.\Mr. Cutler's claim that he is protecting union members who don't like what the union is lobbying for is not needed. Members of unions can request and receive reimbursement for the portion of their dues used to lobby for issues they disagree with.\The truth of the matter is Mr. Cutler is not worried about the concerns of working men and women. He is pursuing the national interests of the American Legislative Exchange Council and out-of-state millionaires and billionaires who want the voices of working men and women silenced so theirs is the only voice impacting the direction of our country.\Michael Fox\Harrisburg\(Editors' note: The writer is director of AFSCME District Council 89.)\I really enjoyed reading Cal Thomas' syndicated column in the Lancaster New Era on the departure of Jay Leno from ""The Tonight Show.""\I am so tired of all the negative articles and TV spots over the years on his hosting, saying Jay's not hip.

They based a sound government and just human relations as natural law - which is God's law. America was founded on Christian ways.\Our leaders and nation have become corrupt when it comes to what is right or wrong. Right has become wrong and wrong has become right. We must examine our hearts and see where we stand.\We have forgotten to seek God. The world loves darkness. The Lord tells us, ""I am the light of the world. If you follow me, you won't have to walk in darkness, because you will have the light that leads to life.""\We all need to follow the right path - the path of light that God offers us.\Fran Catanzaro\Mount Joy\In 2013, the world had a record $41 billion worth of weather-related disasters, insurance firm Aon Benfield just announced.\The insurance industry knows that, without a significant worldwide reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, this record will be broken many times with disastrous consequences for the economy and the environment.\CO2 has been increasing in the Earth's atmosphere ever since people began burning fossil fuels. The rise was slow at first and is speeding up each year. Now there's 43 percent more CO2 in the atmosphere, and it's still rising.\Scientists knew in the 1800s that CO2 is a heat-trapping gas. They concluded that more CO2 would mean more heat. Furthermore, for decades they have predicted this trend would change world weather patterns. That is now happening.\Average global temperatures, sea levels, droughts, wildfires, melting sea ice and glaciers, intense storms and floods are all expected to continue increasing. Food and water shortages, which often lead directly to violent conflict, also are predicted to increase.\The insurance industry, as well as other businesses that depend on a predictable environment, should ask Congress to tax CO2 emissions. Make the fossil-fuel companies pay for the damages their product inflicts upon the economy and the environment.\Jerry Lee Miller\Manheim Township\If this winter's polar vortexes and Atlanta's new ice-skating rinks have you doubting whether climate change is real, you're not alone.\In a recent Yale survey, a record 23 percent of Americans now doubt global warming. But, take it from giant oil companies like ExxonMobil and BP and Shell, you're wrong. Big Oil not only believes in global warming, it's factoring it into their business plans.\Shell, along with BP, was among the first oil majors to publicly accept global warming, and by the early 1980s it was incorporating global warming into its internal planning.\""It seemed inevitable that we would decarbonize,"" said its CEO, ""It should be made expensive to emit carbon and other greenhouse gasses. People always think the market will solve all of it. That of course is nonsense.""\Exxon, which once funneled tens of millions of dollars to a climate change denial campaign, has had a change of heart.\""ExxonMobil believes that it is prudent to develop and implement strategies that address the risks to society associated with increasing (greenhouse gas) emissions.""\Exxon has even quietly proposed that the United States levy a carbon tax.\It's time to put a realistic price on carbon emissions.\Lynn Goldfarb\Manheim Township\Is it possible that the Intell/New Era staff directed a reader's letter to the wrong editor?\The Jan. 28 issue contained a letter that I suspect was intended for the Scribbler ""Liars Contest"" column in the same issue.\The reader's letter about carbon emissions said that electric utilities burn 4,576 pounds (2.25 tons) of coal to provide energy for the average Pennsylvania household. That may be true over some time frame.\Further, the reader said one's home ""electricity will put 14,668.78 pounds"" (over 7 tons) of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.\That is a gain of 5 tons and is exclusive of the energy produced or weight of the ash residue.\Of course, if true, the above conversion would be a gross violation of the law of conservation of mass/energy.\Bob Horst\Manheim Township\(Editors' note: The EPA calculates CO2 emissions at .71 metric tons per 1,000 kilowatt hours.

273,"Reading the Your View, ""U.S. has investors, innovators to combat climate change effect,"" gave me hope. The authors provided readers with a list of stakeholders, including scientists, fossil fuel companies, insurance companies and some politicians, who are beginning to take action to mitigate climate change.\It's time now for the American public to put some pressure on our elected officials so they will sponsor or support a revenue-neutral carbon tax. A carbon tax that returns revenue to American households is a market-based solution that appeals to both Democrats and Republicans. It helps us move from carbon-based energy to carbon-free energy, with the added benefits of increased jobs and cleaner air.\Supporting this legislation would be an opportunity to ensure the future health of our planet, our people, and our pocketbooks. It would also be an opportunity for politicians to restore the public's faith in our democracy as they show that they can work together to find a sensible solution to a problem that affects us all.\I join the Your View authors, Cecilia Eberhard, Renate Brosky and William Egbert, in urging you to write to your senators and congressman to ask for action now.\Martha Christine\Bethlehem\Credit: The Morning Call\Credit: The Morning Call"
274," The trends and dangers in the report last week from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change are so vast that they are difficult to grasp. Because it is hard to connect the prospect of global warming over centuries to current policy, it is hard for governments to know what to do.\ The report is the fourth in a series by the United Nations- sanctioned panel since 1990. With each succeeding report, the scientists involved have raised the certainty of their analyses and judgments. That includes the basic finding that human activity has contributed to increases in atmospheric and ocean temperatures.\ The report says that if the burning of fossil fuels and other atmosphere-warming activities continue, annual average temperatures could go up by 3 to 7 degrees Fahrenheit in the current century. If emissions are held at 2000 levels, warming would continue, but at a slower rate, the report estimates. It even could be stabilized.\ There are concerns about glaciers melting and ocean levels rising. These are overall trends. The effects of climate change would be different in different places, and that only underscores the complexity of the panel's undertaking since it was created in 1988. Not only is it difficult to interpret climate evidence going back thousands or millions of years, it is even more difficult to look into the future -- or to assess how and whether political, economic or technological changes today will affect any of it.\ Air pollution harms human health and causes damage to everything from buildings to vehicle paint-jobs. As one of the ""greenhouse gases,"" carbon dioxide has the biggest impact. The United States is the nation with the single greatest ""carbon footprint,"" but in the future, it will be China. It is a difficult political argument to ask a country to undertake costs whose eventual benefits, as uncertain as they might be, would be felt elsewhere.\ Since the rebirth of ecological awareness with the first Earth Day in 1970, calls for environmental action have always been political, even ideological. There also are scientific arguments to make against the finding that humans contribute to climate change, but not as many as there used to be, this year's IPCC report shows. Therefore, the wisest response to the report is this: Even if there are uncertainties about whether future climate change can be predicted or affected, there are good reasons to control pollution and use the Earth's resources wisely.\ So, the United States can't continue to sit by while other countries lead the dialogue. One idea that deserves more consideration is a ""carbon tax"" that would discourage burning fossil fuels and encourage alternatives. It would be better applied as a mutually agreed upon system, rather than assessed across borders like a tariff. If such a system can be fairly and efficiently created, industrial nations like the United States would consume less oil and thereby rely less on unstable supplies from around the world.\ President Bush opened the door to progress in that direction in his State of the Union address last month when he referred to the ""serious challenge of global climate change."" Mostly, he called for voluntary actions, but they can be only the first steps. A strong economy, national security and cleaner air are not mutually exclusive goals."
275,"
Did you enjoy $3 a gallon gasoline last summer? Some members of Congress have plans for a carbon tax that will get you even higher prices.
\
By taxing the carbon content of fuels, they hope to steer Americans toward smaller cars, mass transit and city living and away from SUVs, highways and suburbs. This is an astonishingly bad idea, one that will harm the economy while hitting the poor the hardest. When you think about it, a tax on transportation is a tax on everything.
\
A key reason for our economic success is that Americans have access to a broad market for the things we need and the products we make. The logistics revolution of the past 20 years -- centered on innovations like ""just in time"" production -- reduced manufacturers' costs and contributes to our prosperity.
\
Because our food, clothes and the materials with which we build our homes are drawn from this national market, a tax on fuels is a tax on everything. Raising taxes on everything we buy is a quick way to sicken our economy.
\
Of course, if carbon-tax supporters were proposing a national tax on everything, they'd be laughed out of town as soon as they opened their mouths. Every can of food, every book and every piece of clothing that you buy that wasn't raised next to the store where it was sold will cost more with a carbon tax. The only difference from an explicit ""tax on everything"" is that a carbon tax would be hidden, embedded in the price of everything you bought.
\
There are three kinds of taxes:
\
Progressive taxes, like our income tax's rising rates for higher incomes, take a larger proportional bite from the rich than from the poor
\
Flat taxes take the same proportion from everyone
\
Regressive taxes take a higher proportion of the income of the poor than of the rich.
\
Tax experts debate the relative merits of flat and progressive taxes but there is no case for regressive taxes.
\
A carbon tax would be regressive because poorer people spend a higher proportion of their incomes on energy-related products. On average, families making between $10,000 and $30,000 a year spend 10 percent of their income on energy; families making more than $50,000 spend 3 percent.
\
And finally, Congress isn't smart enough to tax carbon. Carbon tax proponents argue that people buy less of things that cost more. If carbon emissions harm the environment, tax enthusiasts reason that they can get people to emit less carbon by raising the price through a tax. Carbon-tax enthusiasts are vague about how much of a tax to impose. That detail matters a great deal.
\
How much harm does releasing the carbon in a gallon of gasoline cause? No one knows and no one seriously believes an accurate assessment is possible. Set the tax too high and we'll use too little of carbon-based fuels; too low and we'll use too much.
\
We've tried allowing politicians to set energy prices before. The energy price controls of the 1970s produced long lines at gasoline stations, natural gas shortages and Jimmy Carter in a cardigan. We can't afford any of those experiences again.
\
Carbon emissions may be bad for the environment. If they are, cutting carbon emissions is not something to be done on the backs of the poor through a regressive tax nor should it be done by sending the economy into a tailspin through a tax on everything.
"
276,"
To the Editor:
\
As the $789 billion stimulus package attempts to pull our country out of recession, we need to remember our fragile economic condition when addressing climate change -- an issue bound to be a ""hot"" topic this year.
\
Living in rural Pennsylvania almost all my life, I know dealing with climate change is important to protect the environment.
\
However, at a time when we're trying to grow businesses and create jobs, we should adopt a climate change solution that reins in emissions, but doesn't cause more economic turmoil.
\
And more turmoil is inevitable if our country goes with a complex carbon cap and trade program. Mandating companies to buy and sell emissions allowances would be expensive and difficult to monitor. It would nurture more market manipulation and corruption -- something everyone has had enough of.
\
To foster new energy technologies with lesser carbon footprints, our nation needs a stable, growing economy. As our country bares the weight of the sub-prime mortgage and Wall Street crises, we need to steer clear of risky dealings like a cap and trade program.
\
A better policy for coping with climate change would be a carbon tax. This simple, transparent policy would maintain economic stability while reducing emissions and encouraging investment in energy research and development. Sounds like a win-win to me.

277,"Taxes have two consequences. They raise revenue and almost inevitably change our expenditure patterns. Both of these outcomes are often seen as positive by those who advocate a carbon tax.\A carbon tax is levied on the amount of carbon, a key element in carbon dioxide, that emits in the process of producing or using energy. The tax penalizes those who burn fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas because it is levied on the number of metric tons of carbon each energy source produces.\Carbon taxes are designed to address the issue of ""negative externalities."" When energy is used, whether it produces electricity, or for gasoline to power your car, pollutants escape into the atmosphere and create negative externalities. The cost of cleaning up those pollutants is not part of your monthly electrical bill, nor is it paid in the price you pay for gasoline. A carbon tax would increase the price of electricity and gas, thereby incentivizing consumers to engage in energy-saving behaviors, such as adjusting the thermostat, driving less and buying hybrid cars.\Many economists argue that if society wants to reduce air pollution and help lessen the effects of climate change, then a carbon tax is the best way to proceed by creating an incentive to use less energy. It is simple to administer and would reduce carbon emissions in a more efficient way than direct controls from the Environmental Protection Agency and other regulators. The carbon tax discussion is particularly important now because it appears that EPA regulations and enforcement will be reduced under Trump administration proposals.\Several provinces in Canada, as well as countries such as New Zealand, have carbon taxes. Why hasn't the United States moved to establish a carbon tax? First of all, a carbon tax is just that, a tax. Raising taxes is not very popular, especially now. More specifically, many wonder where the proceeds from such a tax would be spent. Would they go to subsidize research on energy-saving technologies, as suggested by Sen. Bernie Sanders? Those familiar with some of the boondoggles that resulted from the grants given in the early years of the federal Energy Department shudder at that idea.\Perhaps, as some suggest, the proceeds from the new tax could make up revenue lost if a proposal to reduce corporate income taxes is enacted. As the United States currently has one of the highest corporate income taxes in the world, the net savings would help stimulate economic growth and create jobs. But some consider a carbon tax to be regressive because it disproportionately affects those with lower incomes. People who make this argument say that lower-income citizens pay a higher percentage of their income for energy and hence the tax is unfair.\Finally, there's an important question of how such a tax would impact employment. A carbon tax might cause some firms to relocate out of the country and take jobs with them. This is why large producers of CO2, such as Russia, China and the United States, have generally been reluctant to initiate carbon taxation. A carbon tax in the United States could hasten a shift in production of some kinds of energy - such as relatively high-polluting coal - to natural gas, thereby negatively impacting employment in some regions of the country.\For these and other reasons in 2014 Australia, one of the first countries to introduce a carbon tax, voted to eliminate it. In fact, Australia's prime minister at the time, Tony Abbott, made the elimination of the tax of $2,260 per metric ton of carbon a major promise in his campaign, claiming it ""damaged jobs, hurt families, didn't help the environment.""\Carbon tax advocates promote it as an effective way to reduce pollutants. It may indeed be so, but as Australia proved, it is no panacea. Attractive as it may be to those who seek an easy answer to carbon pollution, like any other policy recommendation, it needs to be thoroughly examined to ascertain both its intended and unintended consequences. This is especially true given the wide variety of other taxes and policy proposals currently under consideration.\Credit: MICHAEL A. MACDOWELL"

Last week, nearly 700 members of Citizens' Climate Lobby met with 499 members of Congress or staff members in Washington (including Sens. Casey and Toomey, and Reps. Perry, Barletta, Shuster and Dent) to share with them the very positive results of a new economic study designed to evaluate the effects of the carbon fee/dividend program. Proof now exists, regardless of the climate beliefs of the challenger, that a carbon tax makes excellent economic sense for the country.
\
The study, by Regional Economic Models, Inc. (REMI), provides conclusive proof that a carbon tax would
\
- Grow the economy not the government.
\
- Create two million new jobs over the next 10 years, not cost jobs (compared to doing nothing).
\
- Save thousands of lives not waste them prematurely.
\
- Allow the free markets to choose winners not losers.
\
- Be revenue neutral by returning 100 percent of fees collected to families.
\
- Produce only a positive impact on middle and low income families, and begin to save the environment.
\
It is time to put aside the partisan divide and pay attention. REMI has worked for federal and state governments, major universities and international agencies and can easily be located by searching REMI for those interested in the credibility of the study.
\
The 128-page analysis uses the same nine geographic regions used by the federal government for analysis of census data. To review the complete study, search Carbon Tax Study REMI. This tax is not paid by residents -- it benefits residents.

279,"Bravo to U.S. Rep. Conor Lamb, D-Mt. Lebanon, for holding yet another town hall meeting in Green Tree on the evening of Aug. 30. He answered questions from the more than 100 constituents in attendance for nearly two hours on topics that ranged from the environment, to gun control, to health care, to ways to hold the current administration accountable for its actions.\When asked about which features he liked among the variety of carbon tax bills now in Congress, he opined that the best use of the money would be an investment in infrastructure. The Market Choice Act was just such a bill introduced by U.S. Rep. Carlos Curbello, R-Fla., last year, so the idea has bipartisan bonafides.\I don't disagree with the need for infrastructure investment, but we need broad support to make a carbon tax stick. Returning all the money to American households through an equally shared dividend, as the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act does, will put a monthly check in everyone's mailbox and is estimated to cover the higher energy costs of about two-thirds of the population.\Keeping a carbon tax bill simple and transparent will limit complaints about the government taking yet more of our money, which will be important come election time.\Chris Mullin\Mt. Lebanon\Young generations\I have been a reader of the Post-Gazette for decades and usually give a casual glance to the editorial cartoon as well. Although I am often offended by the cartoon satire of Steve Kelley, I just brush it off and go on with my day. I could not remain silent, however, after seeing the cartoon printed in the Aug. 29 edition, which insulted an entire generation of young people in this country.\In his cartoon, Mr. Kelley portrays all young people as only concerned with ""me, myself and I,"" while those of us in the older generations are portrayed as having the good values of ""God, family and country."" Mr. Kelley couldn't be more wrong.\As a mother of four young people and a mother-in-law of one, I know that the millennials and ""Gen-Z""ers among us are more compassionate and caring than most people my age. My daughter-in-law is dedicating herself to finding a cure for throat and neck cancer; my daughter has a career with a nonprofit, working each day to assist those who have fallen through the cracks; and my son is studying psychiatry to help those afflicted with mental illness. All of them care deeply about the planet and the destruction we have done to it, and all care deeply about their fellow humans. All have grown up traumatized by the gun violence in this country. It's unfortunate that we older folks have left the younger ones to clean up so many of our messes.\Maybe Mr. Kelley needs to get to know some young people before he disses an entire generation. I suggest he should begin with Greta Thunberg, the Swedish teenager who just sailed across the Atlantic Ocean into New York Harbor to protest climate change.\Emily Miller\Upper St. Clair\Important technology\After reading the Sept. 4 editorial ""Regulate Plate Readers,"" I couldn't help but recognize how hypocritical it was after reading the Sept. 4 front page headline ""Missing Toddler's Body Found"" about little Nalani Johnson, and how plate readers helped law enforcement trace where her abductor traveled, and ultimately helped them find and recover her body.\Is the editorial board so lost on this vastly important technology, that it can't see the forest for the trees?\Plate-reading technology is only resourced when a crime has been committed, and it is simply another tool in law enforcement's tool box to bring criminals to justice.\Ask young Nalani Johnson's family if they think plate readers are over-reaching.\Francesco Rosato Jr.\Jeanette\A slippery slope\I watched five minutes of depressingly routine news on Sept. 1. I saw a traffic stop in Texas in which a man grabbed his assault rifle on the seat of his car. I saw seven innocents were killed, 22 injured - including what had been the beautiful face of a 17-month-old baby shot in her mouth (Sept. 2 ""Police Identify the Texas Gunman But No Explanation for Rampage"").\I saw a report that Texas laws were expanded - laws designed to make sure that everyone has the nonexistent right to always be able to immediately grab an assault rifle. I listened to former senator Rick Santorum vigorously assert that no laws could possibly have prevented any deaths that occurred in recent years from gun violence. He feared a slippery slope.\The slippery slope is not that every sensible gun control law, overwhelmingly supported by the American people, jeopardizes real, but truly very narrow Second Amendment rights. The real slippery slope is how simple incidents like a traffic stop so often produce slaughter, suffering, fear and carnage in America.\Sanford Neiman\Shadyside"
280,"
Three years ago this week I wrote an op-ed in the York Daily Record about my very first experience at a Citizens' Climate Lobby Conference and lobby day held every year in Washington, D.C. It was titled ""A climate activist finds hope in Washington."" At that time it was the second conference ever held and about 75 people showed from all over the country. I remember being so excited that we were able to meet with 140 congressional offices, and came home really hopeful that we would be able to pass serious climate change legislation that will begin to slow the global warming we are now experiencing. Last week I attended my fourth annual conference, and let me tell you, what a difference three years can make.
\
This year's conference had more than 600 attendees who met with 523 congressional offices over several days. These were volunteers from all over the country who paid their own way to Washington to speak with their own representatives and voice their concern about our warming planet. We do this with gratitude and respect for our representatives. Being a non-partisan organization, we seek to find common ground with everyone, no matter their stance on climate change.
\
We've been going to Washington every year to ask Congress to place a steadily rising price on carbon emissions and return all of the revenue back to every household. This is what economists, both conservative and liberal, have been telling us is the simplest, most effective and fairest way of dealing with the problem of too much carbon pollution in our atmosphere. It's simple; tax the things you want less of and people will switch to alternatives. Instead of building new pipelines and coal plants, investment will shift to less carbon intensive forms of energy and to energy efficiency. But just as important as the carbon tax is the returned revenue. We would like 100 percent of the revenue returned monthly as a dividend to every household. We want to fix the problem without creating a new one, namely harming our economy.
\
To gain a better understanding of how exactly a revenue-neutral carbon tax would affect our economy we looked to the experts. Regional Economic Modeling Inc. (REMI) has been creating economic models for over three decades. They do so in a nonpartisan way for government agencies, educational institutions, nonprofits, consulting firms and industry. REMI's clients include the American Gas Association, AARP, the Nuclear Energy Institute, the National Federation of Independent Business, the National Education Association, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, M.I.T., PWC (formerly Price Waterhouse Coopers), and ICF International. REMI conducted research on a revenue-neutral carbon tax and created a 125 page detailed report for us to take to Congress.
\
REMI findings include:
\
- National employment increases by 2.1 million jobs after 10 years, and 2.8 million after 20 years.
\
- CO2 emissions decline 33 percent after only 10 years, and 52 percent after 20 years.
\
- Due to the decreased pollution, 13,000 lives are saved annually after 10 years, with a cumulative 227,000 American lives saved over 20 years.
\
- $70-$85 billion increase in GDP from 2020 on, with a cumulative increase in national GDP due to a revenue-neutral carbon tax of $1.375 trillion
\
- Size of monthly dividend for a family of four with two adults in 2025: $288, and in 2035, $396. Annually, this is $3,456 per family of four in 2025 ($1152 per capita--children get half dividend).
\
- Biggest employment gains are in healthcare, retail and other services (excluding public administration). This is because people have more money in their pockets to spend, and these industries are labor-intensive, responding to increased consumer spending by creating more jobs.
\
The REMI report is a game changer. It shows that whether or not you even believe the climate is changing and/or we are responsible for it, a revenue-neutral carbon tax is good for our economy. It also makes the whole ""China isn't acting so we shouldn't either"" argument a moot point. Reducing greenhouse gases via a revenue-neutral carbon tax would be good for our economy, regardless of what China or India does. This isn't to say there wouldn't be losers; there will be. Fossil fuels are the definite loser here. But 97 percent of climate scientists say we must drastically reduce CO2 emissions immediately to stave off global catastrophe, so fossil fuels will lose here no matter what. EPA regulations are here, and if legislators really are concerned about how they affect our economy, they should take a look at a revenue-neutral carbon tax. The REMI report busts the myth that we have to choose between a healthy environment and economic prosperity.
\
I know next year's conference will be even bigger. I'm betting over 1,000 CCL volunteers will be back to visit our lawmakers in Washington next year with smiles on our faces to continue the conversation. We're a persistent bunch.

If not carbon tax, what?
\
The editorial ""Carbon caper: Bogus policy"" (Nov. 18 and TribLIVE.com) erred by not offering an alternative method to reduce emissions, ignoring the fact that climate change must be slowed.
\
The editorial claimed a carbon tax will increase prices without reducing fuel usage. Actually, if fossil-fuel prices increase, everyone will cut consumption except the ""1 percent"" who are so wealthy they will continue to heat their jumbo homes, fly their jets and fuel their gas guzzlers.
\
Perhaps the Trib prefers a fairer alternative? Rationing would be fairer to the ""99 percent"" because everyone would get rationing coupons for a normal, nonwasteful lifestyle. Prices wouldn't increase because demand for fossil fuel would drop as the ""1 percent"" start to live a nonwasteful life. Does the Trib support rationing?
\
Nationalizing American coal fields could also reduce emissions, as the government would end coal excavation and terminate coal exports. Does the Trib support nationalization?
\
Taking no serious action to stop climate change, of course, is not an option. I prefer a carbon tax that is remitted to the public in dividends because it gives everyone the freedom to decide individually how to reduce emissions and stops the current system by which thoughtless, wasteful greenhouse-gas polluters pollute our environment for free.

"
282,"The six ""Principles for Global Warming Legislation"" released recently by Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., were notable for what they lacked. There were no specific greenhouse-gas emissions targets. There was no determination on an auction of pollution permits vs. initially giving some or most of them away to polluters. But Ms. Boxer was clear on one thing: There will be no consideration of a carbon tax.\Sure, the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee said, ""We're willing to look at everything."" But she ended that declaration with ""... but we believe cap-and-trade is the way to go.""\Ms. Boxer's principles include enforceable reductions with periodic review. States and localities would be allowed to forge ahead on their own efforts to fight global warming. A transparent carbon market would be established. The proceeds generated by it would fund clean energy technology and assist the transition by consumers, manufacturers, states and localities to a clean-energy economy.\Cap-and-trade regimes have advantages, notably the ability to set a limit on emissions and to integrate with other countries. But they are complex and vulnerable to lobbying and special pleading, and they do not guarantee success.\The experience of the European Union is Exhibit A. Emissions targets were set too high. Too many pollution allowances were given away to industry. The value of a carbon credit plummeted. Companies made windfall profits by charging customers more for energy while selling allowances they didn't need. And the Europeans have not had much success reducing greenhouse-gas emissions. Disputes on the next round of reductions led to the creation of a two-tiered system to appease Eastern European countries fearful of the cost to their industries.\A carbon tax, by contrast, is simple and sure in its effects. Last summer, when gas prices shot up past $4 a gallon, average miles driven dropped significantly, as did energy consumption. Demand for fuel-efficient cars and overall energy efficiency skyrocketed.\If high prices had been the result of a gas tax, that money would have stayed in the United States rather than lining the pockets of oil-rich regimes all too happy to feed the U.S. addiction to fossil fuels. As with a cap-and-trade system, the money generated by a carbon tax could be given back to the American people.\Alluding to the climate-change bill that failed in the Senate last June, Ms. Boxer said that her committee would be ""starting afresh."" What better way to do that than by giving a tax on carbon a fair hearing?"
283,"It's a scary economy we're living in. People are worried about putting food on the table, making this month's rent or mortgage payment, and hoping just maybe they'll have a little extra cash to see a movie this weekend.\Given our economic situation, President Barack Obama's aspiration to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through a carbon cap-and-trade system is misplaced. Focusing on jobs and economic recovery should be priority No. 1.\The state of the environment is not something to take lightly. My enthusiasm for environmental stewardship goes back to my college days when I started my campus' first recycling program. This sophisticated effort involved me sifting through classroom trash and taking the recyclables to a recycling plant. And now, as a father, I want my daughter to grow up breathing clean air and not worrying about pollution.\So agreed, we need to address carbon emissions, but a cap-and-trade system where the federal government sells a capped number of credits for emitting greenhouse gases (chiefly carbon dioxide) is the wrong way to go. For the most part, the problems begin when we get to the ""trade"" part of cap and trade.\All those carbon emission credits could be bought and sold among companies in a complex market run by the same Wall Street speculators at the root of our current economic blight. Such a market would handle millions of trades a day, in a system so complicated it would make hedge-fund speculation seem like simple barter. A cap-and-trade market would be ripe for manipulation by inside players. Prices of emissions credits could be cranked up or down for quick profits -- leading to violent swings in energy prices.\While a cap-and-trade market is too huge and complex for meaningful government safeguards, taxpayers would be stuck footing the bill to create a new bureaucracy to regulate it. In practice, cap-and-trade systems also come down hard on coal-dependent states like ours.\But by far the biggest weakness of cap and trade is that it simply doesn't cut greenhouse gas emissions -- as our friends in the European Union have discovered.\If we want to lower greenhouse gas emissions, and it seems clear by now that America does, there are simpler, more effective ways to accomplish this.\Conservation is one, and Pennsylvania already has a head start. For obvious reasons, our state is aggressively exploring clean-coal technology. And we're right up there with California and New Jersey in supporting tighter limits on motor-vehicle exhaust, which accounts for one third of Pennsylvania's air pollution.\The supposed benefit of cap and trade is that it would apply a financial sanction to carbon emissions and encourage industries to invest in ""green"" energy and cleaner forms of fossil-fuel use. That benefit would be much better delivered by a straightforward tax on all carbon emissions.\A carbon tax is simple -- it applies a set fee per each ton of carbon dioxide a company emits. The tax could be set up almost immediately -- without creating a new trading market or regulatory agency. \Additionally, the carbon tax concept would have 90 percent of generated revenue being returned as tax relief to the people and businesses who use the energy and pay the tax in their utility bills. (Or how about using the revenue to beef up Social Security?) The remaining 10 percent of revenue would be dedicated to climate research and clean-energy technology.\Given the state of our economy, Pennsylvania families and businesses can't afford to suffer the unacceptable costs of an expensive and ineffective cap-and-trade program. But that's not to say that other proposals to deal with climate change should be off the table. Solutions to reduce carbon emissions that don't further weaken the economy, such as a carbon tax, are where we need to shift this conversation.\So, before rushing into cap and trade, let's continue the climate-change discussion. And in the meantime, with the money we're saving by not paying for a reckless climate-change program, maybe check out a movie this weekend."
284,"Even ExxonMobil says climate change is real. So why won't the GOP? \To understand how dangerously extreme the Republican Party has become on climate change, compare its stance to that of ExxonMobil. \No one would confuse the oil and gas giant with the Sierra Club. But if you visit Exxon's website, you will find that the company believes climate change is real, that governments should take action to combat it and that the most sensible action would be a revenue-neutral tax on carbon - in other words, a tax on oil, gas and coal, with the proceeds returned to taxpayers for them to spend as they choose. \With no government action, Exxon experts told us during a visit to The Washington Post last week, average temperatures are likely to rise by a catastrophic (my word, not theirs) 5 degrees Celsius, with rises of 6, 7 or even more quite possible. \""A properly designed carbon tax can be predictable, transparent, and comparatively simple to understand and implement,"" Exxon says in a position paper titled ""Engaging on climate change."" \None of this is radical. Officials negotiating a climate agreement right now in Paris would take it as self-evident. \Republican leaders in the 1980s and 1990s would have raised no objection. But to today's Republicans, ExxonMobil's moderate, self-evident views are akin to heresy. Donald Trump, the leading GOP presidential candidate, says, ""I don't believe in climate change."" Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas says, ""Climate change is not science, it's religion."" Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida at the moment seems to acknowledge that climate change might be real but opposes any action to deal with it. \Well, you may say, Mr. Trump revels in his stupidities, and most of the presidential candidates are appealing to the rightmost wing of their primary electorate at the moment. What about the grownups in the party, such as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky? \Glad you asked. \In an op-ed for The Washington Post published as President Barack Obama traveled to Paris for the opening of the climate talks, Mr. McConnell slammed Mr. Obama's policy for harming the middle class without measurably affecting climate change. \Does that mean, I asked the majority leader's press secretary, that he believes climate change is real, and are there policies he would favor to mitigate the risk? \The spokesman answered: ""While the leader has spoken often on energy and the president's policies, I don't believe he'll have anything new today. And as to the president's policies, the president says he's for 'all of the above.' He got that line from us. But as to his climate proposal and the Paris proposals, I think he's spoken clearly on that in his op-ed. I hope that helps."" \I tried once more: ""So as to whether he believes climate change is real, or would favor any policies to mitigate it, I should just say, declined to answer?"" \I didn't hear back. \A genuine conservative, as Ronald Reagan's secretary of state George P. Shultz has written, would acknowledge uncertainties in climate science but look for rational, market-based policies to lessen the risk without slowing economic growth. A revenue-neutral carbon tax, as in a bill Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., has introduced, fits the description precisely. \What then explains the know-nothingism of today's Republicans? \Some of them see scientists as part of a left-wing cabal; many of them doubt government's ability to do anything, let alone something as big as redirecting the economy's energy use. Almost all of them, along with quite a few Democrats, would rather not tell voters that energy prices need to rise for the sake of the environment. \Their donors in the oil and gas industry encourage their prejudices. Three years ago, Grover Norquist, the Republicans' anti-tax enforcer, said that a carbon tax wouldn't violate his no-tax-increase pledge if the proceeds were returned by lowering the income tax, though he made clear he didn't like the idea.The next morning, the lobbying arm of the oil and gas industry swung into action. ""Grover, just butch it up and oppose this lousy idea directly,"" the American Energy Alliance said. ""This word-smithing is giving us all headaches."" \For most of us, the reaction to this would have been: Butch it up? But Mr. Norquist got the message and within hours issued a clarification: Only a constitutional amendment banning the income tax could justify a carbon tax. \So the industry deserves its share of blame, and that includes ExxonMobil, which hardly trumpets its views on the advantages of a carbon tax. But blaming it all on Big Oil lets the politicians off too easily. Yes, Mr. McConnell represents a coal state, and, yes, he wants to preserve his Senate majority. If those considerations are more important to him than saving the planet, let him say so to our children and grandchildren. Let's not blame the oil companies for the pusillanimity of people who are supposed to lead."
285,"The Armed Forces banners located on Main Street and surrounding streets in New Holland have been giving drivers and walkers inspiration for almost a year and a half.\This summer also has brought lots of construction to Route 23 in New Holland.\So next time you are stuck staring at a flagger stopping traffic, check out the banners to get you through.\Here is my story of how the banners get me through:\I run. I hesitate in calling myself a runner, but I like to run and I get a lot of satisfaction out of finishing a running workout.\I also have four small children, so getting out and moving is not as easy as it might be for some.\So when I get out and start running around town, the banners keep me going.\The John Ressler banner at the corner of Spruce and North Railroad assures me that I can keep going, and when I am doubting myself, the Patrick Morgan family of Marines tells me to get my butt up the hill on North Railroad.\Running up to the school, the banners that line Grandview by the track push me to finish the extra mile, even though it is hot and I am tired.\Leaving the school by Main Street, I look to the left and see my grandfather's banner by the light at Yoder's and I remember that, even though he isn't here anymore, he is still watching me to see where I'll go.\Then when I really feel like stopping, my siblings' banners that line the entrance to the school remind me that I come from a strong family and that I can finish if I really want to.\I make my way down Main Street and, like many mothers, when I get a moment to myself, I start thinking ... what do I want to be when I grow up?\Will I have enough education or expertise to achieve my goals? Will we be able to raise our children to be the best people they can be?\Then I remember that the very idea that I can consider these options is because of all the sacrifices the people on these banners made and continue to make.\The banners of Ed Beck and others remind me to take pride in my surroundings and to try to change what I don't like.\Then there are times when I am feeling sorry for myself because my military husband is away with work, and then banners for Chad Burkhart, Brandon Hardy, Galen Ludwig, Herbert Stauffer and others remind me how small our sacrifices are compared to theirs and their families.\The banners get me through the miles. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.\Allison Cuthie\New Holland\Demons, narcissistic, coward ... every time a newscaster uses words like this in regards to suicide, they may be pushing someone over the edge. Those who are educated in such things would never use such words.\I have seven family members on both sides who have taken their lives. For my sister, it was, ""Go off your medicine and pray. Your faith is weak. You have demons.""\The past few years I experienced loss at a staggering rate. ""God is punishing you. You better get right with God.""\My experience is, it takes courage to commit suicide and a whole lot more courage to seek help.\Learn about DES (Detecting the Early signs of Suicide). For many, the mental becomes physical. I was willing to do anything to make the pain stop.\Would you call a person with liver cancer crazy if they wanted to take their life? No! The stigma around mental illness has to stop.\Thank God for Lancaster General, Philhaven Prince Street and Mental Health America. They saved my life.\Samuel Sherman\Adamstown\Many of us acquired our understanding of justice from the Bible, where the plucky Israelites stood up to the empire no matter the cost. Nowadays, it's the Palestinians who stand tall despite overwhelming forces arrayed against them. Some say God always supports those who call themselves ""Israel,"" but those of us who paid attention to our Bible lessons know that isn't so.\Since 2006, when the people of Gaza chose Hamas to lead them, Israel has by its blockade made war on Gaza. Can we agree Gaza has the right to defend itself?\The U.S. government calls Hamas a terrorist organization, in part because it defends Gaza with crude rockets, which lack guidance systems and are more likely to hit Israeli civilians than soldiers. But it claims Israel, which fires sophisticated missiles at tiny military targets and kills mostly civilians, is fighting fair. Can we agree this kind of morality is a bad joke?\The other accusation against Hamas is that it refuses to recognize Israel's right to exist. Actually, as part of its decision in April to form a unity government with the Palestinian Authority, Hamas agreed to recognize Israel according to the terms of the 1993 Oslo Accords. What Hamas refuses to recognize is Israel's right to exist as a racist nation where Palestinians are legally second class. Can we blame them?\When we look at the events this summer leading up to the war in Gaza, we see that Israeli president Netanyahu used the murder of three Israeli teenagers as a pretext to renew attacks on Gaza, even though he knew Hamas had nothing to do with the crime.\Simple justice requires that Netanyahu be charged with war crimes before the International Criminal Court.\Berry Friesen\Manheim Township\In a recent column, Ad Crable showed how global warming is increasing the number of harmful insects in our area.\Citizens can be grateful that Rep. Joe Pitts understands the serious implications of climate change. In response to a personal letter I wrote to Mr. Pitts, he insisted that the U.S. Congress must take action on climate change now.\In Mr. Pitts' words, the effects of climate change ""are evident in shifting agricultural productivity, forest insect infestations and fires, shifts in water supply, record-breaking summer high temperatures and coastal erosion and inundation. I believe that we must take responsible steps today to ensure a safe and healthy environment for our children and grandchildren in the future.""\Similar to senior statesman George P. Shultz, it's clear Mr. Pitts is concerned about climate change. Shultz recommends placing a price on carbon as a better solution than regulation. Pitts has the opportunity to follow in the footsteps of this eminent former secretary of state and support such a policy.\Citizens can do their part by writing to Reps. Pitts and Patrick Meehan, as well as our senators, to encourage their support of a fee-and-dividend solution.\Importantly, a recent economic report by Regional Economic Modeling Inc. shows that a carbon fee and dividend approach not only limits carbon emissions, but also creates jobs.\A fee and dividend solution is a win-win for all.\Susan Finn Miller\Manheim Township\Taxes: the price one pays to the government for services received. Or in other words, one of the costs of living.\For the operator of a business, taxes are one of the costs of doing business. Like all costs of doing business, taxes are included in the selling price of the goods or services the business provides. Thus, the reality of who pays the taxes ultimately rests with the consumer of goods and services.\Any politician claiming that he or she will require a given industry or business to pay that which the politician calls ""a fair share"" of the taxes necessary for the operation of government-sponsored programs is really taxing the consumer.\Levy the taxes where you will within the production or service chain, but the consumer at the end of the line is the ultimate payer.\The public that demands that its government increase spending, no matter the purpose, must experience an increase in taxes.\Who is the public? The public is comprised of those persons who go to work day in and day out, put food on the table, send their children to school, pay the bills and pay the tax man.\An admonition: Be cautious when selecting the candidate for whom you vote.\Daniel T.

286,"Taxes have two consequences. They raise revenue and almost inevitably change our expenditure patterns. Both of these outcomes are often seen as positive by those who advocate a carbon tax.\A carbon tax is levied on the amount of carbon, a key element in C02, emitted in the process of producing or using energy. It penalizes those who burn fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas because it is levied on the number of metric tons of carbon each energy source produces.\Carbon taxes are designed to address the issue of ""negative externalities."" When energy is used, whether it be to produce the electricity or for gasoline to power your car, pollutants escape into the atmosphere creating negative externalities. The cost of cleaning up those pollutants is not part of your monthly electrical bill nor is it paid for in the price you pay for gasoline. A carbon tax would increase the price of electricity and gas thereby incentivizing consumers to engage in energy saving behaviors like adjusting the thermostat and buying hybrid cars.\Many economists argue that if society wants to reduce air pollution then a carbon tax is the best way to proceed by creating an incentive to use less energy. It is simple to administer and would reduce carbon emissions in a more efficient way than direct EPA and other regulations. The carbon tax discussion is particularly important now because it appears that EPA regulations will be reduced under the Trump Administration.\Several provinces in Canada as well as countries such as New Zealand have carbon taxes. Why hasn't the United States moved to establish a carbon tax? First of all a carbon tax is just that, a tax. Raising taxes is not very popular, especially now. More specifically, many wonder where the proceeds from such a tax would be spent. Would they go to subsidize research on energy-saving technologies as suggested by Senator Bernie Sanders? Those familiar with some of the boondoggles that resulted from the grants given in the early years of the federal Energy Department shudder at that idea.\Perhaps, as some have suggested, the proceeds from the new tax could make up revenue lost if the proposed corporate income tax reduction is enacted. As the U.S. currently has one of the highest corporate income taxes in the world the net savings would help stimulate economic growth and create jobs. But some consider a carbon tax to be regressive because it disproportionately affects those with lower incomes. People who make this argument say that lower income people pay a higher percentage of their income for energy and hence the tax is unfair.\And finally there's an important question of how such a tax would impact employment. A carbon tax might cause some firms to relocate out of the country taking jobs with them. This is why large producers of CO2 such as Russia, China and the United States have generally been reluctant to initiate carbon taxation. And a carbon tax in the United States could hasten a shift in production of some kinds of energy, such as relatively high polluting coal, to natural gas thereby negatively impacting employment in some regions of the country.\For these and other reasons in 2014 Australia, one of the first countries to introduce a carbon tax, voted to eliminate it. In fact Australia's Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, made eliminating the tax of $2,260 per metric tons of carbon a major promise in his campaign claiming it ""damaged jobs, hurt families didn't help the environment.""\The carbon tax has been promoted by its advocates as an effective way to reduce pollutants. It may indeed be so, but as Australia proved, it is no panacea.

If the tax increased annually, the market, not government regulations, would make the switch to clean energy.

289,"
Remember Rio? The Earth Summit? Everyone slamming the United States for balking at international agreements on the global environment?
\
What a difference eight months makes.
\
Today, the United States is the only major industrial nation, except for Canada, to have ratified the treaty designed to limit emissions of greenhouse gases.
\
It is also the only developed nation that has come forward with a significant amount of money - $25 million - to help Third World nations meet the treaty requirements.
\
Representatives of 160 nations signed the climate accord in Rio de Janeiro last June. But it cannot take effect until the parliaments or governments of 50 nations ratify it.
\
So far, only 15 governments have done so.
\
Yesterday, the Clinton administration's new ambassador to the United Nations, Madeleine K. Albright, said the United States believes the world should act with a ""sense of urgency"" on the climate issue. She made her remarks to a U.N. committee working on financing mechanisms to implement the treaty.
\
""As much as we accomplished in Rio, the United States believes that much more can and must be done . . . and the United States wants to help lead this effort,"" Albright said.
\
The irony of America's present position is that the ratification and
\
financial pledges came not under President Clinton, but under George Bush.
\
""America's policy was always better on this than its politics. Under Bush the politics was atrocious,"" said John Topping, president of the Climate Institute, an environmental organization based in Washington.
\
Before and during the Rio Earth Summit, it had been the European nations that had pushed for a stronger climate treaty, over U.S. objections.
\
But to date, no European state - except Monaco - has ratified the treaty.
\
""We are moving toward ratification, but it has gone slowly,"" said Cornelia Quinnet, a German diplomat on the U.N. committee.
\
The ratifying nations include China, Mexico, Ecuador, Canada and Australia. But the rest are tiny countries such as Fiji, the Seychelles, and St. Kitts and Nevis.
\
Japan hasn't ratified. Germany hasn't ratified. Neither has France or Britain.
\
A number of Third World nations, led by India, have said repeatedly that Third World participation would depend on whether the industrial countries took the lead.
\
The treaty is designed to limit emissions of greenhouse gases - gases that might radically alter the Earth's climate by trapping more of the sun's heat in the atmosphere. The bulk of these greenhouse gases comes from burning fossil fuels and from industrial processes - most of which take place in industrialized countries.
\
""At this point, India has adopted a wait-and-see approach,"" said Michael Zammit-Cutajar, the secretary-general of the U.N. office overseeing the climate accord.
\
Part of the Europeans' problem, Quinnet said, is trying to decide whether each nation will ratify on its own or do it together under the 12-nation European Community.
\
If Europe approaches the treaty as a ""community,"" less-developed countries, such as Spain, want to make sure they do not have to bear as big a burden in curbing greenhouse gases as major industrial nations, such as Germany.
\
""It is a lot more difficult if you are 12 than if you are one,"" said Zammit-Cutajar.
\
Germany has already put its own ratification bill through parliament, Quinnet said. She predicted that the Bundestag would approve the treaty by June.
\
The other big global warming idea the Europeans touted at Rio was for a ''carbon tax,"" levied on the carbon content of various fuels. The money would have helped finance energy-efficiency programs in the Third World.
\
""When the economies went flat in Europe, you didn't hear very much about a carbon tax anymore,"" said Scott Hajost, an international affairs analyst with the Environmental Defense Fund.
\
Japan, Norway, Holland, Canada and Australia have all come up with some
\
funds to help countries such as China, India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Thailand and Sri Lanka do the energy studies required under the treaty.
\
But the United States' pledge, made prior to Rio, to provide $25 million over the next two years remains the largest single funding commitment.
\
Now, the Clinton administration has proposed an energy tax. ""This may prod us,"" Quinnet said. ""The more vigorous the United States is, the quicker things will happen"" in Europe.
\
""Our target,"" Zammit-Cutajar said, ""is to have the treaty in force by mid-1994. I think we will meet that.""

290,"There's a dangerous myth that Donald Trump's presidency is too buffoonish to be ranked anywhere on the Chavez-Mussolini scale of authoritarianism, that a commander in chief who spends much of his day curled up in the Lincoln Bedroom rage-tweeting his favorite shows on Fox News Channel may be bad for America's image as a serious nation but that no actual humans were harmed in this production.\To those who believe this, I say: Go to the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation in North Dakota.\At the reservation, the New York Times' Eric Lipton recently found that while surging oil and gas production has brought some much-needed economic benefit to a remote piece of land in western North Dakota, a growing number of tribal members are questioning the trade-off. For example, a $1 million early-childhood learning center was paid for by a pipeline company, but only as a fine for a spill of more than 1 million gallons of polluted fracking wastewater that reached the reservation's main drinking water supply.\When Lipton arrived on the reservation, he found the frigid night sky was a weird orangey-yellow from all the lit flares of oil and gas wells. Not only have flaring emissions roughly doubled during Trump's presidency, but in September, the president's so-called Environmental Protection Agency gutted an Obama-era rule that had been imposed to curb methane and related pollution from well flaring. It was a rule that not only would have aided the fight against climate change - methane is a significant greenhouse gas - but also sought to make the air less foul to breathe for people who live near these wells.\Lisa DeVille, whose family has lived on the North Dakota reservation for decades, told the Times she's been treated for the respiratory sickness known as the Bakken cough because it's been frequently reported by oil-field workers in the Dakotas. ""My children and grandchildren breathe in this air,"" she said. ""How is this going to affect our health?""\Rivaling the tax cut that enriched big corporations and billionaires and caused the federal deficit to soar (but didn't do a darned thing for Wall Street), the Great Environmental Rollback is probably the most consequential policy maneuver of Trump's nearly two years in the Oval Office. In some cases, the measures have meant higher short-term profits for executives saving money on pollution controls, at the cost of long-term damage to the communities where they do business. Other times, like rolling back fuel-efficiency standards for new vehicles, Trump has gone farther than even the industry wanted to go, let alone the public.\And things are likely to get worse in the second half of Trump's term. Over Christmas week, when few were watching, the Times reported that Trump's EPA is now reversing yet another Obama-era rule meant to curb toxic mercury pollution from coal-fired power plants. And this is a case where the ""why"" is arguably worse than the ""what"" - because the administration is claiming that impact assessments should only cover the economics, not the ""cost"" of declining human health. That opens a Pandora's box for all sorts of rulings to make polluters richer amid the din of everyone else's Bakken cough.\Trump's actions go against a consensus that started at the end of the 1960s and has held up all the way into 2019. A 2018 poll conducted by academics from Yale and George Mason University found 56 percent of Republicans - yes, Republicans - are part of a broader U.S. consensus that favors both a carbon tax and curbs on power-plant pollution, even if it causes electric bills to increase.\So how does Trump get away with this literal garbage? While the real beneficiaries of these policies may be a handful of coal or oil executives and their highly paid lobbyists, the president sells it to the millions in his base - somewhere from 35 to 46 percent of the electorate - not on the specific policies (which we've seen they don't like) but on the attitude, or attytood. Trump's reactionary EPA infuriates the Left, the talking heads on CNN, and know-it-all scientists on the East and West Coasts. So therefore it must be making America great again.\Trump voters are destroying their lungs or drinking toxic tea in order to own the libs. Some of them may be laughing all the way to the grave. And while the short-term, devastating health impacts are going to hit the hardest in the communities where less-privileged citizens live, the long-term effects of climate change are going to wallop all of us - especially those kids and grandkids you just showered with shiny new toys over the holiday season and who will grow into a world marred by global warming.\The time to start fighting back is now. A Democratic House can't write new laws, but it can block potential bad ones and use its subpoena powers to expose the ongoing ecological nightmare to the public, setting the stage for a new age of environmental protection to commence in 2021. The clock is ticking - and I don't mean the one counting down to the new year in Times Square.\bunchw@phillynews.com\215-854-2957\will_bunch\ \Credit: By Will Bunch"
291," When President George Bush called for a stronger Clean Air Act, fellow Republican Don Ritter objected. Bad science, the for mer congressman complained.\ When New York wanted to mothball Shoreham, a controversial nuclear power plant on Long Island, Ritter intervened. Bad science, he said of the decision.\ When Congress pushed ahead with the Superconducting Super Collider, Ritter condemned the atom smasher even though Lehigh Valley businesses held contracts worth millions of dollars.\ A Lehigh University metallurgist better known for the 14 years he spent on Capitol Hill, Don Ritter obviously has strong feelings about scientific and environmental issues. Now, he's acting on them -- full time.\ Ritter has created his own Washington, D.C., think-tank called the National Environmental Policy Institute. Ritter is founder and chairman.\ Its focus?\ Good science, spokesman Anson Franklin said yesterday. ""We'll be exploring and promoting rational environmental policy based on good science and sound economics.""\ Ritter has shown no sign of using the institute as a springboard back into the public limelight he left abruptly last November, when he lost his House seat to Rep. Paul McHale, D-15th District.\ Franklin said that will change when the organization formally introduces itself to the public next month. ""It's really a timing issue,"" Franklin said of Ritter's decision so far to decline press interviews on the project. ""We're in the organizational stages.""\ Franklin described the institute as a non-profit, privately funded educational think tank that will not actively lobby lawmakers. By law, former members of Congress must wait a year to lobby their former colleagues.\ ""We're not going to endorse or actively push for specific points of legislation,"" said Franklin. ""We will be actively involved in the issues through education and information.""\ Franklin himself is a registered lobbyist, handling clients such as the Energy Tax Policy Alliance, Illinois Power and the Alliance Against a Carbon Tax. He is also experienced in press relations. He was an assistant press secretary in the Reagan White House.\ The institute is forming an advisory board of congressional, corporate, academic and environmental members, Franklin said. It wants input from Republicans, Democrats and a range of advocates. He describes its ideology as ""radical middle.""\ Ritter's conservative environmental views worked for and against him as a lawmaker in Washington. Supporters at times relied on his keen mind and willingness to take politically incorrect positions.\ In the early 1980s, he teamed with a powerful House Democrat to argue successfully against stricter air pollution laws. But a decade later Ritter was on his own in expressing those views when Congress and the White House favored tougher restrictions.\ But by 1991 Ritter found himself once again in favor on an environmental issue. He argued for federal regulators to prioritize their efforts as a way of squeezing the politics out of environmental decisions while focusing the spending.\ Ritter's push came as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency was studying ways of ranking hazards based on their risks, a concept known as risk assessment."
292,"As Earth Day is again upon us, we must learn from our past environmental mistakes and consider our earth every day. \Protecting our rivers, streams and drinking water is not only vital to our personal health as citizens, but it is also vital to our state and local economies, and to many personal hobbies such as hunting and fishing. \Regardless of your stance on climate change and the human impact on our environment, a tour through Pennsylvania's coal country should serve as a reminder to us all. \During its heyday, a lack of regulation on the coal mining industry resulted in contamination of many miles of Pennsylvania waterways by acid mine drainage. The orange waters of Schuylkill County and western Pennsylvania, the fires under Centralia, and the billions of dollars in environmental clean-up to come are the result of our collective lack of foresight on this issue. \For these reasons, we should encourage our lawmakers to create legislation that collects fees from businesses exposing Pennsylvanians to increased environmental risk and that provides incentives for businesses to do their part reducing their carbon dioxide emissions. We must pay attention and hold accountable those politicians who campaign on promises and do not deliver. \At one point in our state's recent history, a severance tax made sense. Businesses profiting off our state's natural resources have a responsibility to those living here. The businesses promised jobs and low gas prices. Politicians spoke of a severance tax that would help fund education. \Well, those businesses' profits dropped off, the jobs went away, and gas prices are climbing again. The executives continue to receive large bonuses because the businesses remain very profitable - but clearly not profitable enough to maintain the 212,000 jobs promised to our state by businesses that were to begin fracking in 2012. \What we are left with now is the environmental fallout of fracking, such as contaminated drinking water. \A recent scorecard rates our legislators based on their votes to represent the people (bit.ly/LawmakerScorecard). Many legislators listed have not defended Pennsylvania's environment or held businesses accountable for their promises. We must look past partisan politics and put in place people who will represent all of us, people who care enough to stand up to those who are not doing what is best for Pennsylvania. \I believe it is time to pursue legislation to protect Pennsylvania's environmental future. We should ban fracking and create passes for hikers and bikers using state parks. Such passes would ease the financial burden on hunters and fishermen whose license fees are used to protect places such as Middle Creek Wildlife Management Area. We also should increase impact and royalty fees for companies removing and profiting from our state's natural resources. \The Citizens Climate Lobby has proposed an increasing, revenue-neutral carbon fee program that would allow time for individuals and businesses to adjust their consumption. Businesses and individuals would pay a fee based on their greenhouse gas emissions. This program would be revenue-neutral, in that collected fees would be returned to citizens and businesses pursuing environmentally friendly solutions to their energy needs in the form of tax rebates. For example: British Columbia's carbon tax has allowed it to have the lowest personal income tax rate in all of Canada and to reduce the tax burden on small businesses and big corporations alike. \I believe there are great opportunities yet to be pursued to move Pennsylvania to the forefront of the green energy revolution, all while creating a positive impact for the state's environment and the wallets of its citizens and businesses."
293,"
If you want to save the environment, a few sacrifices are in order: Drive a small car that gets 40 miles per gallon, pay a higher tax on coal and oil, plant lots of new trees and stop opposing new nuclear power plants.
\
Those are among the wide range of steps that must be taken soon to temper the perilous ""greenhouse effect"" of rising global temperatures, according to a new report by the Environmental Protection Agency.
\
In his first appearance on Capitol Hill since becoming EPA administrator, William K. Reilly warned that by the end of the next century, average temperature could be ruinously higher if various gases continued their current rate of buildup in the air.
\
If no steps are taken to ""limit the emission of greenhouse gases, the equivalent of a doubling of carbon dioxide is estimated to occur between 2030 and 2040,"" Reilly told the Senate environmental protection subcommittee. The Earth could heat up by as much as 11 degrees Fahrenheit, which would melt glaciers and icecaps, raise the seas to flood-tide levels, alter climatic patterns and poison the air.
\
Scientists have been warning of these consequences for years. Until recently, Reilly said, too few national leaders have heeded the warnings.
\
The report he unveiled yesterday was two years in the making. Ordered by Congress in 1986, it proposes dozens of steps to curb emissions of not only carbon dioxide but also methane, nitrogen oxides and ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).
\
Altogether, these gases - the byproducts of industrial and automotive combustion, refrigeration and air-conditioning - are forming an impermeable envelope that traps heat near the Earth's surface rather than allowing it to radiate into space.
\
It will take an international campaign to solve the problem, Reilly said,
\
because the United States, which contributes about 20 percent of the Earth's gaseous pollutants, cannot do it alone. ""We've got to try to make sure that whatever efforts we undertake are not canceled out by the failure of other nations to also act,"" he said.
\
Even with a massive global effort, he added, the warming trend cannot be halted - only slowed.
\
Reilly said that President Bush had directed him to participate in international programs to phase out CFCs, but that the administration had not taken a position on any of the proposals in the global-warming report.
\
He said steps toward slowing the buildup should include:
\
* A new generation of automobiles that get 40 miles per gallon or better. The trend among motorists, though, is for bigger and more powerful cars. In fact, the Transportation Department relaxed fuel economy standards for the 1989 model year and is considering relaxing them further for the 1990 model year.
\
* The construction of 600 new 1,000-megawatt nuclear power plants around the world.
\
* Improved catalytic converters in new cars to reduce carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides.
\
* Heavy insulation of new and existing homes to conserve oil and natural gas.
\
* A halt to deforestation, accompanied by a worldwide program to plant billions of new trees, which absorb carbon monoxide and convert it to oxygen.
\
* Increased use of solar energy to make it competitive in many areas with electricity generated by fossil fuels.
\
* Development of vast tree plantations to provide wood for burning in steam-powered generators and homes.
\
* A carbon tax of 20 percent on coal, 11 percent on oil and 7 percent on natural gas to encourage conservation.
\
* Elimination of CFCs, which are entering the air as refrigerants and stripping the atmosphere of the ozone that shields people from harmful ultraviolet rays.

294,"Australia has repealed its carbon tax, leaving climate advocates in the U.S. and abroad feeling disheartened. While the repeal has long been anticipated - Prime Minister Tony Abbott campaigned to scrap the tax and has been gearing up to repeal it ever since he took office - it nonetheless strikes at the heart of supporters of a price on carbon. \In a bit of irony, the conservative prime minister's opposition to the carbon tax has been so strident that he actually praised the Obama administration's Environmental Protection Agency regulations - hotly opposed by conservatives in the United States - as ""sensible direct action steps"" Australia should follow. \However, this high-profile carbon tax defeat may not be what it appears. While Australia's carbon tax has become widely unpopular and controversial, British Columbia's carbon tax on the other hand is considered a popular success. What accounts for this difference? \The carbon tax rates for each region are similar, with British Columbia even edging out Australia at approximately $27.9 versus $22.6 (U.S. dollars per ton of carbon dioxide). British Columbia's tax is more broadly applied than Australia's, covering the purchase or use of all fuels within the province. Australia's carbon tax, in contrast, was applied only to the 348 highest carbon-emitting businesses, covering the electricity and mining sectors, but not gasoline use. By these measures, British Columbia has a seemingly more burdensome carbon tax. \Both regions have in recent years strongly supported climate policy, with 68 percent of the Australian public considering global warming a ""serious and pressing problem"" in 2006. That sentiment has all but disappeared in Australia. While there is plenty to say about the role of media and business interests in influencing Australian public opinion of the carbon tax, I think there are two crucial additional insights that explain the difference: \-1) Australia did not have a similar shale gas boom as in North America. Regardless of whether you consider fracking a good or bad thing, electricity prices in North America have been depressed in part due to abundant shale gas, and in part to economic recession. Dramatically rising electricity prices in Australia - due in large part to electricity infrastructure upgrades and other factors independent of the tax, along with the tax - turned the Australian public forcefully against the carbon tax, in a dynamic that does not exist in British Columbia. \-2) More importantly, British Columbia's carbon tax is revenue-neutral, and Australia's carbon tax was not. While wonky, the concept of revenue neutrality is perhaps the single most important factor for explaining British Columbia's success. \By law, British Columbia is required to return every dollar of carbon tax raised back to British Columbians by lowering other taxes. In essence, taxes are shifted away from what you might call ""prosperity taxes"" - like taxes on income and payroll - to taxes on carbon pollution. In practice, British Columbia's carbon tax has actually been revenue negative - cutting more prosperity taxes than raising pollution taxes - with the result that it now has the lowest personal income tax rate in Canada and one of the lowest corporate rates in North America. (As an aside, carbon tax shift opponents argue that it could never remain revenue neutral in practice; highly progressive British Columbia is a notable example to the contrary.) \Shifting taxes from prosperity to pollution has enabled British Columbia to reduce carbon emissions handsomely compared to the rest of Canada, while maintaining a stable economy following recession. The ""shift"" in ""carbon tax shift"" has also cemented this once unpopular tax as a public policy pillar in the province, garnering a commanding 64 percent of public support, according to a 2012 poll. \Although Australia's carbon tax included compensation schemes for electricity users to shield them from excessive costs - which many households benefited from - these schemes caused a lot of confusion. \Compensation schemes are not as transparent as a tax shift, and do not naturally cultivate the low ""prosperity tax"" environment that has now taken hold in British Columbia. \For American climate advocates, this ""Tale of Two Carbon Taxes"" should be heeded when advocating for a price on carbon. Already many unlikely allies are aligned around a carbon tax shift, from activist James Hansen and Citizens Climate Lobby, to ExxonMobil and the free-market Heartland-spinoff R Street Institute. \In practical terms, the repeal of Australia's carbon tax highlights the key role that revenue-neutrality will play in keeping together both the political coalition and public support for a carbon tax in the United States."
295,"Left-wing advocacy group MoveOn.org recently launched a new effort to oppose innovations that are propelling states like Pennsylvania toward a new abundance of locally produced energy. Not only is this helping to fuel America's manufacturing renaissance, but it is also helping to make the United States more competitive in the international energy market, advancing our nation's energy independence and keeping Pennsylvania residents warm in the recent harsh winter weather.\Unfortunately, this anti-development group is pushing activists to work to ban fracking in their local communities, without regard for the benefits that this critical energy resource is doing to help consumers across Pennsylvania and the nation. What are the benefits that would be taken away if Marcellus Shale production was threatened?\Let's start with the environment. According to the International Energy Agency, the United States is leading all developed nations in reducing our carbon footprint since 2006. In fact, increased use of natural gas for electricity generation has led to a 20-year low in U.S. carbon emissions -- without a federal or international carbon tax or cap and trade scheme. While it is important to understand that every energy source, including natural gas, has an impact on the environment, it is increasingly clear that our nation's shale revolution is improving our environment while bolstering our economy.\Speaking of the economy, according to the state Department of Labor, Marcellus Shale development supports over 239,000 Pennsylvania jobs across a range of sectors, from construction and manufacturing to real estate and hospitality. Even more importantly, these are good-paying jobs that are supporting middle-class families in our communities.\But shale development provides more than work for Pennsylvania residents; it also has spurred investment in our communities and families. Gov. Corbett's recently unveiled Energy = Jobs Energy Plan estimates that the oil and gas industries will inject more than $14 billion in investment into the Keystone State's economy by 2020.\Last year, the natural gas industry sent Pennsylvania landowners $1.2 billion in royalty payments, and the state's largest natural gas utilities have saved ratepayers $3,200 each over the past four years through rate reductions. In addition, legislation that Gov. Corbett signed into law in 2012 authorizing impact fees for shale development has resulted in $400 million in revenue in the last two years -- on top of the $1.8 billion in state taxes that the natural gas industry has paid since 2008.\These opportunities are transforming lives for people across the state. Reversing this investment into our communities could be devastating to families across the state and region.\Finally, there is benefit to Pennsylvania's consumers. Recently, The Associated Press found that about two-thirds of Pennsylvanians who heat their homes with natural gas went into the winter season paying the lowest prices in a decade for this time of year, according to rate information from the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission.\Utilities credit the huge volume of gas being produced from the Marcellus Shale formation underneath Pennsylvania for pushing down prices. In most cases, prices this past December were less than half of what they were in December 2008, when the shale boom was just beginning.\Consumer Energy Alliance has long supported expanded use of natural gas as part of a comprehensive energy policy. It is clear that the use of natural gas has helped lower consumer prices and significantly reduced greenhouse gas emissions. For these reasons, the alliance supports the safe production of natural gas through sound development of the Marcellus Shale formation's abundant resources. The Keystone State is uniquely positioned for economic growth for many future generations, and its future should not hang in the balance of potential fracking bans or moratoriums.\That's why we recently asked the co-sponsors of the Statewide Natural Gas Drilling Moratorium Act to withdraw their support for the bill. As a co-sponsor of this potentially harmful legislation, we ask that Sen. Lisa Boscola, D-Northampton, abandon her support of any moratorium legislation or proposals that would ban Marcellus Shale development.\We can all agree that the benefits of properly regulated shale development are too great to sacrifice. These resources can be developed responsibly, so we do not need to choose between either the environment or energy development -- we can have both. Our children deserve a beautiful environment and good economic opportunities. Pennsylvania shale development can bring both! Sen. Boscola, please join CEA and a majority of Pennsylvanians who, according to a recent Franklin Marshall College poll, support the safe development of shale resources in the state.\Mike Butler is executive director of the Consumer Energy Alliance-Mid Atlantic.\Credit: Mike Butler Special to The Morning Call - Freelance\Credit: Mike Butler Special to The Morning Call - Freelance"
296,"Lawmakers put their interests before ours \I applaud all the negative comments by our Pennsylvania House and Senate regarding Gov. Tom Wolf's budget proposal. It's about time our General Assembly does something constructive. Here is the top 10 things on their agenda for the next four years. \1. Get re-elected. \2.

Since the election, few words, and little attention, have been given to the pension crisis. \Gov. Tom Wolf has indicated his intent to be yet another tax-and-spend politician. He wants to increase revenue by eliminating some exemptions while raising both sales and income tax rates. The lion's share of Wolf's largess would go to education. Is this a smoke screen? Or does Wolf choose to simply avoid tackling the problem that may well bankrupt our state? \The need to address state-sponsored retirement plans should be No. 1 on the governor's to-do list. Time is of the essence. \Donald Dempster \Landisville \Time to unite against terrorists \America, Israel, and the rest of the world are waiting for Iran to join us in an agreement that would alleviate our suspicions that Iran is developing a nuclear weapon. For some of us, it seems Iran has been stalling for years, trying to sell us on the notion that its leaders are interested in nuclear development only for peaceful purposes. \Israel has been telling the world it's open to the idea of a Palestinian state under the right circumstances for years, while building settlements in occupied lands. Now we find out that the prime minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, has no intention of allowing a Palestinian state to be created on its border; then he indicates he was just kidding. I'm starting to sense that Netanyahu's harping about statements - coming from Iran and some Palestinian factions - that they want the total destruction of Israel is just a ruse by the prime minister to maintain the status quo. \I'm starting to believe that my country is being played for a fool, and I want these two issues resolved now. No more excuses. \We're going to need all these parties to help the world defeat the Islamic State, which is starting to look more and more like a maniacal, homicidal campaign to outlaw everyone else's opinions and beliefs. \Ben Thompson Jr. \Lebanon \Women deserve better treatment \We've told young women that they can be and do anything but we haven't given them tools to do it. Women can fight for women's rights all they want but it needs to come from both sides; it needs to come from men as well. Men need to fight for equal rights, as much as women do, so that their daughters, wives, nieces, mothers and granddaughters can believe they can do anything they desire. \Women are forced back to the workplace far too soon after having children and are given little flexibility when they return. In balancing child care and careers they often risk reduced pay, career advancement and support. Employers can choose to provide only the limited, unpaid leave benefits mandated under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act. \My female friends are facing very different situations during their recent deliveries and in raising children: One was offered maternity leave a week after she had her baby and only if she agreed to use all of her vacation days first; another was given short-term disability pay for six weeks and chose to take off an additional six weeks unpaid; another will be paid during her time off only for vacation time she has left; and one has a special needs child and faces disciplinary action when she needs to take time off to care for her son beyond her allowed paid sick time. This is only the beginning of where things need to change for women's rights. \It's time for us to accept feminism as empowerment for women to have equal choices in the way they balance their families and careers and for them to be given equal pay and benefits in order to afford that balance. It's about accepting women as equals at work and at home. This is a discussion that is long overdue in Lancaster County, as proven by Tim Stuhldreher's LNP article a year ago (""Women's pay here lags: Earn 59 cents for every dollar a man makes, April 9""). \Brenda Lee Sieglitz \Mount Joy \Leading economists support a carbon tax \I have to take exception to David Marks' letter (""Carbon tax won't save planet or jobs,"" March 19). \I don't see any connection between a carbon tax such as Jerry Lee Miller of Citizens' Climate Lobby is proposing (""A plan to create jobs and reduce greenhouse gases,"" March 11) and the Affordable Care Act. The Affordable Care Act is a government program, whether it is run by the state or the federal government. The carbon taxes being proposed are not. There are several carbon tax proposals: one from Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I.; one from Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md.; and one from Citizens' Climate Lobby. They all put a price on carbon and rebate the collected taxes in some fashion. \I am in the middle of a three-semester economics course from Columbia University, taught by Jeffrey Sachs, a noted economist who has worked mostly on the right side of the aisle. We have discussed a carbon tax in general, but not these three proposals in particular. Along with N. Gregory Mankiw from Harvard, James Hansen from NASA and dozens of economists from both sides, Sachs says pretty much the same thing. Putting a price on carbon is one of the first things we need to do. That won't be the end of the problem, but it is the best way to start. \The jobs are there, the health benefits are there and a clean environment can be there if we do something. Hundreds of the world's best economists and climate scientists agree that this is the way to start. Why isn't Congress doing something? \Jim Sandoe \Ephrata \Union contributors seek only fairness \Regarding David Nace's letter (""Gov. Wolf is helping unions, not seniors,"" March 17), I feel the need to respond to his anti-union rhetoric. \Nace points at the voluntary union contributions to Gov. Tom Wolf's campaign with disdain. These dollar amounts pale in comparison with the big-business and corporate contributions to ex-Gov. Tom Corbett's campaign. \Pension reform continues to be a hot topic. As usual, Republicans fail to mention who is really responsible. Our so-called leaders failed to contribute the state's share to the pension fund and foolishly invested our money in a rapidly declining stock market, losing even more pension funds. \As far as the increased sales tax is concerned, in my opinion it is the most fair method to evenly spread the burden of raising state revenue. \Finally, to the suggestion that union workers are rewarded for supporting a candidate (I'm certain corporate contributors would never expect any kind of reward), I offer the following: If working for a decent wage and having benefits with the expectation that after a lifetime of labor, workers can retire with a pension that will sustain a decent standard of living, then I would consider that a ""reward."" \Dave Schober Jr. \Lancaster"

298,"
A panel of national business and environmental leaders is recommending that President-elect Bill Clinton support a $1-per-gallon gasoline tax and a $30-a- ton ""carbon tax"" on fossil fuels as part of his economic policy.
\
The recommendations are part of a rigorous agenda the panel is proposing for the new administration on the eve of Clinton's economic summit, set to begin Monday.
\
In its 169-page report, scheduled to be released tomorrow in Washington, the National Commission on the Environment makes detailed recommendations on the economy and environment.
\
Two years in the making, the recommendations by the private advisory committee will test Clinton's campaign promises of being both ""pro-growth and pro-environment.""
\
The gasoline and carbon tax are the panel's most controversial recommendations. The commission recommends that both be phased in over a five- year period, saying they would rapidly reduce harmful air emissions, generate new revenues and spur the development of cleaner technologies.
\
Although candidate Clinton said he would ""consider"" a carbon tax - affecting coal, oil and natural gas - and spoke frequently of the need to reduce auto pollution through better fuel efficiency, the commission's recommendations for hefty taxes far surpass Clinton proposals.
\
Release of the report was timed to precede Clinton's economic summit, set for Monday and Tuesday in Little Rock. While the report's authors hope it will
\
serve as a centerpiece in the economic-policy discussions, Clinton assuredly will be exposed to its contents in other venues as well.
\
Two of the commission's members, Madeleine M. Kunin and Alice M. Rivlin, are on the Clinton transition team. Kunin, the former governor of Vermont and a long-time adviser to Clinton, has been rumored to be in line for the job of Environmental Protection Agency administrator. Rivlin is a former head of the Congressional Budget Office.
\
Other members of the 19-person bipartisan commission include four former EPA administrators, the chief executives of Aluminum Co. of America and Southern California Edison Co., the chairman of the executive committee of BankAmerica Corp., representatives of some of the nation's leading environmental organizations, educators and scientists. It is chaired by former EPA chief Russell E. Train, chairman of the World Wildlife Fund.
\
""Long-term growth depends on a sound environment, and resources to protect the environment will come from economic strength,"" said the report, which is entitled ""Choosing a Sustainable Future.""
\
In many respects, the issues addressed in the document echo themes of the Clinton campaign. The report calls for ""making the marketplace work for, instead of against, environmental protection.""
\
""We reject the false dichotomies of 'people versus nature' or 'jobs versus the environment,' "" Train said before the report was released. ""Unless this country takes bold steps now to marry environmental and economic prosperity, the risks of continued environmental deterioration and long-term economic decline are grave.""
\
The report also recommends:
\
* Tax policies and incentives to foster research and development of environmentally safe technology. ""The first target of new technologies in the United States must be energy use and production,"" the report noted.
\
* Pollution prevention should take priority over pollution control. Environmental regulation focused on ""end-of-the-pipe cleanup"" should be replaced by incentives that encourage pollution prevention.
\
* Elevation of the EPA to cabinet status, consolidation of various congressional committees dealing with environmental issues to eliminate overlapping jurisdictions and preparation of a national environmental strategy that sets long-term objectives.
\
* Environmental costs should be incorporated into economic data. The social costs of pollution and loss of resources rarely are calculated when measuring job creation or economic growth. The commission specifically recommended an end to water subsidies for Western farmers, which keep agricultural-production statistics high but are wasteful and are destroying valuable aquifers in the region.
\
In a sharp break with Bush administration policies, the commission urged that the United States take an active role in global environmental programs, especially those aimed at reducing population growth.
\
""The most critical need facing the world today is the control of human numbers,"" the report noted.
\
The commission recommended that international population-assistance funding be increased from its current level of about $350 million to $650 million next year and $1.2 billion by 2000.
\
In the 1980s, the Bush administration sharply cut funding to international family-planning agencies because some offered abortion services.
\
""We envision a world in which human numbers are stabilized, all people enjoy a decent standard of living through sustainable development, and the global environment is protected for future generations,"" the report said.

Early in December. the United Nations hosted a climate change conference in Copenhagen. The global summit was held as a follow-up to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol in Japan.
\
Recognizing that not everyone believes global warming is a reality despite the science that has been gathered to support such theories, the question arises: Why have so many countries pledged their support to prevent global warming?
\
Nations around the globe have come together to discuss this topic and identify what alternatives are available for our planet as global temperatures continue to rise. The U.N. is demonstrating its commitment by setting up an operating fund for richer nations to contribute billions of dollars to help poorer countries deal with the effects of global warming.
\
The United States led the U.N. conference in developing a global accord that not only acknowledges the issue of global warming but develops a key framework on how to proceed so carbon emissions can be reduced and global warming prevented.
\
Although much evidence and scientific data have been gathered, people disagree on whether global warming is an issue or not. Ultimately, time will tell.
\
Those who believe global warming is real and man-made have advanced strong scientific arguments that climate change is endangering our planet and humans as a species. Others believe that mankind cannot have an effect on the environment that is permanent or lasting, especially on a global level. Each side has its dyed-in-the-wool advocates.
\
As much as this may be a philosophical discussion for the hosey or local club, it has nevertheless become a real concern for 193 countries that were represented at the Copenhagen conference. Rather than try to resolve the debate, a more appropriate response for all would be to reflect more profoundly on how it may impact us at the local level. A primary example on whether or not human activity can have an effect on the environment is clearly demonstrated on a regional level here in the anthracite region.
\
Anthracite mining clearly validates the fact that man can have a major impact on the environment and our planet. In looking at the area comprised of Carbon, Columbia, Dauphin, Luzerne, Lackawanna, Northumberland and Schuylkill counties, one need only look to the devastation of our rivers, streams and tributaries to see what type of impact man can have on his own environment.
\
Many regulatory controls are now in place to prevent such environmental impacts due to mining, and these controls have limited the negative impact. Those of us who live in this region can attest to the impact our activities have had on the environment.
\
One need only look at the nearest orange stream, high walls and waste coal banks for the answers. Global warming is a result of man's continuing activities on a planetary level which, along with natural events, contribute to the overall warming of the planet.
\
It will be another 20 to 40 years until we know who is right. By that time, we may be past the tipping point if the global warming theorists are correct. If they are not correct, then we continue on without concern for the future of the world. Climate change is like the proverbial Sword of Damocles hanging over our generation's head with impending and ever-present danger for believers and non-believers alike.
\
What consequences can we expect at local levels? How may we benefit or lose from the scenarios now being promulgated by a worldwide scientific body? Can our area actually take advantage of the current set of circumstances being promulgated on climate diplomacy by the U.N.?
\
These are very complex questions, and they require a fundamental understanding of the political forces that are now driving the Copenhagen Accord. A good basis for this understanding can be found in a recent discussion by leading climatologist Dr. James Hansen on Democracy NOW. Dr. Hansen, considered one of our nation's leading climate scientists, heads the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies.
\
Hansen's interview is a thoughtful and insightful discussion on global warming, the science behind it and what the outcomes of the Copenhagen Accord mean. Hansen is not totally in agreement with the U.S. approach currently circulating through Congress on a cap-and-trade carbon emissions policy. He believes that a tax on carbon would be a better policy that would have a more immediate and lasting impact.
\
Cap-and-trade is essentially an environmental policy tool. In its simplest form, it requires a mandatory cap on the amount of carbon dioxide that can be released into the atmosphere by power plants and other entities that emit carbon into the atmosphere. The trade component is based on permits issued to each company or generator of carbon with an allowable limit.
\
Companies that exceed limits must buy emission credits from other companies or sources that pollute less and have excess credits to trade or sell. A carbon tax would require that any generator of carbon be taxed for each metric ton of carbon generated by the polluter. As any casual observer can see, either policy is going to have major impact on companies that emit pollutants into the atmosphere and the U.S. economy.
\
Anyone who is interested should consider taking a few moments to go to Democracy NOW to view Hansen's interview and discussion on this very thorny subject. The video can be found at:http://www.democracynow.org/2009/12/22/leading_climate_scientist_james_hansen_on.

To carbon tax or not to carbon tax -- that is the question dogging the Obama administration, which says it has no intention of getting its hands dirty in this messy business while other observers say otherwise.
\
""That is the ultimate goal of this president,"" says Sen. David Vitter of Louisiana, the ranking Republican on the Environment and Public Works Committee. But White House press secretary Jay Carney says the Obama administration has ""no intention of proposing"" a carbon tax, which would affect coal, oil and power plants, The Hill newspaper reports.
\
Keep in mind that the same administration was against the odoriferous United Nations gun treaty last year -- before it was for it.
\
A carbon tax would be especially devastating for Pennsylvania, the fourth-leading coal-producing state in the country. According to an analysis reported by the Pennsylvania Manufacturers' Association, such a levy on natural gas, electricity and gasoline could reduce manufacturing output among energy-intensive businesses by 15 percent.
\
Additionally, it would cost the state the income equivalent of up to 122,000 jobs by 2023. Hardest hit would be the state's coal sector, which would lose up to 54 percent in economic output, based on the study.
\
Analysts say Congress has little appetite for a carbon tax -- for now. Whether it's called a ""carbon tax"" or something else, it would be an economy killer in Pennsylvania and for the rest of a recovery-weary nation.

303,"What have future generations ever done for us?\They have lent us the planet. We didn't inherit it from our ancestors. We borrowed it from our children, and we risk returning it in worse condition, since we face an impending crisis brought on by climate change.\The American Association for the Advancement of Science's recent report on global warming states that destructive climate changes are happening now, including a risk of highly damaging and irreversible changes. The latest report from the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warns that we have a ""carbon budget"" that, at current rates of emission, will be exceeded in a few decades, leading to warming beyond the 2 degrees Celsius that scientists tell is, if not safe, at least manageable. Our world is already seeing the disastrous effects of climate change, and things will get much worse.\The fossil fuel industry knows it. The five major oil companies and two dozen of America's biggest corporations are making business decisions anticipating a carbon price to be an inevitable part of their financial future, making climate change a budget reality. Exxon Mobil, which had funded research to discredit climate science, now acknowledges the contribution of greenhouse gas emissions to climate change.\The insurance industry knows it and provides consensus that climate change is happening. All use it in their models. R Street Institute, a public policy research organization focused on insurance, energy and environment, declares that governments have a role to play by assigning a cost to carbon and other pollutants.\Republican leaders know it. Last August four former Environmental Protection Agency administrators presented ""A Republican case for climate action"" in a New York Times op-ed. They served Republican presidents, but their message transcends party affiliation: ""The United States must move now on substantive steps to curb climate change,"" adding, ""A market-based approach, like a carbon tax, would be the best path to reducing greenhouse-gas emissions.""\We know it. Surveys of almost 20,000 residents in 46 states reveal that a majority of Americans agree global temperatures are rising and that human actions are part of the cause. More than 60 percent in every state, according to public opinion polls, favor government-imposed limits on greenhouse gas emissions from businesses and power plants.\The good news is that we in the U.S. have the investors, innovators and problem-solvers to act now to reduce the changes that are projected. However, this challenge requires the support of us all, as the solution will be transformative -- the gradual transition from carbon-based fuels as our primary source of energy to carbon-free energy sources. Our country has faced many grave challenges, and we have proven we can be world leaders in addressing them.\Economists believe we can transition to carbon-free energy sources while sustaining economic prosperity. A market-based solution that puts a tax on carbon and gives the revenue back to the people rather than the government has nonpartisan support. A well-designed carbon tax that recycles revenue back to households and into the economy would protect families from rising costs and actually add jobs. A recent study by Regional Economic Models Inc. found that a carbon tax in California would increase the state's economy and add hundreds of thousands of jobs, provided the revenue is returned to the residents either as tax cuts or direct payments.\What have future generations done for us? They give us hope. We are inspired to return the planet to them in at least as good condition as when we got it. As grandfather used to say, always return something in better condition than when you borrowed it. While it may be true that the planet itself does not depend on us for survival, we certainly depend on the planet for our survival.\We need to take personal and societal responsibility now to mitigate the damage of climate change. We need to recycle, conserve energy and use more fuel-efficient vehicles, but more important, we need to demand from our leaders policies that will address this on a national scale, whether by a revenue neutral carbon tax or other national solutions. Contact your members of Congress today, tell them about your concern for the environment, and ask for action now.\Cecilia Eberhard of Salisbury Township is co-leader of the Citizens' Climate Lobby Lehigh Valley; Renate Brosky of Whitehall Township and William Egbert of Bethlehem are members of the group.\Credit: Cecilia Eberhard, Renate Brosky and William Egbert Special to The Morning Call - Freelance\Credit: Cecilia Eberhard, Renate Brosky and William Egbert Special to The Morning Call - Freelance"

There is only one meaningful response to the horrific oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and that is for America to stop messing around when it comes to designing its energy and environmental future. The only meaningful response to this man-made disaster is a man-made energy bill that would finally put in place an American clean-energy infrastructure that would set our country on a real, long-term path to ending our addiction to oil.
\
That is so obviously the right thing for our environment, the right thing for our national security, the right thing for our economic security and the right thing to promote innovation. But it means that we have to stop messing around with idiotic ""Drill, baby, drill"" nostrums, feel-good Earth Day concerts and the paralyzing notion that the American people are not prepared to do anything to change our energy mix.
\
This oil spill is to the environment what the subprime mortgage mess was to the markets -- a wake-up call and an opportunity to galvanize a constituency for radical change that overcomes the powerful lobbies and vested interests that want to keep us addicted to oil.
\
If President Obama wants to seize this moment, it is there for the taking. We have one of the worst environmental disasters in American history on our hands. We have a public deeply troubled by what they've seen already -- and they've probably seen only the first reel of this gulf horror show.
\
And we have a bipartisan climate/energy/jobs bill ready to be introduced in the Senate -- produced by Sens. John Kerry, Joe Lieberman and Lindsey Graham -- that would set a price on carbon and begin to shift us to a system of cleaner fuels and greater energy efficiency, and unlock an avalanche of private capital to the clean energy market.
\
American industry is ready to act and is basically saying to Washington: ""Every major country in the world, starting with China, is putting in clear, long-term market rules to stimulate clean energy -- except America. Just give us some clear rules, and we'll do the rest.""
\
The Kerry-Lieberman-Graham bill is an important step in that direction. It is far from perfect. It includes support for more off-shore drilling, nuclear power and concessions to coal companies. In light of the spill, we need to make this bill better. At a minimum, we need much tighter safeguards on off-shore drilling.
\
There is going to be a lot of pressure to go even further, but we need to remember that even if we halted all off-shore drilling, all we would be doing is moving the production to other areas outside the U.S., probably with weaker environmental laws.
\
Somehow a compromise has to be found to move forward on this bill -- or one like it. But even before the gulf oil spill, this bill was in limbo because the White House and Senate Democrats broke a promise to Graham, the lone Republican supporting this effort, not to introduce a controversial immigration bill before energy. At the same time, Obama has kept his support low-key, fearing that if he loudly endorses a price on carbon, Republicans will be screaming ""carbon tax"" and ""gasoline tax"" in the 2010 midterm elections.
\
Bottom line: This bill has no chance to pass unless Obama gets behind it with all his power, mobilizes the public and rounds up the votes. He has to lead from the front, not the rear. Responding to this oil spill could well become the most important leadership test of the Obama presidency. The president has always had the right instincts on energy, but he is going to have to decide just how much he wants to rise to this occasion -- whether to generate just an emergency response that over months ends the spill or a systemic response that over time ends our addiction. Needless to say, it would be a lot easier for the president to lead if more than one Republican in the Senate was ready to lift a finger to help him.
\
Our dependence on crude oil is not just a national-security or climate problem. Some 40 percent of America's fish catch comes out of the gulf, whose states also depend heavily on coastal tourism. In addition, the Chandeleur Islands off the Louisiana coast are part of the Breton National Wildlife Refuge. It was created by Teddy Roosevelt and is one of our richest cornucopias of biodiversity.
\
As the energy consultant David Rothkopf likes to say, sometimes a problem reaches a point of acuity where there are just two choices left: bold action or permanent crisis. This is such a moment for our energy system and environment.
\
If we settle for just an incremental response to this crisis -- a ""Hey, that's our democracy. What more can you expect?"" -- we'll be sorry. You can't fool Mother Nature. She knows when we're just messing around. Mother Nature operates by her own iron laws. And if we violate them, there is no lobby or big donor to get us off the hook.
\
No, what's gone will be gone. What's ruined will be ruined. What's extinct will be extinct -- and later, when we're finally ready to stop messing around, it will be too late.
\

305,"
Thanks for your June 4 editorial ""EPA rules overdue"" and thanks to President Obama for taking a leadership role on the climate change issue by reducing the amount of greenhouse gases causing our planet to warm.
\
The rules do not go far enough, but they are a step in the right direction.
\
Republican detractors in Congress who dislike the rules can introduce a free-market approach to dealing with the problem, a steadily rising, revenue-neutral carbon tax that returns 100 percent of the revenue back to every household equally.
\
Some deride EPA regulations as ""job-killing.""
\
I would say ""How about creating jobs that aren't planet-killing?""
\
We need sustainable, clean-energy jobs that improve society, not pollute it.
\
A revenue-neutral carbon tax would boost the economy by putting money back in the hands of those who spend it, the consumers, with an added benefit of lowering emissions and cleaning up our air.
\
A border tax adjustment on imports coming from countries without similar carbon pricing would protect American businesses and encourage these countries to put a price on carbon as well.
\
Siding with polluters and attacking the rules coming from the agency whose mission is to ""protect human health and the environment"" is not a winning strategy for members of Congress, our children, or our climate.
\
They should focus on alternative, free-market solutions to the problem instead.

306,"TO THE EDITORS:\President Obama's State of the Union message included a challenge to make the conversion to clean, renewable energy follow the template of the ""race for space"" from my childhood.\In that situation, everyone from our NASA scientists down to the kids on my block, threw their support into the task. We all took pride in putting the first man on the moon.\Today, the stakes are even higher: No less than ensuring a viable environment for our nation, for the world, for all species on Earth and for generations into the future.\Some members of Congress might not be aware that already a plan is in the formative stages that uses the natural forces of our open market economy to achieve this goal. It is not cap and trade, but ""fee and dividend.""\How it works is: CO2-creating energy producers are charged a fee for the amount of CO2 pollution generated by their processes, at the sources of materials withdrawal. This money offsets the cost increases that companies might pass on to consumers, since the collected money fund is distributed across the board, equally to all citizens in the form of a dividend.\The goal is to make it more appealing and cost-effective to research and produce clean, renewable energy than the climate-destroying fossil-fuel energy.\Between the record heat and numerous climate-related disasters that unfolded in 2012, it's clear that our nation must take steps to reduce the greenhouse-gas emissions that are warming up our planet.\Lacking a legislative solution, the president will turn to regulation.\Republicans, who abhor regulation, should answer the climate challenge with the free-market approach of a revenue-neutral carbon tax. I think ""fee and dividend"" fits. Exxon, Shell and BP have expressed support for a price on carbon.\What's holding Congress back? Many conservative economists support a revenue-neutral carbon tax, including Art Laffer, economic adviser to President Reagan, and Greg Mankiw, economic adviser to President George W. Bush and candidate Mitt Romney.\Stated another way, returning revenue from a carbon tax to consumers would speed the transition to clean energy without inflicting economic pain on American households. Border-adjustment tariffs on goods from nations that don't price carbon would protect American businesses and give other countries a strong incentive to follow our lead.\Toveah Mirot\Lancaster"
307,"Gov. Tom Wolf wants to cut carbon emissions from the electricity sector by joining the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), a cap-and-trade system across 11 Northeastern states that puts a price on carbon emitted by their electric power plants. Members of the business community are skeptical because pricing carbon will raise electricity prices for households and businesses. (The state estimates that auctions of RGGI emissions rights will raise some $300 million a year in revenue.) Republicans in the state legislature are skeptical, too. If they win the governorship in 2022, then they could withdraw from RGGI, meaning that the next few years will be filled with exactly the kind of uncertainty that paralyzes business investment and economic growth.\There might be a way to avoid all this drama, a way to make progress on climate change that respects the budget constraints facing Pennsylvania households and businesses. It’s faster and stronger than RGGI, and in the long run, it will reduce regressive taxes on electricity. Accomplishing all that may sound impossible, but it might be done with a simple tax reform two-step.\The first step is to cut taxes: eliminate the state’s 5.9% gross receipts tax on electric utilities. Although this tax is formally levied on the utilities, they pass the tax along to consumers. (If you need convincing, just look at your bill.) Eliminating this tax will save taxpayers some $900 million a year, according to the state Tax Compendium.\The second step — and this is where the carbon reduction happens — is to impose a carbon tax on electric utilities in Pennsylvania based on the carbon content of the power they deliver to customers. A carbon tax of $20 per metric ton of CO2, for example, amounts to about 2 cents per kilowatthour of coal-fired power, half that for natural gas, and nothing for wind, solar, hydro, or nuclear power. That’s more than double the carbon price that’s likely to come from RGGI, where prices are stuck in the single digits. (At least one RGGI state, New York, is considering layering an additional carbon price on top of RGGI.)\Putting a strong price on carbon will give utilities a financial incentive to speed up the shift to renewables. Until that shift is complete, though, utilities would have to pay the carbon tax, a burden that would likely get passed along to customers. As it turns out, a $20 carbon tax on electricity in Pennsylvania would generate about $900 million a year. In the short run, then, you’d move one step forward and one step back: $900 million in carbon taxes instead of $900 million in gross receipts taxes.\As time passes, though, the carbon tax will push utilities to shift away from fossil fuels. If and when they do so entirely, there will be no more electric-sector carbon emissions, and consequently, no more $900 million in tax revenue. That’s a long-term victory for taxpayers, especially low-income households. It’s doubly good for emissions reductions: carbon-free electricity is a huge win, and electrifying other sectors like transportation will be easier if electricity is cheaper. It’s also a manageable budget problem for state legislators. Pennsylvania’s General Fund takes in over $30 billion in taxes every year, so they’ll have to adjust to a long-run revenue loss of about 3%. (That’s roughly equal to the value of the state’s sales tax exemption for groceries. While taxes on groceries disproportionately burden the poor, taxes on residential electricity are even more regressive.)\Republican legislators could pass this tax swap as part of a package deal that also blocks RGGI, for example, by requiring legislative approval to join. Democrats, including Gov. Wolf, could support it as a way to supercharge climate action while also cutting regressive taxes. The business community would get a policy environment with less uncertainty and more efficiency. It’s not a free lunch, but it’s pretty close.\Yoram Bauman is an environmental economist who focuses on state-level climate policy. Will Delavan is an associate professor of economics at Lebanon Valley\College."

Democrats need to heed the commonsense argument against their long-held dream of a carbon tax -- and for American prosperity -- that Heritage Foundation chief economist Stephen Moore laid out in a recent Senate hearing.
\
Writing in The Washington Times, Mr. Moore recounts what he told the Committee on Environment and Public Works. In response to a question from Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., he said he'd consider a carbon tax only if its Democrat proponents were willing to implement a flat tax of 17 or 18 percent on income and end double taxation of savings and investments.
\
Moore doubts that's what carbon-taxing Dems have in mind. He says they want to end fossil-fuel production -- despite the shale-energy boom lowering gasoline prices, cutting dependence on foreign oil and ""producing more jobs on net than all other industries combined from 2009 to 2013"" -- and fund ""green"" boondoggles like Solyndra that even Google scientists now say hold out ""false hope"" of staving off ""catastrophic climate change.""
\
A carbon tax, cap and trade, environmental regulations targeting power plants -- all Democrat ideas -- ""would do severe damage to the economy"" during the slowest recovery since the Great Depression, according to Moore. He says America's top priority ""must be to accelerate economic growth and raise incomes"" -- which a carbon tax would prevent.

310,"New York State has become the country's most intense battleground in the fight over unconventional natural-gas drilling, known as fracking. Now anti-fracking activists in the Empire State are claiming a victory. They ought to think twice about what they are wishing for.\Those who would ban fracking or regulate it into oblivion ignore the exceptional benefits that inexpensive natural gas can provide in the biggest environmental fight of our time -- climate change.\After four years of review, state regulators opted for another round of public-health analysis before they permit new unconventional wells. More analysis will probably trigger another public-comment period, even though the state has already taken in nearly 80,000 comments.\Why more delay? Among other things, Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) and other officials say that environmentalists have threatened to sue the state if it permits fracking. Mr. Cuomo argues that a thorough environmental and health review will make the state's eventual fracking rules more resistant to legal challenges. ""Months or years of litigation may be avoided,"" Mr. Cuomo said.\We are in no position to judge what combination of politics and legal judgment pushed New York toward this latest delay, and we're all for making sure that fracking is safe. Fracking involves pumping a mixture of water and chemicals deep underground to free trapped gas, and it should proceed with due care and proper regulation. The federal Interior Department and Environmental Protection Agency have proposed some sensible rules.\But anti-fracking activists who hope delay begets delay and eventually prohibition are doing the environment no favor. Burning natural gas produces only about half the carbon emissions as burning coal, which produced 42 percent of America's electricity in 2011.True, half the emissions does not mean no emissions. But the United States does not have to eliminate its carbon footprint all at once, nor should it. Doing so would cost far too much. Instead, natural gas can play a big role in transitioning to cleaner energy cheaply. A recent analysis from Resources for the Future, a think tank, shows that low, fracking-driven natural gas prices combined with efficiency measures and a serious carbon tax would result in a massive increase in the use of natural gas, nearly eliminating America's coal dependence by 2035.\Renewable technologies would have time to lower costs and address other hurdles to widespread deployment before picking up more of the load later.\Environmentalists, in other words, should hope fracking is safe -- and permitted."

Cohen, a fanatical fly fisherman and former aide to Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, thinks that President Trump is moving the Republican Party to the wrong side on the environment.\Not only has Trump - who once tweeted that climate change was a Chinese hoax - proposed slashing the Environmental Protection Agency, on Tuesday he also is expected to sign an executive order to undo former President Barack Obama's signature plan to curb global warming.\Cohen and other Republicans say it is wrong to assume that Trump has their backing on the environment.\""The Republicans got into this game very early and are still in it,"" said Cohen, now a business ethics professor at Temple University. He notes that Theodore Roosevelt was the prime mover behind the National Park Service and that Nixon established the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970.\Cohen is particularly incensed that Trump has called for the EPA budget to be cut back to a Nixon-era level of funding, and that climate change is still being denied, despite ""overwhelming"" scientific evidence to the contrary.\""I don't want this to be a partisan issue. That's a mistake,"" Cohen said. ""We all breathe the same air and drink the same water,"" he added, paraphrasing John F. Kennedy.\U.S. Rep. Ryan Costello, a Republican whose district includes parts of Montgomery, Chester and Berks Counties, agrees with Cohen than climate change is a bipartisan issue, not a hoax.\A recent Yale poll shows that 69 percent of Pennsylvanians, near the national average, believe global warming is underway and that a majority believe the main cause is human activities. Many of those voters live in districts represented by GOP congressmen. And the closer to Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, the more they believe. In New Jersey, 75 percent of residents believe in global warming.\Costello sponsored a recent House resolution on ""conservative environmental stewardship,"" acknowledging the impact of climate change and calling for a science-based approach to tackle the problem.\Other local Republican members of the U.S. House of Representatives, including Brian Fitzpatrick, Pat Meehan, and South Jersey's Frank LoBiondo, are co-sponsors of the measure, which is mostly symbolic, but has drawn the signatures of 17 Republicans.\All four local Republicans also opposed Trump's position on the Republican plan to replace the Affordable Care Act last year, widely seen as a harbinger of trouble for the president's agenda.\Costello and others who backed the resolution are also part of the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus, which has 13 members from each party; newcomers can be admitted only with another member of the opposing party.\Costello called climate change ""a major issue of our time"" in an interview last week. He says a mix of new clean technologies, such as solar storage and cell innovation, energy-efficient building materials, carbon capture advances, traffic reduction through computerized signaling, and developments in nuclear power could all reduce greenhouse gas emissions. He still would keep traditional fossil fuels as part of the national energy scheme, but would reduce the nation's reliance on them.\Costello said he would argue for keeping federal programs that foster innovation, including one that Trump wants to cut within the Department of Energy that awards money to promising technology projects.\""The issue itself,"" he said of climate change, ""will hopefully be able to transcend partisan politics in the years to come.""\Conservative policy organizations also are chiming in on the climate change debate.\The nonprofit ConservAmerica took issue with the new EPA administrator, Scott Pruitt, after he said on CNBC that he did not believe fossil fuel emissions were a major contributor to climate change. The group said it wants to meet with Pruitt and discuss facts.\""Many on the right will not admit, publicly, that carbon dioxide emissions are the primary driver of rising global temperatures, simply because admitting that would mean their side would lose ground,"" according to the group.\And republicEn, a nonprofit that consists of ""conservatives, libertarians, and pragmatists,"" also says climate change is real and needs to be addressed.\Conservative conservationists may agree climate change is real, but they often diverge from their liberal environmentalists on what to do about it.\Conservatives tend to favor market-based approaches to discourage fossil fuel use and encourage cleaner technologies, while liberals say faster action also is needed through regulation.\For example, former GOP Secretaries of State George Schultz and James Baker were part of a group this year that backed a carbon tax designed to discourage fossil fuel use. Such a tax would impose a fee on fossil fuel plants would be passed down to industries that make products from the fuels and ultimately to consumers. But the White House has ruled out any support for a carbon tax.\On Tuesday, Trump is expected through an executive order to kill the Clean Power Plan, a series of regulations put in place in 2015 under Obama to limit carbon dioxide emissions at fossil fuel and natural-gas fired plants. Cuts to the EPA could affect states that use federal money for clean-air and water programs and remediation.\Some Democrats ask whether conservatives are lining up behind the environment in preparation for an anti-Trump pushback at the polls in 2018. Evan Lukaske, a spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Committee, says Republicans such as Costello are more concerned with their political careers ""melting away, not the ice caps.""\But Samuel Rubin, an organizer with Food & Water Watch, an environmental activist group, says he's glad to see conservatives get on board.\""It's a delight to see resistance to taking on climate change break,"" Rubin said. ""It's good to see any movement on climate change. Democrats haven't been as strong as we'd like on some issues.""\Rubin notes that it was Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, who called last week for a ban on hydraulic fracturing, or ""fracking,"" saying the risks to the environment outweigh the rewards.\Cohen says Pennsylvania Republicans have a particularly proud history of conservationist policies. John Saylor, who represented the Keystone State in the U.S. House from 1949 through 1973, supported air and water standards and helped write the Wilderness Act and other programs now revered by Democrats. More recently, former New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman headed the EPA under George W. Bush and has spoken out against Trump's appointment of Pruitt to head the EPA and against cuts to the agency.\""The hardest part of the battle is how we, as a society in the modern world, keep an environment that's usable for birds, fish, animals and ourselves,"" said Cohen, who intends to be fly fishing soon for trout in a clear stream in East Stroudsburg. ""If you want to say you're conservative, as I do, you've got to acknowledge it has as its root the word conserve.""\fkummer@philly.com\215-854-2645\@FrankKummer\ \Credit: By Frank Kummer STAFF WRITER"
312,"Of the many things being said about climate change lately, none was more eloquent than the point made by Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington state in the Showtime series ""Years of Living Dangerously,"" when he observed: ""We're the first generation to feel the impact of climate change and the last generation that can do something about it.""\The question is how do we motivate people to do something about it at the scale required, when many remain skeptical or preoccupied with the demands of daily life - and when climate scientists themselves caution that it is impossible to attribute any single weather event to climate change, even if recent weather extremes fit their models of exactly how things will play out as the planet warms.\Andrew Sullivan's Dish blog last week linked to a very novel approach offered by Thomas Wells, a Dutch philosopher: Since climate change and environmental degradation pit the present against the future, our generation versus those unborn, we should start by giving the future a voice in our present politics.\""Even if we can't know what future citizens will actually value and believe in, we can still consider their interests, on the reasonable assumption that they will somewhat resemble our own (everybody needs breathable air, for example),"" wrote Mr. Wells in Aeon Magazine. Since ""our ethical values point one way, towards intergenerational responsibility, but our political system points another, towards the short-term horizon of the next election,"" we ""should consider introducing agents who can vote in a far-seeing and impartial way.""\Mr. Wells suggests creating a public ""trusteeship"" of nongovernmental civic and charitable foundations, environmental groups and nonpartisan think tanks ""and give them each equal shares of a block of votes adding up to, say, 10 percent of the electorate,"" so they can represent issues like ""de-carbonizing the economy"" and ""guaranteeing pension entitlements"" for the unborn generation that will be deeply impacted but has no vote.\Unrealistic, I know, but the need to incorporate longer time scales into our societal choices is very real - and right in the lap of our generation. Andy Revkin, who blogs at Dot Earth for The New York Times' Opinion section, put it well: ""We are coming of age on a finite planet and only just now recognizing that it is finite. So how we manage infinite aspirations of a species that's been on this explosive trajectory, not just of population growth but of consumptive appetite - how can we make a transition to a stabilized and still prosperous relationship with the Earth and each other - is the story of our time.""\One way to get us to act with an intergenerational perspective is to enlarge the problem beyond climate - to make people understand that this is our generation's freedom struggle. The abiding strategy of our parents' generation was ""containment"" of communism in order to be free. The abiding strategy of our generation has to be ""resilience."" We will only be free to live the lives we want if we make our cities, country and planet more resilient.\Even if we can't attribute any particular storm to climate change, by continually pumping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere we are ""loading the dice"" in ways that climate scientists are convinced will continue to raise average temperatures, melt more ice, raise sea levels, warm oceans and make ""normal"" droughts drier, heat waves hotter, rainstorms more violent and the most disruptive storms even more disruptive. It is crazy to keep loading those dice and making ourselves more vulnerable to disruptions that will make us less free to live the lives we want. How free will we be when paying the exorbitant cleanup costs of endless weather extremes?\Moreover, acting today as if climate change requires an urgent response - like replacing income and corporate taxes with a carbon tax, introducing a national renewable portfolio standard to constantly stimulate more renewable energy and raising the efficiency standards for every home, building and vehicle - actually makes us healthier, more prosperous and more resilient, even if climate change turns out to be overblown.\We would end up with cleaner air and a tax structure that rewards more of what we want (work and investment) and disincentivizes what we don't want (carbon pollution). We would be taking money away from the worst enemies of freedom on the planet, the world's petro-dictators; and we would be incentivizing our industries to take the lead in manufacturing clean air, water and power systems, which will be in huge demand on a planet going from 7 billion to 9 billion people by 2050.\In short, by taking the climate threat seriously now, we'd make ourselves so much more economically, physically, environmentally and geopolitically resilient - and, therefore, more free.\What containment was for our parents' generation - their strategy to fight for freedom against the biggest threat of their day - resiliency will be for our generation against the multiple threats of our day: climate change, petro-dictatorship and destruction of our environment and biodiversity. Let's act so the next generation will want to honor us with a Memorial Day, the way we honor the sacrifice of previous generations.\Thomas L. Friedman is a syndicated columnist for The New York Times."

How's this for a change agenda?
\
Help average-wage workers retire as millionaires.
\
Bring affordable health care to all.
\
Push conservation and alternative energy sources through a ""carbon tax,"" with the proceeds going to working-class tax reductions.
\
More of John Edwards' populist agenda? No. This list is actually among the suggestions offered to revive the conservative movement in David Frum's Comeback: Conservatism That Can Win Again.
\
Frum is the former Bush speechwriter who coined the phrase ""axis of evil"" and titled the memoir of his White House service The Right Man: The Surprise Presidency of George W. Bush. Now, in Comeback, he suggests we offer to talk with axis-member Iran as part of a ""whatever it takes"" agenda to keep it from getting nukes - he doesn't expect Iran to accept the offer. And he goes into agonizing detail about the many areas in which Bush hasn't been right.
\
No, Frum hasn't switched sides, but he does want to update the conservative playbook. He is a foreign policy adviser to Rudy Giuliani, but the book is for any conservative or Republican who wants to address issues from this century, particularly those who want to do more than cry ""No!"" or ""Socialism!"" in response to Democratic proposals on issues ranging from education and health care to stem cells, immigration, and the war on terror.
\
""The great challenge for both parties . . . is to address Americans' genuine concerns in ways that meet those concerns but also yield positive results for the U.S. and the world economy,"" he said in a phone interview during this first week of his book tour.
\
He is not sure that the GOP can adapt quickly enough, however.
\
""Organizations don't change until change is forced on them,"" he said. ""I fear that my party may have to go through a defeat or two before we rethink issues.""
\
Should his party decide to try to win this year, Frum has some suggestions. First, accept the progress made in hot-button issues of the 1980s and '90s - tax policy, welfare reform, crime, abortion - and recognize how success was achieved: by hearing Americans' concerns and then offering practical, conservative solutions.
\
""People need to know that help is on the way,"" he said.
\
Among the areas he addresses are health insurance, retirement and the environment.
\
Here's Frum on the first issue: ""The health-care status quo is a nightmare favela of bizarre regulations heaped upon minute controls upon perverse lawsuits upon irrational subsidies."" He argues that the public hates the system but is not yet ready to endorse a massive single-payer bureaucracy. But they could sign on if no alternative is offered.
\
Frum offers common sense: Find the impediments to lower costs (think government mandates), and overcome them. The solution will come not from one quick fix, but from many good ideas over time.
\
For example: Allow interstate competition among insurers. If the average insurance plan costs $6,000 in New Jersey, and the costs include state-mandated areas of coverage a consumer doesn't want, let her purchase a basic plan for $1,000 from an insurer in a state with fewer mandates.
\
On retirement, Frum suggests adding $300 annually to the Social Security accounts of low-income workers, guaranteeing $1 million in net worth for many retirees. His slogan - ""Every American a millionaire by age 67"" - is far more appealing than the gloom and doom peddled in the 2005 attempt to reform Social Security.
\
On the environment, Frum offers a ""carbon tax"" on fossil fuels. It would encourage conservation and investment in alternate energy sources, including nuclear, please the stop-global-warming crowd, and reduce the nation's energy dependency on unfriendly regimes. He would use the revenue to offset child-tax benefits and payroll-tax reductions for the working class, who would be hit hardest with a carbon tax.
\
Frum doesn't see enough urgency about these issues among the current GOP field. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee raises them, Frum says, but his suggestions, including the fair tax, ""are unworkable, unintelligent and utterly fantastical.""
\
""If you're running for president, you have an obligation to arrive at workable solutions, not just come up with an exploitive list of problems,"" Frum said.
\
Not everyone will agree with Frum's solutions, either, but at least he's done his homework. He also shows that, while there may be reasons for conservatives - and Clintons - to weep this election season, a lack of good ideas isn't one of them.

314,"For just about all of human history, our prosperity has been coupled with our ability to take resources from the Earth.\Prior to the Industrial Revolution there was a hard ceiling on how prosperous or numerous we could become; however, by unlocking the energy in fossil fuels, the human intellect changed the story of civilization. Through industrialization we grew healthier, lived longer and became richer, yet our spectacular economic growth has had calamitous effects on the natural world.\It's technological progress that has both despoiled the Earth and ensured that people are better housed, better clothed and better cared for. Air pollution continues to choke cities in China and India while severe poverty in those countries has been declining for decades. The threat of ecosystem and species losses loom large, yet fewer people are dying from war and preventable diseases.\There are clear signs, however, that ""a great reversal of our Industrial Age is taking place,"" author Andrew McAfee writes. Lives are getting better in material terms while we've learned how to decouple growth from resource use. Mr. McAfee's new book, ""More From Less,"" is a concise guide to this ongoing reformation of the U.S. economy. He lays out the distinctive and counterintuitive pattern of dematerialization, which means that we are using less stuff each year to produce the same amount.\Mr. McAfee writes and speaks with a pugnacious spirit dispelling the myth that a sustainable economy has to be one without growth. Small may be beautiful, but the American population is forecast to increase by over 100 million by 2050. Therefore, growth is imperative to sustain a growing labor force.\Making the most\Dematerialization means getting more from less, and we can see this in every sector of the economy. Every year, more food is grown on less American land. Crop yields were once tightly linked to water and fertilizer use, but now more corn, wheat, soybeans and other crops are grown from the same acre of land, pound of fertilizer and gallon of water.\Fertilizer use is down almost 25% from its 1999 peak, and by 2014, total water use for irrigation had decreased by more than 22% from its maximum in 1984. Between 1982 and 2015, over 45 million acres - an amount of cropland equal in size to the state of Washington - was returned to nature. Meanwhile, the total tonnage of crops produced in America increased by more than 35% during the same time.\Despite a decline in manufacturing employment in America, output has increased every non-recession year. In 2015 (the most recent year for which U.S. Geological Survey data are available), our total use of steel was down more than 15% from its high point in 2000; aluminum consumption was down more than 32% from its peak and copper use 40%. Up until the time of the original Earth Day in 1970, consumption of metals in America grew in lockstep with the overall economy. The economy has continued to grow, but consumption of metals has decreased. ""We're now getting more 'economy' from less metal year after year,"" Mr. McAfee writes.\Competition and innovation\What Mr. McAfee calls the ""four horsemen of the optimist"" - capitalism, tech progress, public awareness and responsive government - have improved human prosperity and brought us to post-peak in resource consumption. One may argue that public awareness is the force that ensures the other three, but the public is not required to be aware the way government is required to be responsive. While the first principle of economics is that markets should be left alone, the second principle is that unregulated markets will not put a price on negative externalities like air pollution. Businesses will dump waste into the environment if there is no cost for them to do so.\The Clean Air Act, signed into law in 1970, and amended by President George H.W. Bush in 1990, drastically reduced the amount of atmospheric pollution in our forests and waterways at a cost to industry that was far less than originally forecast. Atmospheric levels of sulfur dioxide in the U.S. have dropped to lows not seen since the early 20th century. The Clean Water Act of 1972 is also considered a great success. In 2002, the Environmental Protection Agency announced that two-thirds of America's rivers and half of its lakes had met the goal of making our waters fishable and swimmable. One regional example: the Cuyahoga River in northeast Ohio, which caught fire in the '70s, is now a trout-fishing stream again.\A clean environment has to come not only from the laws of a responsive government but also from its investments. The U.S. has made huge visionary investments in technology before, from railroads and interstate highways to computer chips and the internet (Google got its start with federal funding), and it must continue to invest in clean energy today. There will be no significant action to address climate change until alternatives to fossil fuels are better and cheaper. Making clean energy cheap requires substantial investments in research and development to encourage technological breakthroughs.\Almost 90% of economic growth comes from technological innovation, and capitalism provides incentives for the kind of scientific advances that improve lives. The U.S. Army is looking for a company to develop wearable coronavirus sensors. This is a $25 million contract that will be awarded to ingenuity, and its success would yield large benefits to the entire society.\Mr. McAfee argues that by combining technological progress with capitalism we got better at doing the things we'd already been doing. Fewer resources are being used because raw materials cost money, and companies, locked in competition with one another, are keen to find ways to use fewer of them. Competition drives economic progress, disciplines businesses and spurs dematerialization, and tech progress now offers competitors ""many ways to slim, swap, evaporate, and optimize their way out of using resources,"" Mr. McAfee writes.\Taking bets\One of the main themes of Mr. McAfee's book is that companies in a market system are sensitive to price changes, so making pollution expensive is one way to reduce it. By putting a price on pollution - and categorizing greenhouse gases as another category of air pollution - and making it a cost like any other material, companies will be compelled to invest and innovate to reduce those costs. ""If pollution is costly instead of free,"" Mr. McAfee writes, ""companies will work hard to ""de-pollute,"" just as they work hard to dematerialize.""\Mr. McAfee is a champion of William Nordhaus, who won the Nobel Prize for economics in 2018, in large part for his work on greenhouse gases. What does Mr. Nordhaus say? Put a tax on carbon, but don't let the government have the tax. Instead, refund it back to citizens. This would give Americans a direct stake in the system by providing them with dividend checks based on the amount of carbon emitted. Corporations therefore would no longer be able to see their interests as separate from the American people.\A letter published in The Wall Street Journal last year had more than 3,500 signatures from economists, including 27 Nobel laureates, and four former chairs of the Federal Reserve, supporting the idea of a revenue-neutral carbon tax. This was the largest public statement of economists in history.\As it stands, those who produce the emissions are not paying for the privilege, and those who are harmed are not duly compensated. A tax would make carbon-intensive products and energy sources more expensive. Increasing the tax over time would give people incentives to shift to cheaper, lower-carbon alternatives, while giving producers incentives to find and develop new low-carbon products and processes. ""Putting a price on carbon,"" Mr. Nordhaus writes, ""represents a societal decision about the priority of reducing CO2 emissions.""\A study by the Climate Leadership Council estimates that by setting a carbon tax rate at $40 per ton, a family of four would receive $2,000 per year. According to the U.S Treasury Department, the bottom 70% of Americans would receive more in dividends than they would pay in increased energy prices, and the amount of the dividend would grow as the carbon tax rate increases.\Mr. Nordhaus compares climate outcomes to the spin of a roulette wheel, where the precise outcome cannot be known but the odds compel action to reduce emissions of CO2. Investing in alternatives to fossil fuels would be one such action.\In an article in The New York Times last month, Brad Plumer reported that the U.S. is on track to produce more electricity this year from renewable power than from coal for the first time. The cost of building large wind farms has declined by more than 40% since 2010, while solar costs have dropped more than 80%. ""In just the first four and a half months of this year,"" Mr. Plumer wrote, ""America's fleet of wind turbines, solar panels and hydroelectric dams have produced more electricity than coal on 90 separate days - shattering last year's record of 38 days for the entire year.""\Here we can invert Nietzsche's maxim from, ""If you see something slipping, push it,"" to ""If you see something improving, advance it."" More investment in clean tech will fund improvements that build on one another until we have a scalable solution.\Mr. McAfee places some 10-year bets for the reader: In 2029, he argues, the U.S. will consume less total energy than it did in 2019; will produce less total CO2 emissions than it did in 2019; and, compared with 2019, in 2029, will consume in total: fewer metals, fewer industrial materials, less timber, less paper, less fertilizer and less water for agriculture, while using less cropland. Does anyone want to wager?\Timothy Lydon is a writer and bookseller at Classic Lines Books in Squirrel Hill.\CAPTION: PHOTO: Maura Losch/Post-Gazette:"
315,"
In just three years, CFCs, the compounds that keep 6 million pieces of U.S. cooling equipment and 130 million car air conditioners humming, will be history - banned from production because they are eating through the earth's ozone layer.
\
But industry's efforts to develop substitutes for these chlorofluorocarbons have started stirring up considerable anger and apprehension.
\
Indeed, the very solutions are posing a whole new set of problems.
\
Experts are warning that:
\
* Shortages of CFCs may develop as early as 1994 as companies such as Allied Signal and Du Pont crank down CFC production.
\
* Auto owners will be in for a shock when they start to realize, probably next summer, that they can no longer top off a leaky cooling system with a CFC coolant. Instead, the system will have to be fixed - or, an even costlier proposition, retrofitted to use a new CFC substitute.
\
* Large industrial CFC users may wind up paying more taxes if they choose a CFC alternative that also contributes to global warming.
\
* Many real estate owners, having paid to make their buildings safe from asbestos contamination, are stymied in replacing their air conditioning systems because some of the CFC alternatives they use, while safer for the environment, may be harmful to humans.
\
""We're getting caught up in a problem that is bigger than us,"" says Jim Dinegar of the Building Owners and Managers Association International.
\
""You feel like telling people, 'Just move outside and wear a hat.' ""
\
Compounding these problems, the Environmental Protection Agency has yet to issue the rules and regulations that will guide CFC users in their choice of substitutes. They were due early in the fall but now are not expected until after the presidential election.
\
The scramble to crank out CFC replacements is giving rise to a $6 billion industry. The major CFC producers have stressed that they are committed to ending CFC production by 1995 and introducing adequate substitutes.
\
Allied Signal Inc., for instance, has announced plans to step up its $250 million CFC-substitute program and to start up production in 1994. Du Pont has invested more than $400 million in developing and selling CFC alternatives.
\
But so distressed are the chemical manufacturers over the confusion surrounding the phaseout of CFCs that at a recent Washington conference on CFC alternatives, J.A. Krol, Du Pont Co. vice chairman, pleaded for an end to the ''sniping.""
\
""Given the time constraints before us and the substantial investment decisions and technical changes we have to make, we do not have the luxury of spending months on end debating which products are marginally better and taking potshots at each other,"" he told the 1,600 CFC experts from 30 countries.
\
Still, all the hoopla over the half-dozen CFC alternatives considered the most viable has not allayed anxieties that as soon as next year a black market in the banned CFCs is likely to develop as users hold on to their old equipment while the uncertainties are ironed out.
\
Owners of air conditioners may be among the first to feel the sting.
\
Regulations that took effect July 1 prohibited technicians servicing any piece of equipment using CFCs from releasing the compounds into the air. Service personnel, moreover, are now required to recycle CFCs they recover
\
from air conditioners and other equipment.
\
Many repair people interpret the new rules to mean they no longer can top off leaking cooling systems.
\
Moreover, it will be much harder for individuals to do it themselves.
\
Starting next month, selling CFC-laden coolants in packages under 20 pounds to anyone except a certified technician will be illegal. So, getting a 12- ounce can of coolant at an auto-parts store will be a thing of the past.
\
Even if a car owner were willing to pay as much as $100 for a 20-pound can of coolant, there may not be much available.
\
Companies such as Allied Signal and Du Pont are already cutting back on CFC production to meet their goal of getting out of the business by 1995. That means shortages will develop, especially if the coming summers are warm, experts warn.
\
""There will be a significant (CFC) shortfall"" in 1994, a General Motors air-conditioning expert warned during the Washington conference.
\
As a result, experts say, car drivers will be looking for CFCs on the black market.
\
Sticker shock awaits those who opt for a more environmentally responsible solution: A $200 bill to fix a leaky air conditioner, and as much as $1,000 to adapt a system to CFC substitutes, according to Ward Atkinson, an Arizona engineer and expert in CFC alternatives.
\
A lot of service stations are likely to face car drivers who will be ''combative,"" says Simon Oulouhojian, executive director of the Mobile Air Conditioning Society (MACS).
\
Meanwhile, a battle is brewing on another front: among some coolant manufacturers, automakers and makers of car air conditioners.
\
Because of the cost of retrofitting car air conditioners, some coolant manufacturers, including Du Pont, are aggressively marketing blends they say will work in cars still outfitted to use the banned CFCs.
\
However, there is strong opposition to the blends, particularly from automakers and MACS.
\
Two of the available blends are flammable, many are incompatible with air- conditioner parts and could damage them, and all could wreak havoc with efforts to recover and properly recycle existing coolants, say representatives of General Motors and MACS.
\
""One of the biggest current threats is the proliferation of unproven compounds,"" Oulouhojian said.
\
""None of these so-called replacement refrigerants have been accepted for use by any system manufacturer, and many original-equipment-system manufacturers have specifically warned their dealers not to use these substitutes.""
\
Du Pont defends the blends it is bringing to market.
\
""Other blends are not technically sound, but we think ours is viable"" in some cars under some conditions, says David Bateman, a Du Pont CFC scientist, adding that the company has done extensive tests.
\
Du Pont, added Tom Tattersall, another CFC expert for the company, would ''stand behind its product"" to the point of guaranteeing the warranty of the car air conditioner being filled with the blend.
\
Joining the automotive air-conditioning industry in its apprehensions about a CFC-free world is the real estate industry.
\
Over the last few decades commercial real estate owners and managers have had to struggle with asbestos, energy crises and indoor pollution, said Dinegar of the building owners association.
\
""And now we get to CFCs,"" he complained.
\
Property owners who are considering updating or replacing their air- conditioning systems are being presented with ""83 variations"" of CFC substitutes, none of which is satisfactory, including HCFCs, or hydrochlorofluorocarbons, which themselves are scheduled to be phased out eventually because they, too, have ozone-damaging properties, Dinegar said.
\
Extensive testing has shown that several CFC substitutes are safe.
\
But some studies show that some CFC substitutes, while they may not hurt the ozone layer, can have harmful effects on one's health, particularly on the human heart. These reports worry Dinegar's building owners.
\
Then there is the looming possibility that Congress may enact a carbon tax, a levy on compounds that contribute to pollution, especially global warming.
\
Some experts acknowledge that the new CFC substitutes will increase global warming, but only minimally.
\
Tony Vogelsberg, for one, says the substitutes will actually have a beneficial effect on global warming.
\
The new compounds, says Vogelsberg, a Du Pont CFC expert, are highly efficient coolants. That means the equipment that uses them consumes less energy than is now the case, less of the fuels that emit the gases that cause global warming.
\
But the argument does not convince everyone, particularly environmentalists, who argue that Vogelsberg and others are ignoring the considerable global-warming potential of the new CFC substitutes.
\
Another CFC substitute, HFCs, hydrofluorocarbons, has ""significant"" ability to contribute to global warming, said Dan Lashoff, a scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council.
\
And it is precisely because some CFC substitutes could add to global warming that they are likely to be targets of a future carbon tax, said Steve Decanio, an economist at the University of California at Santa Barbara.
\
The prospect of a carbon tax on CFC substitutes and the conflicting views about whether they contribute to global warming will further prompt businesses to defer plans to replace their CFC-dependent equipment until the arguments are sorted out, experts say.
\
""It would be a tragedy if a carbon tax spilled over into this industry,"" Vogelsberg said. ""It will stifle a lot of activity.""

316,"OTTAWA -- When Canada's election campaign began a month ago, the leading issues were the environment, health care and the quality of its leadership.\In the early weeks, that is what preoccupied the governing Conservatives and the four parties trying to dislodge them. When the stock market crashed, however, the tone of the race changed -- and so has the prospective outcome.\As the credit crisis has reshaped the presidential race in the United States, it has done much the same in Canada. While the Conservatives are still favored to win re-election tomorrow, their support has eroded and their hope of winning a majority of the 308 seats in Parliament has receded.\Suddenly, it is all about the economy. Driven by oil and gas, coal, potash, and iron ore and other natural resources, Canada has enjoyed a long season of prosperity. It has had years of growth (2.7 percent in 2007), relatively low unemployment, a strong dollar, swelling surpluses and falling debt. The government boasts that Canada's economy is the strongest among the Group of Eight major industrialized democracies.\But the prosperity is uneven. In resource-rich Alberta, Saskatchewan and Newfoundland, the energy bonanza has brought skyrocketing house prices and a labor shortage. But in Quebec and Ontario, the country's populous industrial heartland, a high dollar and high oil prices have hurt manufacturing, especially in the automotive sector.\Three-quarters of the country's exports go to the United States. When it sneezes, Canada catches cold.\With the United States in recession, economists predict that Canada will follow. They expect it to be less severe north of the border, but critics of Prime Minister Stephen Harper, himself an economist, say that he has been paralyzed by the sudden reversal of fortune.\""Remember, Canada is not the United States,"" Mr. Harper said a week ago in a statement that evoked the Republican presidential nominee, Sen. John McCain. ""The fundamentals of the Canadian economy are sound.""\Since the markets began falling in Canada, the race has tightened. The Liberals, who were in a distant second place, are now within five percentage points. They are unlikely to win, but their resurgence could deny the Conservatives the majority government they were seeking when the election was called.\In the final days of the campaign, Liberal leader Stephane Dion has been attacking the Conservatives for economic mismanagement. He says Canada has the worst growth among industrialized nations and has squandering its large budgetary surplus. He reminds Canadians that when the Liberals were defeated in January 2006 after 13 years in office, the annual surplus was $12 billion (Canadian).\Since then, the Conservatives have cut the national sales tax as well as income taxes, depriving Ottawa of billions of revenue. The surplus is now $2 billion (Canadian), and critics warn that Canada may run a deficit for the first time in a decade.\The re-emergence of the economy has been a godsend to Mr. Dion, who began the campaign talking about the environment. The Liberals propose a comprehensive platform called the ""Green Shift"" with a $15 billion (Canadian) carbon tax offset by income tax cuts. They also propose allowances for investing in green technology and grants to make homes energy-efficient.\But Mr. Dion, who won his party's leadership as an activist environmentalist, had trouble selling a carbon tax to skeptical Canadians. His halting English hasn't helped, and his support plunged.\The Conservatives have called the Green Shift ""a tax grab."" They have abandoned Canada's commitment to the Kyoto Accord, promising instead to cut Canada's greenhouse gases by 20 percent over 2006 levels by 2020. They also offer incentives to invest in renewable energy.\Now, though, the environment has disappeared as an issue. So have other issues, such as the perennial one of improving Canada's universal health care. Both the Liberals and the Conservatives promise incentives to train more doctors and nurses -- Canada has a shortage -- and to encourage them to settle in rural and northern Canada.\Another issue is families. The Conservatives are promising income splitting and a bigger child tax credit; the Liberals promise a $1.5 billion national child care plan, as well as child tax credit.\In a political system in which the Liberals and Conservatives find success in the center, which is more liberal than the United States, their ideas are not radically different. But the New Democrats, a left-of-center party, and the Bloc Quebecois, the secessionist party running only in Quebec, are closer to European social democracy.\The Green Party, which has never won a seat but has 12 percent in the polls, is arguing that it is not a one-issue party. It may be a spoiler, drawing votes from the Liberals and New Democrats.\Foreign policy is not an issue in the campaign, which isn't unusual. What is different this time is that Canada has more than 3,000 soldiers deployed in Afghanistan, where it has lost almost 100 of them.\While the other three parties want to withdraw or change the mission, the Liberals and Conservatives have agreed to extend it to 2011. This means the Liberals have not been able to use the war against the Conservatives in Quebec, where the war is unpopular.\The immediate beneficiary seems to be the Bloc Quebecois, which has enjoyed a resurgence of popularity, denying the Conservatives the breakthrough they imagined in the province."

A new study from the National Association of Manufacturers and the Pennsylvania Manufacturers' Association confirms the absurdity of anti-growth, climate-clucking leftists' claims that a U.S. tax on carbon-dioxide emissions would be good for both the environment and the economy.
\
The study finds that either a carbon tax starting at $20 per ton and rising 4 percent annually or one reducing CO2 emissions 80 percent would have a ""net negative effect on consumption, investment and jobs"" nationwide and in Pennsylvania.
\
The resulting economic slowdown would cost far more in federal revenue than a carbon tax would yield. Higher coal, natural gas and gasoline prices would depress non-energy spending, decrease wages as much as 8.5 percent and reduce manufacturing output as much as 15 percent in energy-intensive sectors, 7.7 percent in non-energy-intensive sectors.
\
In Pennsylvania, workers would lose income equivalent to 77,000 to 81,000 jobs in 2013, 96,000 to 120,000 jobs by 2023. Natural-gas costs would rise more than 40 percent, average household electricity rates 13 percent, gasoline prices more than 20 cents per gallon -- just in 2013. By 2023, coal-sector output would drop 48 to 54 percent, with manufacturing output falling 1.9 percent in energy-intensive sectors, 0.5 to 0.9 percent in non-energy-intensive sectors.
\
With this study definitively demonstrating devastating effects on the real-world economy, only nonsensically utopian radicals can still portray a carbon tax as a prescription for prosperity.

It is early evening on Capitol Hill, and I am sitting with Sen. Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican, who, along with Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., and Sen. Joe Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, is trying to craft a new energy bill -- one that could actually win 60 votes.
\
What is interesting about Graham is that he has been willing -- courageously in my view -- to depart from the prevailing GOP consensus that the only energy policy we need is ""drill, baby, drill.""
\
What brought you around, I ask? Graham's short answer: politics, jobs and legacy.
\
We start with politics. The Republican Party today has a major outreach problem with two important constituencies, ""Hispanics and young people,"" Graham explains:
\
""I have been to enough college campuses to know if you are 30 or younger this climate issue is not a debate. It's a value. These young people grew up with recycling and a sensitivity to the environment -- and the world will be better off for it. They are not brainwashed. ... From a Republican point of view, we should buy into it and embrace it and not belittle them. You can have a genuine debate about the science of climate change, but when you say that those who believe it are buying a hoax and are wacky people you are putting at risk your party's future with younger people. You can have a legitimate dispute about how to solve immigration, but when you start focusing on the last names of people the demographics will pass you by.""
\
So Graham's approach to bringing around his conservative state has been simple: avoid talking about ""climate change,"" which many on the right don't believe. Instead, frame our energy challenge as a need to ""clean up carbon pollution,"" to ""become energy independent"" and to ""create more good jobs and new industries for South Carolinians."" He proposes ""putting a price on carbon,"" starting with a very focused carbon tax, as opposed to an economywide cap-and-trade system, so as to spur both consumers and industries to invest in and buy new clean energy products. He includes nuclear energy, and insists on permitting more offshore drilling for oil and gas to give us more domestic sources, as we bridge to a new clean energy economy.
\
""Cap-and-trade as we know it is dead, but the issue of cleaning up the air and energy independence should not die -- and you will never have energy independence without pricing carbon,"" Graham argues. ""The technology doesn't make sense until you price carbon. Nuclear power is a bet on cleaner air. Wind and solar is a bet on cleaner air. You make those bets assuming that cleaning the air will become more profitable than leaving the air dirty, and the only way it will be so is if the government puts some sticks on the table -- not just carrots. The future economy of America and the jobs of the future are going to be tied to cleaning up the air, and in the process of cleaning up the air this country becomes energy independent and our national security is greatly enhanced.""
\
Remember, he adds, ""we are more dependent on foreign oil today than after 9/11. That is political malpractice, and every member of Congress is responsible.""
\
This isn't just for the next generation, says Graham: ""As you talk about the future, if you forget the people who live in the present, you will have no future politically. You have to get the people in the present to buy into the future. I tell my voters: 'If we try to clean up the air and become energy independent, we will create more jobs than anything I can do as a senator.' General Electric makes all the turbines for the GE windmills in Greenville, South Carolina."" He also is pushing to make his state a manufacturing center for nuclear reactor components and biomass from plants and timber.
\
What would most help him bring around his GOP colleagues? The business lobby. ""The Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers need to tell my colleagues it is OK to price carbon, if you do it smartly,"" he says.
\
Sure, Graham's strategy will give many greens heartburn. I don't agree with every point. But if there is going to be a clean energy bill, greens and Democrats will have to recruit some Republicans. Graham says he's ready to meet them in the middle. ""We've got to get started,"" he says, ""because once we do, every CEO will adopt a carbon strategy, no matter what the law actually requires.""
\
And for those Republicans who think this is only a loser, Graham says think again: ""What is our view of carbon as a party? Are we the party of carbon pollution forever in unlimited amounts? Pricing carbon is the key to energy independence, and the byproduct is that young people look at you differently.""
\
Look at how he is received in colleges today.
\
""Instead of being just one more short, white Republican over 50,"" says Graham, ""I am now semicool. There is an awareness by young people that I am doing something different.""
\
Five more GOP senators like him and we could have a real energy bill.
\
""We can't be a nation that always tries and fails,"" Graham concludes. ""We have to eventually get some hard problem right.""

When I decided to write a letter listing the top 10 reasons to oppose a carbon tax, I soon realized the list was too long: big government's inefficiency/wasteful spending/incompetence (all with illustrative examples), over-regulation and over-taxation, prosperity is better for the environment than poverty, CO2 is not a pollutant, the global temperature hasn't changed in over 15 years, etc.
\
But when you boil it all down, the main reason to oppose a carbon tax is because the science is not settled just because a corrupt international bureaucracy declares it so. The propaganda, including wild exaggerations and apocalyptic predictions, is disseminated from one main source: the IPCC. The U.N.'s IPCC is government-sponsored, politically motivated and predisposed to believing that climate change is a problem in need of a U.N. solution. The strong bias of its founders and principals in their determination to find a human role in climate change is well documented. Its reports are edited and revised by government officials, not scientists, to fit their political agendas. However, since 2003, an organization called the NIPCC (Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change) has provided a second opinion. The independent studies and reports of this international group of scientists contradict the conclusions of the IPCC. The NIPCC has no formal attachment to or sponsorship from any government or governmental agency. Because it is wholly independent of political influences, it is not predisposed to produce politically motivated conclusions or policy recommendations. It seeks to objectively analyze and interpret data and facts without conforming to any specific agenda. Haven't heard of it? I didn't think so. (www.climatechangereconsidered.org)
\
If the earth isn't warming as predicted and the cause isn't CO2, there's no need to continue sending billions of dollars to the U.N. ($7.45 billion from American taxpayers in the years 2010-2012) to help poor countries ""cope"" with climate change. There's also no reason to burden Americans with more regulation and increased prices via a carbon tax.

321,"In the Feb. 8 op-ed ""Carbon Taxes Alone Aren't Good Climate Policy,"" Bloomberg columnist Gernot Wagner discusses the necessity of having both a tax (or fee) on carbon and government support for renewable energy research and development. Both are important, but he leaves out one very important ingredient of policies needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate the coming climate crisis.\Targeted government support of energy research and development is a ""no-brainer."" The United States has become a world leader in numerous scientific, technological and industrial areas thanks to strategic government investment to nurture valuable economic sectors. Renewable energy is clearly an excellent target for such an approach.\The case for a carbon tax is more difficult to make. Mr. Wagner is correct that putting a price on carbon is probably the best way to achieve the necessary result, but his article leaves out an important downside of that policy. Changing to renewable energy requires investment, such as replacing gasoline-fueled cars with electric ones, replacing gas furnaces with electric ones, or adding rooftop solar panels to homes and businesses.\Because energy is a larger fraction of the basic expenses of low-income people, they will disproportionately feel the impact of the carbon tax while not being in a position to make the necessary lifestyle changes. Fortunately, there is a bipartisan approach to deal with that problem. The bipartisan Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act returns the revenues from the carbon fee as a dividend to family units. Economic analysis shows that about two-thirds of all households, especially those at lower income levels, will come out ahead.\So I agree that carbon taxes alone are not good policy. But using those taxes as a dividend not only makes that policy revenue neutral but also allows all families, as well as the environment, to benefit from the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. I urge U.S. Rep. Mike Doyle, D-Forest Hills, to join with his colleagues as a co-sponsor of the EICDA.\Alfred B.

322,"WASHINGTON - As progressive Democrats in Congress planned to reintroduce the Green New Deal resolution, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., joined the head of the mine workers' union on Monday to call for federal funding for fossil fuel technology like carbon capture, slammed proposals for a carbon tax, and said efforts to ensure a ""just transition"" to renewable energy ring hollow to many Appalachian coal miners. But Mr. Manchin - the key vote in a 50/50 divided U.S. Senate - gave his fellow congressional Democrats a big lift in another way: He announced he would co-sponsor legislation that worker advocates consider the biggest expansion of labor organizing rights in more than 80 years.\Mr. Manchin, during a virtual conversation with the National Press Club in Washington, said the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, or PRO Act, was key to ""level the playing field"" for workers seeking to organize, particularly in emerging tech-driven and clean energy fields.\The bill, passed by the House in March, would classify independent contractors as employees, prevent employers from permanently replacing striking workers and impose financial penalties on employers that interfere with organizing efforts.\The bill also would eliminate right-to-work laws passed by more than two dozen states to allow private-sector workers to opt out of paying dues. A Supreme Court ruling in June 2018 allowed public-sector workers in all states to stop paying dues.\The House voted to pass it last month by a 225-206 vote, with just five House Republicans members supporting it and one Democrat voting against it. Last year, House Democrats passed the same bill, and it died in the Senate, then controlled by Republicans.\Mr. Manchin discussed his support for unions, in particular those laboring in coal and natural gas, in the context of the debate over the future of fossil fuels as Congress considers a $2.2 trillion infrastructure plan. President Joe Biden unveiled the proposal near Pittsburgh last month, pressing for a transition to clean energy and electric vehicles, among other priorities.\""While the [coal] industry has been in a steady downturn in job opportunities, maintaining those good-paying jobs as we reduce emissions is both possible, and it's our responsibility,"" the senator said.\Mr. Manchin, who chairs the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said he would continue to push for federal research dollars into carbon capture technologies that would not only preserve fossil fuels in the U.S. but also export to countries that are building new coal plants today.\He noted that 667 new coal-fired plants are being constructed today around the world, with 5,286 coal-fired power plants operating currently. Just a few hundred coal plants are being operated in the U.S., with none under construction, according to federal data.\""If you think that you can stick your head in the sand and say, 'I'm going to eliminate all fossil [fuels], all coal-fired plants, shut them down and clean up the environment' - you better start looking around at what's happening in the world,"" he said.\Policymakers instead should be focused on preserving the livelihood of those who spent generations working in fossil fuels. About 7,000 coal miners lost their jobs in 2020, said Cecil Roberts, international president of the United Mine Workers of America, and some 40,000 miners had been laid off in the past decade or so.\Mr. Roberts, a fellow West Virginian, joined Mr. Manchin in opposing a carbon tax that proponents say would provide the financial incentive for the electric utility industry to speed up its transition to clean-burning fuels.\Mr. Roberts said the union believed such a tax would put an end to carbon capture research altogether.\""What the carbon tax would do is place a heavy penalty on fossil fuels, which would make coal, and perhaps even natural gas, completely uncompetitive,"" Mr. Roberts said. ""So we would never get to the advancement of the technology that's needed worldwide for carbon capture and sequestration to allow the utilization of these fuels around the world and help deal with this climate situation.""\Mr. Manchin said the tax would be ineffective in spurring new technologies and would be used by fossil fuel opponents as ""a way to eliminate and transition"" industry jobs.\Mr. Manchin reiterated his support for region-specific tax credits for clean manufacturing developments, including renewable energy like wind and solar, that would require job creation in regions hardest hit by the decline of coal.\Policies favored by both men have run counter to many tenets of the Green New Deal, which is expected to be reintroduced Tuesday by Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. The nonbinding resolution, as first introduced in 2019, calls for sweeping public investment in renewable energy so the country relies on 100% zero-emission energy sources in the next decade.\Mr. Roberts said he would press all lawmakers to ensure his members are protected in the infrastructure bill. He pointed to Congress' approval of a backstop for the UMWA pension plan that suffered from a wave of coal company bankruptcies and layoffs that resulted in fewer miners paying into the fund.\""We need to provide a future for those people, a future for anybody who loses their jobs as a result of the transition in this country,"" Mr. Roberts said.\""We talk about a 'just transition' all the time - I wish people would quit using that,"" he added. ""There's never been a just transition in the history of the United States, and that's sad. The transition you get is down at the courthouse and whatever you can get out of bankruptcy, and it's generally nothing.""\CAPTION: PHOTO: Alyssa Schukar/The New York Times: Sen.

While the West Coast deals with drought, wildfires and hot weather, states east of the Rockies were dealing with a deluge of rainfall earlier this month.
\
On Wednesday, Aug. 13, Islip, N.Y., got a serious taste of what climate change looks like when over 13 inches of rain fell in a 24-hour period, shattering N.Y.'s previous record set in 2011 when Tropical Strom Irene dumped 11.6 inches of rain on Tarrytown, N.Y.
\
According to The Washington Post, ""Incredibly, over 11 inches (11.19c) of rain fell in three hours, between 5 and 8 a.m. About 10 inches (9.81c) of rain fell in two hours, a phenomenal quantity of water in such a short time. No hurricane or tropical storm to affect New York State has produced such an output.""
\
That same day, a large area south of Baltimore received 8 inches of rain, delaying flights from BWI and immersing parked cars half way under water in the long-term parking lot. On Aug. 11, Detroit suffered the heaviest rains in almost a century, as flooding became so bad that a police scuba dive team checked more than 70 vehicles on Interstate 94 on Tuesday morning to look for drivers that may have been trapped in submerged vehicles.
\
According to the National Climate Assessment released this year (http://nca2014.globalchange.gov), ""The Northeast has experienced a greater recent increase in extreme precipitation than any other region in the U.S.; between 1958 and 2010, the Northeast saw more than a 70 percent increase in the amount of precipitation falling in very heavy events (defined as the heaviest 1 percent of all daily events). This increase, combined with coastal and riverine flooding due to sea level rise and storm surge, creates increased risks. For all of these reasons, public health, agriculture, transportation, communications, and energy systems in the Northeast all face climate-related challenges.""
\
Climate change is making flooding in our region more frequent and more intense.
\
Climate scientists explain it this way: In a world warmed by burning fossil fuels releasing heat-trapping greenhouse gases, there's more evaporation, and a warmer atmosphere holds more water. When that water vapor condenses as rain or snow, there's more of it.
\
Flooding is just one of the consequences of living in a warming world.
\
Sea level rise, extreme flooding and droughts, heat waves and wildfires are all putting an increased burden on our infrastructure and our economy. In June a group of highly respected economists and climate scientists from the Risky Business Project released a report titled ""Risky Business, The Economic Risks of Climate Change in the United States"" (www.riskybusiness.org).
\
""The report's conclusions demonstrated the significant harm that climate change is causing now and that will almost certainly be far more severe in the future -- to the agricultural, energy and coastal-property sectors, as well as to public health and labor productivity more generally,"" according to Robert Rubin, one of Risks committee members.
\
Who foots the bill from damages caused by these increasing extreme precipitation events? Ultimately, you and I do.
\
Who should be footing the bill when it comes due? The fossil fuels industry.
\
Each and every one of us is being forced to pay for the damages caused by burning fossil fuels, both in dollars and lost lives due to the harmful effects of carbon pollution. The true cost is not being paid at the pump so to speak, but instead in the form of higher taxes, healthcare costs and insurance premiums or flat out losses due to lack of coverage from extreme weather events.
\
What we need now is a transparent, steadily rising carbon tax placed on fossil fuels that would reduce consumption and shift investment to carbon-free sources of energy, thereby reducing the risk of damages from extreme weather events. A hundred percent of the revenue collected should be returned to every household equally so as not to swamp our economy.
\
A recent study by the economic modeling firm Regional Economic Modeling Inc. (REMI) showed such a carbon tax would boost our economy and result in a net job creation of 2.1 million jobs after 10 years, an increase in GDP by $70 billion to $85 billion from 2020 on, and reduce CO2 emissions 33 percent over 10 years.
\
While flooding from extreme precipitation affects millions of people across the country, billions of dollars in profits are flooding into the fossil fuels industry, draining our economy as taxpayers get soaked when they are forced to foot the bill for damages.
\
As Robert Rubin put it in a Washington Post op-ed recently: ""We do not face a choice between protecting our environment or protecting our economy. We face a choice between protecting our economy by protecting our environment -- or allowing environmental havoc to create economic havoc.""

If there is a new world order, who's in charge?
\
The largest assemblage of nations in history gathered here to ponder the fate of the planet at the Earth Summit, but spent much of their time looking for a leader.
\
They found there is no longer a simple answer to the question.
\
Because the Bush administration had serious reservations about many of the treaties and policies, the United States was often less a leader than a balky follower. The old superpower alliances and enmities had disappeared with the breakup of the Soviet Union.
\
Faced with the magnitude of its task, the uncertainty of its political terrain and absent a forceful American agenda, the summit lumbered to its conclusion this weekend, as 114 heads of state met face to face, with a measure of success - and some notable failures.
\
Among the summit's achievements are a treaty to preserve the Earth's diverse flora and fauna, a new commission to monitor international environmental and development treaties, and an agreement to work on the problem of the world's growing deserts.
\
For some, however, the summit's disappointments loom larger: a weak treaty to deal with global warming, a failure to develop a comprehensive funding package for environmental programs and the lack of any serious discussion of the problems of overpopulation and overconsumption.
\
""The world's leading politicians have squandered a historic opportunity,"" Friends of the Earth International said. It noted issues such as nuclear waste and military spending were not even taken up.
\
""A number of people brought unrealistic expectations to the conference . . . and also unrealistic expectations of the United States,"" said William K. Reilly, the head of the American delegation.
\
Several European, Asian and African countries, large and small, stepped forward to attempt to exert a measure of leadership.
\
But what troubled many the most was the behavior of the United States, whose doggedly limited approach focused on a few key issues - such as forests and oceans - and rejected the appeals of other countries for more vigorous action.
\
Undaunted, the 12-nation European Community took the lead on the issues of biodiversity, climate change and financing. ""This is the first summit without superpowers,"" said Laurens Jan Brinkhorst, head of the EC delegation. ""It is the quality of the proposals that determine leadership.""
\
Austria, Switzerland and the Netherlands, much to the chagrin of the United States, also launched a campaign to get countries to do more on the threat of global warming.
\
The Japanese, with the largest delegation, were also a force here. Yesterday they announced a five-year program of aid - as much as $7.7 billion - to developing nations. About $2 billion is new funding.
\
A coalition of African nations, led by Nigeria, was successful in persuading the world community to address the problem of the spreading deserts threatening many parts of the globe. The goal is to develop an international treaty to try to halt desertification.
\
""This is a very big victory for Africa,"" said a spokesman for the Nigerian delegation.
\
""I am troubled by our President, who seems to be passing the torch of leadership on environmental issues to the European Community and on finance to Japan,"" said John Adams, the director of the Natural Resources Defense Council, an American environmental organization.
\
But Reilly, who heads the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, said, ''What you are seeing are other countries with enormous financial capabilities beginning to acknowledge commensurate environmental responsibilities.""
\
""That is something that is better for the world, better for the environment,"" he said. ""We welcome that sharing of leadership. It is not a unipolar world.""
\
*
\
Indeed, in this post-Cold War conference, the divisions seemed more between North and South than East and West.
\
The only concern of the Russian delegation appeared to be language in the financing document that said ""countries in transition"" would not be expected to help finance Earth Summit programs.
\
""We are moving out of a bilateral world centered on military and nuclear arms-control issues and moving into a multilateral world where the issues are environment and development and the relation between the two,"" said Alden Meyer, director of climate and energy policy for the Union of Concerned Scientists.
\
The EC stepped forward to offer declarations to strengthen the global climate change and biodiversity treaties and offered an aid package of $4 billion, including $50 million in new funds, to start financing the summit's programs.
\
The EC also is urging all industrial countries to join it in implementing a ''carbon tax"" on fossil fuels, which could raise as much as $100 billion.
\
These initiatives appeared to distance the Europeans from the Americans. But when asked if the EC was isolating the United States, Brinkhorst said, ''Every time we try to do something right, it is perceived as an attempt to isolate the United States.""
\
Carlos Borrego, Portugal's environment minister, said, ""Maybe it's us, and not the United States, that is being isolated.""
\
Borrego would probably find few here who would subscribe to that analysis. ''We have repeatedly had to remind the United States that this is a conference of united nations, and not just one powerful nation,"" said Linn Keng Yaik, a Malaysian diplomat.
\
Nevertheless, the United States, at least publicly, appeared comfortable with its position. On the technical side, it focused on oceans and forests and by the end of the summit had some modest successes on both.
\
It wrested from the Asian forest nations, which had opposed the idea, a general declaration on forest principles. The declaration affirms the role of forests as a global resource while recognizing the sovereign control of nations over timber for development. It was immediately criticized by environmentalists as a weak agreement. ""This does nothing to protect rain forests,"" said William Mankin, a forests expert for the Sierra Club.
\
The Americans also announced they would host a conference next year on the problem of land-based sources of ocean pollution.
\
It was, however, on two related issues - finances and the economic impact of treaties - that the United States stood apart from the world.
\
The Bush administration successfully diluted the climate-change treaty and refused to sign the biodiversity treaty because it feared they would adversely affect the U.S. economy.
\
The United Nations has estimated that a minimum of $3.8 billion a year is needed immediately to begin the programs in the Earth Summit agenda and $125 billion a year by 2000.
\
The United States balked at promising any large new funding source, offering instead a modest $250 million package, the bulk of which will be for forest programs.
\
The U.S. delegation argued that there were not enough details about how new
\
funds would be used and that better management of existing aid and the encouragement of private market investment were wiser approaches.
\
""At the end of the day, there will be some limit of the amount of government aid. . . . Most of the capital in the world is in private hands. How are you going to get that?"" said Michael Young, a deputy undersecretary of state.
\
""In a way the conference is a little reminiscent of the development conferences in the 1960s: 'Please put a pot of money on the table, and we will send you a postcard on how we use it,' "" he said.
\
""We were isolated then as we are to some extent now,"" Young said, ""but it's not a bad position to be in . . . since we were right.""
\
Sen. Steve Symms (R., Idaho), a member of the Senate delegation to the conference, said, ""We won the Cold War with the private market . . . and that's the way to solve these problems.""
\
Not everybody agrees.
\
""This conference will have a bigger impact on the United States than the United States will have on this conference,"" said Sen. Bob Graham (D., Fla.), another member of the Senate delegation.
\
He said that just as the United States used its position to set the terms of world trade after World War II, it was now letting other nations take the lead in setting the ground rules for the future.
\
The broad outlines of those ground rules are contained in the documents issuing from this conference. They include the treaties on climate change and biodiversity, Agenda 21 and the Rio Declaration. Agenda 21 is a voluminous, voluntary ""action plan"" on subjects as varied as radioactive wastes and indigenous people's rights.
\
The Rio Declaration is a proclamation of 27 principles deemed vital to sustainable development of the Earth's resources and the protection of its environment.
\
In addition, there are the two declarations on forests and deserts that will lead to further international discussions, which could then lead to additional treaties.
\
The difficulty in assessing the eventual effectiveness of these documents is that they are so general, after having run a gantlet of regional interests.
\
""They could either be great or mean nothing. It depends upon what happens after Rio,"" said Scott Hajost, international affairs analyst for the Environmental Defense Fund.
\
""We enter the field of action, the field of commitment,"" said Reilly, of the U.S. delegation, ""that will determine the success of the conference.""
\
But Mahbubul Haq, the former finance minister of Pakistan and now a U.N. adviser, said, ""The fact that you can get so many countries to even discuss these issues and agree on some broad principles on development and environment is a step forward.""
\
The EC worked particularly hard, even as heads of state were arriving, on its funding package because it was using that as one measure of success. Without financial resources, Brinkhorst said, ""Agenda 21 will be a hollow shell.""
\
One thing is certain: The problems this conference was convened to address continue to grow. Outside the auditorium where the heads of state made their speeches is a world clock ticking off the growth in population and loss of arable land.
\
When Reilly delivered his address on the opening day of the conference there were, according to the clock, about 5,646,328,137 people in the world and 17,855,585,650 productive acres in the world.
\
By the time President Bush finished his speech Friday, there were 1 million more people and 234,000 fewer productive acres.
\
\
THE RESULTS OF RIO
\
\
RIO DECLARATION
\
A non-binding proclamation of 27 principles ""recognizing the integral and interdependent nature of the Earth."" One of the principles says developed countries should pursue environmentally sound policies ""in view of the pressures their societies place on the global environment and of the technologies and financial resources they command.""
\
FOREST PRINCIPLES
\
One of the most controversial proposals of the summit, a non-binding declaration that supports preserving the world's forests. The United States successfully opposed language requiring protection of forests located primarily in developed countries and linking the protection of tropical forests with aid.
\
AGENDA 21
\
An 800-page non-binding blueprint for preserving the world's environment and promoting patterns of ""sustainable development."" Goals include protecting the atmosphere, halting the spread of deserts, making safe use of toxic chemicals and meeting agricultural needs without destroying the land. U.N. officials estimate it would cost $125 billion a year to meet the goals.
\
CLIMATE CONVENTION
\
Designed to tackle the threat posed by the buildup of man-made gases believed responsible for the ""greenhouse effect."" The treaty, diluted at U.S. insistence, calls for each country to inventory its sources of greenhouse gases and develop a plan to manage them. It sets a general goal of stabilizing emissions of these gases as soon as practicable, but does not mandate any timetable.
\
BIODIVERSITY CONVENTION
\
The treaty that pitted the United States, which refused to sign it, against most other nations. It aims to preserve plant and animal species and ensure that the benefits of this biodiversity are enjoyed not only by those who use it commercially - such as pharmaceutical firms - but by the nations from which these species come. It calls on nations to monitor biological diversity in their borders, set up parks and preserves, develop training and technology programs to benefit the biologically rich but technically poor countries of the Third World. The Bush administration said that signing the agreement could hurt U.S. industry.

"
325,"Tuesday night, I tuned in to President Barack Obama's Oval Office address expecting to learn details of a master plan to stop the oil spilling into the Gulf and a clarion call to action, complete with mobilization of forces, to clean up the apocalyptic mess destroying the environment and the economy there.\What I heard was what I have always heard when Mr. Obama speaks: a lightweight, once-over-lightly, short-on-details-long-on-rhetoric campaign-style speech.\Mr. Obama still seems to think that inspiration is all that the American people are looking for.\The latest Rasmussen poll, taken after that speech, proves Mr. Obama has badly misjudged what we want to hear from our president during a time of crisis.\But Mr. Obama did something else on Tuesday night. He flinched. The leader of the free world succumbed to fear. And in the process, he magnified the fears of the American people by citing statistics about fossil fuels (how much we use and how little we have).\Then, deciding not to waste a good crisis, he turned this speech into a commercial pushing his clean-energy agenda.\Mr. Obama compared the current crisis with the national push to produce the military equipment needed to fight WW II, and I believe there is a really important lesson to be learned from the Greatest Generation - a lesson in resilience.\When did we shift from being courageous, unshakable, can-do people, with leaders who said things like, ""We have nothing to fear but fear itself,"" to being fearful, intimidated people afraid of risks and desiring iron-clad guarantees of perfect safety and freedom from difficulties?\We live in a 21st century world filled with technology and innovation, most of it powered by energy. Locally, we drive everywhere, but we also love to fly. We live and work in climate-controlled environments. Most of us use computers every day, and we run our lives with Blackberries, cell phones, laptops, and Wi-Fi. We have to install powerstrips to accommodate all the electronic tech-gadgets recharging overnight.\We have benefited greatly from technology and the availability of electricity and fuels to power labor-saving equipment. Dishwashers, washers and dryers, kitchen appliances, water heaters, tools and farm equipment have delivered us from a lot of backbreaking work, and technology in the workplace has been the great equalizer. Machines have permitted people to compete for high-paying jobs which once required the physical prowess of only very strong men.\We cannot lose the gains we have made because we are so fearful of fossil fuels and industrial accidents and carbon footprints that we allow ourselves to be reduced to Third World status by a fear-driven environmentalist agenda.\France is largely energy independent, deriving 75 percent of its electricity from nuclear power. The French viewed that move as a national security issue, so that they could not be held hostage by foreign powers.\Meanwhile, the United States suffered one serious nuclear plant incident at Three Mile Island 30 years ago, which we have allowed to make us so afraid of nuclear power generation that we haven't built a new nuclear plant since.\We have allowed recent accidents in coal mines in West Virginia to make us afraid to mine coal, and now the president and others are fanning the fears over offshore oil drilling, allowing this one admittedly horrifying disaster to cause us to abandon our own domestic oil potential.\I don't think Franklin Delano Roosevelt would have reacted the way Mr. Obama has, and I don't think he would have tolerated the American people wanting to throw the baby out with the bath water.\Where is the voice of reason, the voice of empowerment, the voice of determination that will say this to the American people:\""We will not compromise our way of life. We will have nuclear power, and we will demand of the nuclear industry unparalleled safety measures. We will exploit our abundance of coal, develop technology that is environmentally friendly and demand of the industry the protection of miners with the very latest in ventilation and safety equipment. And we will drill for oil wherever we find it, with stringent standards for prevention of environmental impact. We are Americans, the smartest, most innovative people on the face of the earth, and we will not be shaken by an accident, no matter how big the mess. We will clean it up and make sure it never happens again.""\I didn't hear that voice of reason on Tuesday night. I heard a man with an agenda.\The solar panels and wind turbines he talked about, as wonderful as those may turn out to be, are not able to supply our energy needs for the foreseeable future.\And cap and trade and a carbon tax, which he alluded to, would be the nail in the coffin of an economy already on life support.\Carol Petersen is a freelance writer, artist and photographer from Lancaster Township. Her e-mail address is cpetersencolumn@gmail.com."
326,"ILULISSAT, Greenland\Beyond the howl of sled dogs echoing across this hilly coastal village is the thunderclap of ancient icebergs splitting apart, a deafening rumble you feel in your bones.\There's no mistaking its big, loud, and powerful boom, a sound that can work up to a crescendo like rolling thunder. Or be as sudden as a shotgun blast.\Lifelong Greenland resident Karen Jessen Tannajik said people who live in Ilulissat -- an Inuit word for icebergs -- notice more about what's been calved by the village's nearby Sermeq Kujalleq glacier than sights and sounds.\""Right now, they're coming out so quick. There are not so many big ones, but many small ones,"" she said. ""When I am tired, I can watch them and feel them and smell them. It seems like we get our power from them.""\Sermeq Kujalleq is the largest glacier flowing out to sea in the northern hemisphere. The icebergs it calves float along a fjord that was recognized as one of the great wonders of the world when it was added to the World Heritage List in 2004 by the United Nations.\Although millions of people across the world still aren't convinced global warming is as big a problem as scientists claim, symptoms of the planet's warming pop up everywhere in Greenland.\The island's summer fishing season is longer. Crops are being grown in areas never thought possible for cultivation. Tourism is booming.\Even the island's first-ever craft brewery, Greenland Beer, is a product of global warming. The company markets the water it uses as purer than what is found in other parts of the world because it comes from melted inland ice formed thousands of years before the Industrial Revolution.\But Greenland's long-term problems from global warming will likely overshadow such short-term gains.\A lack of sea ice has made winter passage between settlements more difficult, if not impossible. That's a huge problem because there are no roads between villages. Greenland is one of the only places on Earth that relies on sled dogs as a primary mode of transportation.\Fishing is Greenland's No. 1 industry. Mild winters, especially north of Ilulissat in Uummannaq on Greenland's east coast, have made it treacherous for residents to fish or hunt on what little ice is left. \Greenland is the world's top producer of halibut and cold-water prawns. Halibut in particular have become more elusive, plunging to greater depths as the ocean temperature has warmed.\Two leaders of the Ilulissat fishing community, Peter Olsen and Johanne Mathaussen, said the downward movement of halibut makes those fish more difficult and costly to catch. Full-sized halibut that used to be available at depths of about 1,000 feet now swim at depths of about 2,600 feet.\Ove Rosbach, who has fished the Arctic for decades, blamed the decline on warmer ocean currents flowing to the north. He said a similar phenomenon occurred in the 1950s. Halibut returned when the ocean current cooled in the 1970s, but Mr. Rosbach said things feel different now.\""[Even] when the sun is not shining, it's still very warm,"" he said. ""The sun is warmer than normal now.""\This time looks different\To be fair, Greenland is a fickle place. A Danish territory of 56,000 people spread out across a land mass more than three times the size of Texas, it has gone through extreme warming and cooling periods before.\Literature produced for visitors claims various cultures of Inuits have lived on Greenland for more than 4,500 years, although it also notes extensive periods in which the island had no inhabitants -- usually when climatic conditions were so extremely cold there was little, if any, wildlife to hunt.\Changes to the Earth's climate are nothing new. Scientists believe natural climate variations occur every 100,000 years based on how the planet spins, tilts, and orbits around the sun.\The sun itself changes. NASA believes that volcanic eruptions on Earth, coupled with natural changes to the sun, explain warming and cooling from 1000 through 1850.\But the space agency also believes that Earth has been on a one-way warming trend triggered by human activity since the Industrial Revolution began about 1850.\Heat-trapping carbon dioxide, the chief greenhouse gas, is on a course to exceed 500 parts per million in the atmosphere later this century, something the human race has never experienced, said Daniel Schrag, director of Harvard University's Center for the Environment.\An abundance of greenhouse gases means higher temperatures on land and in the oceans. They rise in the atmosphere and trap the sun's energy, keeping heat from escaping back into space.\A climate variation of three to five degrees ""is a really big deal,"" considering that much of the Earth was covered in ice 18,000 years ago when the planet was only an average of five degrees cooler, Mr. Schrag said. He believes that summer sea ice could be gone from the Arctic by 2015 -- well ahead of the earlier projection of 2050.\""We are performing an experiment at a planetary scale that hasn't been done for millions of years. No one knows exactly what will happen,"" he said.\The scientific consensus about climate change is based primarily around evidence of increasing air and ocean temperatures, accelerated melting of snow and ice at the polar ice caps, and rising ocean levels.\Records on global surface temperatures only go back to 1850, but the world's most prestigious body of climatologists -- the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change -- noted in its landmark 2007 series of climate reports that the Earth's average temperatures for 11 of the 12 years from 1995 to 2006 were at or near record-high levels.\Those reports concluded there has been ""unequivocal"" warming of the planet and claimed with a certainty of greater than 90 percent that human activity was largely responsible. The data those reports used came, in part, from satellite images showing an accelerated loss of northern polar sea ice since 1978 and a rise in average sea levels since 1961 -- accelerating after 1993.\Ilulissat is Greenland's third-largest village, with 4,500 people and just as many sled dogs. Each summer, it hosts dozens of researchers and hundreds of tourists. Many of the latter see Greenland's famous Eqi glacier breaking off into seawater from the comfort of luxury cruise ships.\Nearly everyone who visits Ilulissat seems to have a feeling of suspended reality when they open their hotel blinds each morning. Almost without fail, the icebergs they saw the night before have been replaced by new ones.\How can such massive hunks of ice come and go so fast? After all, they were formed from thousands of years of compressed snow. And they look harder to budge than skyscrapers.\But it happens. The frequency that the Sermeq Kujalleq glacier calved icebergs over the past decade rose, throwing some of the world's top Greenland experts for a loop.\One of them is Swiss-born Konrad ""Koni"" Steffen of the University of Colorado. He has done field work in the Arctic since 1975 and on Greenland's ice sheet at least once every year since 1990. His work is cited in major publications, and he is at the table of most major climate talks.\The costs of warming\Conventional wisdom during the 1970s was that Greenland's ice sheet would take thousands of years to melt. ""Nobody would have predicted 10 to 15 years ago that Greenland would lose ice that fast,"" Mr. Steffen said. ""That revises all of the textbooks."" \His take-home message: Forget the scientific modeling. Greenland is melting faster than anyone's best guess.\""How can you have an ice sheet so big and respond that quickly?"" he asked. ""That is still part of the mystery, to be honest.""\Ohio State's Jason Box is perhaps the most famous of Mr. Steffen's former students, having done research in Greenland every summer except one since 1994.\Mr. Box has likewise gained attention from the national media for his work. He synthesizes data he and others generate into a ""holistic"" view of Greenland's thaw, using a number of tools, including time-lapse photography.\Americans may fret about paying more for electricity if the next Congress enacts a carbon tax or strict regulations on utilities to combat global warming. But Mr. Box said that cost will be a fraction of what adapting to climate change will cost them years from now, especially if nothing's done to curb emissions now.\Billions of dollars will be needed to construct New Orleans-like levees along the nation's coastline to guard against flooding, he said.\""It's going to get too expensive for the U.S. to mitigate,"" Mr. Box said. ""It's going to be kind of like taking on a global war against terrorism. It's going to be too expensive. It's going to sap the U.S. economy.""\Sea level rise is ""going to cost people whether their properties are flooded or not,"" he said.\On average, Greenland's ice sheet loses 300 billion tons of ice a year. That hasn't been enough to raise global sea level a millimeter a year, though.\The Greenland ice sheet has been eroding almost annually for 50 years, except for a short period in the 1970s when temperatures were cool enough in summer to keep it ""in balance"" by rejuvenating itself enough in winter. But the greatest ice losses on record are recent -- in 2003, 2005, and 2007, Mr. Box said.\In Alaska, coastal villages are eroding. Long stretches of highway are impassable for months at a time because they were built on permafrost that is melting.\One of the most heavily affected villages, Newtok (population 400), was told in June that it will get $3.3 million in state aid to help relocate displaced residents to higher ground.\Alaska is putting aside nearly $13 million to protect six remote villages in the coming year. That could be only the beginning of a massive tab for taxpayers. According to the Government Accountability Office, erosion and flooding affect 184 of Alaska's 213 native villages to some degree.\In Greenland, Ilulissat's soccer field is slumping because of permafrost melt. Tourists hiking marked trails to see the village's famous glacier feel the spongy soil.\""It's actually not a faith issue but whether or not you believe in the science. In its purest form [climate change] is objective science,"" Mr. Box said. ""The ice in the Arctic is the canary in the coal mine. To put it bluntly, the canary is dead."""
327,"
They have the largest staff - 700 - at the Earth Summit. They have the largest offices. And it is rumored that they are prepared to donate billions in environmental and development aid to poorer nations.
\
While the United States careens from controversy to controversy, the Japanese appear to be emerging as the world's environmental leaders.
\
""We think that what automobiles were in the 1970s, environment and pollution-control technology will be in the future,"" said Hikaru Kobayashi, an analyst with Japan's Environment Agency.
\
Cecilia Song of the World Wildlife Fund in Japan said many Japanese believed that this ""is a perfect time to assume leadership and change the view of Japan.""
\
The delegation's spokesman, Sadaaki Numata, was more reticent: ""Each country will try to make its contribution commensurate with its abilities.""
\
Most of the speculation at the Earth Summit, however, has centered on the rumors of a massive multibillion-dollar aid package, which could make Japan the largest donor of foreign aid in the world, surpassing the United States.
\
Currently, Japan gives about $9.1 billion a year; the United States about $11.7 billion. Under the reported package, Japan would provide an additional $7 billion over the next five years.
\
""I appreciate the active interest of everybody in the size of our pockets and how much would come out of it,"" Numata said. ""But I can't count on that.""
\
Some observers said Japan might not make its funding and environmental positions known until after the summit, in deference to the United States.
\
The Japanese are not the only ones looking to fill the leadership vacuum left by the United States, which has refused to sign the biodiversity treaty, sought significant weakening of the climate-change treaty and has given no sign that it will announce significant financing programs.
\
Yesterday, the European Community invited other nations to join in signing a declaration to stabilize emissions of carbon dioxide, believed to be the major cause of global warming, at 1990 levels by the year 2000. The United States had opposed the target and timetable.
\
The EC also announced its members would support the goal of donating 0.7 percent of their gross national products to overseas environment and development aid.
\
And the EC was working on a French proposal to create a pool of ""fresh money"" that would be available immediately for implementing the decisions of the Earth Summit.
\
""We feel that we need to move immediately to change our behavior . . . not wait,"" said Carlos Borrego, the president of the EC environmental ministers.
\
The Europeans also are still pushing their plan for a ""carbon tax"" that would be levied on fossil fuels in industrialized countries - to spur energy efficiency and raise funds for global environmental protection.
\
The tax, starting at $1 for the equivalent of one barrel of oil and rising to $3, could raise $40 billion to $100 billion a year, by EC estimates. But the Europeans have made it clear they need the participation of Japan and the United States.
\
""We are pretty much of the position that we would not do it alone,"" said
\
Lauren Jans Brinkhorst, the head of the European delegation.
\
Brinkhorst, however, noted: ""This is the first summit without superpowers, and leadership is determined by the quality of the proposals.""
\
For the Japanese, environmental leadership is good business.
\
""We have found that pollution control is good for the economy. For while it is a cost on one end, it creates a demand for new technology on the other,"" said Kobayashi.
\
Indeed, 75 percent of all the world's air-pollution units that remove sulfur dioxide from smokestack emissions are in Japan, according to Kobayashi.
\
""Carbon-dioxide technology is going to be important,"" Kobayashi said.
\
But the Japanese are not viewing the environment as solely a market. It is also a political field. Japan is promoting a plan called ""New Earth 21"" and has in the last two years established the Research Institute for Innovative Technology and the International Center for Technology Transfer - two agencies to develop and promote technology worldwide.
\
""We very much want to work with countries . . . particularly developing countries"" on new technology, said Katsuo Seiki, a Japanese Environment Agency official.

328,"Radar use not best solution for speeding \Just remember one of the old adages, ""Be careful what you wish for."" If Lancaster City Council gets its wish (""Vote expected on police use of speed radar,"" June 3) and Pennsylvania's municipal police forces get the authority to use radar, consider this: \Pennsylvania has 1,117 law enforcement agencies (many of these being small municipal departments), according to a 2008 report from the Bureau of Justice Statistics. In the 10 miles between Columbia and Lancaster, there are at least five of these departments and many more in the surrounding area. What if they all set up speed traps? And they will! \How long before you are hurrying to a meeting or running a little late for work and you are caught in one of these traps? It won't be long! \More law-abiding citizens than outlaw speeders would be affected by this change. I think this legislation would harm rather than help in a state with so many departments already clogging our overburdened courts. \A far better way to combat speeding drivers here and statewide would be to strengthen the state's reckless driver laws. Five to 7 mph over the speed limit on a city street would be looked at more harshly than the same infraction on a highway. \Roger A. Culbreth Sr. \Lancaster \Prison protesters don't see big picture \It never ceases to amaze me to have so-called ""do-gooders"" protest the prison at 625 E. King St. - this time because prisoners did not have cheese on their sandwiches and were yelling out the windows, saying how hard they have it in jail (""Protesters support inmates,"" May 30). \Where do the prisoners think they are - living and eating at the Waldorf Astoria? They are in prison for a reason. They broke the law. Some prisoners have it better in jail than they do on the outside. \Having spent 40 years in law enforcement, I have seen things that the average person will never see - just like all the other police officers and retired officers. \I wonder how the do-gooders would feel if they, a family member or friend was the victim of a crime such as a hostage taking, home burglary or murder. Many inmates released from prison return to crime. \In my opinion, Lancaster County Prison Warden Paul Smeal and his staff are not there to baby-sit the prisoners. They are there to protect the public and run the prison or jail the best they can. \You can say all you want that we should pity the poor prisoners, until it hits home. Then it's a different story. And don't think it can't happen. \Perhaps the do-gooders could protest for the victim one day. \John L. Finger \Lancaster \Inmates have reason to complain \Regarding a recent report of inmate complaints (""Warden responds to renewed inmate complaints,"" May 27), I'd like to address the issue of the lack of a humane living environment at Lancaster County Prison. \We're all advised to seek a cool place to hang out when the summer temperatures reach unbearable heights. As a former inmate, I can tell you that, at Lancaster County Prison, inmates are subjected to cells with no cooling system; temperatures can reach 100 degrees for days, and elderly and other inmates are not accommodated. \In the winter, well, we know that heat rises and cold sinks. The furnace at the prison is located near the top floor, so the lower three cell blocks are subjected to freezing or near-freezing temperatures, especially the ground floor. Since cold air dominates the lower cell blocks, any heat from the top floor is lost on its way down. \In winter's cold, air flow directly out of the vents is 40 to 50 degrees, but is immediately swallowed up by the 32-degree temperature in the cells, as well as the day room. To make things worse, the windows are highly drafty. Inmates are forced to violate prison rules by finding whatever way they can to keep warm, such as fastening their blankets to the window frame and wearing their fatigues to bed. \Seth Carl \Lancaster \Going green comes with hefty price tag \If you think going green for your electricity needs is a good idea, then you need to take a look at what is going on in Germany. Germany's aggressive and reckless expansion of wind and solar has come with a hefty price tag for consumers. \Some 800,000 poor Germans have their electricity cut off each year because they cannot afford to pay their bills that are being assessed a renewable energy surcharge. German physicist Horst Joachim Ludecke issued a sharply worded paper saying the transition to green energy was brought about by state propaganda, green brainwashing and a corrupt mainstream media. \Here in Pennsylvania, we have an abundance of natural resources, and energy companies still provide affordable electricity. If you are worried about a climate meltdown, just remember new coal-fired power plants are emerging all over developing countries and there has not been the slightest global warming for 18 years. \Beware of those lobbying for expensive green energy or a carbon tax. They have something most unpleasant in mind. \Dale Horst \Elizabeth Township \Immigration policy endangering country \Why are we still importing foreigners into this country? Our government's policy of inviting immigrants and issuing visas exceeds all other developed nations combined. \And with an estimated 11.7 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S. as of 2012, that number has roughly doubled over the past 20 years. Michael Cutler, a retired Immigration and Naturalization Service official, warns of the dangers of uncontrolled entry into our country. \Why aren't we being told the real extent of this situation? According to the Federation for American Immigration Reform, Pennsylvania spent $728 million in 2010 for the education, medical care and incarceration of an estimated 140,000 undocumented immigrants. \Humanitarian reasons are clearly being used as a guise to channel our emotions and allow the doors to stay open. But we are, indeed, being pillaged of fortune, property and language, and our culture is evolving (or being engineered) right before our eyes. \The current situation is urgent. This enticement of foreigners into our country will continue to destroy it. Using mass immigration tactics is nothing new in history, and our current policy to invite more immigrants to come here (from wherever) puts us all at risk. \Richard Swomley \Lancaster"

If it generates or carries electricity, somebody, somewhere is opposed to it, and environmentalists are often first in line.
\
The Virginia-based Piedmont Environmental Council, for instance, is just one of the green groups implacably against the proposal for a new 500,000-volt transmission corridor through Rappahannock County. But Dominion Virginia Power says existing lines will become overloaded by 2011 without such a corridor.
\
Environmental Advocates of New York wants you to know how firmly it opposes Broadwater, a proposed liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility in Long Island Sound. ""As large as the Queen Mary II, this factory would harm this estuary of national significance and begin the industrialization of Long Island Sound,"" it declares.
\
In the mountains of Pennsylvania, a green group called Save Our Allegheny Ridges (SOAR) is out to stop wind farm development. ""Once installed, these monsters will dominate the landscape while altering scenic vistas and wildlife habitat forever,"" the group says.
\
Meanwhile, the Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound has tapped into a network of wealthy donors to stop the Cape Wind Project off Massachusetts' Cape Cod. Politicians have lined up behind the Alliance. In 2005, then-Massachusetts Attorney General Tom Reilly declared his passionate support for renewable energy, but avowed, ""There is a right way to do things and there is a wrong way, and this is the wrong way.""
\
Even if we accept that there are strong, environmentally based arguments to be made for all these positions (and I do concede that point), our twin energy and climate crises may mean we no longer have the luxury to choose ""none of the above."" U.S. energy demand is growing at an inexorable 1.8 percent every year. If we expect our lights to come on when the switch is flicked, and if we want to save our planet from the worst effects of climate change as population continues to climb, then we're going to have to accept some electric power development.
\
We can't keep turning down the cleanest practical forms of energy because it will spoil the view or take out some wildlife habitat. Sad as it might be, the alternative is so much worse. Today, more than half of all electricity in the U.S. (including Cape Cod) comes from climate-aggravating coal, and we're producing more than 20 percent of the world's coal-related carbon emissions. If President Bush's energy vision were realized, we'd be building hundreds of new coal plants. Coal, he said, ""should be at the heart of America's energy strategy.""
\
But far more damaging to the environment than wind farms on Pennsylvania's ridgelines or LNG terminals in Long Island Sound is the mountaintop-removal coal mining now going on throughout much of Appalachia. Pristine and ancient mountains are blasted out of existence, reduced to contaminated rubble that is then dumped into nearby valleys, smothering streams and rivers in the process. This is the dark side of ""clean coal."" In West Virginia alone, 300,000 acres of hardwood forests have been destroyed by these highly destructive but cheap mining practices.
\
Very few environmentalists like nuclear power, but a few brave souls (including James Lovelock, originator of the Gaia theory, and Stewart Brand, founder of the Whole Earth Catalog) are taking a second look at it simply because -- despite huge issues of safety and waste storage -- nukes produce no global warming emissions.
\
Yes, the best answer to our climate and energy problems is aggressive conservation, and California (which has held electric demand in check as its population rises) provides an excellent example for other states. A carbon tax would be an excellent idea, too. But even conservation and regulation together are unlikely to keep demand in check. A diverse portfolio of high-output energy alternatives is needed, and needed quickly.

Fervent:1. Hot, burning, glowing, boiling.

-- Oxford English Dictionary
\
Fervently"" is how America will henceforth engage in talks on global warming. So said the president's climate change negotiator Sunday in Germany, at a U.N. conference on reducing carbon emissions. This vow was fervently applauded by conferees welcoming the end of what AP's news story called the Bush administration's ""eight years of obdurate participation"" in climate talks.
\
Reducing carbon emissions supposedly will reverse warming, if it resumes after the current period without warming, a period that began, according to statistics published by the World Meteorological Organization, 11 years ago. Regarding the reversing, the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change has many ambitions, as outlined in a working group's 16-page ""information note"" to ""facilitate discussions.""
\
For example: ""Tariffs can be lowered to grant special preference to climate-friendly goods, or they can be maintained at high levels to discourage trade in GHG (greenhouse gas)-intensive goods and services."" The working group says protectionism ""in the service of climate change objectives"" might virtuously ""shelter domestic producers of climate-friendly goods.""
\
Furthermore, using ""border carbon adjustment,"" a nation might virtuously ""impose costs on imports equivalent to that (sic) faced by domestic producers"" operating under a carbon tax. Or a nation with a cap-and-trade regime regulating carbon emissions by domestic manufacturers might require foreign manufacturers ""to buy offsets at the border equal to that (sic) which the producer would have been forced to purchase had the good been produced domestically.""
\
Cynics will see only potential for mischief by governments, including the U.S. government, using such measures to give a green patina to protectionism. Meanwhile, the U.S. government is having its own problems with one ""climate-friendly good"" that might not be. Last week The New York Times front page carried this headline: ""The Bulb That Saved the Planet May Be a Little Less Than Billed.""
\
The story recounted some Americans' misadventures with the new light bulbs that almost all Americans -- all but those who are filling their closets with supplies of today's incandescent bulbs -- will have to use after the phaseout of today's bulbs in 2014. (You missed that provision of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007?)
\
A San Francisco -- naturally -- couple emerged from Al Gore's movie ""An Inconvenient Truth"" incandescent with desire to think globally and act locally, in their home. So they replaced their incandescent bulbs with the compact fluorescents that Congress says must soon be ubiquitous. ""Instead of having a satisfying green moment, however,"" the Times reported, ""they wound up coping with a mess.""
\
Although supposed to last 10,000 hours and save, the Times says, ""as much as"" $5.40 a year in electricity costs, some bulbs died within a few hours. Some experts, reports the Times, ""blame the government for the quality problems,"" saying its push to cut the bulbs' prices prompted manufacturers to use inferior components. Furthermore, some experts have written a guide saying the new bulbs require ""a little insight and planning."" The Times says that ""may be an understatement.""
\
The bulbs, says the Times, ""do not do well in hot places with little airflow, like recessed ceiling fixtures,"" and some do not work ""with dimmers or three-way sockets."" And: ""Be aware that compact fluorescents can take one to three minutes to reach full brightness. This is not a defect."" Well, if you say so. Because all fluorescents contain mercury, a toxic metal, they must never be put in the trash, so Home Depot and other chains offer bins for disposing of dangerous bulbs. Driving to one of these disposal points might not entirely nullify the bulbs' environmental benefits. Besides, the Times summarizes the Environmental Protection Agency's helpful suggestions for coping with the environmental dangers caused when one of these environment-saving bulbs breaks:
\
""Clear people and pets from the room and open a window for at least 15 minutes if possible. Avoid vacuuming. Scoop up larger pieces with stiff paper or cardboard, pick up smaller residue with sticky tape, and wipe the area with a damp cloth. Put everything into a sealed plastic bag or sealed glass jar. In most cases, this can be put in the trash, but the EPA recommends checking local rules.""
\
Worrywarts wonder what will happen when a lazy or careless, say, 10 percent of 300 million Americans put their worn-out bulbs in the trash. Stop worrying. What do you think? That Congress, architect of the ethanol industry and designer of automobiles, does not think things through?

Last week, Chris Cali, a Scranton Prep graduate and junior biology major at Villanova University, shared his experiences living in a sustainable environment last summer at the Center for Sustainable Development Studies in Costa Rica.
\
In recognition of Earth Day, I've asked Chris to offer tips for sustainable living in order to promote health and wellness. Here are his 11 suggestions:
\
a?, a?, a?,
\
- Solar panels: Getting energy directly from the sun is one of the cleanest and most efficient ways to make electricity. Solar panels on your roof can reduce your electricity bill to almost nothing, and the costly initial investment will pay off in time.
\
- Drive a fuel-efficient vehicle: Driving a car with good gas mileage is a no-brainer with the current price of gas. While saving money, you will also be reducing your emission of carbon dioxide and therefore helping to fight climate change. Look into getting a hybrid electric vehicle, as there are tons of options now available, including SUVs and trucks. The extra cost of the vehicle will most likely be made up with the savings at the gas pump.
\
- Rain barrels: Reducing daily water use can save money and water for times of harsh weather. Collecting rainwater from the gutters and using it to water plants or the lawn is a good way to save water.
\
- Composting: Composting fruit and vegetable remains is a good way, along with recycling, to reduce the amount of waste we send to the landfill. The composted soil can then be used to fertilize your own garden.
\
- Eat organic and local foods: Organic foods are grown without the use of any artificial pesticides or fertilizers and are not genetically modified. Studies have shown that organic fruits and vegetables actually contain more nutrients than conventionally grown food, and locally grown foods do not have the artificial preservatives that are used on commercial crops.
\
- Eat less meat: The meat industry in the United States harms the environment and our health. Animals are kept in disgusting conditions that are breeding grounds for E. coli and salmonella, animal wastes pollute the air and water, and tremendous amounts of water and food are used to raise the animals. If you love a good steak like I do, buy grass-fed beef instead. Grass-fed cows are treated better, and the meat contains more omega 3 fatty acids necessary for a healthy diet.
\
- Visit nature: Ecotourism involves visiting a place to experience and learn about nature. It offers hope to preserve nature while at the same time bringing economic development to local communities. Be wary, however, because not all ecotourism is sustainable. Costa Rica has a government-run program that certifies hotels and tour operators as sustainable. Travel websites such as Trip advisor now display whether hotels merit a ""CST"" - Certificate for Sustainable Tourism - so visitors can better chose sustainable options.
\
- Write to Congress: The United States is one of the few developed nations that doesn't have some restriction on carbon emissions known to cause global warming. A carbon tax on polluting companies would bring in much-needed revenue for our government. Alternatively, a cap-and-trade system, which allows companies to buy and sell carbon credits to each other, would promote greener industry while fighting climate change.
\
- Support green business: Consumers have power when it comes to making our economy more sustainable. Read labels and choose products that do not contain substances that will harm the environment. Buy products made in sustainable factories, and buy stock in companies that are environmentally friendly. Boycott companies that are known to pollute or treat their workers unjustly.
\
- Plant trees: Planting trees and preventing deforestation is the cheapest and most effective way to fight climate change. Tropical forests are especially important, as they take in huge amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Every tree helps, so plant some in your own yard.
\
- Be less consumptive: Walk more; use less gas. Eat less; use less food and energy. Both you and the planet will be healthier.

There is much in the House cap-and-trade energy bill that just passed that I absolutely hate. It is too weak in key areas and way too complicated in others. A simple, straightforward carbon tax would have made much more sense than this Rube Goldberg contraption. It is pathetic that we couldn't do better. It is appalling that so much had to be given away to polluters. It stinks. It's a mess. I detest it.
\
Now let's get it passed in the Senate and make it law.
\
Why? Because, for all its flaws, this bill is the first comprehensive attempt by America to mitigate climate change by putting a price on carbon emissions. Rejecting this bill would have been read in the world as America voting against the reality and urgency of climate change and would have undermined clean energy initiatives everywhere.
\
More important, my gut tells me that if the U.S. government puts a price on carbon, even a weak one, it will usher in a new mind-set among consumers, investors, farmers, innovators and entrepreneurs that in time will make a big difference -- much like the first warnings that cigarettes could cause cancer. The morning after that warning no one ever looked at smoking the same again.
\
Ditto if this bill passes. Henceforth, every investment decision made in America -- about how homes are built, products manufactured or electricity generated -- will look for the least-cost low-carbon option. And weaving carbon emissions into every business decision will drive innovation and deployment of clean technologies to a whole new level and make energy efficiency much more affordable. That ain't beanbag.
\
Now that the bill is heading for the Senate, though, we must, ideally, try to improve it, but, at a minimum, guard against diluting it any further. To do that we need the help of the three parties most responsible for how weak the bill already is: the Republican Party, President Barack Obama and We the People.
\
This bill is not weak because its framers, Reps. Henry Waxman and Ed Markey, wanted it this way. ""They had to make the compromises they did,"" said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign, ""because almost every House Republican voted against the bill and did nothing to try to improve it. So to get it passed, they needed every coal-state Democrat, and that meant they had to water it down to bring them on board.""
\
What are Republicans thinking? It is not as if they put forward a different strategy, like a carbon tax. Does the GOP want to be the party of sex scandals and polluters or does it want to be a partner in helping America dominate the next great global industry: ET -- energy technology? How could Republicans become so anti-environment, just when the country is going green?
\
Historically speaking, ""Republicans can claim as much credit for America's environmental leadership as Democrats,"" noted Glenn Prickett, senior vice president at Conservation International. ""The two greatest environmental presidents in American history were Teddy Roosevelt, who created our national park system, and Richard Nixon, whose administration gave us the Clean Air Act and the Environmental Protection Agency."" The elder George Bush signed the 1993 Rio Treaty, to preserve biodiversity.
\
Yes, this bill's goal of reducing U.S. carbon emissions to 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 is nowhere near what science tells us we need to mitigate climate change. But it also contains significant provisions to prevent new buildings from becoming energy hogs, to make our appliances the most energy efficient in the world and to help preserve forests in places like the Amazon.
\
We need Republicans who believe in fiscal conservatism and conservation joining this legislation in the Senate. We want a bill that transforms the whole country not one that just threads a political needle. I hope they start listening to green Republicans like Dick Lugar, George Shultz and Arnold Schwarzenegger.
\
I also hope we will hear more from Obama. Something feels very calculating in how he has approached this bill, as if he doesn't quite want to get his hands dirty, as if he is ready to twist arms in private, but not so much that if the bill goes down he will get tarnished. That is no way to fight this war. He is going to have to mobilize the whole country to pressure the Senate -- by educating Americans, with speech after speech, about the opportunities and necessities of a serious climate/energy bill. If he is not ready to risk failure by going all out, failure will be the most likely result.
\
And then there is We the People. Attention all young Americans: Your climate future is being decided right now in the cloakrooms of the Capitol, where the coal lobby holds huge sway. You want to make a difference? Then get out of Facebook and into somebody's face. Get a million people on the Washington Mall calling for a price on carbon. That will get the Senate's attention. Play hardball or don't play at all.

THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN writes for The New York Times.
"
335,"
Climate researchers are focused on the Arctic in recent years as nowhere else on Earth is our rapidly changing climate so apparent than the Arctic.
\
One of the most shocking examples of our rapidly changing climate is the loss of Arctic sea ice. The sea ice in the Arctic shrinks and grows with the changing of the seasons, but recent years have shown a stunning decline in the amount of summer sea ice left at the end of summer.
\
According to NOAA, ""In 2012, summer minimum sea ice extent was recorded at 3.41 million square kilometers: the lowest of the satellite era, and 18 percent lower than in 2007, when the previous record of 4.17 million square kilometers was recorded.""
\
Since 1979, the Arctic sea ice minimum extent has shrunk by more than 50 percent. Arctic sea ice plays a critical role in helping to cool the earth as its white surface reflects much of the sun's energy back to space.
\
Since much of the Arctic is ocean, the lack of sea ice means now the darker colored open ocean is absorbing heat, much like a black car is sweltering hot when left in the summer sun, and is amplifying warming in the Arctic.
\
As the National Research Council says in a report released last month entitled Abrupt Impacts of Climate Change: Anticipating Surprises, ""The change in sea ice is largely irreversible, and substantial cooling is required to reestablish the original sea ice cover.""
\
Once we lose this sea ice, there's no going back.
\
The opening of the Arctic poses a threat to our national security. Lack of sea ice means our Arctic coastlines must be monitored and patrolled more closely for increased traffic using now opened shipping lanes and searching for more extractable resources.
\
In November, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel unveiled the Department of Defense's first ever Arctic Strategy, saying ""As climate change and the viability of new energy sources shape the global environment, these shifts will affect our strategic outlook going forward, especially in the Arctic.""
\
Recently Russian President Vladimir Putin told his military leadership they should build up their forces in the Arctic as a priority.
\
Tensions will increase as countries bordering the Arctic including the U.S., Russia and Canada maneuver to claim natural resources that may be beneath International waters.
\
In a sad and ironic twist, last September the first ever bulk cargo ship passed through the fabled Northwest Passage. The Nordic Orion, a 225-meter vessel carried a load of coal from Vancouver, British Columbia, and headed for Finland; its cargo destined to be burned adding even more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere and speeding the Arctic's demise even quicker.
\
In our glee to claim new shipping lanes and undiscovered natural resources in an ice-free Arctic, no one seems to question why the Arctic is becoming ice-free or what the implications of this may be for life on this planet.
\
Arctic species such as the walrus, ringed-seal, and polar bear depend on sea ice for their survival. In 2008 the world caught a glimpse of what the future may hold for polar bears in the Arctic when a satellite-tracked female polar bear and her yearling cub spent 9 days straight swimming in the Beaufort Sea searching for sea ice to hunt on. After a 426 mile swim she finally found sea ice, but in the process lost her cub, likely drowned due to exhaustion, and 22% of her body weight. Many Arctic species are threatened with extinction as the Arctic warms, there is nowhere left for them to migrate to.
\
A growing amount of research is linking the loss of Arctic sea ice with changing weather patterns around the world. Jennifer Francis, a Research Professor at Rutgers University, recently published research showing the amount of warming seen in the Arctic is causing the jet stream to slow and take large meandering patterns. The contrast in temperature between the equator and the poles is what pushes the jet stream. A warming Arctic means less of a temperature contrast resulting in a weakened jet stream, the jet stream looks less like the rolling west to east waves you would typically see, and more like a slow, meandering river with more of a north-south pattern. This is causing some of the same weather patterns to be ""stuck"" in place for extended periods of time, leading to extremes in weather. It's also causing warmer southern temperatures to be pulled further north than usual and frigid Arctic temperatures to be pulled further south than usual, exactly why the ""polar vortex"" wasn't in the Arctic last week where it's usually found.
\
The news fortunately is not all bad. We have time to act to limit the amount of warming we are causing by burning fossil fuels, but time is limited. This will require us to act on a global scale and the U.S. must take a lead role in reducing our emissions. Most economists agree, a revenue-neutral carbon tax is the most efficient way to do so and if done smartly, can push other countries to do the same. Last June, President Obama asked Congress to bring him a market-based approach to addressing climate change, a revenue-neutral carbon tax is a conservative, free-market solution to the climate crisis.

""They had to make the compromises they did,"" said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign, ""because almost every House Republican voted against the bill and did nothing to try to improve it. So to get it passed, they needed every coal-state Democrat, and that meant they had to water it down to bring them on board.""\What are Republicans thinking? It is not as if they put forward a different strategy, like a carbon tax. Does the GOP want to be the party of sex scandals and polluters or does it want to be a partner in helping America dominate the next great global industry: ET -- energy technology? How could Republicans become so anti-environment, just when the country is going green?\Historically speaking, ""Republicans can claim as much credit for America's environmental leadership as Democrats,"" noted Glenn Prickett, senior vice president at Conservation International. ""The two greatest environmental presidents in American history were Teddy Roosevelt, who created our national park system, and Richard Nixon, whose administration gave us the Clean Air Act and the Environmental Protection Agency."" The elder George Bush signed the 1993 Rio Treaty, to preserve biodiversity.\Yes, this bill's goal of reducing U.S. carbon emissions to 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 is nowhere near what science tells us we need to mitigate climate change. But it also contains significant provisions to prevent new buildings from becoming energy hogs, to make our appliances the most energy efficient in the world and to help preserve carbon-absorbing forests in places like the Amazon.\We need Republicans who believe in fiscal conservatism and conservation joining this legislation in the Senate. We want a bill that transforms the whole country not one that just threads a political needle. I hope they start listening to green Republicans like Dick Lugar, George Shultz and Arnold Schwarzenegger.\I also hope we will hear more from Barack Obama. Something feels very calculating in how he has approached this bill, as if he doesn't quite want to get his hands dirty, as if he is ready to twist arms in private, but not so much that if the bill goes down he will get tarnished.\That is no way to fight this war. Mr. Obama is going to have to mobilize the whole country to pressure the Senate -- by educating Americans, with speech after speech, about the opportunities and necessities of a serious climate/energy bill. If he is not ready to risk failure by going all out, failure will be the most likely result.\And then there is We the People. Attention all young Americans: Your climate future is being decided right now in the cloakrooms of the Capitol, where the coal lobby holds huge sway. You want to make a difference? Then get out of Facebook and into somebody's face. Get a million people on the Washington Mall calling for a price on carbon. That will get the Senate's attention. Play hardball or don't play at all."

Climate researchers are focused on the Arctic in recent years, as nowhere else on Earth is our rapidly changing climate so apparent than the Arctic.
\
One of the most shocking examples of our rapidly changing climate is the loss of Arctic sea ice. The sea ice in the Arctic shrinks and grows with the changing of the seasons, but recent years have shown a stunning decline in the amount of summer sea ice left at the end of summer.
\
According to NOAA, ""In 2012, summer minimum sea ice extent was recorded at 3.41 million square kilometers: the lowest of the satellite era, and 18 percent lower than in 2007, when the previous record of 4.17 million square kilometers was recorded.""
\
Since 1979, the Arctic sea ice minimum extent has shrunk by more than 50 percent. Arctic sea ice plays a critical role in helping to cool the earth as its white surface reflects much of the sun's energy back to space.
\
Since much of the Arctic is ocean, the lack of sea ice means now the darker colored open ocean is absorbing heat, much like a black car is sweltering hot when left in the summer sun, and is amplifying warming in the Arctic.
\
As the National Research Council says in a report released last month entitled Abrupt Impacts of Climate Change: Anticipating Surprises, ""The change in sea ice is largely irreversible, and substantial cooling is required to reestablish the original sea ice cover.""
\
Once we lose this sea ice, there's no going back.
\
The opening of the Arctic poses a threat to our national security. Lack of sea ice means our Arctic coastlines must be monitored and patrolled more closely for increased traffic using now opened shipping lanes and searching for more extractable resources.
\
In November, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel unveiled the Department of Defense's first ever Arctic Strategy, saying ""As climate change and the viability of new energy sources shape the global environment, these shifts will affect our strategic outlook going forward, especially in the Arctic.""
\
Recently Russian President Vladimir Putin told his military leadership they should build up their forces in the Arctic as a priority.
\
Tensions will increase as countries bordering the Arctic, including the U.S., Russia and Canada maneuver to claim natural resources that may be beneath International waters.
\
In a sad and ironic twist, last September the first ever bulk cargo ship passed through the fabled Northwest Passage. The Nordic Orion, a 225-meter vessel carried a load of coal from Vancouver, British Columbia, and headed for Finland; its cargo destined to be burned, adding even more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere and speeding the Arctic's demise even quicker.
\
In our glee to claim new shipping lanes and undiscovered natural resources in an ice-free Arctic, no one seems to question why the Arctic is becoming ice-free or what the implications of this may be for life on this planet.
\
Arctic species such as the walrus, ringed-seal, and polar bear depend on sea ice for their survival. In 2008 the world caught a glimpse of what the future may hold for polar bears in the Arctic when a satellite-tracked female polar bear and her yearling cub spent nine days straight swimming in the Beaufort Sea searching for sea ice to hunt on. After a 426-mile swim she finally found sea ice, but in the process lost her cub, likely drowned due to exhaustion, and 22 percent of her body weight. Many Arctic species are threatened with extinction as the Arctic warms, there is nowhere left for them to migrate to.
\
A growing amount of research is linking the loss of Arctic sea ice with changing weather patterns around the world. Jennifer Francis, a research professor at Rutgers University, recently published research showing the amount of warming seen in the Arctic is causing the jet stream to slow and take large meandering patterns. The contrast in temperature between the equator and the poles is what pushes the jet stream. A warming Arctic means less of a temperature contrast resulting in a weakened jet stream, the jet stream looks less like the rolling west to east waves you would typically see, and more like a slow, meandering river with more of a north-south pattern.
\
This is causing some of the same weather patterns to be ""stuck"" in place for extended periods of time, leading to extremes in weather. It's also causing warmer southern temperatures to be pulled further north than usual and frigid Arctic temperatures to be pulled further south than usual, exactly why the ""polar vortex"" wasn't in the Arctic last week where it's usually found.
\
The news fortunately is not all bad. We have time to act to limit the amount of warming we are causing by burning fossil fuels, but time is limited. This will require us to act on a global scale and the U.S. must take a lead role in reducing our emissions. Most economists agree, a revenue-neutral carbon tax is the most efficient way to do so and if done smartly, can push other countries to do the same. Last June, President Obama asked Congress to bring him a market-based approach to addressing climate change, a revenue-neutral carbon tax is a conservative, free-market solution to the climate crisis.

338," Arlen Specter's inch-thick campaign media guide devotes whole chapters to his views on the economy, health care and education -- but not a page to environmental protection.\ Lynn Yeakel's position papers are half as thick as Specter's. Her booklet includes two pages on the environment -- as many as it does on federal funding for libraries.\ In a recession, environmental concerns clearly have slipped down the index of leading political issues. Yet they never really go away.\ And while Republican Specter, 62, of Philadelphia, and Democrat Yeakel, 51, of Rosemont, agree on a surprising number of topics, they offer voters sharp alternatives on a number of environmental views.\ Yeakel, for instance, supports an immediate moratorium on the construction of incinerators for municipal or hazardous wastes. Specter opposes such a temporary, blanket ban.\ Specter voted for an energy bill that streamlines the nuclear licensing process by eliminating automatic public input after a utility gets the go-ahead for construction. Yeakel said she would have opposed such a change.\ But as hopeful representatives of a state heavy with manufacturing, mining and steel-making interests -- all of which take a toll on the environment -- neither candidate can be considered totally ""green.""\ Both, for instance, decry ""global warming"" -- the worldwide greenhouse effect caused by industrial gases such as carbon dioxide - - as a concern. And both support the Clean Air Act.\ Yet neither is willing at this point to support a ""carbon tax"" on fossil fuel producers, including coal mines. Europe is considering such a levy as a way of raising money for increased research into cleaner alternate energy sources.\ Yeakel calls for higher mileage standards for cars as a way of reducing America's energy dependence on foreign oil. And Specter supported an energy bill that would have opened Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to domestic oil exploration. He also is an outspoken fan of mass transit.\ Yet neither candidate is willing to support what many experts argue is the most direct and effective way of curbing United State's reliance on foreign oil -- a gasoline tax of 50 cents a gallon or more.\ However, both actively support energy conservation. Specter wrote provisions into this year's energy bill that requires greater efficiencies within government agencies and promotes them in homes.\ And Yeakel was a founder and co-chair of the Philadelphia-based Citizens' Coalition for Energy Efficiency, which encouraged the city's schools and businesses to invest in energy-saving technologies.\ In Specter, voters get an environmentally-conscientious Republican with a mediocre record on issues of utmost importance to national environmental organizations.\ The League of Conservation Voters, the 22-year-old non-partisan arm of the environmental movement, gives Specter a 48-percent lifetime rating.\ In Yeakel, voters get an untested Democrat who has taken strong stances on a number of environmental issues. She's been endorsed by the League, Sierra Club and Clean Water Action.\ Yeakel's investments show she is not a pure environmentalist. A Main Line millionaire, her money is spread among some companies -- such as oil giant Texaco -- whose environmental records are mixed, at best.\ Yet environmentalists are encouraged by her candidacy.\ Bob Wendelgass, director of Clean Water Action in Pennsylvania, said Specter has been supportive of wetlands protection, one of the group's key concerns.\ But Specter is reactive or unpredictable on other issues, Wendelgass said. For instance Specter came out against a hazardous waste incinerator proposed for rural Union County, but only after Yeakel did so first and after being criticized in the primary election.\ ""Specter is not a leader but a weak follower on many issues,"" Wendelgass said. ""We must work for each vote with him.\ ""In Yeakel we have an opportunity to replace someone with weak positions with someone who has taken strong positions and who shows promise of being out there as a leader.""\ The League of Conservation Voters reached a similar conclusion: ""State environmentalists say he (Specter) doesn't go out on a limb one way or another.""\ The League criticized Specter for opposing a one-year moratorium on mining claims on Western public lands, including parks and national forests. Environmentalists fear such claims will be redeemed by their private owners for as little as $2.50 an acre.\ On another Western issue of concern to the League, Specter voted against raising below-market grazing fees for ranchers whose animals feed off government lands.\ Still, Specter has been active in environmental areas that pose high health risks but rate low on the publicized agendas of environmental groups.\ Specter has offered legislation to reduce lead exposure in the home, community and schools. And the senator recently helped an Allentown couple with small children escape a high-lead home with the government's help.\ Years ago Specter and six colleagues founded the Senate Radon Task Force. And this year he added language to a radon abatement bill.\ Neither Specter nor Yeakel has enunciated a clear position on a Bush administration proposal to open federal parks and lands, including the Allegheny National Forest, to strip mining.\ But they agree that the private owners of minerals under public lands should be compensated by Uncle Sam via laws that prohibit the government from simply taking private property.\ Likewise, both favor government compensation for farmers who agree to stop tilling wetlands. Such money would come from the government's general fund.\ The environment has not been completely overlooked in the Senate race. Last week Yeakel visited a Superfund site in the coal region and promoted legislation to make corporate polluters pay."
339,"WASHINGTON - Last month, Mike Doyle stepped out of a meeting on climate change legislation to face a group of union steelworkers on a lobbying storm on Capitol Hill.\It was a brief, friendly meeting in a marble hall. Mr. Doyle, D-Forest Hills, talked about his commitment to the environment without passing policies that could imperil steel and manufacturing jobs in the Pittsburgh region. He brought up his concerns about the Green New Deal, a sweeping plan calling for an end to fossil fuels, hatched by liberal Democrats from New York and Massachusetts.\""We share the same goals: We want to get to net-zero carbon,"" he told them. ""I think there are a lot smarter ways to do it.""\These subtle but long-standing climate policy differences within the Democratic Party recently erupted after Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto announced his unequivocal opposition to new petrochemical plants in the region.\Mr. Peduto, who cited his concern that more carbon and methane would degrade Pittsburgh's troubled air quality, drew fire from labor unions and some moderate Democrats who see such staunch opposition to more plastics plants - and the natural gas drilling that enables them - as jeopardizing the region's economy.\Since arrival to Congress in 1995, Mr. Doyle has been on the front lines of confronting climate change as a 19-year member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. It's a powerful panel, now controlled by Democrats, with the unenviable task of how to limit atmospheric gases released by a range of sources - and how to find Congressional consensus on solutions.\In July, the committee launched a series of hearings and meetings to get input on climate change legislation. The committee's goal is to reach net-zero carbon emissions and a 100% clean economy by 2050.\Mr. Doyle's broad view, shared by unions and Rep. Conor Lamb, D-Mt. Lebanon, is that investment in technology can allow industries, even those dependent on extracting fossil fuels, to operate cleanly.\Those measures are more realistic, Mr. Doyle said in an interview, and can garner enough bipartisan votes to move forward on meaningful proposals.\Mr. Doyle touted his recent proposal to provide a 30% production tax credit for large-scale batteries that store energy for solar and wind farms when the sun isn't shining and the wind isn't blowing.\He wants to encourage energy efficiency in the building sector and scale up electric vehicles, he said, because the building and transportation sectors are together responsible for more emissions than the power and steel sectors.\Doyle's drumbeat\Mr. Doyle has beat this drum in a similar situation in 2009 - during the last session of Congress the Democrats controlled the House.\Two liberal Democrats from the coasts - Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., and Rep. Ed Markey, D-Mass. - were pushing forward on a carbon cap-and-trade program. (Mr. Markey, alongside Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., introduced the Green New Deal in February.)\Cap and trade sets a limit on carbon emissions and requires facilities to buy pollution credits for excess emissions, credits that facilities can then trade. Mr. Doyle felt it amounted to major penalties for the steel and manufacturing sectors, which were already battered by foreign competitors that did not have such regulations. He was concerned some U.S. companies may leave the country, destroying American jobs while still emitting carbon.\Mr. Doyle and Jay Inslee, then a representative from Washington State, drafted an amendment to provide rebates, for up to 15 years, to energy-intensive industries and those manufacturers vulnerable to overseas competition.\""It makes sense we attack the low-hanging fruit,"" he added. ""What do we agree on?""\Mr. Lamb, a first-term congressman who represents the northwestern Pittsburgh suburbs, including the Shell cracker plant, has favored increased federal funding for energy research as a way to fight climate change.\As chair of the Energy subcommittee of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology - he wants to boost the budget for ARPA-e, the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy.\Established in 2009, the Energy Department research agency was modeled on DARPA, a Defense Department program well known for investing in Carnegie Mellon University robotics ventures for military purposes.\In September, Mr. Lamb's subcommittee moved forward legislation that more than triples ARPA-e's budget to $1 billion by 2024 and directs more funding toward lowering emissions in manufacturing.\Reached for comment last week, Mr. Lamb reiterated that natural gas, as a whole, has been beneficial to his district.\""Everybody talks about Pittsburgh reinventing itself and being successful in the 21st century - well, outside the city limits, it means energy jobs and manufacturing,"" Mr. Lamb said.\""I don't think it's really accurate to suggest that there's a trade off there between jobs and the environment.""\Asked if he would sponsor a carbon tax, Mr. Lamb said he wasn't ready to support it.\""It's still early days for a proposal like that,"" he said. ""It's a little hard to forecast what that would mean for jobs in this region.""\Mr. Lamb won two elections in 2018 with the overwhelming support of labor unions. And last month, Allegheny County Labor Council disagreed ""wholeheartedly"" with Mr. Peduto's comments - in a statement distributed for the council by Mr. Lamb's brother and campaign spokesman, Coleman Lamb.\""It's hard to believe that the mayor of Pittsburgh would actually tell companies not to create thousands of good middle-class jobs in our region,"" the labor council's president, Darrin Kelly, stated. ""It just isn't true that we have to choose between good jobs and clean air and water.""\The GOP chimes in\Some Republicans, sensing a moment to beat back more progressive proposals like the Green New Deal and a nationwide ban on fracking, have chimed in.\Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., said petrochemicals had brought ""tremendous benefits"" to Western Pennsylvania without harming the environment.\Mr. Toomey, in an interview, said he was ""really shocked"" when he heard Mr. Peduto's comments. ""I like the mayor, I think he's a good man, but he couldn't be more mistaken,"" he said.\Asked why a U.S. senator would comment on a mayor's views, Mr. Toomey said the debate is bigger than Pittsburgh.\This is ""a very far left wing of the Democratic Party that is frankly become hostile to economic growth and prosperity, and they're advocating terrible policies,"" Mr. Toomey said. Mr. Peduto's position ""is an example.""\Mr. Doyle, a self-styled broker of climate compromise, believes he can pull together all sides on his committee to get something done.\""There's no magic wand to it,"" Mr. Doyle told the steelworkers last month, before ducking back to the hearing. But ""we have to make sure we're not taking out whole industries to do this, and we can do this in a way that doesn't do that.""\CAPTION: PHOTO: Alexandra Wimley/Post-Gazette: U.S. Rep.

340,"Pulitzer Prize-winning former New York Times Washington bureau chief Hedrick Smith is also the author of several books. His most recent, ""Who Stole the American Dream?"", is a clearly laid-out explanation of how we went from a prosperous, thriving economy to the meltdown of the middle class. He is also an Emmy award-winning producer for PBS's ""Frontline."" His documentary ""Poisoned Waters"" in 2009 stirred up renewed interest in protecting our waterways from chemical run-off and toxins. For more, go to www.HedrickSmith.com. \How did writing ""Who Stole the American Dream?"" affect you? \It made me very angry. I knew that middle-class, average Americans, had really fared badly over the last 30 years, but I didn't know how badly compared to others. Income flat for average male workers for the last 30 years adjusted for inflation, while the top 1 percent was gaining 600 percent. Didn't realize that homeowners had lost $6 trillion in accumulated value in their home mortgages before the housing boom went bust. Didn't realize the main victims of subprime loans were prime borrowers, people with good credit ratings who got talked into, cheated into, bamboozled into bad loans with high rates, high fees. So I was shocked at the degree to which the middle class had its dream stolen.\You talk about how the roots of the problem go back to Lewis Powell's 1970s declaration of an attack on free enterprise which stirred corporations into political action. \The middle class really exercised a lot of political power during its economic heyday. We the people really influenced Washington through the consumer's movement, the environmental movement, the labor movement ... the peace movement. Those middle-class movements had a real impact on the standard of living and the way Washington worked. \What happened was you had a revolt of the bosses which was triggered by this memorandum written by Lewis Powell, who was a famous corporate attorney -- very strongly anti-union, very strongly free enterprise. He basically said in a private memo: Business, you have got to get into the political arena. You have been taken to the cleaners by all these middle-class movements. \I was running The New York Times Washington Bureau in the late 1970s, and I could see some impact. I could see the 401(k) plan being put in to replace lifetime pensions. I could see the corporate bankruptcy laws being changed and the tax rates on capital gains being dropped, but I didn't realize there was an organized movement. It took quite a long time for people to wake up and see what was going on, including the media.\Responsibility was transferred from employer to employee for managing their retirement, and it appears that the Baby Boomers, who are retiring now, didn't really know what they were doing and many don't have the funds to retire. \Yeah, I think people to a certain extent were sold a bill of goods. The mutual fund industry understood that the 401(k) plan, if they could get a hold of managing all those funds, would make enormous amounts of money. So they preached power to the people -- run your own retirement. \The median 401(k) balance today is $18,000 and for people who have been in the program for 20 years, now in their 60s on the verge of retirement, it's $85,000. That's nowhere near enough. People don't stick with their plans. They don't invest intelligently. When the economy goes down, they stop putting money in, and that's the very time you should be putting money in because that's when you are going to get the best gains later on. People make all kinds of mistakes. It's a terrible idea.\But how much responsibility should the individual take for signing the bad mortgage deal or not putting enough money toward retirement? \I think we should take a lot of responsibility politically, but I think a lot of those people with bad mortgages were simply cheated. I mean, you'll see stories in my book about people who literally were given false information. That's why we have a Consumer Protection Bureau so the sleazy financier can't take advantage of people. Finance is complicated. Saying everybody should be able to take care of themselves is like washing your hands of it. \The folks who were floating these mortgage loans, and the banks that were behind them, they knew what they were doing. They were fleecing people. But, politically, we are all to blame because we have backed out of politics. \So what happened to that early crop of Baby Boomers who protested the Vietnam War and fought for civil rights? Are they just exhausted? \Ironically, part of it was they were successful. I mean, in the environmental movement, they pushed and they got the Clean Water Act and they got the Clean Air Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Anti-Toxic Substances Act. And they were all signed by that great tree-hugging environmentalist, Republican President Richard Nixon (I'm making a joke). To a certain extent, we got all this legislation passed, now it is up to the government -- They'll do it. Well, the problem is you've got to keep the heat on regulators to do it, and they gave up on that. \The landscape of power in Washington has changed, and unless consumers and average people get active, the policy tilt is going to continue to be on behalf of big business and on behalf of the 1 percent, the financial elite.\The more it tilts, the more powerless people feel and the virtuous circle becomes the vicious cycle. \That's right. Well, it's up to us to change that. My friend, Ernie Cortes [Industrial Areas Foundation co-chair], says really profoundly: ""Not only does power corrupt, powerlessness also corrupts."" In other words, if people feel powerless, it corrupts democracy at the core. We don't try.\In the book you do use United Airlines bankruptcy as an example of a lot of things that went wrong. The unions gave back a lot to keep jobs and even today the mantra is you are lucky to have a job, which makes you powerless. \That's right, you feel insecure. That's always going to be the case when there is high unemployment. People can't afford to protest too hard against their own working conditions. There is no question that the current circumstances really hurt the middle class. But I've got to tell you, this has been going on even when unemployment was low. The middle class has not been active. People can demonstrate for bailing out the homeowners since we bailed out the banks. People can protest for a level playing field on taxes. Those are not things people should be afraid to protest about. We have a systemic problem here. Our system is not working for most Americans really well. We need to do something about it.\What about all the people who can't retire and are holding onto their jobs while all those graduates with student loans are looking for jobs. Nothing is budging. \We are connected to each other. We are a family, and if someone in the family is doing badly, in the end the whole family is doing badly. And we are. We are suffering right now as a nation because middle-class Americans are not getting paid well enough. We need strong consumer demand from middle-class Americans to drive this economy.\Speaking of connectedness, lets talk about Earth Day and the environment. \It's incredible to go back and take a look [at Earth Day]. In 1970, 20 million Americans went into the streets, went to shopping malls, went to college campuses, got on the air to talk on radio and television to protest the fouling of the nation's air and waterways. There was public outrage. People demanded that things change, and they had a powerful impact. \Within a year, Congress had passed seven major pieces of environmental legislation. All of those were signed by Richard Nixon, a Republican president who regarded himself as a friend of big business. He set up the first Environmental Protection Agency and they went after big business, they went after cities, they went after auto emissions and the pollution from them. They really cracked down. To the degree that our environment is better off today, it is because of those people.\Now many of those laws are being eroded. \People need to be aware of that. But the problem of limiting emissions from coal power plants, the battle over the Keystone Pipeline, the question of a carbon tax to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels -- all of that is in political trouble. \Other environmental issues are going under the radar, such as factory farming and genetically modified foods. \There's no question. Huge agri-businesses are having a terrible effect on the environment, and there are new chemicals that are going into the waterways, into the soil. Fortunately, there is a counter movement. You do have more and more markets cropping up around the country where people buy from local farms.\Do you keep tabs on the subjects you have delved into? \Absolutely. In the last four years, corporate profits have been rising 20 percent on average and the average home income has gone up 1.4 percent. So the division I am talking about, the two Americas I am describing in this book, are continuing. The gap between the middle and the top is continuing to widen. The problems are still there. Yes, I keep up with it. I follow it very closely."
341,"The pope says that harming the environment harms humanity. Climate change scientists say that humanity harms the environment. So both must conclude that the only way to reverse environmental damage is to reduce humanity.\So why is the pope not leading his followers to adopt birth control, particularly in underdeveloped countries? Poor countries are the least able economically to support another human being. The developed nations have already achieved negative population growth.\Uncontrolled population growth in poor nations is a recipe for disaster and the reason for our concern with illegal immigration. The world population is shrinking in countries where we can feed and educate people and growing where we cannot feed and educate people. Net effect is that the world population becomes hungrier and less educated. Is that the objective of our leaders?\So instead of me having to give up my car to reduce pollution so that poor countries can add people or my having to pay a carbon tax so that my government can feed and educate the wave of illegal immigrants, is it not time for our leaders and the pope to make birth control a priority in poor countries?\Peter T.

His lone reference to a scientific source in his April 25 column, ""Climate Consensus Du Jour,"" is a National Academy of Sciences statement from 15 years ago that is based on data from the 1990s. \Mr. Will conveniently ignores this later statement from our National Academy and 10 other national academies around the world: ""The scientific understanding of climate change is now sufficiently clear to justify nations taking prompt action."" \It's all too easy for a science dilettante like Mr. Will to minimize the consequences of climate change.

343,"
Democrats brag about Sen. Al Gore's environmental record, but his controversial proposals for new environmental taxes could mean trouble down the road with voters.
\
Republicans are calling Gore an environmental radical. Democratic presidential candidate Bill Clinton is keeping his distance from his running mate's proposals, even though Gore would offset the new ""green"" taxes with other tax cuts.
\
In his best-selling book, Earth in the Balance, Gore calls for new taxes on gasoline, heating oil, coal, natural gas and electricity generated from the burning of fossil fuels.
\
""For the average person, you're talking about a substantial price increase in just about every good,"" said Wilbur Steger, president of CONSAD Research Corp., an economic consulting firm in Pittsburgh.
\
""You're talking about a cost-of-living increase of 5 percent plus,"" said Steger, whose firm's analysis of the effect of broad fossil fuel taxes concluded that 600,000 jobs could be lost by 2000.
\
Gore is also proposing a separate ""virgin materials fee,"" a tax based on the amount of nonrecycled materials built into a product, from appliances to paper to glass bottles.
\
But it's the fossil fuel tax that would directly address global warming, Gore's chief concern.
\
Fossil fuels - such as coal - produce carbon dioxide, which accumulates in the atmosphere and is believed to contribute to global warming. Gore hasn't spelled out the size of the tax, but it would be aimed at reducing reliance on fossil fuels.
\
Gore's tax proposals are part of a ""global Marshall Plan"" that he says is needed to save the planet from catastrophic climate changes that could result if global warming continues unchecked - a disputed theory among scientists.
\
A Greenpeace survey of 400 leading climatologists last year found that they were almost evenly divided on whether global warming could lead to environmental collapse. A Gallup survey in February found that even though most climatologists believe that human activity contributes to global warming, only 41 percent think there is enough scientific evidence to prove it.
\
Sensing potential political backlash, the Clinton campaign is keeping the proposals at arm's length.
\
Clinton spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said her boss ""endorses the general principles of Gore's approach on the environment, but not necessarily the specifics in his book."" Clinton said last week that he opposed raising gasoline taxes to cut the deficit.
\
Even Gore's camp sounds as if it is trying to pull back.
\
""The senator has talked about a carbon tax as something that ought to be studied,"" said Gore spokeswoman Marla Romash. ""It is not something that we ought to be proposing in the short term.""
\
In his book, Gore says he is convinced that a fossil fuel tax ""is rapidly becoming politically feasible.""
\
Republicans see Gore's environmental proposals as a nice, fat target, since gas taxes are particularly odious to mobility-conscious consumers.
\
""Bill Clinton embraced his running mate, and that includes (Gore's) book,"" said Jim Cicconi, issues director for the Bush campaign. ""If it doesn't, he owes the voters an explanation.""
\
Cicconi called Gore's proposals radical and said a fossil fuels tax could devastate the very parts of the country Clinton and Gore have just finished touring in their bus caravan.
\
""The type of radical approach to the environment that Gore seems to espouse could have a potentially severe effect in the Midwest industrial regions,"" said Cicconi. ""His proposals would severely damage - if not destroy - the auto industry.""
\
Romash said Gore would not support any environmental tax that makes industry less competitive.
\
Environmentalists applaud Gore, saying that he is no radical. They point out that the European Community is debating a tax on fossil fuels.
\
""I consider him to be mainstream,"" said Lester Brown, president of the Worldwatch Institute, an environmental think tank in Washington. ""His prescriptions are those that most people in the field are supportive of.""

344,"A couple of conservative Pennsylvania natives have penned a book subtitled ""The Evangelical's Guide to Climate Change and a Healthy Environment,"" as surprising to some as ""The Liberal's Guide to Small Government."" \Maybe we shouldn't be surprised. Maybe it's surprising only because so many of us like to stuff complex thought into convenient little boxes so we don't have to think as hard. ""Caring For Creation"" is heavier on scientific data than on Scripture but it taps both without apology. \I found that refreshing, so I called the Rev. Mitch Hescox, who co-wrote the book with meteorologist Paul Douglas. Rev. Hescox leads the Evangelical Environmental Network and is the son of a coal miner, a lifelong Republican and a resident of York County. \He was in suburban Minneapolis on Monday to give a talk with Mr. Douglas, and then drove to Sioux Falls, S.D., for another speech Tuesday night. Those talks sandwiched President Donald Trump's announcement that he'd keep a campaign promise and chuck the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan. \That executive order assuredly means an uptick in emissions of carbon and other pollutants. It didn't surprise Rev. Hescox, but he doesn't believe Mr. Trump's oft-cited base is entirely with him on this move. Many evangelicals felt they had to make a choice between pro-life and pro-environment, he said, and backed Mr. Trump for his late and calculated embrace of pro-life rhetoric. But that's not a choice anyone should have to make, Rev. Hescox said. \Roughly 70,000 Pennsylvania pro-life Christians have called for methane reduction standards through online and email petitions, he said, because they're tired of ""burying its costs in the the lungs, brains and hearts of our kids."" \Shelving the Clean Power Plan can't be the end of the story, he said, any more than shelving Obamacare could be. \""We have to have an alternative. We can't afford to stop reducing carbon"" emissions. \Their book is thick with supporting data on the warmest years on record, but the tone and cadence, if not the content, can sound downright Trumpian. Take this passage from Mr. Douglas: \""Wet areas are getting wetter, dry areas are trending drier. You've heard the expression 'weather on steroids' We're turbocharging the storms that would have formed anyway - loading the dice in favor of more extreme weather events."" \Weather is local. Climate change is global. While there's no silver bullet to stem it, this book makes a case for ""silver buckshot - hundreds of new technologies and viable, cost-competitive clean-energy alternatives, which will gradually, methodically wean us off fossil fuels, employ more Americans, and jump-start a sputtering, rudderless economy."" \That's not the message from the White House or from legions of Trump supporters in coal country, but other conservatives are pushing for a revenue-neutral carbon tax. The revenue raised would offset the payroll tax, dollar for dollar. \Every day seems to bring another climate- or weather-related story. This week we learned that Pennsylvania's booming tick and mouse population, due in part to the warm winter, has heightened the threat of Lyme disease. But if fresh scientific data isn't persuasive enough, this book rolls out biblical passages such as this translation of Isaiah 24:4: \""The earth dries up and withers, the world languishes and withers, the heavens languish with the earth. The earth is defiled by its people; they have disobeyed the laws, violated the statutes and broken the everlasting covenant. Therefore a curse consumes the earth; its people must bear their guilt. Therefore earth's inhabitants are burned up, and very few are left."" \These may not be the end times but they are strange times, and reaching for God to make a point is nothing new. Some reaches are just longer than others. A couple of Saturdays ago at a raucous town hall meeting in Red Lion, U.S. Rep. Scott Perry, R-York County, angered the crowd when he said federal and state environmental regulations unfairly penalized some polluters while exempting others. \""Some violators, if you are spiritual and you believe in God, one of the violators was God because the forests were providing a certain amount of nitrates and phosphates to the Chesapeake Bay,"" Mr. Perry said. \I can't speak for Isaiah, but does anyone think he's buying that?"
345,"Thomas L. Friedman is a syndicated columnist for The New York Times.\ How will future historians explain it? How will they possibly explain why President George W. Bush decided to ignore the energy crisis staring us in the face and chose instead to spend all his electoral capital on a futile effort to undo the New Deal, by partially privatizing Social Security? We are, quite simply, witnessing one of the greatest examples of misplaced priorities in the history of the U.S. presidency.\ ""Ah, Friedman, but you overstate the case."" No, I understate it. Look at the opportunities our country is missing -- and the risks we are assuming -- by having a president and vice president who refuse to lift a finger to put together a ""geo-green"" strategy that would marry geopolitics, energy policy and environmentalism.\ By doing nothing to lower U.S. oil consumption, we are financing both sides in the war on terrorism and strengthening the worst governments in the world. That is, we are financing the U.S. military with our tax dollars and we are financing the jihadists -- and the Saudi, Sudanese and Iranian mosques and charities that support them -- through our gasoline purchases. The oil boom is also entrenching the autocrats in Russia and Venezuela, which is becoming Castro's Cuba with oil. By doing nothing to reduce U.S. oil consumption we are also setting up a global competition with China for energy resources, including right on our doorstep in Canada and Venezuela. Don't kid yourself: China's foreign policy today is very simple -- holding on to Taiwan and looking for oil.\ Finally, by doing nothing to reduce U.S. oil consumption we are only hastening the climate change crisis, and the Bush officials who scoff at the science around this should hang their heads in shame. And it is only going to get worse the longer we do nothing. Wired magazine did an excellent piece in its April issue about hybrid cars, which get 40 to 50 miles to the gallon with very low emissions. One paragraph jumped out at me: ""Right now, there are about 800 million cars in active use. By 2050, as cars become ubiquitous in China and India, it'll be 3.25 billion. That increase represents an almost unimaginable threat to our environment. Quadruple the cars means quadruple the carbon dioxide emissions -- unless cleaner, less gas-hungry vehicles become the norm.""\ All the elements of what I like to call a geo-green strategy are known:\ -- We need a gasoline tax that would keep pump prices fixed at $4 a gallon, even if crude oil prices go down. At $4 a gallon (premium gasoline averages about $6 a gallon in Europe), we could change the car-buying habits of a large segment of the U.S. public, which would make it profitable for the car companies to convert more of their fleets to hybrid or ethanol engines, which over time could sharply reduce our oil consumption.\ -- We need to start building nuclear power plants again. The new nuclear technology is safer and cleaner than ever. ""The risks of climate change by continuing to rely on hydrocarbons are much greater than the risks of nuclear power,"" said Peter Schwartz, chairman of Global Business Network. ""Climate change is real and it poses a civilizational threat that could transform the carrying capacity of the entire planet.""\ -- And we need some kind of carbon tax that would move more industries from coal to wind, hydro and solar power, or other, cleaner fuels. The revenue from these taxes would go to pay down the deficit and the reduction in oil imports would help to strengthen the dollar and defuse competition for energy with China.\ It's smart geopolitics. It's smart fiscal policy. It is smart climate policy. Most of all -- it's smart politics. Even evangelicals are speaking out about our need to protect God's green earth. ""The Republican Party is much greener than George Bush or Dick Cheney,"" remarked Schwartz. ""There is now a near convergence of support on the environmental issue. Look at how popular Arnold Schwarzenegger, a green Republican, is becoming because of what he has done on the environment in California.""\ Imagine if George Bush declared that he was getting rid of his limousine for an armor-plated Ford Escape hybrid, adopting a geo- green strategy and building an alliance of neocons, evangelicals and greens to sustain it. His popularity at home -- and abroad -- would soar. The country is dying to be led on this. Instead, he prefers to squander his personal energy trying to take apart the New Deal and throwing red meat to right-to-life fanatics. What a waste of a presidency. How will future historians explain it?"
346,"This generation of Americans must make a choice of awesome proportions about the future of civilization on this little blue planet.\For months, debate has raged in government circles about whether to extend the war against terrorism to Iraq, Somalia, Sudan, the Philippines, Yemen - using military power to rid these countries of terrorist elements.\We can do that if we choose. We are so overwhelmingly superior militarily that for the next couple of decades, we can do pretty much what we please. But behind the intense debate about whether to invade Iraq, etc., lies a crucial question: What kind of world does America want to use its power to promote?\There are two options. We can use our power unilaterally to promote the shorter-term economic and political self-interest of America (always, of course, with a veneer of moral appeal to freedom, justice and democracy for all). Or we can seek genuinely to implement the moral principles we claim to embrace and take the lead in creating a better world for all.\The unilateral approach is tempting. If taken shrewdly, and with a heavy dose of moral rhetoric, it could probably be effective for a decade or three. In fact, by unilaterally abandoning the ABM treaty and by defying the near-global consensus on the Kyoto Protocols, we are already well down the unilateral path.\Long-term, however, that way lies disaster. Widespread poverty will breed ever more desperate terrorists. China, India, and the Muslim world eventually will build the technical and military power to fight back. A global arms race with the almost unimaginably powerful technologies of the 2020s and 2030s will make the Cold War look like child's play.\To choose the second, multilateral, cooperative choice, we must launch a global Marshall Plan against poverty, strengthen multinational institutions like the United Nations, and join in a sustained global cooperative effort to preserve the environment.\Persuading the American people to embrace British Prime Minister Tony Blair's call for a global Marshall Plan is the place to start. In the contemporary world, our ability to tolerate conditions under which half of the world's people must try to survive on $2 a day is not only a moral outrage but also contrary to our long-term self-interest. We can and must offer the poor hope for a better future. Nurturing even a few economically successful Arab countries would demonstrate that Islam is compatible with the modern world of science, technology, and freedom.\How much would a Marshall Plan cost? Blair suggests that an additional $50 billion a year spent by wealthy nations to improve education and health care for the poorest would produce dramatic improvement. That is only about 1/40 of the present annual U.S. federal budget! Nobody is asking us to do it alone, but we could - with only very modest, short-term economic sacrifice.\Second, we must be willing to temper our proud American inclination to go it alone. Instead, we need to cooperate much more with multinational institutions like the United Nations and the World Court, respecting their decisions even when they frustrate immediate national advantage, and build by persuasion a global community committed to freedom, democracy and justice. That means not attacking other nations including Iraq unless we can persuade the global community that that is wise.\Finally, we must cooperate with global efforts to nurture a decent, sustainable environment for all the world's grandchildren. In fact, a good way to raise the money for the Marshall Plan against poverty would be to impose a carbon tax on fossil fuels (e.g., a $2 tax on each gallon of gasoline) so the market will create strong economic incentives for alternative energy sources. It is morally outrageous and, in the long run, even contrary to our own self-interest, for our politicians to operate as if American drivers buying ever larger gas-guzzling SUVs have the inalienable right to gasoline prices two or three times lower than those in Europe.\Which will we choose? A short-term unilateral policy to protect our present advantage - or a cooperative, multilateral path that in the long term will truly benefit everyone? If we want our grandchildren to live in a world where hopeless terrorists constantly devise new ways to penetrate the ever more complicated defenses of our affluence even at the expense of freedom; if we want our grandchildren to experience a global arms race that threatens the very survival of civilization, then let us choose the easier, unilateral path.\But if we long for a more peaceful, cooperative world, then American leaders of moral vision must commit themselves to a long, tough campaign to help the American people understand what path leads to genuine happiness and security.\Like Moses of old, we must help American voters see that they cannot avoid choosing between life and death, not just for themselves but for people everywhere. Imitating Moses' plea, we must urge: ""Choose life that you and your descendants may live.""\Ronald J.

347,"
Well, so much for our daffodils! They all bloomed in our front yard last week. They now form a nice bright yellow cluster at the bottom of our driveway. Temperatures of 65 degrees in Washington in January will do that. Frankly, daffodils in January do brighten up the lawn. Maybe next year we'll try for roses in February.
\
Don't know about you, but when I see things in nature that I've never seen in my life, like daffodils blooming in January, it starts to feel creepy, like a ""Twilight Zone"" segment. I half expect to wake one day and find Rod Serling mowing my lawn -- in shorts.
\
Why not? Last December was the fourth warmest on record, and 2006 was the hottest year in America since 1895. It was declared the hottest in Britain since 1659.
\
Even the White House seems to have noticed. Al Hubbard, the president's economic adviser, says Bush will soon unveil an energy independence strategy that will produce ""headlines above the fold that will knock your socks off."" Since everything the president has done on energy up to now has left my socks firmly in place, I will be eager to hear what Bush says.
\
Neither the White House nor the Democratic Party seems to grasp that the public and business community are miles ahead of them on this energy/environment issue. The presidential candidate who finally figures that out, though -- and comes up with a compelling energy/environment agenda -- is going to have a real leg up in 2008.
\
What would be compelling? I used to think it would be a ""Manhattan Project"" on energy. I don't any longer. I've learned that there is no magic bullet for reducing our dependence on oil and emissions of greenhouse gases -- and politicians who call for one are usually just trying to avoid asking for sacrifice today.
\
The right rallying call is for a ""Green New Deal."" The New Deal was not built on a magic bullet, but on a broad range of programs and industrial projects to revitalize America. Ditto for an energy New Deal. If we are to turn the tide on climate change and end our oil addiction, we need more of everything: solar, wind, hydro, ethanol, biodiesel, clean coal and nuclear power -- and conservation.
\
It takes a Green New Deal because to nurture all of these technologies to a point that they really scale would be a huge industrial project. If you have put a windmill in your yard or some solar panels on your roof, bless your heart. But we will only green the world when we change the very nature of the electricity grid -- moving it away from dirty coal or oil to clean coal and renewables. And that is a huge industrial project -- much bigger than anyone has told you. Finally, like the New Deal, if we undertake the green version, it has the potential to create a whole new clean power industry to spur our economy into the 21st century.
\
To spark a Green New Deal today requires getting two things right: government regulations and prices. Look at California. By setting steadily higher standards for the energy efficiency of buildings and appliances -- and creating incentives for utilities to work with consumers to use less power -- California has held its per-capita electricity use constant for 30 years, while the rest of the nation has seen per-capita electricity use increase by nearly 50 percent, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council. That has saved California from building 24 giant power plants.
\
Had Ronald Reagan not rolled back the higher fuel efficiency standards imposed on Detroit, we might need no Middle East oil today. High standards force innovation, and innovation leads to conservation at scale.
\
But prices also matter. I don't care whether it is a federal gasoline tax, carbon tax, BTU tax or cap-and-trade system, power utilities, factories and car owners have to be required to pay the real and full cost to society of the carbon they put into the atmosphere. And higher costs for fossil fuels make more costly clean alternatives more competitive.
\
""The regulated utilities are the most important consumers from the perspective of long-term investment, and if they are not required to value carbon reduction then they will under-invest in energy efficiency and renewable energy,"" Peter Darbee, chairman of Pacific Gas and Electric, said to me.
\
This isn't rocket science. Government standards matter. They drive innovation and efficiency. And prices matter. They drive more and cleaner energy choices. So when the president unveils his energy proposals, if they don't call for higher efficiency standards and higher prices for fossil fuels -- take your socks off yourself. It's going to get hot around here.

348,"Climate crossroads\Editor: Even as the president pledged to ""drain the swamp"" in Washington, his policies will advance manmade activities that harm our planet.\Even as he promises to safeguard clean water and air, his administration's policies for the Environmental Protection Agency will gut critical regulations to arrest the pollution that threatens our environment, the climate and, by extension, human health, vital ecosystems and the survival of countless species.\Even as the number of climate deniers decreases in the face of certain science, even as a coalition of senior Republicans call for a carbon tax on greenhouse gas pollution from fossil fuels, even as the number of U.S. jobs in solar energy already has overtaken those in oil, natural gas and coal extraction, still the administration persists in rolling back the very environmental protections we need more urgently.\If polluters were better public citizens, we might make do with fewer regulations. But we now know, for example, that Shell and Exxon knew of the dangers of climate change decades ago and not only continued to grow their fossil fuel businesses, but supported the idea that climate change was a hoax. Simply put: Polluters need strict rules or they will put their own interests above those of the public and the planet.\The Republican Party was once the proud party of conservation - think Teddy Roosevelt - and the EPA was created by Republican President Richard Nixon to fix the nation's ineffective environmental protection laws and to enforce them.\Today, I believe my party betrays its own legacy of protecting the environment and I predict that if the Republican-controlled Congress fails to take the long view and act now to mitigate the devastating future effects of pollution and climate change, then the GOP will sign its own death warrant\JANE BOLLINGER\DYBERRY TWP.,\WAYNE COUNTY\Overhaul staggers\Editor: No portion of the 2008 Republican platform endorsed comprehensive health care. In 2012, there was a plank against it.\From the first, party leaders and officeholders were opposed and quickly dubbed the Affordable Care Act ""Obamacare.""\I last counted at 66 the number of times that Republicans attempted to repeal the health care law. The concept should have won early acceptance in our conflicted and thus, beleaguered, land.\The tea party patriots - who in Congress dominate the Freedom Caucus - are now the last sector of political resistance seeking only repeal. They are an anachronism in American history: Their predecessors' demand for states' rights - in order to keep slavery in place - was at the heart of the move toward secession in 1857. In 2007, there was again a secessionist passion in the Old South, this time in opposition against nearly everything.\If Republicans had not been so interested in adding to their numbers in 2010, they would have spoken to the truth of the matter. There has been little consistent thinking from the resulting ""big tent"" party. They sacrificed honesty and fidelity, which is most evident in efforts toward a health care replacement law.\Their rationale has more recently focused on the cost, the so-called ""downward spiral,"" of Obamacare. But didn't this occur because of retrenchment by Republicans, which happened first in the 2012 elections, when they gained a majority in the House, and again in 2014, when they took control of the Senate? Only after that was there serious talk about replacement.\Republicans would never consider working with Democrats to repair and revise the law. So now, they want cooperation with replacement. Speaking for his party, President Donald Trump said, ""I didn't know it was so complicated."" Indeed.\RICHARD J. YOST\SOUTH ABINGTON TWP.\Repeal concerns\Editor: Little has raised more national angst than discussion about the repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act. Recently, many national groups have come out in opposition to the proposed changes. In a society of instant gratification and a growing culture of impatience, we have had limited time to carefully consider these changes and their effects.\Democracy is a participatory process supporting inclusion and engagement in constructive dialogue. This process is particularly important in addressing issues that could affect the community and the common good. A proper repeal and replacement of the act is an example of how the process should work. All stakeholders should be at the table to provide expert information and perspectives. To achieve the best possible outcome, constructive dialogue must continue.\The Pennsylvania State Nurses Association recognizes that these proposed changes will affect patients and care. As the leading professional nursing organization representing the state's largest number of health care providers, we support dialogue including professional nurses and community members. Critical thinking and meaningful discussions will result in high-quality health care services.\As these conversations take place, the association supports means to achieve improved outcomes. These include increased access to care through advanced practice registered nurses, adequate nurse staffing levels, cost-saving tools for consumers who purchase health care, and strategies to pay providers based on outcomes and efficiency rather than volume of services.\We hope the democratic process will ensure that the appropriate stakeholders will be seated at the tables as they engage in civil, thoughtful dialogue to achieve a long-term, comprehensive and cost-effective health care system.\MARK C.

These prophets respected authority but never became awed by power.\Not so with contemporaneous evangelical leaders. In 2001, during the run-up to America's invasion of Iraq, these evangelicals recast Christian doctrine and preached war sermons favoring the invasion, even declaring the war ""just"" according to St. Augustine criteria, although it was a war of choice. They even connected Saddam Hussein to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. They wanted access to power.\Now these evangelical leaders are declaring President Trump, our 45th president, akin to King Cyrus of Isaiah (Chapter 45). Cyrus, the first Persian emperor, is celebrated in Isaiah for freeing captive Jews in Babylon. He is a model for a nonbeliever chosen by God as a vessel to help the faithful.\This era's evangelical leaders do not speak truth to power but seek access to power.

Totally ignore politicians who claim they will give the money back - history tells us it never happens.\This is just another way politicos devised to take from earners for more pie-in-the-sky ideas providing corporate welfare to companies who are part of the renewable energy industry. We all know how efficiently any government entity handles our money.\Anyone who rails against the U.S., stating we are not doing enough to reduce carbon release in our environment, is lying to you since ours is the country to continue to reduce carbon release without a government-mandated carbon tax. All those countries who are part of the Paris Accords failed to live up to their agreed carbon reduction, yet used those accords to further tax their people.\Politicians are using extremist environmental views of normal climate change as a tool to separate you from your money and control what you can do in life.

He is auctioning off millions of acres of public lands for fossil fuel production, including the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\And now the EPA signed a measure that scraps one of President Obama's key initiatives of the Clean Power Plan to rein in fossil fuel emissions. This measure will allow coal plants to spew more pollutants into the air.\Past heads of the 49-year-old EPA have signed a letter urging Congress to make the EPA focus on its mission of protecting public health and the environment.

350,"Two months before the conference on global warming in Kyoto, Japan, Charles Carson, a vice president of USX, and several of his industry colleagues sat down with administration officials at the White House.\Only a few years ago, their mission would have been unthinkable. But on this mild Thursday in late September, what they had to say was merely improbable.\What the steel company executives dropped on the table was the industry's voluntary plan for achieving a 10 percent cut in its emissions of greenhouse gases from 1990 levels by 2010.\This would be accomplished through continuing improvements in steel processing technology and more efficient use of energy, without any mandates imposed by government. The industry leaders did want something from Washington, however: more federal investment in research and development, along with tax incentives to help spur new energy-efficient technologies.\The group, which included top officers from Bethlehem Steel, Inland Steel, North Star and LTV, also urged the Clinton administration not to sign onto an agreement in Kyoto that would put binding limits on U.S. emissions while allowing such steel-producing countries as China, South Korea, India, Mexico and others in eastern Europe to operate without restrictions.\They were warmly received by administration officials, only to be subsequently disappointed by what came out of Kyoto. They were dismayed that the United States had agreed to reduce its output of greenhouse gases 7 percent below 1990 levels by 2012 without any commitment, so far, from developing nations to curb their soaring output of carbon dioxide.\The White House has announced that it does not expect to send the proposed treaty to a currently hostile Senate for ratification until sometime in 1999, and then only if the rapidly industrializing countries that were excluded in Kyoto make ""meaningful commitments"" to reduce polluting emissions.\In the meantime, it is working on details of a $5 billion package of tax cuts, research and development grants and other incentives that President Clinton is expected to unveil in his State of the Union address late next month.\""We were disappointed,"" Carson said last week, citing in particular the failure of U.S. negotiators to bring China and other developing countries into the proposed accord. Carson, USX vice president for the environment, also chairs the global climate task force of the American Iron and Steel Institute, or AISI, the industry's trade association.\New figures that the institute made public Friday show that while U.S. steel exports through October were running 17.4 percent higher than the same 10-month period in 1996, steel imports also are on the rise, up 13.8 percent over a year ago.\The most dramatic jump has been in imports from Russia, up 201 percent over a year earlier. That was enough to catapult Russia to third place, behind the European Union and Canada, for steel exports to the United States, putting it ahead of such traditional U.S. competitors as Mexico, Brazil, Japan and Korea.\Overall sales by U.S. steel manufacturers are running about 3 percent ahead of 1996, continuing an upward trend that should put total sales close to $36 billion for the year.\Although the European Union, Canada and Japan will be bound by the global warming treaty if they ratify it, the other countries are excluded for now. If they remain outside the agreement, they will be able ""to operate under much less stringent laws and conditions than we do here,"" Carson said, ""which will give them an additional competitive advantage on a global basis.""\While making known its strong objections to the unfinished treaty that emerged from Kyoto, the Iron and Steel Institute is not backing away from its offer to achieve a self-set goal of a 10 percent emissions reduction by 2010 if the domestic political and economic climate is agreeable. From the industry's vantage point, that means no punitive ""carbon tax,"" which could force up steel prices by $50 or more a ton, and no mandated timetable from Washington that might outpace or even thwart the introduction of new technologies.\It is the high cost of wasted energy, rather than any anxiety over global warming, that is propelling the steel industry to the forefront of environmentally friendly innovation.\Bruce Steiner, vice president for energy and environment at the AISI, notes that energy represents 15 percent of the cost of steel production. Since 1975, the industry has reduced its energy consumption by 45 percent while going through the throes of massive reorganization and downsizing that have transformed it into today's global pace-setter.\Carson readily ticks off a dozen efforts that USX has under way to cut energy costs and raise efficiency. They range from cogeneration and recycling of gases generated during the production process to more efficient furnaces and burners and much greater use of recycled steel and waste metallic particles. All these changes have the corollary advantage of reducing the greenhouse gases spewing into Earth's atmosphere.\In 1996, USX and Westinghouse Corp. shared honors as ""corporate partners of the year"" in the Department of Energy's ""Green Lights"" program, which encourages businesses and industries to adopt more efficient lighting systems.\While the environmental kudos were welcome, the really ""pleasant surprise"" for USX, Carson said last week, has been the $2 million to $3 million in annual savings on utility bills that the sprawling corporation has achieved since putting in new fixtures and operating procedures and switching to low-energy fluorescent bulbs.\All it takes is getting a ""committed group of people"" involved, he said, and ""they find these little nuggets (of savings) all over the place.""\""We're delighted by what the steel industry is doing,"" Joe Romm of the Energy Department said last week after a panel discussion hosted by environmental groups to assess the outcome of the Kyoto conference.\""Clearly, if the steel industry thinks it can do a 10 percent reduction by 2010, that's a big deal, and it's something we're going to hold up as an example for other major energy-users. . . . We're very bullish on what they say they can do,"" said Romm, whose full title is principal deputy assistant secretary of energy for energy efficiency and renewable energy.\While steel company executives say they can adapt to a ""flexible"" program for reducing emissions and still remain globally competitive, the coal industry is digging in for what it is portraying as a life-or-death struggle against mandated reductions in the use of carbon-based fuels.\The Kyoto agreement is ""the death knell for the coal industry,"" John Grasser of the National Mining Association protested last week. ""There's no doubt that it has the potential to wipe out the U.S. coal industry.""\Insisting that there is ""no way"" that technological advances alone will be able to achieve the 7 percent reductions called for in the agreement, Grasser predicts that the administration will turn to new carbon taxes as a way to force down the use of coal and pay for its package of tax incentives to encourage alternative fuels.\""Coal is the highest-based carbon fuel, and this is going to hurt very, very severely,"" Grasser warned. ""That's why the United Mine Workers and the AFL-CIO have jumped on this. As energy prices go up, utilities will stop using coal and go to natural gas, and coal-mining jobs will go to China, India and Korea.""\Over the next few years, he declared, the administration's intent ""is pretty much to close down the coal-mining industry.""\Glasser said the coal industry and its major allies will do everything possible to build opposition in Congress to the Kyoto treaty and any tax breaks or other incentives to implement it.\At the National Coal Council, an advisory board to the Secretary of Energy comprised of both industry officials and representatives from a broad array of public-interest and environmental groups, Executive Director Jim McAvoy is certain the coal industry is going to survive, even if the country makes a major shift to natural gas and other fuels.\""Will it survive in its current state? No, it will not,"" McAvoy said. ""But when you look at the vast amount of energy you need in this country, you're going to have to keep using coal, there's no question about it.""\According to the Energy Information Administration, coal production has risen steadily since the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo, to the point that coal now represents about one-third of the total energy produced in the United States.\Production from mines west of the Mississippi River has been increasing, and last year represented 47 percent of the 1.06 billion tons mined in the United States. Production is expected to grow again this year and next, rising more slowly in the Appalachian coal belt than in the West, and dropping in the middle of the country.\The coal industry currently has 90,300 employees, including 9,000 in Pennsylvania, 3,400 in Ohio and 21,300 in West Virginia.\A report from the Western Economic Analysis Center put the value of coal mined in West Virginia in 1995 at $4.43 billion, compared with $1.65 billion for Pennsylvania and $678.2 million for Ohio.\The Energy Department's Romm said he expects ""coal will be used for decades"" as clean coal technologies advance and its breakdown into separate components of carbon dioxide and hydrogen, which can be used in fuel cells, becomes economically feasible.\And because current coal-burning power plants waste two-thirds of the energy they produce, ""there's lots of opportunity to get `free' energy from existing coal plants,"" he said. ""And we have 10 to 15 years to think how to do this.""\Nancy Kete, an economist with the World Resources Institute, told last week's environmental forum that with coal production already shifting to favor Western states, a tapering off of production in the Appalachian region would likely ""be happening anyway.""\Also, she suggested, industries have a long history of overestimating the costs and burdens of meeting new environmental standards. As an example, she cited a consultant's report prepared for the American Iron and Steel Institute in 1986 that predicted widespread worker layoffs, plant closings and health risks from stress if the industry were forced to comply with new regulations for emissions of particulate matter.\But in September, she pointed out, the AISI's Internet site was heralding the industry's global competitiveness, saying, ""Through tens of billions of dollars in capital investments, steel producers have been able to reduce costs while becoming a global model of industrial efficiency, productivity and quality."" And steel exports were four times above what they were in the mid-1980s.\Credit: PAT GRIFFITH, POST-GAZETTE WASHINGTON BUREAU"

Exelon Corporation, a national company that operates 12 fossil power plants, one hydroelectric plant, two landfill gas plants and three nuclear power plants, including Three Mile Island and Peach Bottom, was well represented at Monday's DEP listening session on the EPA's clean power plan.
\
The plan aims to cut the nation's carbon emissions to a rate that's 32 percent lower than they were a decade ago by 2030.
\
After 14 public listening sessions, of which York's was the eighth, and a public comment period that ends Nov. 12, the agency will draft a clean power plan that will put Pennsylvania on a path to compliance with the federal clean power plan, DEP Secretary John Quigley said in his opening comments.
\
Several Exelon employees, including Jeannie Liggett, senior manager of government affairs at the company, stressed that nuclear energy is carbon-free and should be supported.
\
Liggett said that nuclear power is the ""lynchpin"" of Pennsylvania's transition to clean power.
\
She also said that because of the ""absence of market mechanisms"" to value carbon-free energy, Three Mile Island faces ""economic headwinds."" She urged the DEP to preserve existing zero-carbon resources, such as nuclear power plants.
\
Other speakers were less business-oriented.
\
Environmental justice:Kevin Stewart, Director of Environmental Health at the American Lung Association of the mid-Atlantic, said the changing climate is already affecting the health of Pennsylvanians, citing ground-level ozone, which he called a ""serious respiratory irritant,"" and suggesting the DEP speak with people in vulnerable communities, particularly low-income people who live in polluted environments and face high health risks due to pollution.
\
Through the listening process, the DEP will focus on ""environmental justice"" communities, areas where people face disproportionate threats to their health due to environmental factors, Quigley said after the meeting. Ten of the 14 listening sessions will be held in or near environmental justice zones, he said, and the agency is in the process of reestablishing its Office of Environmental Justice.
\
Mitch Hescox of New Freedom, who is the president of the Evangelical Environmental Network, also looked at the issue from an ethical perspective. He started his comments with a Bible verse and then spoke of increasing rates of childhood asthma and Lyme disease due to climate change and pollution.
\
Hescox said the state should transition to using renewable energy and address the needs of coal miners who will lose their jobs, providing them with training that will allow them to participate in the production of renewable energy.
\
He also urged the Wolf administration to reduce fossil-fuel subsidies and funnel the money instead into research into clean power.
\
David McCullough of East York said he has long been a pastor, at times in coal country, and has seen firsthand the health effects of the coal industry. ""I've conducted the funerals of hundreds of people who died too young while defending the was of life that killed them,"" he said. McCullough advocated a mass-based plan that allows Pennsylvania to trade carbon allowances across state lines.
\
Ideas and concerns: Representing the York chapter of the Citizens' Climate Lobby, Jon Clark advocated a carbon tax, saying that companies need to face consequences for carbon emissions.
\
Joy Bergey, clean energy outreach manager for the Partnership for Policy Integrity, expressed concerns about the plan's objective to maintain a variety of power sources.
\
Bergey was particularly concerned about the burning of biomass--mainly, wood--becoming a replacement for the burning of coal. Though it is sometimes considered a form of clean energy, she said, in addition to degrading forests, burning biomass produces more carbon pollution than coal does.
\
Against the plan:Anna McCauslin, policy director for Pennsylvania's branch of conservative political advocacy group Americans for Prosperity, made claims that rested on the idea that benefits of the clean power plan are 85 years away and ""very limited.""
\
McCauslin referred to the plan as ""controversial"" and expressed her concern that it will cause electricity costs to go up, which she said would hurt low-income families.
\
""This plan will force tough choices on families,"" she said, and suggested that because of rising energy costs, her daughter might have to give up her gymnastics classes.

Thank you for publishing Jon Clark's op-ed on climate change action. Clark pointed out that oil prices collapsed recently. However, he didn't mention that the reason oil prices fell so low is that the Saudis are manipulating the price of oil in the USA. They want to push prices so low that American drillers are pushed out of business. Then, with American competitors destroyed, they'll ramp our prices back up. The best way to free ourselves from future Saudi price gouging is to encourage the development of more and more alternative forms of energy. With oil prices so low right now, it's the perfect opportunity to enact the George Schultz carbon fee and dividend program described by Clark.
\
I understand from your congressman's website that he is concerned about meeting ""our nation's energy needs while taking thoughtful steps to preserve our environment."" Rep. Scott Perry should also care about meeting our nation's energy needs without Saudi price manipulation. Because the Saudi's control of OPEC, we will never be free of their manipulations until we develop more and more non-fossil fuel energies.
\
I urge Rep. Perry to please consider the subject of carbon tax legislation with my congressman, Rep. Joseph Kennedy III, who has now been named to the powerful House Committee on Energy and Commerce.
\
I'm sure they could make a great team to stymie the Saudis.

353,"I'm writing in regard to the recent TV ad in support of D. Raja that appears to paint those who support taxes on energy as extremists and those tax initiatives as ""job killers."" As a volunteer for Citizens Climate Lobby, I feel I need to set the record straight.\The bipartisan Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act, which was recently re-introduced in Congress, has been lauded by economists from across the political spectrum as being an effective means of reducing emissions and as a job creator. The key difference with a straight carbon tax is that all the money collected goes back to American households in the form of a monthly dividend check that people can use as they wish. The government doesn't get a dime other than administrative costs. When Americans spend that money, it's expected to generate 2 million additional jobs over 10 years.\In my view, the ad in question is dangerous because it only serves to slow our response to climate change and ocean acidification, which are both major threats to our security. Most Americans are concerned about climate change, but assume that action requires giving up our way of life. Mr. Raja should learn about The Energy Innovation Act and how it can be good for the economy, good for people and good for the environment. We are out of time to dither over this.\CREDIT: TIM KELLY, Aleppo"
354,"WASHINGTON - Pennsylvania Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick was one of three House Republicans to support a resolution approved Thursday that rebukes President Donald Trump's intention to pull the country out of the Paris climate accord.\The measure would block the Trump administration from using federal funds to withdraw from that international agreement and would require the White House to submit yearly plans on how it would meet the climate deal's obligations on reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\The legislation passed the majority Democrat U.S. House on a vote of 231 to 190. It is expected to die in the Republican-led Senate.\Fitzpatrick is the rare House Republican lawmaker with a positive rating from environmental groups, such as the League of Conservation Voters. He's part of the House Climate Solutions Caucus and has sponsored legislation to enact a carbon tax.\""Climate change must be addressed proactively with leaders from both sides of the aisle working to protect our planet,"" Fitzpatrick said in a statement Thursday. ""Every nation will be affected by climate change, which is why nearly every country agreed to work to reduce carbon emissions in the Paris Climate Accords. The people in my district remain committed to pursuing bipartisan solutions to address climate change and protect our environment which is why I voted yes on HR 9.""\Fitzpatrick also hasn't been shy about bucking his own party on other issues. He opposed a Republican-drafted health care bill in 2017 and Trump's national emergency declaration on border wall funding this year, and he has supported a range of gun-control proposals, including one in the Violence Against Women Act renewal he drafted alongside Democrats.\Washington correspondent Laura Olson can be reached at 202-780-9540 or lolson@mcall.com.\Credit: By Laura Olson"

New EPA regulations are driving some people cuckoo, many wondering when the flood of new regulations will end.
\
A study recently found the wealthy benefit the most from tax credits for plug-in cars and even simple home insulation upgrades. Makes one wonder if a different approach would be better.
\
Carbon emissions cap and trade programs have been developed and implemented for many years now, complete with emissions credit trading on Wall Street.
\
There's something about all of this that makes my head want to explode.
\
It seems all way, way too complicated, especially our supporting of both fossil fuels and renewables simultaneously.
\
Half of Congress wants utterance of ""carbon tax"" on the floor banned. The idea of a fully refunded to households version, which therefor isn't even a tax, is buried from view perhaps because it's so simple it could work really well.
\
Rep. Perry's D.C. staff seems to not understand its simplicity, with an aide declaring ""more oppose EPA regulations than there are climate change people."" He totally missed the boat -- fully refunded carbon fee and dividend 1) isn't regulations and 2) helps the economy and the environment simultaneously according to REMI's authoritative study of it, which meshes with how it's working in British Columbia.
\
We were decreasing our carbon intensity (carbon pollution per unit of energy produced) until the 1990s. Fully refunded carbon fee and dividend just helps us return to that trend via whatever works. Just let the market do its thing. Increases in costs get fully refunded simply to households, with two-thirds expected to come out ahead, including the poor.
\
Carbon fee and dividend could help as Pennsylvania's implementation of the Clean Power Plan, although a national implementation would be simply better.

TO THE EDITOR:
\
I was considerably dismayed to read about the plight of our friendly farmers who might have to fork over $175 a year, per cow for a carbon tax that was reported in the Intell, Dec. 3.
\
These environmentalists who are prodding legislatures to pass this outlandish and ruinous tax have practically an asphyxiating grip on our economic jugular vein.
\
This bloc of concerted antagonists is riding roughshod over our incomes and diminishing our money supply to the four winds as we, the downtrodden taxpayers and hapless farmers, are squeezed blue-in-the-face as we shovel money over to the environmentalists' demands.
\
If the environmentalists are so worried about the environment, then why don't they live in a tree and leave us alone? If they don't stop trying to bleed our economy that's where all of us will have to live.

It's good to learn about a federal task force looking into how to best prepare for rising sea levels in a warming world (""Federal task force warns U.S. coasts,"" YDR, Aug. 20). However, it would be better to learn what Congress is doing to mitigate the problem. A draft report of the next Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report due out in September has already been leaked to the press. According to Reuters, the report says it is at least 95 percent likely that human activities -- chiefly the burning of fossil fuels -- are the main cause of warming since the 1950s. The report also says the phenomenon of sea level rise is ""unequivocal"" and increases prior estimates of projected sea level during this century.
\
A 2011 report commissioned by the U.S. Navy estimated that $100 billion of Navy installations are at risk from sea level rise. Recently, Navy Admiral Samuel J. Locklear III, who leads U.S. Pacific Forces, called climate change our greatest threat saying significant upheaval related to the warming planet ""is probably the most likely thing that is going to happen ... that will cripple the security environment, probably more likely than the other scenarios we all often talk about."" Climate change is a national security issue that we cannot afford to ignore or deny any longer.
\
So it is fantastic timing that our own Rep. Scott Perry announced recently that he has joined a bipartisan group called the problem solvers. As he mentions in his letter, ""America's problems are not going away, and we can't just wait for another Congress or another generation to deal with them."" Climate change is a significant problem that is definitely not going away. A revenue-neutral carbon tax seems like a fair way to address the issue as the problem stems from the massive quantities of carbon pollution we're pumping into the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels.

359,"The health-care debate has been so combustible that the political fire is in danger of sucking the oxygen out of other important congressional business. That can't be allowed to occur, because the other concern about health -- that of the planet -- will only be hurt by delays.\On June 26, the House of Representatives by a narrow margin -- 219-212 -- passed the American Clean Energy and Security Act, HR 2454, which would wean the nation away from fossil fuels with incentives to encourage alternative energy sources such as wind and solar.\The payoff would come at several levels -- the creation of new jobs in green industries, greater national security by lessening the nation's reliance on importing oil from dubious foreign regimes and reduction of global warming gases (of course, less pollution also benefits the overall health of the American people).\Using a cap-and-trade system -- a cap would be set on overall emissions, but companies could buy or sell credits to comply -- the bill would reduce emissions in stages resulting in an 83 percent reduction over 40 years. While climate change still has its skeptics, despite the ever-growing body of evidence, even the Pentagon has become concerned about the implications of a planet convulsed by global warming-linked upheavals.\Before health care became demagoguery's cause du jour, the climate bill was the focus of dire predictions that are sure to be soon revived. The critics say cap-and-trade is just a tax increase on businesses. No, it is a market mechanism offered as a more palatable alternative to a direct carbon tax.\Critics say that it will bankrupt the country, but the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the cost per household by 2020 will be only $175, which is less than the likely rise in the cost of cable TV over that period. They say it will kill jobs, but the potential for job growth is huge. A recent study by a project of the Pew Charitable Trusts found that green energy jobs are already exploding at a rate of 9.1 percent a year. In 2007, Pennsylvania had more than 38,700 of them.\It is not only environmentalists who support this bill. Groups with a personal stake in jobs and a good economy -- ranging from the United Steelworkers to Alcoa -- are backing the bill as a reasonable and much-needed step for the nation to take.\It is now up to the Senate. Supporters of the bill expect it to be introduced in the Committee on the Environment and Public Works shortly after the summer recess, on Sept. 8 or 9. Democratic Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania is a member of that committee.\In the House, Rep. Mike Doyle, D-Forest Hills, provided leadership that helped make the difference, and we hope Sen. Specter and his colleague Sen. Bob Casey will now pick up the ball and run with it. This bill is good for the planet and for America's place in it. It cannot be allowed to die."
360,"Don Hopey can be reached at dhopey@post-gazette.com or 412-263- 1983.\ Former Bush administration Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Christine Todd Whitman predicts the United States will respond to global climate change by enacting mandatory limits on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and industries but that no action will occur before the 2008 elections.\ Ms. Whitman, who spoke yesterday at the Air & Waste Management Association's annual conference in Pittsburgh, said she favors a cap- and-trade program over an across-the-board policy limiting emissions to reign in the greenhouse gases that exacerbate climate change.\ ""A market-based cap-and-trade program can and will work,"" she said, ""and the sooner we engage in that type of control, the better off we will be.""\ Such a program, she said, could be modeled after the successful acid rain control program. It could set a cap or limit on the total amount of carbon dioxide emitted and allow utility companies and industries to decide where to cut emissions by trading credits between those that make the reductions and those that don't.\ Ms. Whitman said global warming is ""not a partisan issue,"" and a federal response makes more sense than the ""patchwork quilt"" of state regulations and programs that have filled a vacuum created by the Bush administration's inaction.\ ""Most of the states would adopt federal greenhouse gas limits if Congress acts,"" she said, ""but carbon regulation probably won't happen before 2008. We need to be ready to go once the election is over.""\ Ms. Whitman said the nation's greenhouse gas control policy should include a new emphasis on nuclear power and encourage people to buy hybrid vehicles to reduce mobile source pollution.\ Government should also be encouraging development of renewable energy sources and use of alternative fuels, she said, but not corn- based ethanol production, which is inefficient to produce, transport and burn and is driving up food prices.\ ""It's a case of political science trumping actual science,"" she told an audience that was much friendlier than the one she had faced Monday in Washington, D.C., where her testimony to a congressional committee about air quality in New York City following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attack was booed by rescue workers. She declined to discuss that topic yesterday.\ Her speech was the third to address greenhouse gas issues at the four-day conference of the Pittsburgh-based, not-for-profit organization of environmental professionals, and reflects the gathering's focus on climate change.\ At a panel discussion yesterday titled ""Climate Change: Electric Power Industry Perspectives,"" there was consensus that such a change is occurring, and human-produced emissions are having a major impact. Discourse focused on how greenhouse gas emission controls should best be imposed.\ Ray Butts, manager of environmental services for Florida Power and Light, said the 65 percent to 70 percent reductions in carbon dioxide emissions needed to stabilize atmospheric carbon can be achieved only by mandatory limits on all sources: utility companies, industries and vehicles.\ He said his company and the Climate Action Partnership, a joint utility, business and environment advocacy group, favor enactment of a federal carbon fee that would ""change the behavior"" of polluters and provide money to support research and development on new technology to capture and sequester carbon emissions.\ Martin Smith, manager of energy policy for Xcel Energy, which has 3.3 million customers in eight Western states and uses coal for almost half of its fuel, said a carbon tax penalizes companies that use a lot of coal. Instead, he proposed they meet clean energy portfolio standards that require they get a minimum of 20 percent to 25 percent of their fuel from clean and renewable sources."
361,"The officials from around the world who will gather today in South Africa to convene the latest round of U.N. climate negotiations are facing an uncomfortable fact: The global pact that has dictated greenhouse-gas targets since 1997 may no longer be relevant.\The mandatory targets of the Kyoto Protocol cover less than a third of the world's carbon output. Major emitters are not bound by it. And, increasingly, the world is relying on a patchwork of measures rather than a universal treaty to lessen the impacts of global warming.\The Kyoto agreement won't die altogether in Durban; it may be extended for another five years without binding commitments from industrialized nations while programs for international carbon offsets are preserved as a way to compensate for emissions.\Delegates to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change will focus largely on technical details, such as how to administer a future fund to help poor nations adapt to global warming and how to transfer clean technology to developed nations.\But the debates over concrete policies to cut greenhouse-gas emissions over the next decade are happening in places such as the Australian Parliament and California's Air Resources Board.\James Connaughton, who chaired the Council on Environmental Quality under President George W. Bush, said Kyoto's global, top-down strategy has been replaced by a more incremental approach to tackling emissions.\""The situation has never been weaker for that vision"" of a global approach, said Mr. Connaughton, now executive vice president for corporate affairs, public and environmental policy for Constellation Energy. ""On the other hand, there's been quite a lot of progress bottom-up, country by country, in terms of setting reasonably ambitious goals and time frames"" for cutting greenhouse gases.\In 1997, nearly 200 countries, including the United States, forged an agreement that aimed to cut industrialized nations' global emissions 5.2 percent compared with 1990 levels by the end of 2012. But 14 years later, the binding targets cover countries that account for just 27 percent of the world's carbon output. That's because the United States did not ratify the Kyoto Protocol and the agreement did not cover major emerging economies such as China and India.\Nonetheless, many countries and regions are pressing ahead with strategies to curb their carbon emissions. Australia imposed a carbon tax that takes effect next year and will transition to a carbon-trading system in 2015.\Several developing countries are adopting what are known as ""nationally appropriate mitigation actions."" Mexico is considering legislation to establish a domestic carbon market while developing rules for the cement industry and providing incentives for low-income residents to buy energy-efficient homes. Colombia is working on plans to scrap its aging and polluting freight trucks, promote renewable energy, increase energy efficiency in construction and expand rapid bus transit.\""You've got some good things happening,"" said Ned Helme, who heads the Center for Clean Air Policy and has worked with several Latin American governments on climate policy. ""Look at where we are on the ground and where we're moving.""\Todd Stern, the U.S. special envoy for climate change, emphasized in a news conference this month that all the major emitters of greenhouse gases established their 2020 climate targets in a political agreement at last year's U.N. talks in Cancun, Mexico. The United States pledged to cut its emissions 17 percent compared with 2005 levels, and China has pledged to cut its carbon dioxide emissions per unit of gross domestic product between 40 percent and 45 percent during that same period.\An analysis by the Center for American Progress shows that these commitments would bring the world two-thirds of the way toward keeping the global temperature rise by the end of the century to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), the target all parties to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change have endorsed for several years. And if developing nations don't follow through on their most ambitious goals, even the two-thirds mark will be out of reach, according to a new report by the U.N. Environment Program.\""What is evident is we have a large gap to fill, because of what science tells us we need to do,"" said Maria Fernanda Espinosa, Ecuador's coordinating minister of heritage and a leading climate negotiator."
362,"What's the best way to reduce the chances of climate change wreaking havoc on Earth? \Easy. Reduce the amount of carbon dioxide we're pumping into the atmosphere by, for instance, putting a price on carbon and thus creating powerful market incentives for industries to lower their carbon footprint. Or by moving to renewable energy sources. Or by changing people's behavior so that our collective actions radically reduce the amount of fossil fuel the world needs to power itself. \Despite all of us knowing this, however, few policies have been put in place to do any of that. In the United States, the effective price of carbon, as Gernot Wagner and Martin Weitzman point out in their new book, ""Climate Shock"" is ""about zero."" Fossil fuels remain the world's default energy source and, despite the impressive growth of global solar capacity, that's likely to be the case for decades. A carbon tax on the worst emitters has gotten nowhere. \So maybe we need to start thinking about coming at the climate-change problem from a different direction. Instead of hoping that humans will start reducing their carbon use, maybe it's time to consider using technology to keep climate change at bay. \The deliberate use of technology to manipulate the environment is called geoengineering. \One method is carbon capture, traditionally conceived as a process that sucks up carbon from the air and buries it in the ground. \A second is called solar radiation management, which uses techniques like shooting sulfate particles into the stratosphere to reflect or divert solar radiation back into space. This effect was illustrated after the volcanic eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines in 1991. Spewing 20 million tons of sulfur dioxide in the air, the volcano caused global temperatures to fall, temporarily, by about 0.5 degrees Celsius. \Somewhat to my surprise, a good portion of the Wagner and Weitzman book is devoted to geoengineering, especially solar radiation management, which they describe as relatively inexpensive and technologically feasible, with a serious bang for the buck. \The reason I was surprised is that the authors have solid environmental credentials - Mr. Weitzman is an environmental economist at Harvard, and Mr. Wagner is a senior economist at the Environmental Defense Fund - and many environmental groups object to the very idea of geoengineering. They even object to research into the subject, viewing the desire to manipulate nature as immoral. \""Geoengineering presumes that we can apply a dramatic technological fix to climate disruption,"" said Ben Schreiber of Friends of the Earth, ""instead of facing the reality that we need to drastically reduce our carbon emissions."" \Mr. Schreiber was reacting to two reports by a National Academy of Sciences panel that came out a week before ""Climate Shock."" The reports concluded that, while ""climate intervention is no substitute for reductions in carbon dioxide emissions,"" the politics around carbon reduction have been so fractious that the day could well come when geoengineering will be needed as part of a ""portfolio"" of responses to global warming. It urged further study for both methods and called for the establishment of a research program to examine the possible risks of solar radiation management. \Messrs. Wagner and Weitzman do not deny the potential risks; indeed, they write quite cautiously about geoengineering. Mr. Wagner told me that it should be thought of as a last resort - something the world could turn to if it had to. He described it as a kind of ""chemotherapy for the planet"" - something you hope you don't have to use, but you are ready to use if the need arises. And that requires doing research now to prepare for the future. \David Keith, a scientist who is perhaps the foremost proponent of geoengineering, told me that solar radiation management should be used even if decent carbon policies become law. ""It has substantial benefits,"" he said. ""That would be true whether we were cutting emissions or not."" \But he also acknowledged that more research is needed. ""If you put sulfur into the atmosphere, will there be a risk of ozone loss?"" he said, as an example of the kind of risk that needed to be studied. \There is another kind of risk, of course: the risk that if people thought a technological solution were available to ""solve"" climate change, it would make it even less likely that they would collectively agree to do what is needed to reduce carbon emissions. It is yet another reason that many environmentalists object to geoengineering. \Still, if disaster is truly approaching, wouldn't you rather be safe than sorry?"

The 2 is back. Last week, U.S. gasoline prices fell below $3 a gallon to an average of $2.91, the lowest level in almost a year. Why does this news leave me with mixed feelings?
\
Because in the middle of this wrenching economic crisis, it would be a real source of relief for many Americans to get a break at the pump. Today's declining gas prices can save $15 to $20 a tank for an SUV-driving family.
\
Yet, it is impossible to ignore the fact that when gasoline hit $4.11 a gallon we changed. Americans drove less, polluted less, exercised more, rode public transportation and overwhelmed Detroit with demands for smaller, more fuel-efficient, hybrid and electric cars. The clean-energy and efficiency industries saw record growth.
\
But with little credit available for energy start-ups, and lower oil prices making it harder for renewables like wind and solar to scale, and a weak economy making it nearly impossible for Congress to pass a carbon tax or gasoline tax that would make clean energy more competitive, what will become of our budding clean-tech revolution?
\
This moment feels to me like a bad B-movie rerun of the 1980s. And I know how this movie ends -- with our re-addiction to oil and OPEC, as well as uncertainty for our economy, trade balance, security and environment.
\
""Is the economic crisis going to be the end of green?"" asks David Rothkopf, author of ""Superclass."" ""Or, could green be the way to end the economic crisis?"" It has to be the latter. We can't afford a bailout that also isn't a green buildup -- a buildup of a new clean energy industry that strengthens America and helps the planet.
\
But how do we do that without policy to affect the price signal for gas and carbon?
\
Here are some ideas: First, Washington could impose a national renewable energy standard that would require every utility in the country to produce 20 percent of its power from clean, non-CO2-emitting, energy sources -- wind, solar, hydro, nuclear, biomass -- by 2025. It would create a huge domestic pull for renewable energy if we had a uniform national mandate.
\
Second, Washington could impose a national requirement that every state move its utilities to a system of ""decoupling-plus."" This is the technical term for shifting them from getting paid for how much electricity or gas they get you to consume to getting paid for how much electricity or gas they get you to save.
\
Third, an idea offered by Andy Karsner, former assistant secretary of energy, would be to modify the tax code so that any company that invests in new domestic manufacturing capacity for clean energy technology -- or procures any clean energy system or energy savings device that is made by an American manufacturer -- can write down the entire cost via a tax credit or accelerated depreciation in the first year.
\
""I'm talking about anything from energy-efficient windows to water heaters to industrial boilers to solar panels, and the job-creating, manufacturing facilities that produce them -- anything that makes us more efficient, lean and economically competitive and comes from a domestic, American source,"" said Karsner.
\
He also suggests money from any stimulus package to incentivize and support states' efforts to modernize their building codes to get already well-established national ""best practices"" quickly into their marketplaces.
\
We need the next president to be an energy efficiency trendsetter, starting by reinventing the inaugural parade. Get rid of the black limos and armored Tahoes inching down Pennsylvania Avenue. Let the next president announce that he will use no vehicles on Inauguration Day that get less than 30 miles per gallon. He could invite all car companies to participate with their best American-made, fuel-efficient, innovative vehicle.
\
Finally, if Congress passes another stimulus package, it can't just be another round of $600 checks to go buy flat-screen TVs made in China. It has to also include bridges to somewhere -- targeted investments in scientific research, mass transit, domestic clean-tech manufacturing and energy efficiency that will make us a more productive and innovative society, one with more skills, more competitiveness, more productivity and better infrastructure to lead the next great industrial revolution: ET -- energy technology.

THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN is a columnist for The New York Times.
"
364,"Thomas L. Friedman is a syndicated columnist for The New York Times.\ OK, class, it's time for another news quiz. I'll give you the question and you tell me who asked it and why it was significant. Ready? Here goes:\ ""Mr. President, how would you rate yourself as an environmentalist? What specifically has your administration done to improve the condition of our nation's air and water supply?""\ You'll never get it. The questioner was James Hubb, a member of the audience at the second presidential debate between George W. Bush and John Kerry at Washington University in St. Louis on Oct. 8, 2004.\ What's the significance? It was the only direct question about energy or environmental policy that was posed in any of the three presidential debates in 2004. Hard to believe when you consider the salience of these issues today. Is it any wonder we still don't have a serious energy policy?\ We can't afford to make this mistake again. In this election cycle, we need to hold a ""Green Debate,"" devoted only to energy and environmental questions. I would suggest Tulane University in New Orleans on Aug. 29, 2007 -- the second anniversary of Katrina. That would give the candidates, Republicans and Democrats, all summer to develop positions and it would give the voters all fall to examine them before the big primaries in February 2008.\ I would like to see each party's candidates questioned separately, so Republican voters and Democrats can each focus on their primary candidates. The questioning should be done by a three- person panel consisting of one climate scientist, one energy investor and one college student, since young people will be the ones most affected by global warming.\ We can't let ethanol-promoting farmers in Iowa determine our energy policy anymore by virtue of the early Iowa primary. For too long, all we've had in this country is energy politics, not energy policy, and that is why we have this incoherent mess of energy systems, standards and fuels.\ ""A new conversation has started in the country -- a new energy economy is what the people want,"" said Carl Pope, director of the Sierra Club. To get there, though, we need to force politicians to start thinking about going ""green"" as part of our national security strategy, as a Plan B for disengaging from Iraq and still driving reform in the Middle East, as an economic opportunity, as a way to restore U.S. leadership and as an answer for climate change.\ Since addressing all these issues will require a carbon tax, or a really serious cap-and-trade system, or tighter mileage and efficiency standards -- i.e., sacrifice -- we need our candidates to be talking about such things in the campaign so they have a mandate to act if elected.\ A group of environmental entrepreneurs, including Andrew Shapiro of GreenOrder and Jesse Fink of Marshall Street Management, just created a Web site, GreenPrimary.org, to host online forums where, after the Green Debate, voters can study the different candidates' policy positions and even vote for the one they think is most serious. ""The 2008 presidential campaign will present the first opportunity for a national candidate to make sustainability a breakthrough electoral issue,"" Mr. Shapiro argues.\ A new survey released last week by the Democratic polling firm Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research, conducted for the Center for American Progress, underscores that large majorities of independents (59 percent) and Democrats (76 percent) support action now to stop global warming and make the U.S. energy-independent, along with a significant bloc of Republicans (41 percent).\ ""Only 27 percent of people feel that our energy policy is headed in the right direction, while 65 percent say our energy policy is seriously off on the wrong track,"" the Greenberg firm said. ""Moreover, a majority of Americans (52 percent) believes the U.S. is either falling or has fallen far behind other countries in developing clean, alternative energy. Only 14 percent of people believe we lead the world in developing these technologies.""\ They're right. The biggest energy deficit we have right now in America is the energy to lead on this issue -- to overcome all the entrenched interests that have tied us in knots and left our country with what the energy expert Gal Luft calls ""the sum of all lobbies"" instead of the sum of the best energy practices.\ The best way to overcome that is to elevate the issue during the campaign to a level that forces everyone to put a serious energy/ environment platform on the table and builds a real mandate for the next president."

Ernest Rukangira knows just what to do with some of the billions of dollars in environmental and development aid pledged during the Earth Summit.
\
The personable, chain-smoking minister of environment and tourism for the African state of Rwanda has a plan.
\
He would improve the protection and ecological management of the mountain rain-forest preserve on his country's northern border, where the movie Gorillas in the Mist was filmed. Price tag: $3.2 million.
\
He would resettle and reforest the Byumba region, which has been ravaged by Rwanda's running civil war. More than 100,000 people have been displaced from their homes there, and 9,450 acres of woodland have been destroyed. Price tag: $13 million.
\
He would build water- and sewage-treatment plants, begin a program to preserve biodiversity, and set up a waste composting program in Kigali, the nation's capital and its only city.
\
There is quite a lot that could be done in Rwanda, which - roughly the size of the state of Maryland - is one of the smallest and the most densely populated countries in Africa.
\
In all, Rukangira has 21 projects, costing $67 million. All he needs is the cash.
\
""There is no lack of things to do,"" Rukangira said. ""There is just a lack of money.""
\
The United Nations, which sponsored the summit, estimates that in all, $125 billion of aid annually - $55 billion more than the wealthy, industrialized nations provide - is needed to finance such programs.
\
One of the questions that the summit did not answer is from where that money would come. In fact, one of the very last texts on which the diplomats struck a compromise was the one dealing with financing.
\
It was vaguely worded and left the industrial nations pledging to increase aid as quickly as they could.
\
The Europeans and the Japanese made bold pledges for funds, which would provide several billion dollars a year.
\
International financial officials say there is plenty of money - from trade, financial debt, military budgets and the like - sloshing around the world that also could be harnessed.
\
Much of this wasted cash, they say, is either the result of present or former bad financial policies which, if changed, could free money without busting national budgets.
\
""Our analysis is that it is feasible. The figures are there . . . even if they are high,"" said Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) - an agency that advises countries on monetary policy.
\
That could be welcome news for Rukangira and other government officials in the developing world. It also could be welcome news for cash-strapped industrial nations.
\
The United States, grappling with a huge budget deficit and the world's largest foreign budget - $11.7 billion a year, offered only $250 million in new environmental funding.
\
U.S. Sen. Larry Pressler (R., S.D.), a member of the congressional delegation in Rio, said the President will have some trouble getting even that amount through Congress due to the nation's budget deficit. ""We are a wealthy country,"" Pressler said, ""but we are fiscally poor.""
\
So from where will the extra billions come that the United Nations estimates are needed for composting and tree planting in Rwanda?
\
International financial experts offered these possibilities:
\
* Trade. Lewis Preston, president of the World Bank, said a 50 percent reduction in tariffs and more favorable terms of trade would generate $65 billion a year in revenues for Third World countries.
\
* Debt forgiveness. Third World countries currently ship $45 billion a year to banks in the prosperous First World. Debt ""drives fiscal policy"" in many developing countries, the IMF's Camdessus said. Despite hefty payments, the debt load has actually increased by $40 billion in the last 20 years. A program to delay or forgive the debt could free billions of dollars.
\
* Military spending. Expenditures on arms dropped by $108 billion between 1985 and 1990, according to Mahbubul Haq, an adviser to the U.N. Development Program. There were $76 billion in military cuts in industrial nations and $32 billion in arms reductions in the Third World, Haq said. ""The problem is,"" he said, ""we haven't seen a peace dividend.""
\
Haq estimates that if military budgets were cut 3 percent a year worldwide for 10 years, the reductions would generate $1.4 trillion. ""This is particularly important in the developing world, where governments must stop spending money on guns and start spending it on people,"" said Haq, the former finance minister of Pakistan.
\
* Carbon tax. The European Community has proposed placing a tax on fossil
\
fuels in all industrialized countries to increase aid and to encourage a reduction in consumption. The tax would start at $1 for the equivalent of a barrel of oil and increase over time to $3. It would generate $40 billion to $100 billion a year.

"
366,"It took more than a month for the container ship Ebba Maersk to steam from Germany to Guangdong, China, where it unloaded cargo on a recent Friday -- a week longer than it did two years ago.\But for the owner, the Danish shipping giant Maersk, that counts as progress.\In a global culture dominated by speed, from overnight package delivery to bullet trains to fast-cash withdrawals, the company has seized on a sales pitch that may startle some hard-driving corporate customers: Slow is better.\By halving its top cruising speed over the last two years, Maersk cut fuel consumption on major routes by as much as 30 percent, greatly reducing costs. But the company also achieved an equal cut in the ships' emissions of greenhouse gases.\""The previous focus has been on 'What will it cost?' and 'Get it to me as fast as possible,' "" said Soren Stig Nielsen, Maersk's director of environmental sustainability, who noted that the practice began in 2008, when oil prices jumped to $145 a barrel. ""But now there is a third dimension,"" he said. ""What's the CO2 footprint?""\Traveling more slowly, he added, is ""a great opportunity"" to lower emissions ""without a quantum leap in innovation.""\In what reads as a commentary on modern life, Maersk advises in its corporate client presentation, ""Going at full throttle is economically and ecologically questionable.""\Transport emissions have soared in the past three decades as global trade has grown by leaps and bounds, especially long-haul shipments of goods from Asia. The container ship trade grew eightfold between 1985 and 2007.\The mantra was, ""Need it now."" But the result is that planes, ships, cars and trucks all often travel at speeds far above maximum fuel efficiency.\Slowing down from high speeds reduces emissions because it reduces drag and friction as ships plow through the water.\Of course, mile per mile, shipping even at conventional speeds is far more efficient than road travel. Shipping a ton of toys from Shanghai to northern Germany churns out less emissions than trucking them south to Berlin afterward.\Some carriers initially resisted the idea of slowing down, arguing that speed was indispensable to serving their clients.\""There was initially a lot of skepticism,"" said Philip Damas, director of liner travel at Drewry Shipping Consultants of London. ""All ships are built with the expectation they'd have to sail fast.""\But now, he said, carriers from Germany to Israel to China are starting to embrace the slow strategy. Today more than 220 vessels are practicing ""slow steaming"" -- cruising at 20 knots on open water instead of the standard 24 or 25 -- or, like Maersk's vessels, ""super slow steaming"" (12 knots).\And many companies find that the practice allows them to cut prices in an ever more competitive market, even at a time when oil prices hover around $80 a barrel.\Any rise in fuel prices or taxes would enhance the appeal of slow steaming. At the international climate conference in Copenhagen in December, Connie Hedegaard, now the European Union's climate minister, proposed a tax on fuels used in shipping, saying the proceeds could be used to help poor countries adapt to rising temperatures.\China and India objected, saying it would increase the price of their exports to the West.\There are practical obstacles to a tax. For one thing, longstanding international agreements intended to promote global trade exempt airline and shipping fuel from taxation.\And even if nations were to accept emission ceilings under a so-called cap-and-trade system, there is enormous disagreement over how the accounting would work. Should the Ebba Maersk's emissions appear on Denmark's balance sheet, even though it travels from China to Germany and back?\While slowing speeds is a good idea, said David Bonilla, senior research fellow at the transport studies unit at Oxford University's School of Geography and the Environment, he maintains that it cannot on its own arrest the emissions growth resulting from today's trade patterns, in which vast amounts of goods are produced in Asia but consumed in Europe or the United States.\To make a difference, he said, fuel costs for long-distance shipping must rise to the point where carriers are forced to invest in new, far more efficient boats or shift to shorter routes.\Yet in shifting hundreds more ships to its slow steaming program last year, Maersk considered itself prescient: It is convinced that a carbon tax or tighter shipping rules are on the horizon.\""This is not going away, and those of us who are starting now will be ahead of regulations,"" Mr. Nielsen said."
367,"The climate crisis is already hitting Pennsylvania, raising temperatures and increasing our days of extreme heat alongside the impact of floods and landslides — but some lawmakers are forcing an old debate that will lead to no action at all.\That’s the only conclusion an honest observer could draw from the effort to block Pennsylvania from joining the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) — a compact of 11 New England and Mid-Atlantic states, with over a decade-long track record, to reduce carbon emissions and bring home revenue.\RGGI is a carbon emission cap-and-trade program — not a new or radical idea. It sets a total carbon allowance for power plants operating within states that belong to the compact. A power plant then can either transition toward cleaner energy or buy CO2 allowances, with revenues from these purchases going back to RGGI states.\In October 2019, Gov. Tom Wolf signed an executive order instructing the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to start drafting regulations to join RGGI. For nearly two years, the DEP has been going through a long regulatory process with multiple stakeholders — including the legislature.\The DEP estimates that by joining RGGI in 2022, Pennsylvania would be able to cut carbon emissions by at least 25.5% by 2030. Considering that Pennsylvania accounts for nearly 1% of greenhouse gas emissions worldwide, that reduction could have global significance.\What makes RGGI appetizing to states, and should to Pennsylvania, is that revenue from the purchase of power allowances goes right back to the state. The program has so far brought in more than $139 million for New Jersey to invest in clean energy and emission reduction in 2021 alone. DEP estimates that RGGI will bring the commonwealth nearly $2 billion and net 30,000 jobs between 2022 and 2030.\Revenue, jobs, better health, reduced emissions — these are the opportunities the state Senate is trying to block in Pennsylvania.\On June 14, the Senate passed a bill advertised by Republicans as “requiring Legislative Approval for Imposing a Carbon Tax.” Although RGGI does not include such a tax, the bill is an effort to prevent Pennsylvania from joining the compact under the guise of legislators wanting to be involved. A similar bill passed both chambers in September 2020, and was rightly vetoed by Gov. Wolf. But the current bill has received more Democratic support in the Senate — including from Philadelphia’s Sen. Tina Tartaglione — and is now going to the House.\Sen. Gene Yaw, the Republican chair of the Environmental Resources and Energy Committee who discloses income from oil and gas companies year after year, claims RGGI would put “hardworking Pennsylvanians out of work.” That is exactly the kind of backward-looking view that leaves workers in polluting plants vulnerable to their jobs’ inevitable disappearance. The operator of the Cheswick Generating Station, a coalfired power plant outside of Pittsburgh, announced the plant’s closure this month — along with closures of coal plants in Ohio and Maryland, only the latter a RGGI state.\Inaction abandons workers. RGGI and investment in the transition to clean energy manages the decline.\RGGI is also merely one starting point for mitigating the climate crisis. It addresses just one type of emissions (carbon) in one type of sector (power). RGGI does nothing to tackle, for example, methane — a greenhouse gas that leaks from fracking wells and traps more heat in the atmosphere than does CO2. Following a recent study on the impact of methane emissions, the executive director of the United Nations Environment Programme said: “Cutting methane is the strongest lever we have to slow climate change over the next 25 years.”\Instead of debating RGGI, Pennsylvania should join speedily, and the legislature should debate how to most equitably use the revenue both to support those who work in polluting plants and to address environmental injustice. Then the state could address the big-ticket items: how to move away from fracking and liquefied natural gas pipelines to reduce methane emissions.\The opportunities of investment in renewable energy and infrastructure improvements go well beyond the jobs and revenues RGGI would bring in. But as long as even a tested, market-based, cap-and-trade program meets such vigorous opposition, Pennsylvania will be stuck in the polluting past — not doing its part to protect its own residents, nor its fair share for the rest of the world."
368,"The round-the-clock coverage of November's midterm elections focused almost exclusively on the size of the blue wave, now 38 congressional seats and growing. But I was looking for a different wave that Tuesday night, a green one, evidence of a groundswell of support for climate change and other green initiatives that have suffered greatly in the last two years.\As I sift through the tea leaves of the election, the climate change takeaway seems mixed, more like two steps forward, one step back. But it's progress.\In the House, many of those 38 incoming representatives campaigned openly on climate change, few more so than New York's Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a veteran of Standing Rock pipeline protests, who ran on a ""Green New Deal"" and believes America can wean itself off fossil fuels by 2035. Ocasio-Cortez, on her first trip to Washington for her orientation, visited 200 protesters outside likely House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office to support their demand that Democrats step up action on climate change. The press loved her appearance, but somehow Pelosi did, too, which bodes well for the young Democratic star.\Speaking of Pelosi, she has already talked about reinstating the select panel on global warming, dismantled in 2011. In addition, Eddie Bernice Johnson, the reelected Texas Democrat expected to chair the House Science Committee, has promised to ""address the challenge of climate change, starting with acknowledging it is real."" Here's a radical notion: Good science should inform sound policy.\The tsunami of more than 100 women winning elections for Congress will also make a difference in the congressional response to climate change, as men have clearly dropped the ball. ""Along with better health care,"" wrote correspondent Mary Jordan in the Washington Post, ""other key issues that helped propel women were their pledges to better protect the environment and to help stop the rising incivility and divisions among Americans."" This is true of Reps.-elect Mary Gay Scanlon in Delaware County, Chester County's Chrissy Houlahan, and Madeleine Dean of a Montgomery-Berks district, all of whom won calling for action on climate, among other issues.\On the negative side of the ledger, a majority of the Republican members of the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus will not be returning to Congress, making bipartisan action on this issue even less probable than now. On the red-blue divide, climate change got bluer that Tuesday, if you can believe that.\At the state level, things seem even more promising. Incoming governors in seven states from Maine to New Mexico pledged action on climate change, some of them even promising to move their states completely to renewable energy. Janet Mills of Maine - no radical at all - vowed to reduce her state's greenhouse gas emissions 80 percent by 2030, and Wisconsin's Stephen Evers pledged to join 17 other states committed to keeping the goals of the Paris climate accord, the one that President Trump famously walked away from. A majority of states electing attorneys general chose Democrats, candidates more likely to challenge Trump's anti-environmental and anti-climate initiatives in the court system.\That's all good. But it wasn't a green wave. Beto O'Rourke in Texas and Andrew Gillum in Florida, running for senator and governor, respectively, both talked about climate change openly and candidly, counterpoints to their anti-climate opponents, but both lost by razor-thin margins. Gillum's opponent, former Rep. Ron DeSantis, said during the election, ""I am not in the pew of the global-warming leftist,"" and won, in a state showing signs of climate stress from toxic algae and sunny-day flooding from a rising ocean.\Among the many state ballot initiatives across the country, Nevadans approved a measure requiring electric utilities to get 50 percent of their power from renewable sources by 2030, up from around 25 percent today, but neighboring Arizona's similar initiative lost, and the voters of Washington state turned aside a carbon tax initiative. While new storm water and flood protection measures also passed in many states, initiatives given immediacy by climate change, new fracking restrictions lost in Colorado.\So a green wave did not materialize. But as Ocasio-Cortez, Scanlon, Dean, and Houlahan join 100 other women marching into Washington, there was a ripple. And as 2020 bears down on us, as our climate continues to crumble, as California burns, watch for this issue to erupt in the presidential election. It's about time. In fact, it's 30 years overdue.\Mike Weilbacher directs the Schuylkill Center for Environmental Education in Upper Roxborough.\ \Credit: By Mike Weilbacher"

Out for Lent
\
Why do the Catholic churches have to have bingo and gambling during Lent? We should all respect the Lenten season, all the denominations. Frog's take: If you object, why not consider organizing a fundraiser to take the place of bingo?
\
More oil?
\
I thought that after the Iraq War, we were supposed to get more oil from Iraq.
\
Thank you
\
I would like to thank the person who returned my purse to the office at Weis. Thank you very much and God bless you.
\
Sad but true
\
The comment from ""Eye of the beholder"" was so funny, but so true. Another caller commented about more jobs for our area, but they forgot to say anything about more money in their greedy pockets.
\
Something for nothing
\
So smokers at the highrise get the gazebo and the non-smokers get nothing. What in the heck do you call that? That is nuts.
\
Directing prayers
\
I see that Britain's highest-ranking priest has resigned amid allegations that he acted inappropriately with other priests, etc. But he said he is going to pray that the Holy Spirit will guide the Catholic Church. Maybe what they should do is pray that the Holy Spirit would enlighten them to eliminate the ban on the sacrament of marriage for priests. Maybe they should do that.
\
No sense
\
How is it that a teacher who is charged with sexting 4,300 messages has to register under the Adam Walsh Act but a man who is charged with sexually assaulting a 13-year-old girl does not have to register? That doesn't make any sense to me.

Don't get it

Let me get this straight. One guy sexually assaults a 13-year-old girl and he doesn't have to register for 15 years under the Adam Walsh Act, and another guy sends dirty text messages and he has to register for 15 years. We have one screwed-up criminal justice system.

Shame on Sen. Toomey. He voted against aid for our New Jersey neighbors after Hurricane Sandy and voted against Chuck Hagel, a twice-decorated Vietnam vet to serve as Secretary of Defense.

Terrific, no smoking in the highrise in Shamokin. Please stop smoking in all other highrises. Don't wait until there is a fire to do it, especially in the wooden buildings.

Revolving junk
\
That is the picture of Gilligbauer's property that you chose to put in the paper? You really need to go over there on a regular basis and take pictures of all his junk over there. That picture is a joke. Frog's take: That is one of several we've published in the past from Gilligbauer's lot.
\
Costs too much
\
I must say I am enjoying the Geisinger employees defending the Life Flight rides and the exorbitant cost of riding in a ambulance, but they are not mentioning the fact that all studies of the medical community, including the Journal of Medicine, said that 90 percent of helicopter rides like Life Flight are unnecessary, unneeded and cost too much.

\
Eleven days is not that long to go through 82 gallons of oil, especially with the cold weather we have been having. I would suggest that you start wearing a sweater, lower your thermostat or get one of those infrared electric heaters that can cut your heating bills in half.
\
Counting on it
\
To the person who said that there is no price tag on a loved one's life: That is true, and that is why Geisinger Life Flight is counting on it. Why do you think they have the price jacked up so high? Why do you think they have the price jacked up so high on everything?

Today's lesson
\
The U.S.A. and China are the two greatest polluters of the environment. China is actively moving toward cleaner and renewable fuels and just imposed a carbon tax. Their progress in this area bears watching. There may be a lesson to be learned.

371,"The 2 is back. Last week, U.S. retail gasoline prices fell below $3 a gallon -- to an average of $2.91 -- the lowest level in almost a year. Why does this news leave me with mixed feelings?\Because in the middle of this wrenching economic crisis, with unemployment rising and 401(k)'s shrinking, it would be a real source of relief for many Americans to get a break at the pump. Today's declining gasoline prices act like a tax cut for consumers and can save $15 to $20 per tank-full for an SUV-driving family, compared with when gasoline was $4.11 a gallon in July.\Yet, it is impossible for me to ignore the fact that when gasoline hit $4.11 a gallon we changed -- a lot. Americans drove less, polluted less, exercised more, rode more public transportation and, most important, overwhelmed Detroit with demands for smaller, more fuel-efficient, hybrid and electric cars. The clean-energy and efficiency industries saw record growth -- one of our few remaining engines of real quality job creation.\But with little credit available today for new energy start-ups, and lower oil prices making it harder for existing renewables like wind and solar to compete, and a weak economy making it nearly impossible for Congress to pass a carbon tax or gasoline tax that would make clean energy more competitive, what will become of our budding clean-tech revolution?\This moment feels to me like a bad B-movie rerun of the 1980s. And I know how this movie ends -- with our re-addiction to oil and OPEC, as well as corrosive uncertainty for our economy, trade balance, security and environment.\""Is the economic crisis going to be the end of green?"" asks David Rothkopf, energy consultant and author of ""Superclass."" ""Or, could green be the way to end the economic crisis?""\It has to be the latter. We can't afford a financial bailout that also isn't a green buildup -- a buildup of a new clean energy industry that strengthens America and helps the planet.\But how do we do that without any policy to affect the price signal for gasoline and carbon?\Here are some ideas: First, Washington could impose a national renewable energy standard that would require every utility in the country to produce 20 percent of its power from clean, non-CO2-emitting, energy sources -- wind, solar, hydro, nuclear, biomass -- by 2025. About half the states already have these in place, but they are all different. It would create a huge domestic pull for renewable energy if we had a uniform national mandate.\Second, Washington could impose a national requirement that every state move its utilities to a system of ""decoupling-plus."" This is the technical term for changing the way utilities make money -- shifting them from getting paid for how much electricity or gas they get you to consume to getting paid for how much electricity or gas they get you to save. Several states have already moved down this path.\Third, an idea offered by Andy Karsner, former assistant secretary of energy, would be to modify the tax code so that any company that invests in new domestic manufacturing capacity for clean energy technology -- or procures any clean energy system or energy savings device that is made by an American manufacturer -- can write down the entire cost of the investment via a tax credit and/or accelerated depreciation in the first year.\""I'm talking about anything from energy-efficient windows to water heaters to industrial boilers to solar panels, and the job-creating, manufacturing facilities that produce them -- anything that makes us more efficient, lean and economically competitive and comes from a domestic, American source,"" said Mr. Karsner.\He also suggests using some of the money from any stimulus package to directly incentivize and support states' efforts to implement and intelligently modernize their building codes to get already well-established national ""best practices"" quickly into their marketplaces.\Lastly, we need the next president to be an energy efficiency trendsetter, starting by reinventing the inaugural parade. Get rid of the black stretch limos and double-plated armored Chevy Tahoes inching down Pennsylvania Avenue. Instead, let the next president announce that he will use no vehicles on Inauguration Day that get less than 30 miles per gallon. He could invite all car companies to participate in the historic drive with their best available American-made, fuel-efficient, innovative vehicle.\Finally, if Congress passes another stimulus package, it can't just be another round of $600 checks to go buy flat-screen TVs made in China. It has to also include bridges to somewhere -- targeted investments in scientific research, mass transit, domestic clean-tech manufacturing and energy efficiency that will make us a more productive and innovative society, one with more skills, more competitiveness, more productivity and better infrastructure to lead the next great industrial revolution: ET -- energy technology."
372,"I didn't expect much from the G-20 meeting this week, but if I had my wish, the leaders of the world's 20 top economies would have committed themselves to a new standard of accounting -- call it ""Market to Mother Nature"" accounting.\Why? Because it's now obvious that the reason we're experiencing a simultaneous meltdown in the financial system and the climate system is because we have been mispricing risk in both arenas -- producing a huge excess of both toxic assets and toxic air that now threatens the stability of the whole planet.\Just as AIG sold insurance derivatives at prices that did not reflect the real costs and the risks of massive defaults (for which we taxpayers ended up paying), oil companies, coal companies and electric utilities today are selling energy products at prices that do not reflect the real costs to the environment and real risks of disruptive climate change (so future taxpayers will end up paying).\Whenever prices do not reflect the real costs and risks associated with their use, people go to excess. And that is what happened in the financial marketplace and in the energy/environmental marketplace during the credit bubble.\Our biggest finance companies engaged in complicated trading schemes that did not adequately price the costs and risks of a market reversal. AIG, for instance, was selling insurance for all kinds of things and did not have near adequate reserves to cover claims if things went badly wrong, as they did.\Meanwhile, our biggest energy companies, utilities and auto companies became dependent on cheap hydrocarbons that spin off climate-changing greenhouse gases, and we clearly have not forced them, through a carbon tax, to price in the true risks and costs to society from these climate-changing fuels.\""When the balance sheet of a company does not capture the true costs and risks of its business activities,"" and when that company is too big to fail, ""you end up with them privatizing their gains and socializing their losses,"" Nandan Nilekani, the co-chairman of the Indian technology company Infosys, told me. Everyone gets to rack up their private profits today and pay them out in bonuses and dividends. But any catastrophic losses -- if the company is too big to fail -- ""get socialized and paid off by taxpayers.""\This is why we need new regulations that rein in the speculative trading that big banks and insurance companies can undertake so they never again become too reckless to regulate but too big fail and taxpayers are forced to pay off their toxic assets. This is also why we need a tax on carbon -- so we and our power utilities don't become permanently addicted to cheap coal that makes for lower electricity prices today but spits out toxic gases that must be paid for by future generations tomorrow.\That's what ""Market to Mother Nature"" accounting is all about. It begins with the premise that the distinction between the G-20 and the Copenhagen climate-change negotiations is totally artificial. They are just flip sides of the same global problem -- how we as a world keep raising standards of living for more and more people in ways that will not, as a byproduct, have both the Market and Mother Nature producing huge amounts of toxic assets.\The old system worked like this: We built more and more stores in America to sell more and more stuff, which was made in more and more Chinese factories powered by more and more coal that earned more and more dollars to buy more and more U.S. treasury bills that got recycled back to America in the form of cheap credit to build more and more stores and more and more houses that gave rise to more and more Chinese factories ....\This system was a powerful engine of wealth creation and lifted millions out of poverty, but it relied upon the risks to the Market and to Mother Nature being underpriced and to profits being privatized in good times and losses socialized in bad times.\This capitalist engine doesn't need to be discarded; it needs some fixes. For starters, we need to get back to basics -- accountable lending, prudent saving, reasonable leverage and, most important, more engineering of goods than financial products.\Some of our biggest financial firms got away from their original purpose -- to fund innovation and to finance the process of ""creative destruction,"" whereby new technologies that improve people's lives replace old ones, said Columbia University economist Jagdish Bhagwati in ""The American Interest."" Instead, he said, too many banks got involved in exotic financial innovations -- to simply make money out of money -- which ended up as ""destructive creation.""\""Destructive creation"" has wounded both the Market and Mother Nature. Smart regulation and carbon taxation can heal both."
373,"""I'm deeply convinced we might win,"" said a soccer player during the recent World Cup. Unfortunately for him, the best team won - and it wasn't his.\Here's a claim with a better chance for success: When the U.S. has an energy policy that allows the best fuel to win in a true free market, the economy will prosper while public health and the environment benefit.\In a true free market, there are no subsidies (no more Solyndra's! ), and every producer pays what their product costs the economy. Citizens' Climate Lobby (CCL) proposes such a policy. A letter writer in last week's Sunday News doubted the efficacy of CCL's fee and dividend proposal; however, endorsements from highly regarded economists keep rolling in.\Here are a few of them: Greg Mankiw, former chair of George W. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers; George P. Shultz, former President Ronald Reagan's secretary of state; and Nobel Prize-winning economist Gary Becker. CCL's advisory board includes Shultz; Dr. James Hansen, former director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies; former Congressman Bob Inglis, now executive director of the Energy and Enterprise Initiative; and evangelical climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe, one of Time Magazine's 2014 ""100 Most Influential People.""\Additional validation came when Regional Economic Modeling Inc. (REMI) released a new study finding that the Carbon Fee and Dividend (CF&D) legislation CCL advocates would add 2.1 million jobs over 10 years with a cumulative increase in GDP of $1.375 trillion.\The improvements in air quality would save 13,000 lives a year as CO2 emissions decline by 33 percent. REMI's economic report attracted attention in June when 600 CCL volunteers met with over 90 percent of the members of Congress or their staffs. REMI's work is widely respected by policymakers and recognized as free from ideological bias. Former clients include the American Gas Association, the Nuclear Energy Institute, the National Federation of Independent Businesses and 47 US states.\While sound economics dictate that each player in the energy market should pay their own way, our current arrangement socializes soot. Fossil fuel- based energy companies are not paying their true costs, which creates an unfair advantage over the competition. Not only do carbon emissions increase health care costs, they also add to the damages caused by global warming. A new bipartisan report on the damages from global warming, ""Risky Business,"" forecasts $35 billion in annual property losses from coastal storms, a 14 percent decline in crop yields, and heat waves costing power customers up to $12 billion more per year. Why should taxpayers pay for this while energy companies pocket huge profits?\To address this market distortion, CCL proposes a steadily rising fee on CO2 assessed at the point of extraction. In addition, American businesses would be protected by applying a border adjustment fee on imports to account for the CO 2 emitted in the process of manufacturing goods.\Since the U.S. has the world's biggest economy, other countries naturally want to sell their products to U.S. consumers (think India and China). A border adjustment gives countries the incentive to assess their own price on carbon, resulting in even greater reductions in CO2 emissions worldwide.\But what sets CCL's plan apart from other carbon tax schemes is the 100 percent revenue-neutral feature. All monies collected would be distributed equally to American households. No tax and spend. No growing of government. The dividend checks would provide a family of four with $288 each month after 10 years. This rebate would both cushion consumers from rising energy prices and stimulate the economy. Consumers and investors would increasingly choose low-carbon fuels.\With support for CF&D growing and CCL volunteers determined to keep lobbying Congress, this policy has a good chance to become law. When that happens, sit back and watch as the best fuel wins."
374,"Amid all the back and forth about climate change, the two most important facts may be these: \First, the carbon dioxide our engines and power plants produce does not dissipate, break down or otherwise go away. Although we cannot see it or feel it, much of the CO2 humans produce goes permanently into the atmosphere, where it will stay for hundreds, even thousands, of years. At present, there is 45 percent more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere than before we started burning fossil fuels. That figure is rising by about 1 percent per year. \Now, combine that with the second fact - carbon dioxide traps the sun's radiation - and you see immediately why we have a problem. \Warmth from the sun, which would otherwise bounce back out into space, gets ""caught"" by CO2 and kept close to the Earth. This is basic physics, and scientists have known about it for 150 years. Although some of this heat-trapping capability is essential to maintain a livable planet, 45 percent more CO2 is entirely too much, and the planet is getting warmer. \The scientific data confirm this. We have just had our 369th straight month with world temperatures above the 20th century average. Although we had a relatively cool spring and summer in Lancaster County, this has not been the case worldwide. Globally, the first six months of this year were the hottest on record, and 2015 is on track to set the mark for the hottest year in recorded history. In fact, 11 of the 12 hottest years on record have been since the turn of this century. \Scientists are concerned about the rising carbon dioxide in the atmosphere for other reasons, too. A certain percentage of this CO2 is absorbed by the oceans, where it is turning sea water increasingly acidic. This is beginning to interfere with the ability of many marine species, particularly coral and shellfish, to thrive and reproduce. The health of our oceans, so vital for food and other resources, is already compromised, and the increased CO2 is making it worse. In addition, species extinction around the world is accelerating. \Perhaps most unsettling of all is the concern among scientists that the millions of tons of methane trapped in the Arctic tundra and the floor of the Arctic Ocean may be released as the planet warms and the ice melts. Many scientists worry about a positive feedback loop in which more warming will result in more methane release, resulting in even more warming, and so on. \There is simply no way to mitigate these threats except to stop adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. \We humans are presently involved in a dangerous experiment. We are removing billions of tons of carbon from the earth in the form of fossil fuels and sending this carbon permanently into the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide. The overwhelming consensus among scientists is that continuing down this path will be disastrous. \Hence Pope Francis' message that action is needed now. As he said at his White House welcoming ceremony last Wednesday, ""It seems clear to me that climate change is a problem which can no longer be left to a future generation. When it comes to the care of our common home, we are living at a critical moment in history."" \Let's be clear: There is no disagreement among climate scientists about the reality of global warming. The fact is that the opponents of climate change don't deny global warming because of the science. They deny it because they don't like the implications. Climate science threatens the reign of unfettered capitalism, and they can't accept the possibility that, to deal with this problem, additional constraints will have to be placed on the way we do business. \We now know a great deal about how nature works when it comes to the climate, and we are being called to change our way of thinking. To be sure, a good deal of humility and courage is demanded here. \But the truth is that no technological fixes are available that will allow us to keep doing what we're doing and get away with it. This leaves only one good option, and that is transitioning to clean energy. \Fortunately, there is a market-based way to do this. A revenue-neutral carbon tax - in which carbon-based fuels are taxed at the point of extraction from the ground or entry into the country, with 100 percent of the money generated returned to individual households - is not the whole solution, but it is almost certainly the best place to start. \The entrenched interests against this are noisy and have deep pockets. And we have a Congress that finds it difficult to take bold steps, even when desperately needed. \Are we paying attention to the scientists who tell us that continuing down our present path of inaction will be the costliest response of all in the end? Do we understand that climate change, if left unchecked, will devastate the environment, seriously diminish our way of life, and leave us and our children with a much less habitable planet? \If so, the obvious question is: Why aren't we speaking up? \Barry Stoner lives in Elizabethtown.

375,"Western Pennsylvania is home to several contentious congressional races, but the incumbents in the 12th and 14th districts should survive. Reps. John Murtha of Johnstown and Mike Doyle of Forest Hills are the better choices on Election Day, and if you could interview their challengers you'd understand why.\* * *\Mike Doyle, 55, is in his seventh term in the 14th District, which includes Pittsburgh and 50 communities in the heart of Allegheny County between Monroeville and Coraopolis and between Reserve and Elizabeth. He is an ardent critic of the Iraq war and supports a mix of solutions to the nation's energy challenges. In September he voted for the sweeping bill that would roll back tax breaks to oil companies, invest in renewable energy sources, require the administration to sell 10 percent of the strategic petroleum reserve and allow limited offshore oil drilling. Last year he voted to raise fuel efficiency standards for U.S. automakers.\He backed the $700 billion economic bailout because he felt it was necessary to stabilize credit markets and that taxpayers eventually will get their money back. As to Iraq, Mr. Doyle says he would remove U.S. troops earlier than his party's presidential nominee, Barack Obama. He believes one of the unfortunate consequences of that war has been loss of control in Afghanistan and Pakistan, where he says the next administration must focus attention.\His challenger is Christopher Titus North of the Green Party, an adjunct professor at Pitt and financial editor with Thomson Reuters who ran two years ago. The son of a peace activist, he faults the Democratic and Republican parties for ""pulling the country apart"" and fomenting a militarism that ""is trying to control the world.""\Mr. North, 47, of Squirrel Hill has a strong concern for the environment and interest in sustainable energy. He favors a carbon tax, rather than a cap-and-trade system, to curb emissions and he wants to phase out the use of coal, gas, oil and nuclear power. He also wants an Apollo-style program to build a renewable energy infrastructure.\He would have voted against the Wall Street bailout, saying it gives the treasury secretary czar-like powers and Congress only ""spectator oversight."" He said he would pull out all U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan and reduce the number of military bases abroad.\While we commend Mr. North for his passion, we're afraid it would meet with a brick wall in Washington. Mike Doyle is more practical and better suited to working with the range of views in the House, and we endorse him for a new term.\* * *\John Murtha is having to fight harder for his seat because the words of the 17-term congressman have gotten him into hot water.\Last week, while analyzing the presidential race in Pennsylvania for the Post-Gazette editorial board, he said, ""There's no question Western Pennsylvania is a racist area."" Two years ago he said the 2005 killings of Iraqi civilians by U.S. troops were done in ""cold blood,"" which drew a defamation suit from a Marine.\If Mr. Murtha, 76, should take more care with his words, he should do the same with his behavior. Known as a master of congressional pork, Mr. Murtha led his House colleagues with 30 earmarks for his district in a spending bill that passed last month; the items totaled $111 million, including $24.5 million for the National Drug Intelligence Center in Johnstown. Last Sunday The New York Times reported, in a story published in the Post-Gazette, that defense contractors, who vie for the congressman's attention as chairman of the Appropriations defense subcommittee, are major contributors to the Johnstown symphony, a favorite Murtha cause.\All that must be weighed against Mr. Murtha's outspoken criticism of the Iraq war, his support for expansion of the State Children's Health Insurance Program, his vote in July to save hundreds of thousands of homeowners from foreclosure and his work on bills to counter global warming.\His challenger, Republican William Russell, is making his first run for office. Recently retired from the Army after 28 years of active and reserve service, he says the incumbent, despite a long career of support for the military, has ""encouraged the enemy"" with his inflammatory remarks.\Mr. Russell, 46, of Johnstown adheres to a less-is-more philosophy of government. He opposed the economic bailout and said much of the crisis was due to an unwarranted social agenda to promote homeownership. He said the market should be allowed to heal itself, which means ""some people will lose homes, some will lose businesses and things are going to go down. But when you start trying to protect everybody, that's when trouble begins.""\The challenger says government should focus on infrastructure, national defense and law and order. ""It's not the government's role to ensure that everyone gets equality of outcome,"" he said. This survival-of-the-fittest approach may work for Mr. Russell, but not for many residents of the 12th District, which includes Greene County and parts of Allegheny, Armstrong, Cambria, Indiana, Somerset, Fayette, Washington and Westmoreland counties.\The incumbent may have his warts, but the challenger is not a promising alternative. We endorse John Murtha for another term."
376,"Carbon fee way to go on climate \The Jan. 22 letter ""Earth has a fever; a cure is available"" recommends a carbon fee as the best way to move from fossil fuels to clean energy. \The states of Oregon and Washington are now planning to enact a carbon tax, and California already has a carbon cap-and-trade program. \The only question is: Which plan works best? California's plan has led to real emissions cuts, and the state's economy has prospered, but it is complex and leaves loopholes for cheaters. \A carbon-pollution fee on all fossil fuels - one that's refunded, directly and entirely, to every American - is the plan that most economists agree is best. \In British Columbia, this kind of revenue-neutral carbon fee has worked well, cutting taxes, creating jobs and increasing gross domestic product. This can serve as a good model for the U.S. \State-by-state measures will do virtually nothing to affect climate change. Only a national carbon fee will enable the U.S. to impose import fees to induce China and other countries to adopt their own carbon reduction plans. That, after all, is a key reason to pursue carbon taxing in the first place. \Karen Davis \Citizens Climate Lobby volunteer \Manheim Township \U.S. budget far too war-oriented \This country is in deep trouble. Our Congress votes 57 percent of our discretionary budget for war (wars of aggression only - they don't make us any friends either, rather they increase our enemies by several orders of magnitude). In 2014, the U.S. and Israel bombed eight Muslim countries. No wonder they hate us. Unfortunately, weapons manufacturers need wars in order to sell their products. \Meanwhile, the U.S. has the highest poverty rate, the greatest inequality of incomes, the lowest social mobility, the highest expenditure of health care as a percentage of GDP, yet accompanied by the highest infant mortality rate, the highest prevalence of mental health problems, the highest obesity rate, the highest percentage of people going without health care due to cost, the highest consumption of antidepressants per capita and the shortest life expectancy at birth, the highest homicide rate, the largest prison population, the highest carbon dioxide emissions, the lowest spending on international development and humanitarian assistance as a percentage of GDP (except for Japan and Italy), the highest military expenditures both in total and as a percentage of GDP. This comes from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which compared with 20 of the world's democracies. \According to James Gustave Speth, ""These deplorable consequences are not the result of economic and technological forces over which we have no control. They are the results of political decisions made over several decades by both Democrats and Republicans who have had priorities other than strengthening the well-being of American society and our environment. Many countries, obviously, took another path - one that was open to us as well."" \In the U.S., the people are becoming ever more poor as increasing amounts of discretionary government funds go into destroying the villages and lives of persons in other countries because the defense companies need to sell ever more weapons to fatten their bottom lines and pay their CEOs ever larger bonuses so they can finance the re-election campaigns of their ever more obedient representatives in Congress. \Would that U.S. Rep. Joe Pitts and Sens. Pat Toomey and Bob Casey would rearrange their priorities and vote for programs that benefit the citizens of the U.S. rather than the fat cat corporations. What doth it profit a person if he/she has to sell his/her soul to the devil in order to be re-elected over and over again? \Daniel Riehl \Manheim Township \It's time to help hungry families \One in seven U.S. households faces hunger. Even when families can scrape together enough money, a balanced and healthy diet is often beyond their reach. \We need to create hunger-free communities and improve the nutrition, health, economic security and well-being of low-income residents. Ensuring that every eligible person benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (food stamps) is core to hunger solutions. \The Food Insecurity Nutrition Incentive Grant Program is a new competitive grant program within the Agriculture Act of 2014 (commonly known as the Farm Bill). Its goal is to increase the purchase and consumption of fruits and vegetables among SNAP participants. \This double-up-style program makes it easier for low-income households to purchase and eat fresh fruits and vegetables while supporting family farmers and growing local economies. \There are food banks throughout the county, yet no Gleaning Network has ever been established. Our neighbor to the north, Lebanon County, has had a Gleaning Network serving a number of their food banks for well over 15 years. \Gleaning, a biblical practice to combat hunger, is thousands of years old. Hunger is an age-old problem which has devastating effects on those who suffer from it. \It's time for the kind-hearted, caring, honest, good natured and faith-based citizens to start addressing hunger solutions for those less fortunate - children, senior citizens, people with disabilities and others truly in need of food. \John Mackley \Elizabethtown \Hold Harrisburg accountable \I am grateful that the cities are standing up to Harrisburg (""NRA sues city over gun law,"" Jan. 15). \I hope that not only will Lancaster, Pittsburgh and Philadelphia win the case, but that National Rifle Association and all plaintiffs will have to pay all costs and that all responsible for the state law prohibiting cities from regulating guns in any way can be held accountable for misuse of their public office to obstruct the law, and sued accordingly. \This mindset that common sense efforts to protect the public from criminal and mentally disabled minds is a violation of Second Amendment rights, has got to end. \Joel Moore \Narvon"
377,"
""The trouble with fighting for human freedom,"" wrote H.L. Mencken, ""is that one spends most of one's time defending scoundrels. For it is against scoundrels that oppressive laws are first aimed, and oppression must be stopped at the beginning if it is to be stopped at all.""
\
Try telling that to George W. Bush.
\
When Somalia, after 15 years of violent anarchy, finally found a government that would bring a modicum of security and liberty to its citizens, the president supported regime change because, well, he didn't like their style. The regime's name was the Islamic Courts Union, and as you can probably guess, Washington didn't expect them to join the War on Terror too readily.
\
The Bush administration turned to Ethiopia, which invaded, triggering a civil war that is now almost three years old. One-tenth of the population has been killed. In the United States, the equivalent body count would be about 30 million.
\
If the aim was to get the bad guys, they missed their target. The Islamic Courts Union may not have lived up to our ideal of the separation between church and state, but they made it very clear that their first priority would be bringing social justice and peace to the country -- something Somalis haven't seen in quite some time. Moreover, it was popularly supported and just might have been Somalis' one hope for freedom. Not to mention hundreds of thousands of Somali lives would have been spared.
\
If the goal was to make the United States safer, they failed even more miserably. Terrorist groups have actually increased. Whereas Somalia had little, if any, connection to al Qaeda before 2006, now the Shabab, an openly pro-al Qaeda jihadist group, is flourishing.
\
So, let's see, we broke international law, cost millions of people their freedom, precipitated the death of thousands of innocent lives, and made our own country less safe. Even if the Islamic Courts Union conformed to our wildest nightmare -- which would contradict all historical evidence about their intent -- they would be hard pressed to match that record.
\
It's nothing new.
\
Since the end of World War II, the United States has advocated regime change whenever we didn't like a foreign government. (OK, we've been doing it longer than that, but the Cold War was when we made it a regular part of our arsenal.)
\
Because such parts of our history have been covert or just unpleasant memories, we brush them aside as exaggerated yarns of international intrigue, maybe even political propaganda. And so, most Americans live comfortably unaware of Somalia-like military actions that have been proven by CIA documents and the like: Iran (twice), Guatemala (twice), Cuba, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Iraq (thrice), Chile, Afghanistan, Turkey, Nicaragua, Republic of Ghana, Venezuela, and the Palestinian Authority.
\
With the demise of the Soviet Union, one would think such operations would lose their allure. Sadly, it seems our government learned the wrong lesson when the Berlin Wall fell. Again, when it comes to American history, we have an uncanny ability to remember only what we want to.
\
The conventional wisdom goes like this: After 40 years of detente and containment, Ronald Reagan swashbuckled into the White House and the Soviet Union backed down. They knew he meant business. Reagan fought them on so many fronts that, when combined with his missile shield and increased military spending, they went bankrupt trying to compete.
\
But numbers don't lie, and they tell a different story altogether. The Soviet Union's defense spending did not change much throughout the 1980s. As a percentage of GNP, it stayed about the same. No, the Soviet Union collapsed for the same reason that economists said it would: Communism does not work.
\
After 9/11, Islamic terrorism became Enemy No. 1, and the old mentality -- show our strength, beat back every advance, ramp up military spending, and rub out every last anti-American regime -- took hold. Washington still hasn't learned that unfriendly governments are best beaten just as the Soviet Union was -- by internal instability, not military defeat.
\
Still, the myth persists.
\
New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman put it in different terms a few months ago when he said of Iran, ""When you have leverage, talk. When you don't have leverage, get some. Then talk."" If I tell you to do as I say or I'll invade your country, that's leverage -- but it's also illegal, immoral and counterproductive if my goal is to create a peaceful community. Leverage did not bring down the Soviet Union, but it did increase the body count, drain the treasury, and multiply our enemies just about every time the United States overthrew a country in the last 60 years.
\
The empiricist in me says things need to change.
\
We can start by abiding by international law, openly conversing with all nations, and ending military aid to countries that are, in many ways, worse than the countries we criticize. If you're worried that gas prices will increase when we stop propping up, say, Saudi Arabia, don't be. With the money we save by ending military aid, we can cut taxes at home. Not only is that an implicit carbon tax swap that helps the environment without costing economic growth, but it makes the world a safer place.
\
Iraq, Iran, Pakistan and North Korea may be the most talked-about foreign problems of the last eight years, but they are symptoms of a greater ailment that has gripped our country for more than 60 years. May the new Obama administration be the beginning of the end to the Somalia Syndrome.

378,"HARRISBURG - Gov. Tom Wolf's push for Pennsylvania to join a multi-state carbon emissions reduction program will face its first major test in one month when a proposed regulation comes before a key state environmental board for a vote.\But the desires of Wolf, a Democrat, to put the state in the the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative via executive order faces pushback from the Republican-controlled Legislature. The House passed a bill with its own approach, and veteran Republican lawmakers vow to hold more hearings.\In the so-called ""RGGI"" program, participating Northeast and mid-Atlantic states attempt to reduce their carbon emissions by setting a cap on those emissions and allowing companies to purchase or trade their emission allowances.\With the vote set for Sept. 15, the Department of Environmental Protection is focusing on outreach and conversations with the independent 20-member Environmental Quality Board.\""We are providing conversations about the modeling to make sure the members are comfortable with and understand what the proposal is and what we are trying to accomplish,"" said Hayley Book, a senior adviser for energy and climate at DEP.\Book said in a call with reporters last week that the department has been more engaged with the Office of Environmental Justice, which seeks to mitigate adverse environmental impacts on low-income and minority communities, and has begun printing its RGGI materials in Spanish.\DEP has also launched a dialogue with the Department of Community and Economic Development and the Department of Labor and Industry to address the needs of ""transitioning communities"" - like those in Indiana and Schuylkill counties that are still reliant on coal-fired power plants for jobs and a tax base.\Earlier this summer, two advisory committees opted not to endorse Wolf's RGGI proposal.\""We are being responsive to their concerns and we will continue to do so as we move forward,"" Book said.\Even with an affirmative vote in September, the earliest Pennsylvania could join RGGI is 2022. A public comment period would open in the fall with virtual public hearings. \The DEP projects RGGI would cut carbon emissions by 188 million tons by 2030, provide a net increase of 27,000 jobs and support a slew of health benefits for Pennsylvania residents. The initiative has cut carbon emissions 45% among participating states since 2005.\Book said whether Pennsylvania joins the pact or not, DEP models show coal will drop to just 1% of the state's energy production by 2030. There are currently five coal power plants operating in Pennsylvania and nine coal waste plants.\The program is intended to encourage cleaner energy production. If one facility pollutes, it will have to buy a certain amount of allowances corresponding to its emission levels, thus raising energy prices. But a facility that emits no pollution would not need to buy any allowances, thus selling its energy for less.\""(RGGI) prices carbon into the market,"" Book said. ""There is an environmental and health detriment to these emissions and through RGGI, by putting a price on carbon, you are acknowledging that there are costs to health and environment beyond the cost of actually generating the electricity itself.""\Wolf's use of the executive order to initiate the process to join RGGI prompted the House to pass House Bill 2025, which would require the governor to seek legislative approval before Pennsylvania could impose a carbon tax or enter into any multi-state program that would impose such a tax, like RGGI.\That bill passed 130-71 in early July with support from nearly all Republicans and more than 20 Democrats. That count was six votes short of a veto-proof majority.\The bill now awaits consideration in the Senate. Lyndsay Kensinger, a spokeswoman for Wolf, said the governor would veto the bill.\Rep. Daryl Metcalfe, R-Butler, and Sen. Gene Yaw, R-Lycoming, the chairs of the House and Senate Energy and Environmental Resources committees, have both already held hearings on RGGI and both say they intend to hold more.\""It may be that these [coal] facilities go the way of the dinosaur, but these facilities are in compliance with EPA and DEP standards,"" said David N. Taylor, the president of the Pennsylvania Manufacturers Association. ""Now the administration is trying to change the rules to destroy these facilities, destroy jobs, and put a great big crater in these rural communities, and that's something they should have to justify before the people's elected representatives.""\Taylor called the push for RGGI through executive action a ""power grab"" that interferes with the separation of powers.\And a recently signed petrochemical tax credit bill, which gives a boost to the state's significant natural gas industry, leaves questions about the state's broader environmental goals.\The bill, which was signed into law by Wolf, gives tax credits to facilities that turn dry natural gas into fertilizer, diesel exhaust fluid and other chemical products.\Perry Babb leads the development team at KeyState Natural Gas Synthesis, which will begin construction on a natural gas production facility in 2022 on 7,000 acres of land in Clinton County. Babb's project is one of the big winners under the law. \The KeyState facility will produce blue ammonia for agricultural, industrial and medical uses, and diesel exhaust fluid, which is EPA mandated for use in buses, trucks and boats to limit their pollution.\But Babb - who said he is ""100%"" in favor of renewable sources of energy - isn't sold on RGGI either, though he wants to find a middle ground.\""I think the governor is looking for solutions, and when you look for solutions, sometimes you look like a liberal and sometimes you look like a conservative,"" he said. ""To find a solution you have to... look at all the options. If parties involved can come together like they did with this tax credit bill, then there will be progress."" \Jordan Wolman is an intern with the Pennsylvania Legislative Correspondents' Association.\Caption: A plume of exhaust extends from the Mitchell Power Station, a coal-fired power plant built along the Monongahela River 20 miles southwest of Pittsburgh.

379,"
It is early evening on Capitol Hill, and I am sitting with Sen. Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican, who, along with Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., and Sen. Joe Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, is trying to craft a new energy bill -- one that could actually win 60 votes.
\
Graham has been willing -- courageously in my view -- to depart from the prevailing GOP consensus that the only energy policy we need is ""drill, baby, drill."" What brought you around, I ask?
\
Graham's short answer: politics, jobs and legacy.
\
The Republican Party today has a major outreach problem with two important constituencies, ""Hispanics and young people,"" Graham explains: ""I have been to enough college campuses to know if you are 30 or younger this climate issue is not a debate. It's a value. These young people grew up with recycling and a sensitivity to the environment -- and the world will be better off for it. They are not brainwashed. ... From a Republican point of view, we should buy into it and embrace it and not belittle them. You can have a genuine debate about the science of climate change, but when you say that those who believe it are buying a hoax and are wacky people you are putting at risk your party's future with younger people. You can have a legitimate dispute about how to solve immigration, but when you start focusing on the last names of people the demographics will pass you by.""
\
So Graham's approach has been simple: avoid talking about ""climate change."" Instead, frame our energy challenge as a need to ""clean up carbon pollution,"" to ""become energy independent"" and to ""create more good jobs and new industries for South Carolinians.""
\
He proposes ""putting a price on carbon,"" starting with a very focused carbon tax, as opposed to an economywide cap-and-trade system, so as to spur consumers and industries to invest in and buy clean energy products. He includes nuclear energy, and insists on permitting more offshore drilling to give us more domestic sources as we bridge to a new clean energy economy.
\
""Cap-and-trade as we know it is dead, but the issue of cleaning up the air and energy independence should not die -- and you will never have energy independence without pricing carbon,"" Graham argues. ""The technology doesn't make sense until you price carbon. Nuclear power is a bet on cleaner air. Wind and solar is a bet on cleaner air. You make those bets assuming that cleaning the air will become more profitable than leaving the air dirty, and the only way it will be so is if the government puts some sticks on the table -- not just carrots. The future economy of America and the jobs of the future are going to be tied to cleaning up the air, and in the process of cleaning up the air this country becomes energy independent and our national security is greatly enhanced.""
\
This isn't just for the next generation, says Graham: ""As you talk about the future, if you forget the people who live in the present, you will have no future politically. You have to get the people in the present to buy into the future. I tell my voters: 'If we try to clean up the air and become energy independent, we will create more jobs than anything I can do as a senator.' General Electric makes all the turbines for the GE windmills in Greenvillea.""
\
He also is pushing to make his state a manufacturing center for nuclear reactor components and biomass from plants and timber.
\
What would most help him bring around his GOP colleagues? The business lobby. ""The Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers need to tell my colleagues it is OK to price carbon, if you do it smartly,"" he says.
\
I don't agree with every point. But if there is going to be a clean energy bill, greens and Democrats will have to recruit some Republicans. Graham says he's ready to meet them in the middle. ""We've got to get started,"" he says, ""because once we do, every CEO will adopt a carbon strategy, no matter what the law actually requires.""
\
And for those Republicans who think this is only a loser, Graham says think again: ""What is our view of carbon as a party? Are we the party of carbon pollution forever in unlimited amounts? Pricing carbon is the key to energy independence, and the byproduct is that young people look at you differently.""
\
Look at how he is received in colleges today.
\
""Instead of being just one more short, white Republican over 50,"" says Graham, ""I am now semicool. There is an awareness by young people that I am doing something different.""
\
Five more GOP senators like him and we could have a real energy bill.
\
""We can't be a nation that always tries and fails,"" Graham concludes. ""We have to eventually get some hard problem right.""

380,"In Soldiers&Sailors Memorial Hall&Museum, where many of the region's war veterans are commemorated, people gathered Wednesday to kick-start a battle they believe must be won quickly to mitigate the impact of climate change.\""Climate change is a global threat that will change our lives dramatically, but we can take smart, proactive steps to combat it,"" said U.S. Rep. Mike Doyle, D-Forest Hills, who hosted the town hall-style meeting. ""But we must take those steps rapidly to avoid the most dire consequences of climate change.""\Although many in the audience of about 400 appeared to be members of a knowledgeable climate change choir, the meeting was one of the first opportunities for residents of the region to learn more about the issue and potential pathways to address it.\""It's an important issue and I hope to gain a better understanding of the nuts and bolts of how climate policy will be developed in the U.S.,"" said Mike Roth, a doctoral student in the engineering and public policy program at Carnegie Mellon University, before the meeting started.\""It doesn't seem the current administration is very receptive to cap and trade or a carbon tax - two of the main proposals that have been hopping around. But delay will be costly, and the sooner we act the less costly it will be to address the issue.""\That sense of urgency was a common theme. Mr. Doyle said the U.S. must achieve zero net carbon emissions by 2050 and become ""carbon negative"" after that.\Patricia DeMarco, an author, biologist and member of Forest Hills council, said the globe is on track for 2019 to be the warmest year ever recorded, and climate change is already affecting human health, infrastructure, emergency services and the natural environment. She said it's costing the nation billions of dollars a year.\""It's real, it's happening now all over the world and in Western Pennsylvania, too,"" she said. ""The latest report by U.S. agencies says we need to reduce carbon emissions by 40% by 2030. We don't have time to dilly-dally. We need to reframe the climate change debate, to acknowledge the cost of not acting on climate change is huge.""\There is scientific certainty that the global climate is warming at an unprecedented rate and that the primary cause is human activity, including the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil, that increases the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping greenhouse gases.\On a warmer planet, growing seasons will be longer in some areas, increasing crops. But most effects will impact human populations negatively.\As temperatures continue to rise, scientists say there will be more droughts and heat waves, more severe storms and stronger hurricanes. Sea levels will rise by 1 to 4 feet by 2100, the Arctic is likely to become ice free in summer and glaciers will melt.\Two panels of experts addressed climate change topics, including how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; the workforce needs of a renewable energy economy; the development of technology to mitigate climate change impacts; and government actions at the federal, state and local levels.\Jay Whitacre, director of CMU's Wilton E. Scott Institute for Energy Innovation, said hundreds of researchers at CMU and the University of Pittsburgh are working on climate change, but more financial support is needed to get emerging research into the hands of big corporations with the means to implement the new technology.\Ron Gdovic, chief executive officer of WindStax Energy, a 2012 startup that manufactures hybrid wind and solar systems in Pittsburgh, said ""new technologies can drive a new economy"" in the region.\Ashleigh Deemer, of PennEnvironment, a statewide environmental advocacy organization, said it has been conducting a lobbying effort to educate state legislators about the perils of climate change and the need for quick action to fill the federal void, but she said it's still ""a heavy lift.""\Another recurring topic was economic justice for displaced workers. Jami Bey, a panel moderator and chief executive officer of UrbanKind, said, ""People have to see themselves as successful in the new economy.""\In a news release prior to the meeting, a coalition of 11 local organizations announced their support of the meeting, which they hoped would be the first of many to draw attention to and help speed action on the issue.\""[The meeting] comes at an opportune time, as there is a push from the American people to greater prioritize climate change during the presidential debates, and every day more studies emerge about how little time we have to act as climate change affects our food, air, water, health and supersizes weather events in more dire ways than previously thought,"" the coalition stated\The coalition also encouraged other members of the Pennsylvania congressional delegation to follow Mr. Doyle's example by holding town halls of their own on climate change.\""While we believe it's important to broaden the understanding about the severity and widespread impact of climate change, it's equally important for our elected officials at all levels of government to transition this knowledge into finally doing something,"" the coalition stated. ""We will look for further opportunities to hold our decision makers accountable and push them to enact meaningful policies.""\Mr. Doyle said he's optimistic about enacting a robust climate change policy, but admitted it will require ""changing a lot of faces in the Senate and, most importantly, in the White House.""\Art Fleming, a retired ophthalmologist, and his wife, Sharyn, who have 24 grandchildren, left the meeting feeling optimistic.\""It was great to hear people talking about all this stuff and the concerns about climate change,"" Mr. Fleming said. ""People are involved. I'm hopeful. They're working on a lot of stuff. I think it will happen eventually. It has to.""\Don Hopey: dhopey@post-gazette.com or 412-263-1983.

381,"
If you want to see the most schizophrenic, mistreated and vital issue on the table during this election, check out our energy policy.
\
Most people, including the candidates, think our oil troubles began with gas lines in the 1970s. There is a price to pay for how much history we forget these days.
\
The real story dates back to 1945 when President Franklin D. Roosevelt made a deal with the devil, so to speak. He guaranteed American protection of the Saudi Arabian royal family in return for access to their oil wells. Fifty-six years later, Osama bin Laden listed American military presence in Saudi Arabia as one of the top reasons for hijacking four airplanes on Sept. 11, 2001.
\
The story picks up again in 1971 when President Richard Nixon instated wage and price controls, which did nothing but stall the economy for three years. Today, economists are having flashbacks to those days of stagflation, with the average consumer shelling out an extra $1,500 for gas this year.
\
The price controls finally ended in 1981 when President Jimmy Carter bargained with Congress to institute a windfall profits tax in their place. Today, Barack Obama wants to institute just such a tax, but he never mentions that Carter tried it -- because it only made us more dependent on foreign oil. Surprise, surprise.
\
Carter didn't stop there with his mindless energy policies. In 1980, he told the world that Persian Gulf oil was a ""vital interest"" to the United States and that we would protect that interest ""by any means necessary, including military force."" Today, we spend over $138 billion each year for this protection. Good thing we don't have a $400 billion budget deficit or anything else that needs money, like infrastructure or health care.
\
The conclusion is obvious: Independence from foreign oil should be our number one economic and national security priority.
\
This is the issue of the future, folks. Unfortunately, our presidential candidates seem more interested in continuing our nightmarish past.
\
Obama's plan is just pointless. Karl Rove's criticism is on the money: ""Why should we stop with oil companies? They make about 8.3 cents in gross profit per dollar of sales. Why doesn't Mr. Obama slap a windfall profits tax on sectors of the economy that have fatter margins? Electronics make 14.5 cents per dollar and computer equipment makers take in 13.7 cents per dollar, according to the Census Bureau. Microsoft's margin is 27.5 cents per dollar of sales. ...
\
""It's not the profit margin, but the total number of dollars earned that is the problem, Mr. Obama might say. But if that were the case, why isn't he targeting other industries? Oil and gas companies made $86.5 billion in profits last year. At the same time, the financial services industry took in $498.5 billion in profits, the retail industry walked away with $137.5 billion, and information technology companies made off with $103.4 billion.""
\
Indeed, his outrage would be more justifiable if it weren't so hypocritical, a dangerous precedent and a proven waste of time.
\
And it doesn't stop there. Next, he wants to pour more taxpayer money into corn ethanol. Let's review that idea, shall we? Corn ethanol is too expensive, worse for the environment than almost any other alternative fuel, and hikes food prices with its government subsidies. But Senator Obama, the man who will ""change"" Washington, gets a lot of his support from the ethanol industry, so he thinks it's swell.
\
John McCain is no better. Once upon a time, this column showed how his gas tax holiday was an egregiously bad idea and a craven political pander.
\
Uh oh, he's at it again. This time the senator from Arizona thinks drilling offshore is worth the gamble. He is counting on you to be so distracted with gas prices that you don't notice that this idea won't do squat.
\
It will reduce gas prices by 1 cent 10 years from now. Not to mention coastline states receive billions of dollars in tourism from their untarnished beaches and vistas, or the little fact that oil companies don't even use all the land they have access to in the United States now.
\
Sorry, Senator, but that's two strikes for you.
\
Thankfully, the pork-busting, corruption-ridding maverick is opposed to all subsidies, including ethanol. Take that, Barack Obama. Hang on, it seems he is willing to make an exception for nuclear power. That's right, all subsidies must go, except for the nuclear industry because they pay his campaign bills. Well, isn't that convenient?
\
Yes, the United States has a long, storied history of energy mistakes, and it looks like the candidates are taking up that mantle just fine. Fortunately, there is hope: Both candidates want to create a cap-and-trade program to wean us off foreign oil. The difference is McCain's plan uses the failed European model that imposes a massive government bureaucracy to allocate emission permits based on which lobbyist pays the most -- instead of a simple auction or a carbon tax.
\
Now why doesn't that surprise me?

382,"WASHINGTON --While introducing her climate change bill Wednesday, Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., told a cheering crowd in front of the U.S. Capitol, ""We have expanded our coalition in the business community.""\In Pennsylvania, that coalition includes businesses that stand to benefit, such as energy-efficient windows manufacturer Serious Materials and wind turbine maker Gamesa.\But heavy industry concerns in Western Pennsylvania, including U.S. Steel, Alcoa and Consol Energy, expressed varying degrees of dismay and fear last week at what the Clean Energy Jobs and American Power Act could mean for their businesses -- and for energy consumers.\The bill, similar to House of Representatives legislation that narrowly passed in June, sets aggressive deadlines for greenhouse gas reductions and creates a cap-and-trade system in which a price is set to emit carbon above a certain level and the right to do so is traded in a newly created market for big polluters.\The result, according to foes of the bill, will be higher energy prices and job losses when utilities scale back because of increased costs.\""You run the risk of having a lot of major coal-fired power plants shut down,"" said Tom Hoffman, spokesman for Cecil-based coal producer Consol Energy.\But in the long run, argue environmentalists and officials with ""green jobs"" companies, energy costs will come down and jobs will be created in areas of renewable energy and efficiency that cannot be outsourced. In addition, the act could create momentum for a global consensus to reduce emissions and, perhaps, stave off global warming. And by spending less on foreign oil, they contend, the United States will reduce funding to potential enemies.\""This bill is the first of many steps toward a cleaner, healthier, safer world,"" said Adam Garber, an organizer for PennEnvironment.\A crucial detail to be filled in as the bill proceeds through Environment and Public Works, Finance and other committees, is how carbon offsets -- or emissions-reduction credits -- will be doled out in the cap-and-trade market.\Aluminum maker Alcoa also would like to see more guidance on how carbon payments would be phased in, and more concessions for companies that compete internationally.\Alcoa is a member of the United States Climate Action Partnership, a group of 30 companies and environmental organizations that lobbies for greenhouse-gas reductions coupled with protections for the economy. The group includes the National Resources Defense Council, as well as Ford Motor Co. and DuPont.\Lee Califf, a Washington-based lobbyist for Alcoa, said USCAP's lobbying efforts will focus on getting language in the bill to address ""carbon leakage"" -- in which emissions reductions in one nation result in increases elsewhere because production is moved. Mr. Califf said the House bill, through issuing free carbon rebates for certain industries, does this well. \Kate Jackson, senior vice president and chief technology officer of nuclear producer Westinghouse Electric, in an e-mailed statement, did not endorse or reject the Senate climate bill -- which promotes nuclear power in an apparent attempt to woo Republicans. In pitching support for the industry, Dr. Jackson noted that nuclear power provides 75 percent of the country's carbon-free energy.\Dr. Jackson wrote that legislation should address the need for more nuclear plants, as well as increases in power output and life span of existing plants, which are heavily regulated now. The Kerry-Boxer bill pledges a reduction in regulatory barriers to expansion of the nuclear industry.\Requests for comment from U.S. Steel were referred to the American Iron and Steel Institute, a trade association. In a news release Wednesday, it called the bill a disappointment.\""If we don't get climate legislation right, we'll harm the U.S. economy, outsource our manufacturing to China and see global emissions increase -- the exact opposite of the goals of climate policy,"" AISI president Thomas J. Gibson said in a release.\Consol jump-started its lobbying efforts last year and is continuing on a similar pace this year, having spent nearly $2 million through June to lobby on climate change, the stimulus package and the union card-check bill.\Mr. Hoffman said Consol is not against reducing emissions, but the company believes the aggressive emissions requirements -- a 20 percent reduction by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050 -- would sink the coal industry.\Consol has invested considerable funds to research technology that would capture carbon emissions from smokestacks and store them underground, but large-scale implementation of that technology is years away. \In March, Serious Materials reopened a shuttered plant in Vandergrift to make high-tech, energy-efficient windows. The company could expand considerably with passage of this legislation, which mandates stronger energy efficiency standards.\Vice President for Projects and Policy Robin Roy said the legislation would spur Serious Materials to ""promote investment and keep hiring. It gives confidence that there is a will to address this issue.""\Mr. Roy said the company would like to see stronger efficiency standards and incentives in the bill. This year, in its first foray into federal lobbying, California-based Serious Materials has spent $20,000.\Wind turbine manufacturer Gamesa, which employs 800 workers at plants in Ebensburg, Cambria County, and Fairless Hills, Bucks County, also would benefit from increased investment in energy sources that won't carry a carbon tax.\""The market depends on regulatory certainty,"" said Michael Peck, director of external relations. ""When investors see that usage for renewable energy is guaranteed and a defined price of carbon, [they start] putting their money on the table.""\The environmental lobby is increasingly turning to an economic argument to sway legislators. Repower Pennsylvania, a grassroots lobbying subsidiary of the Alliance for Climate Protection, pointed to a study released last month by the Center for American Progress showing that Pennsylvania would gain 72,000 green jobs within two years if the federal government invested $150 billion in efficiency and renewable energy. The pending legislation includes some of those ideas.\But economic benefits could be outweighed by the decline of fossil fuels.\The National Association of Manufacturers and the American Council for Capital Formation commissioned a study of the House bill that foretold losses of 71,500 to 97,500 jobs in Pennsylvania by 2030 as heavy industry struggles with higher costs and sends jobs to overseas markets where there are no pollution caps.\If a measure similar to the Boxer-Kerry bill becomes law, it will constitute a revolution in how Americans produce and use energy. But that's a big if, especially with a simultaneous battle on health care reform going on in both chambers and lobbyists and interest groups swarming lawmakers."

City DPW delays

My recyclables were put out March 4 for pickup the following day. As of Wednesday- a week later - they were still out there. I was supposed to put out paper to recycle on Thursday. There is going to be a mess all over the city's streets.
\
There is no business in the country that can operate with more than 30 percent of its employees getting paid every week for not working.

If the city would subcontract some of this service to a private company, it should solicit bids from qualified providers at a public meeting. That way, the public would know if taxpayers are getting a better deal.

Composting solution
\
Editor: The proposed Keystone Sanitary Landfill expansion has pitted an area family, known for its community generosity and support, against a group of citizens concerned about the landfill's impact on the environment.
\
No one, including the Department of Environmental Protection, has proposed any type of solution to appease both sides. Many states have stopped just dumping garbage and piling it up in favor of the more modern, environmentally sound practice of composting.
\
The refuse is dumped into large grinders, which reduce its size by almost seven-eighths. It is then mixed with engineered soil - at least half organic matter loaded with natural fungi and bacteria - that accelerates the decomposition process. This leaves plenty of room for more trash, which should offset the additional cost of the composting machines and special soil. The material is disposed of in the best way for neighboring towns and communities and has minimal environmental impact.
\
Perhaps if this option is explored, both sides could be satisfied and as Ben Franklin once said, ""Now we can have our cake and eat it, too.""

Cheese, meet Kung
\
Editor: It's March and though solutions never seem to be found, political petitions have popped up everywhere like potholes.
\
Lackawanna County Commissioner Pat ""Cheese"" O'Malley has done the unthinkable and switched parties - for the second time. Has there ever in the history of Lackawanna County been a more blatant opportunist than Cheese, especially when you take into account that his major - if not only - goal is to retire as a county commissioner with a comfy pension?
\
Then, we have the Kung Fu Panderer, sometimes referred to as Bat-Mayor Bill Courtright. His solution to Scranton's financial crisis has been to throw money at the very people whose actions put the city in its dire predicament. His other idea seems to be to sell everything owned by the city and turn that cash over to the unions. I think that is a great idea, especially if City Hall is sold first. Then, Kung could move all of the city's government operations into the half-empty Mall at Steamtown.
\
There is ample parking at the mall and the city kangaroo council can meet on the raised stage in the middle of the mall. It is a perfect solution.
\
One more suggestion: Because of the lack of a viable Republican Party in Lackawanna County, the Democratic Party should come up with a slogan, ""Hold your nose and vote Democratic."" Party leaders better act fast and adopt it, though, before Hillary Clinton does.

384,"Higher gas taxes, stricter emissions standards and raising the legal driving age are just a few of the proposals that could come up today and Friday at Northampton Community College, where a panel of government, business and civic leaders will discuss ways to reduce regional air pollution.\Known as the Lehigh Valley/Reading Ozone Stakeholder Working Group, the panel includes 35 members from environmentalists to gasoline company executives. Their mission is to develop a strategy for reducing ground-level ozone in Lehigh, Northampton and Berks counties and submit formal recommendations to the state Department of Environmental Protection.\The group will hold public meetings from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. today and Friday at the Electrotechnology Applications Center, 3835 Green Pond Road, Bethlehem Township. The group will hold additional meetings at the center Sept. 13 and 14 and Oct. 20 and 21.\The group will also meet Aug. 18 and 19 at PP&L headquarters, 2 N. 9th St., Allentown, and on July 22 and 23 and Nov. 17 and 18 at the Inn at Reading, 1040 Park Road, Wyomissing.\Formed by the DEP in March, the group is expected to submit its final report in December.\""Once the report has been put out, we go forward with those recommendations,"" said DEP spokeswoman Christy Hubley, who said it could take up to a year to implement them.\That means the group's upcoming meetings will have a profound impact on air quality regulations that will impact everything from the daily commute to how much area residents pay for electricity.\But members say they are still in the initial stages of their work and are months away from forming a consensus.\""We haven't really talked specifics about what we're going to do,"" said Harvey Joseph, environmental director of the Bethlehem Health Bureau.\""Everybody has different ideas. We have some people who don't want to do anything, and we have some people who want everybody to walk. You've got to have a happy medium.""\So far, all members seem to agree on is the need to reduce regional ozone levels, which do not meet the federal standard of 85 parts per billion over an eight-hour period.\""I do feel strongly that we should limit the ozone,"" Joseph said. ""Everybody knows something has to be done.""\According to DEP statistics, Lehigh County ozone levels averaged 96 parts billion from 1996-1998. Berks County averaged 92 parts per billion and Northampton County averaged 88 parts per billion over the same three-year period. Three-year averages are used when determining federal compliance.\Formed by the combination of heat and emissions from industry, automobiles and other sources, ground-level ozone at high levels can cause chest pain, coughing, nausea, sore throat and congestion.\Children, the elderly and those with respiratory problems are especially vulnerable to ozone's effect.\The ozone season generally runs from May through September, when solar radiation and temperatures are highest.\""Ozone is formed with hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxide and sunlight,"" said Tom DiLazaro, the DEP's Northeast Region air quality manager. ""If you don't have one of them, you're not going to have ozone.""\Two of the biggest contributors to ground-level ozone are automobiles and electric generating plants, but representatives from both groups on the stakeholder group say their industries have been leaders in emissions reduction.\Reid Clemmer, environmental supervisor at PP&L Inc., acknowledged that his company is one of the region's biggest producers of nitrogen oxide emissions, producing as much as 20,000 tons of it during the ozone season.\But, Clemmer said, PP&L has spent more than $110 million on environmental improvements since 1990 and has reduced its emissions about 50 percent during that time.\""We have made significant reductions already,"" Clemmer said, and ""there is the expectation that by the year 2003, we will be required to make further reductions.""\Clemmer said he would like to see the automobile emissions testing program strengthened and expanded to cut down on ozone levels.\Joseph said he is an advocate of reformulated gasoline, which costs 5 cents to 6 cents a gallon more than regular gas, but reduces ozone production.\Reformulated gasoline is already used in the greater Phiadelphia area, including Bucks and Montgomery counties.\But a fellow group member, Theresa Podguski of AAA East Penn, disagrees.\Podguski said the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reported that automobiles are 97 percent cleaner than they were in the 1970s, and less than 30 percent of all air pollution comes from automobiles.\""Automobile emission reductions have outpaced reductions from all other sources,"" Podguski said. ""In fact, control of emissions from cars is the single greatest contribution to the reduction of volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides in the last 25 years.\""Despite this progress, emission reduction efforts continue to focus on reducing automobile pollution rather than on reducing emissions from such other sources as utilities and industrial power plants.""\Still another member, Tom Lloyd, a research scientist at Lehigh University, favors increasing the gas tax and raising the legal driving age to 18 to reduce the number of vehicle miles driven annually and make people more aware of the environmental consequences of their actions.\""We just have to go after greater efficiency, so what this means, I think, is a carbon tax on any kind of fossil fuel,"" Lloyd said. ""You tax any kind of fossil fuel so people will be more conservative of it.\""If we're going to pollute the environment, we ought to pay for it.""\In addition to automobile and industrial emissions, group members say they also have to look at regulating other emission sources such as gas-powered lawn equipment, auto refinishing shops, dry cleaners, landfill gases, composting operations and other polluters.\No matter what action the group decides to take, Clemmer said it has to be done in the most cost-effective way possible.\""Because ultimately,"" Clemmer said, ""the consumers are going to pay for it."""
385,"Oil prices flirting with $100 a barrel, warnings of climate change and holiday road trips fueled by gas topping $3 a gallon are combining to give energy issues unprecedented prominence in the presidential campaign.\""The bottom line for us, we're happy everybody is talking about it,"" said David Willett, national press secretary for the Sierra Club. ""Even in '04, while there was a clear difference between the candidates, it wasn't really a campaign issue.""\The Republicans, with notable exceptions, have concentrated on the dangers to the nation's strategic and economic security of relying on energy from the Middle East.\The Democrats, while embracing those same arguments, have placed much greater emphasis on the threat of global warming.\""The positions the leading Democratic candidates have advanced are, for the most part, very thoughtful, very much at the strong end of realistic,"" said Manik Roy, director of congressional affairs for the Pew Center on Global Climate change. ""I'm not seeing as much from the Republican candidates.""\A New York Times survey of likely caucus and primary voters in Iowa and New Hampshire, for example, found that Democrats were significantly more likely to cite the environment as a primary issue in choosing a candidate. Mr. Roy emphasized, however, that Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona stood out from the GOP field in his emphasis on global warming.\Mr. Roy pointed to the senator's work with Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., in pushing, unsuccessfully so far, for legislation that would cap the overall levels of greenhouse gas emissions in tandem with a system in which emitters could buy and sell permits authorizing the release of different levels of the targeted pollutants.\""He completely changed the dialogue in the Senate, and, to a certain, extent, in the House,"" Mr. Roy said.\Variations of the cap-and trade proposal are also central to the energy plans offered by the leading Democratic candidates. They also tend to favor greater or complete reliance on an auction system for distributing the emission permits, as opposed to one in which certain industries, such as existing coal-fired plants, are granted some level of emission allowance by the government.\Sens. Hillary Rodham Clinton, D-N.Y. and Barack Obama, D-Ill. and former Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina would use part of the proceeds of the cap-and-trade auction to fund research on advances in renewable energy, clean-coal technology and similar efforts. The leading Democrats also propose to fund energy research by curtailing a variety of tax breaks for major oil companies.\Sen. Christopher J. Dodd, D-Conn., stands out among the candidates for his call for a broader carbon tax on corporations of all kinds. Despite their generalized calls for conservation, none of the candidates has supported significantly higher fuel taxes, along the European model, to hold down consumption.\Alternative energy\The politics of climate change have produced what once would have been considered strange bedfellows. With the exception of U.S. Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, who calls for a gradual phase-out of both nuclear and coal-fired plants, all of the candidates at least acknowledge the need for nuclear power as part of the nation's energy future, a position that once would have been anathema to Democratic primary voters.\""When you look at their comments in general, particularly the leaders, they realize that nuclear has to play a significant role,"" said Mitch Singer, a spokesman for the Nuclear Power Institute, an industry lobbying group. ""These are not dumb people. They are aware of the fact that the demand for energy is expected to grow by 40 percent by 2030.""\The Democrats' difficulty with the implications of nuclear power generation were evident, however, at their debate in mid-month in Las Vegas. The candidates were united in their opposition to the opening of a federal facility for storing spent nuclear fuel at Nevada's Yucca Mountain, undeterred by the fact that several of them had supported the facility in the past. And despite their opposition to that site and their grudging support for expansion of the plants that produce the highly toxic waste, no Democrat has offered an alternative for the spent fuel storage.\Auto standards\For Detroit, the Democratic proposals include both carrots and sticks. There is general agreement on the need for mandating increases in fuel economy standards for automobiles. Mrs. Clinton, for example, has called for an increase to an average of 55 miles per gallon by 2030; Mr. Edwards, 40 miles-per-gallon by 2016.\But, along with other Democrats including Mr. Obama, they have also proposed multi-billion dollar aid packages for the auto industry to help it research new technologies and retool factories to produce cleaner cars. The auto industry is also one of the prime beneficiaries of a fund Mrs. Clinton has proposed separately to help pay for the ""legacy costs"" of retiree health care benefits.\As they troll for votes in Iowa, the candidates form a united chorus of support for the use of ethanol.\Most of the candidates of both parties have also called for spending on research for clean-coal technology, including the capture and sequestration of carbon dioxide emissions. Mr. Edwards, for example, while the recipient of an enthusiastic endorsement of the United Mineworkers of America, has taken a hard line on new coal plants that do not capture greenhouse gases.\A UMW spokesman said the union's decision to back the ex-senator came in part because he has put forth what is, in the union's view, the most specific plans for research on coal's future.\Touting their foreign policy credentials, Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico and Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., are among the Democrats calling for a renewed and more vigorous American role in international agreements to curb the release of greenhouse gases.\GOP cool on warming\Global warming in particular and energy in general have played a relatively less prominent role in the GOP nomination battle, a tendency reflected in the candidates' Web sites. While most of the Democratic candidates offer fairly detailed energy plans, the Republicans' debate, and their Web sites, have more abbreviated, broad-brush proposals.\In his standard stump speech, however, Mr. McCain regularly cites the ""devastating"" consequences of global warming and faults the Bush administration for being slow to respond to the issue. Some other Republican candidates, most notably former Sen. Fred D. Thompson of Tennessee, and U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, have been skeptical about the science behind assertions of global warming.\Others, such as former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts and former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, are agnostic on the scientific debate, but support energy conservation and research for security reasons.\Mr. Huckabee pledges that his administration would achieve energy independence by the end of his second term. Mr. Romney offers a general everything-should-be-on-the table approach, endorsing research on a broad array of renewable energy, nuclear and fossil fuel sources. Former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York has similarly called for an ""Apollo project"" to diversify the nation's energy sources, including nuclear, renewable sources and clean coal technologies.\In keeping with his libertarian philosophy, Mr. Paul opposes any significant energy role for the government, arguing that free markets will find a better path to the nation's energy future."
386,"In Soldiers&Sailors Memorial Hall&Museum, where many of the region's war veterans are commemorated, people gathered Wednesday to kick-start a battle they believe must be won quickly to mitigate the impact of climate change.\""Climate change is a global threat that will change our lives dramatically, but we can take smart, proactive steps to combat it,"" said U.S. Rep. Mike Doyle, D-Forest Hills, who hosted the town hall-style meeting. ""But we must take those steps rapidly to avoid the most dire consequences of climate change.""\Although many in the audience of about 400 appeared to be members of a knowledgeable climate change choir, the meeting was one of the first opportunities for residents of the region to learn more about the issue and potential pathways to address it.\""It's an important issue and I hope to gain a better understanding of the nuts and bolts of how climate policy will be developed in the U.S.,"" said Mike Roth, a doctoral student in the engineering and public policy program at Carnegie Mellon University, before the meeting started.\""It doesn't seem the current administration is very receptive to cap and trade or a carbon tax - two of the main proposals that have been hopping around. But delay will be costly, and the sooner we act the less costly it will be to address the issue.""\That sense of urgency was a common theme. Mr. Doyle said the U.S. must achieve zero net carbon emissions by 2050 and become ""carbon negative"" after that.\Patricia DeMarco, an author, biologist and member of Forest Hills council, said the globe is on track for 2019 to be the warmest year ever recorded, and climate change is already affecting human health, infrastructure, emergency services and the natural environment. She said it's costing the nation billions of dollars a year.\""It's real, it's happening now all over the world and in Western Pennsylvania, too,"" she said. ""The latest report by U.S. agencies says we need to reduce carbon emissions by 40% by 2030. We don't have time to dilly-dally. We need to reframe the climate change debate, to acknowledge the cost of not acting on climate change is huge.""\There is scientific certainty that the global climate is warming at an unprecedented rate and that the primary cause is human activity, including the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil, that increases the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping greenhouse gases.\On a warmer planet, growing seasons will be longer in some areas, increasing crops. But most effects will impact human populations negatively.\As temperatures continue to rise, scientists say there will be more droughts and heat waves, more severe storms and stronger hurricanes. Sea levels will rise by 1 to 4 feet by 2100, the Arctic is likely to become ice free in summer and glaciers will melt.\Two panels of experts addressed climate change topics, including how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; the workforce needs of a renewable energy economy; the development of technology to mitigate climate change impacts; and government actions at the federal, state and local levels.\Jay Whitacre, director of CMU's Wilton E. Scott Institute for Energy Innovation, said hundreds of researchers at CMU and the University of Pittsburgh are working on climate change, but more financial support is needed to get emerging research into the hands of big corporations with the means to implement the new technology.\Ron Gdovic, chief executive officer of WindStax Energy, a 2012 startup that manufactures hybrid wind and solar systems in Pittsburgh, said ""new technologies can drive a new economy"" in the region.\Ashleigh Deemer, of PennEnvironment, a statewide environmental advocacy organization, said it has been conducting a lobbying effort to educate state legislators about the perils of climate change and the need for quick action to fill the federal void, but she said it's still ""a heavy lift.""\Another recurring topic was economic justice for displaced workers. Jami Bey, a panel moderator and chief executive officer of UrbanKind, said, ""People have to see themselves as successful in the new economy.""\In a news release prior to the meeting, a coalition of 11 local organizations announced their support of the meeting, which they hoped would be the first of many to draw attention to and help speed action on the issue.\""[The meeting] comes at an opportune time, as there is a push from the American people to greater prioritize climate change during the presidential debates, and every day more studies emerge about how little time we have to act as climate change affects our food, air, water, health and supersizes weather events in more dire ways than previously thought,"" the coalition stated\The coalition also encouraged other members of the Pennsylvania congressional delegation to follow Mr. Doyle's example by holding town halls of their own on climate change.\""While we believe it's important to broaden the understanding about the severity and widespread impact of climate change, it's equally important for our elected officials at all levels of government to transition this knowledge into finally doing something,"" the coalition stated. ""We will look for further opportunities to hold our decision makers accountable and push them to enact meaningful policies.""\Mr. Doyle said he's optimistic about enacting a robust climate change policy, but admitted it will require ""changing a lot of faces in the Senate and, most importantly, in the White House.""\Art Fleming, a retired ophthalmologist, and his wife, Sharyn, who have 24 grandchildren, left the meeting feeling optimistic.\""It was great to hear people talking about all this stuff and the concerns about climate change,"" Mr. Fleming said. ""People are involved. I'm hopeful. They're working on a lot of stuff. I think it will happen eventually. It has to.""\Don Hopey: dhopey@post-gazette.com or 412-263-1983.

Coach Bucciarelli demonstrated a concern for Selena and his entire team. He carefully and thoroughly planned this game with coach Roy Gibbs of Honesdale. Coach Gibbs also should be commended for his support.

We need to spend many billions of dollars to build, rebuild, upgrade, manufacture and refurbish our trains and tracks. We need to do this to be prepared to fight the energy crisis, the pollution crisis and the likely economic crisis caused by this.

We are being told that the ridiculous rate increases have been due to providing better service to the consumer. My service has actually degraded rather than improved.

They have had no problem with their computer systems when I pay my monthly bill, but when I try to speak to anyone about rate increases and package options, they suddenly have no access to my records. I have called Comcast customer service every day for a week. Each time I have been informed that a supervisor will need to return my call. I am still waiting for that call. I intend now to contact the Comcast executive board of directors so easily found on their Web site.

It has been suggested that the community contact the FCC and register a complaint. That is a wonderful place to start.

Editor: The elected government of Iraq has and will continue to fail, and rather than improve, it will only worsen.
\
First: Each Iraqi must declare they are first and foremost Iraqis, then recognize the rest of the rights they declare as individual rights is secondary.
\
Second: If the first step is not and cannot be implemented, then the situation must be declared and recognized as an irrevocable standoff. If the Iraqi people cannot unite in peace versus anarchy, then it would appear some sort of separation is necessary.
\
You cannot unite a people who do not desire unity. Differences in ideology is a specific situation that might be difficult; but, if the fundamental conflict arises out of and from religion, then one is dealing with an impossible situation.
\
In Iraq, there is no thread of unity, and, possibly never was. Saddam had some of the same situations. Here you have a people under the title of Iraqi, but at this point are of an irreconcilable mind. Individual sect power appears to be desired first. Fanaticism in anything causes blind, dead-end reasoning, and if magnified to an extreme, can only lead to chaos and even breakdown. Direction void of sound reasoning and respect for life, basic principles of liberty and the pursuit of happiness is already a failed cause.
\
Third: Good leadership is the only solution. Can the Iraqi people unite the present Iraqi government? If so, and this is truly the best possible solution, the elected government must come up with a plan it can implement. Iraqis are dying needlessly and the situation only escalates. It can only stop if the present Iraqi government takes physical control.
\
The Iraqi government must take physical control of Baghdad. Declare martial law, if need be. Make a declaration of unity, strength and protection of all Iraqis; a ceasing of all violence. The Iraqis need protection from themselves. Baghdad should be divided into controllable precincts, each with a headquarters under one central headquarters. Physically scan the whole city, confiscate all materials of combative nature, allow no one and nothing in or out. See to people's needs and work from there. There is no other solution to the standoff, which will continue until there is no one left to govern.
\
The only other direction is separation.
\
Americans are paying a price for an irresponsible and inconceivable situation.
\
We can't stay in this situation. We can't get out of this situation. Control must be taken. Proper courage must be used. Not one more life must be lost; not one more life must be maimed.

Self-disfranchised
\
Editor: For the first time in 41 years, I will not vote in a primary election. It is not because I am disinterested, apathetic or ill. Rather, it is due to both major political parties decreeing that I shall have no voice.
\
For a host of good reasons, I could no longer stomach being registered as a Republican, so I left the GOP this spring in favor of no affiliation, a sort of conscientious objector status.
\
This means that I have disenfranchised myself, unwelcome to have a say in who is on the ballot for the November election since every race is a partisan effort. Some candidates, though, are able to cross-register and appear on both ballots.
\
The failure to allow open primary elections - as well as the added burdens that are placed on the non-Republicans and non-Democrats who try to qualify to appear on the election ballot - sends the message to independent voters that the deck is stacked against us, that we are persona non grata.

It will be odd to stay home on primary day and have no say in who reaches the fall election, but that is the way it must be under the circumstances in order to be true to myself.

Peeved by potholes
\
Editor: I recently went to my car dealer to get two tires. Let's see now, that's four tires, three damaged wheels to my car and a damaged wheel to my motorcycle.
\
Last year, a PennDOT spokesman went on a local radio talk show and insisted that the reason for the potholes was the severe weather during the winter. He cited expansion and contraction, as well. He was articulate and so smooth.
\
I thought about this before I started thinking about New York and Vermont. I have it on good authority that the folks in Upstate New York as well as the good folks from Vermont know something about severe weather. Having traveled in those states in the spring - pothole season - I noticed something quite striking: They have about 80 percent fewer potholes than we do.
\
Could it be that the reason for all the potholes in NEPA relates to poorly designed, poorly built, poorly maintained and poorly repaired roads? Having seen the same stretch of a road in the Poconos repaved three times in three years, it would not be cynical to think that something wrong is going on here.
\
Recently on my way to work, I noticed a fault line in the new pavement on the Morgan Highway, which will crack and break up in the not too distant future. Amazingly, that will facilitate new contracts to fix the road. The state and the city want my tax money right now. Well, I want the roads fixed correctly right now.

That's not the way it's supposed to be. This is supposed to be an open democracy with government transparency so that the taxpayers the government serves know what the government is doing.

Energy redirection
\
Editor:: Why do the citizens of Northeast Pennsylvania have to suffer the burdens of the oil and gas industry?
\
Why do we have to sacrifice our clean air, water and beautiful landscape for energy development? According to a letter from Gina Severcool Suydam of the Wyoming County Chamber of Commerce (Severance fee foe,"" April 24), it is for jobs.
\
We should ask ourselves, are these sustainable jobs? Do the hordes of drillers and truckers plan to stay after the environmental stripping and extraction are finished? My father was an underground coal miner in NEPA. Looking back, that industry left nothing but black lung, scarred mountains, polluted streams and mine fires.
\
We residents need to look to our future. Ask Sen. Bob Casey and Sen. Pat Toomey to help develop sustainable clean energy jobs. Make the oil and gas industry pay for abusing our environment, preferably through a carbon tax that would be funneled to consumers. It could help equalize the costs of energy sources and encourage development of a sustainable energy infrastructure.

Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., in pushing, unsuccessfully so far, for legislation that would cap the overall levels of greenhouse gas emissions in tandem with a system in which emitters could buy and sell permits authorizing the release of different levels of the targeted pollutants.\""He completely changed the dialogue in the Senate, and, to a certain, extent, in the House,"" Mr. Roy said.\Variations of the cap-and trade proposal are also central to the energy plans offered by the leading Democrats. They also tend to favor greater or complete reliance on an auction system for distributing the emission permits, as opposed to one in which certain industries, such as existing coal-fired plants, are granted some level of emission allowance by the government.\Sens. Hillary Rodham Clinton, D-N.Y. and Barack Obama, D-Ill. and former Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina would use part of the proceeds of the cap-and-trade auction to fund research on advances in renewable energy, clean-coal technology and similar efforts. The leading Democrats also propose to fund energy research by curtailing a variety of tax breaks for major oil companies.\Sen. Christopher J. Dodd, D-Conn., stands out among the candidates for his call for a broader carbon tax on corporations of all kinds. Despite their generalized calls for conservation, none of the candidates has supported significantly higher fuel taxes, along the European model, to hold down consumption.\Alternative energy\The politics of climate change have produced what once would have been considered strange bedfellows. With the exception of U.S. Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, who calls for a gradual phase-out of both nuclear and coal-fired plants, all of the candidates at least acknowledge the need for nuclear power as part of the nation's energy future, a position that once would have been anathema to Democratic primary voters.\""When you look at their comments in general, particularly the leaders, they realize that nuclear has to play a significant role,"" said Mitch Singer, a spokesman for the Nuclear Power Institute, an industry lobbying group. ""These are not dumb people. They are aware of the fact that the demand for energy is expected to grow by 40 percent by 2030.""\The Democrats' difficulty with the implications of nuclear power generation were evident, however, at their debate in mid-month in Las Vegas. The candidates were united in their opposition to the opening of a federal facility for storing spent nuclear fuel at Nevada's Yucca Mountain, undeterred by the fact that several of them had supported the facility in the past. And despite their opposition to that site, and their at least grudging support for expansion of the plants that produce the highly toxic waste, no Democrat has offered an alternative for the spent fuel storage.\So far, at least, the Yucca Mountain facility has not emerged as an issue in the Republican race.\For Detroit, the Democratic proposals include both carrots and sticks. There is general agreement on the need for mandating increases in fuel economy standards for automobiles. Mrs. Clinton, for example, has called for an increase to an average of 55 miles per gallon by 2030; Mr. Edwards, 40 miles-per-gallon by 2016.\But, along with other Democrats including Mr. Obama, they have also proposed multi-billion dollar aid packages for the auto industry to help it research new technologies and retool factories to produce cleaner cars. The auto industry is also one of the prime potential beneficiaries of a fund Mrs. Clinton has proposed separately to help pay for the ""legacy costs"" of retiree health care benefits.\As they troll for votes in Iowa, the candidates form a united chorus of support for the use of ethanol. Several of their Web sites cite the virtues of increasing production of the fuel, both from corn and from other natural sources such as switch grass.\Most of the candidates of both parties have also called for spending on research for clean-coal technology, including the capture and sequestration of carbon dioxide emissions. Mr. Edwards, for example, while the recipient of an enthusiastic endorsement of the United Mineworkers of America, has taken a hard line on new coal plants that do not capture greenhouse gases.\A UMW spokesman said the union's decision to back the ex-senator came in part because he has put forth what is, in the union's view, the most specific plans for research on coal's future.\Touting their foreign policy credentials, Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico and Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., are among the Democrats calling for a renewed and more vigorous American role in international agreements to curb the release of greenhouse gases.\GOP cool on warming\Global warming in particular and energy in general have played a relatively less prominent role in the GOP nomination battle, a tendency reflected in the candidates' Web sites. While most of the Democratic candidates offer fairly detailed energy plans, the Republicans' debate, and their Web sites, have more abbreviated, broad brush proposals.\In his standard stump speech, however, Mr. McCain regularly cites the ""devastating"" consequences of global warming and faults the Bush administration for being slow to respond to the issue. Some other Republican candidates, most notably former Sen. Fred D. Thompson of Tennessee, and U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, have been skeptical about the science behind assertions of global warming.\Others, such as former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts and former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, are agnostic on the scientific debate, but support energy conservation and research for security reasons.\Mr. Huckabee pledges that his administration would achieve energy independence by the end of his second term. Mr. Romney offers a general everything-should-be-on-the table approach, endorsing research on a broad array of renewable energy, nuclear and fossil fuel sources. Former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York has similarly called for an ""Apollo project"" to diversify the nation's energy sources, including nuclear, renewable sources and clean coal technologies.\In keeping with his libertarian philosophy, Mr. Paul opposes any significant energy role for the government, arguing that free markets will find a better path to the nation's energy future."
390,"It's early October, and Republican U.S. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick is marching with dozens of unionized postal workers down the streets of Philadelphia.\He's come to a Center City rally opposing the privatization of the U.S. Postal Service, and he's dressed for the part: A T-shirt emblazoned with the slogan ""U.S. Mail Not for Sale"" is pulled over his white button-up. Federal employees are chanting, ""We are the union, the mighty, mighty union!""\When they reach Independence Mall, Fitzpatrick speaks alongside three Democratic congressmen, a Democratic state senator, and an attorney running for the U.S. House on the Democratic ticket.\""The post office works pretty darn well, I think,"" he said to cheers. ""We have your back.""\In this highly partisan era, just before a midterm election, it is an unusual sight.\But it's part of Fitzpatrick's M.O.: The 44-year-old freshman congressman is betting that a Republican with a moderate brand can win in the Philadelphia suburbs in 2018.\He's running for reelection against Democrat Scott Wallace in Bucks County's First District, ground zero for the fight for control of the House. Bucks is a true swing county, where both Hillary Clinton and Republican Sen. Pat Toomey won in 2016.\Political analysts and even some Democrats think Fitzpatrick could eke out a victory, unlike many other suburban Republicans throughout the country. Wallace argues that the moderate talk is just that - all talk.\The fight of Fitzpatrick's political life comes at a moment of existential crisis for moderate Republicans. As their party has become more conservative and populist, culminating in the 2016 election of President Trump, many are calling it quits on their jobs: Four center-right Republicans in the Philadelphia region resigned from Congress or announced they wouldn't run for reelection this year.\By some measures, Fitzpatrick is the only moderate Republican in Pennsylvania's congressional delegation asking voters for another term. That makes the First District race both a referendum on centrism itself - and a test of whether voters believe such a thing exists in Trump's GOP.\Said Ryan Costello, the Chester County House Republican who decided not to run again: ""If Brian doesn't win, it would tell you just how bad the political environment is in suburban America for Republicans.""\'Brian Fitzpatrick Ranked #1 Most Independent Freshman Congressman'\At gas stations, town fairs, and suburban homes throughout Bucks County, red-white-and-blue campaign signs read: ""Brian Fitzpatrick Ranked #1 Most Independent Freshman Congressman.""\At campaign stops, Fitzpatrick touts membership in the Problem Solvers Caucus, a group of Democrats and Republicans seeking to pass bipartisan legislation.\Since he first ran for office in 2016 after serving in the FBI for 14 years, Fitzpatrick has carefully cultivated an image he had the benefit of inheriting: When he was building cases against Eliot Spitzer and others, his brother, then-U.S. Rep. Mike Fitzpatrick, was building a reputation as a Republican willing to work with Democrats.\Embracing his family's brand was step one. Step two: Once elected, he sided with Democrats on several high-profile issues. He was one of the Republicans who cast a decisive vote against repealing the Affordable Care Act. He opposed President Trump's executive order that banned citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States.\Fitzpatrick also broke with his party on a bill that would require states to honor concealed-carry gun permits from other states. He said nay to another opposing a carbon tax. And he was the only Republican congressman running for reelection who didn't join a lawsuit to block the state's new congressional map.\""My biggest concern for our country right now is hyper-partisanship,"" Fitzpatrick said in an interview. ""We're polarizing to the extremes rather than growing to the center-out. I really worry about it.""\The ""price you pay for being a centrist,"" he said, is getting ""beat up from all sides.""\Wallace, Fitzpatrick's Democratic opponent, counters that the incumbent ""votes with Trump 84 percent of the time."" The figure, from the website FiveThirtyEight, packs a punch in a district where Trump's disapproval rating is 53 percent.\Wallace has highlighted that Fitzpatrick voted for Trump's tax cuts, which he said benefited the wealthy. Fitzpatrick defends his vote, arguing the old tax code was ""an antiquated, outdated monstrosity and a job-killer.""\Yet Fitzpatrick has developed relationships with powerful allies that normally support Democrats, including labor unions and gun-control groups. The Pennsylvania AFL-CIO and former Democratic Rep. Gabby Giffords' PAC, as well as the Inquirer Editorial Board, have endorsed him.\Perhaps another reason Fitzpatrick has been able to build a moderate brand is because his party has moved to the right, particularly on issues such as immigration, making him stand apart where he might not have before.\Fitzpatrick said he visits a mosque in Lansdale in his district weekly. Reporters joined him there this month - around the same time that Trump claimed without evidence that ""Middle Easterners"" had joined a caravan of Latin American migrants.\""You can count on me being here every single Friday,"" Fitzpatrick told worshipers.\'We got to get rid of Trump cronies'\Fitzpatrick's fate in November may come down to whether independents and suburban women believe that he is truly a moderate - or even care about that question, with Trump in the White House.\Asked about that FiveThirtyEight ""Trump score,"" which Democrats argue proves he isn't a moderate, Fitzpatrick said, ""It's a fake number.""\""We've cast, what, 3,000 votes?"" he said. ""What do they identify, 40 out of the 3,000?""\The FiveThirtyEight ranking of Fitzpatrick is based on 93 votes. According to the website, Fitzpatrick has taken the same side as Trump on legislation banning abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy, stripping funding from cities that have ""sanctuary"" immigration laws, and rolling back regulations on financial institutions.\In Fitzpatrick's view, a fairer analysis comes from Georgetown University and the Lugar Center. Their ""Bipartisan Index"" examines the rate at which lawmakers introduce bills that win cosponsors from across the aisle, or sign onto bills from the other party.\That report ranked Fitzpatrick as the third most bipartisan legislator overall in the House in 2017.\Wallace, a multimillionaire philanthropist and former U.S. Senate committee lawyer, also has identified as an independent. At the same time, he's said Fitzpatrick takes money from ""corporate special interests"" and criticized the Problem Solvers Caucus: ""I haven't seen those problems solved yet.""\Wallace's constant drumbeat about Fitzpatrick's vote for the tax cuts has effectively forced the incumbent to campaign on an issue many Republicans have avoided.\Republicans likewise have sought to paint Wallace as no centrist, trying to tie him to convicted cop-killer Mumia Abu-Jamal. One TV ad falsely claiming that Wallace funded Abu-Jamal's defense was pulled from the airwaves.\With less than two weeks to go, Wallace has $1.4 million on hand, while Fitzpatrick has $1.2 million, according to campaign finance filings. An eye-popping $18 million already has been spent on the race, much of it on TV ads.\Political observers say the First District race is a ""toss-up,"" and recent polls have found mixed results.\Republican strategist John Brabender said that if Fitzpatrick holds on, it could be instructive for Republicans in 2020.\""That will serve as a model, if you will, to how Republicans can still win in very moderate-leaning districts,"" he said.\Still, Brabender said Trump accounts for ""70 percent of how people are going to vote."" Democrats now believe control of the House could come down to a handful of races.\Last Saturday, in search of voters, Wallace knocked on Dave Marconi's door in Middletown Township. Marconi normally splits his ticket. Not this year.\""We got to get rid of Trump cronies,"" he said.\Around the corner, Wallace found another Democrat. The middle-aged man told him he's planning to vote for Democratic Gov. Wolf - but in Congress, ""I happen to like the one we have.""\HOtterbein@philly.com 215-854-2508 @hollyotterbein\ \Credit: By Holly Otterbein STAFF WRITER"
391,"Kudos to staff writer Ad Crable for the front-page coverage detailing the impact of climate change on the Pennsylvania fishing industry.\I have tempered my frustration with the newspaper for not giving this issue the attention it deserves with the knowledge that acceptance of the science buttressing ""climate change"" is not the prevailing sentiment in the horse-and-buggy belt.\It should be troubling, though, to those who enjoy fishing, including our own representatives in Washington, that continued denial of climate change and its cause, greenhouse gases, could jeopardize the state's $347 million industry.\I can only speculate about what U.S. Rep. Joe Pitts' input will be in his role on the Energy and Power subcommittee that convenes this week. The committee will re-examine President Obama's mandate to more rigorously enforce DEP policies intended to reduce greenhouse gases.\Insofar as Pitts previously co-sponsored legislation in 2011 that, if passed, would have served to prohibit regulation of those gases, or of considering climate effects in enforcing laws, that he will vigorously do his utmost to negate the president's requests for more strict enforcement of those emissions.\Let's require accountability from Congress, which is playing Russian roulette with our future\I implore Pitts to compromise rather than obstruct progress by supporting his colleagues who propose carbon tax plans that represent win/win solutions for industry and environment alike.\Jeff Sussman\Manheim Township\What is the story with this guy, Terry Madonna.

The letter writer supports coddling these vile creatures and waiting to see if they re-offend?\Sure, let's send out the message to child molesters everywhere that it's OK, and you might get a slap on the wrist and have to undergo a little counseling. I don't care if ""sex offenders have one of the lowest rates of re-offending."" Even one is too many.

The politicians and wealthy have developed an immunity from serious crime. The criminal justice system appears to be mainly for the average citizen.\There are numerous examples. so we will start at the top of the chain. President Nixon, along with his aides, committed serious felonies. They included, but are not limited to authorizing a break-in and obstructing the ongoing investigation. President Ford explained his reason for granting Nixon a pardon, and the pattern was set.\President Reagan and his administration negotiated with terrorists by selling weapons to them in exchange for the release of hostages. There was a major effort to cover up this crime, which was not necessary since everyone received immunity. Again, the majority of politicians offered their approval.\President Clinton suppressed any investigation regarding Reagan's administration efforts to illegally supply Saddam Hussein with money and weapons.\Do you remember Lewis ""Scooter"" Libby, who was guilty of four felonies; he had his entire sentence of 30 months commuted by President Bush. President Bush authorized torture, imprisonment without trial, kidnapping, as well as other crimes.\President Obama failed to authorize any investigation. There appears to be an unwritten rule that each president agrees to shield each other from accountability regarding any crime they might have committed while in office.\Since the threat of any real punishment for violating the law has been removed, there is little incentive to abide by the law and a greater incentive to break it. One can only wonder how far this violation of criminal behavior will go?\Corporations also seem to have a lack of concern for any violations they commit since they only receive a relative small financial penalty.\John Adams summed it up: ""There is a danger from all men. The only maxim of a free government ought to be trust no man living with power to endanger the public liberty.""\Larry R. Widdoss\Manor Township\Currently, the Lancaster County Prison operates with a contract with its phone company that guarantees to Lancaster County a commission at a rate of $400,000 per year. The current charges being made to the inmates are high enough to include paying for this commission, over and above the net revenue flowing to the phone company for its services, including - you can count on it - a handsome profit.\The action by the Federal Communications Commission to cap the charges for out-of-state phone calls is a very good step toward fairness to the inmates. Hopefully, the powers that be will now take the added necessary steps to make sure that, going forward, inmates will only pay actual costs for phone calls of all kinds.\That would correct the injustice that has been occurring in providing an unearned and undeserved cash inflow to Lancaster County.\Reed Spiegel\Manheim Township\Lancaster sheep, beware the county commissioners you chose as shepherds.\Do they have your best interest in mind?

392,"Preservation must be the priority \The proposal to develop the Oregon Dairy site along Route 272 by the Hurst brothers was first unveiled to the public at the Manheim Township Planning Commission meeting on Aug. 17. The proposed plan actually consists of two separate developments, which are being combined into one project. \One of the tracts is the 27-acre former Shawnee Resort site on the east side of Route 272. Few if any concerns are being raised about the redevelopment of that site, and the Hurst family is to be commended for their vision to develop that tract. \The second tract, which is not contiguous with the former Shawnee site, consists of 49 acres on the west side of Route 272, most of which is currently farmed except for the land occupied by the Oregon Dairy store. It is the massive development that is being proposed for that site that has raised concerns by neighboring farmers and residents in the area, in addition to the Old Order Amish and Mennonites who will have great difficulty navigating their horse-drawn carriages through that area with increased traffic. \The magnitude and scale of this development would dwarf the village of Oregon, more than tripling its size, and would create a congestion nightmare on Route 272 with the installation of five new traffic lights. \The project would require the widening of Oregon Road and installation of turning lanes to accommodate the massive traffic increase that would be generated by this development. The land required for the road widening is part of the preserved Jay Landis farm, and the preservation easement is held by Lancaster Farmland Trust. The Hursts bought the Landis farm last November, and in March they and their development team made a presentation to Farmland Trust and requested an amendment of the easement and a land swap so they could take preserved land for the road upgrades. Kudos to Lancaster Farmland Trust for refusing to amend the ag easement and approve the land swap. \Having failed to persuade Lancaster Farmland Trust to amend the preservation easement, the Hursts are now advocating for the condemnation of that preserved land through PennDOT, all while Rich Hurst continues to sit on the Ag Preserve Board. Those serving on the Ag Preserve Board should embrace a preservation ethic. Rich Hurst fails to meet that standard. \R.

The medication in the pens costs $1 to manufacture. \This is another example of corporate greed run amok. During this same time, Mylan CEO Heather Bresch saw her annual salary rocket from a measly $2.5 million a year to an astonishing $19 million. \This lifesaving medication is necessary for patients suffering from severe allergies to foods, such as nuts, and bee stings. It expires usually within 12 to 18 months after purchase. Patients have to bring their EpiPens to multiple locations (home, work, school, gym, etc). Some patients need to buy up to four pens in order to be completely safe, because seconds count during a severe allergic reaction. \Because Congress cannot or will not do anything to rein in this ridiculous gouging of American patients and their families, I have made it my personal mission to stop prescribing EpiPens for all my patients. \There is an excellent alternative: Adrenaclick. It is still expensive, but it retails for one-fourth the cost of EpiPen. \I invite all patients and all doctors to join me in boycotting Mylan's EpiPen so that we may send a message that greed is not the answer. \Dr. Joseph Irwin \Ephrata \The stigma on those with disabilities \There was a motorist killed in North Carolina after failing to stop for police (because he didn't hear the siren) and jumping out of his car to run. The motorist was deaf. \Most people are not as educated as they could be on communicating with people who have disabilities. Instead, they make incorrect assumptions about them. In this case, the assumption made was deadly. \People should take a step back in order to understand disability and better ways to relate. Stigmas are often more disabling than the disabilities themselves. If there are readers out there who agree, please let me know. I want to eliminate this common problem with a simple solution. \Sue Schaffer \East Lampeter Township \Why animal lovers should go vegan \Are you willing to make sacrifices in your own life to help end animal suffering?

Our Social Security didn't go up 7 percent; our pensions didn't go up 7 percent. How do they expect seniors to continue to pay and still afford medication, groceries and to - God forbid - do anything fun? \Remaining in our homes has become a real challenge. Why should we pay more a month than we did when we bought our house? There has to be another way to fund schools and teachers' pensions, or at least give seniors some kind of a break. \To the people who are thrilled and happy to pay excessive taxes, I would be happy to let you pay the remainder of ours. \Judy Myers \Conestoga \Congress must pass carbon tax legislation \""Lancaster city takes on climate change"" (Aug. 12) applauds Lancaster's City Council and Mayor Rick Gray for passing a resolution to fight climate change, which calls on the U.S. Congress to pass a carbon fee and dividend bill. \What's carbon fee and dividend? It's a revenue-neutral carbon fee that uses the market rather than government regulations to phase out fossil fuels. It's a way to transition to clean energy swiftly and efficiently at no cost to consumers or taxpayers. This is accomplished through a carbon pollution tax, where all the money is given to taxpayers in equal monthly checks. The tax increases annually, and so do people's ""carbon dividend"" checks. People who switch to clean energy providers make a profit. \British Columbia has been doing this for eight years, and they've slashed emissions while creating jobs, lowering taxes and energy bills, and their economy has thrived. Carbon fee and dividend has an 83 percent public approval rating there. \A clean-energy economy in the U.S. is projected to create over 5 million permanent, good-paying jobs, save over 45,000 American lives lost annually to carbon pollution, and save Americans over $866 million annually in medical bills for carbon-caused illnesses. \Solar and wind energy is projected to be nearly free within 20 years. Imagine the economic benefits that would provide. \In contrast, the costs of climate change, with a business-as-usual approach, could be over $400 trillion. The sooner we take serious action, the less we'll have to pay for climate disasters. \If Congress wants to improve our economy and our health, carbon fee and dividend is the best way to do that. \Lynn Goldfarb \Manheim Township"
393,"Pushing carbon tax legislation \This letter is regarding ""Feds push back ruling on pipeline,"" Oct. 22. \This is good news. Besides the encroachment on preserved farmland, environmental damage to pristine areas of our county and increased air pollution, there are other dangers - just type ""gas pipeline explosions"" into Google and you'll see. \Beyond the immediate dangers this form of energy poses, there is the larger threat of climate change that fossil fuels are driving. And don't be fooled by claims that natural gas is a ""clean"" fuel that emits less carbon pollution than oil and coal. When methane leaks from fracked natural gas are factored in, it is just as bad a greenhouse gas emitter as coal. \We need a revenue-neutral carbon fee and dividend plan that motivates the shift from dirty fossil fuels to clean, modern, renewable energy. It makes all fossil fuel corporations pay an escalating pollution fee; the public, not the government, gets the money. The carbon fee and dividend uses the market, rather than government regulations or expansion, to create a clean-energy economy that will be a model for the rest of the world to follow. It won't cost us anything now, and it will save us trillions we, or our children, could otherwise pay for future climate change disasters. \You can find out how carbon fee and dividend works at CitizensClimateLobby.org.

Some qualification was obviously missing. \I also find myself in agreement with Donald Trump when he says the system is rigged. Every four years the Electoral College, that archaic middleman of the republic, surfaces with its power to co-opt the vote of the people. This Election Day it did just that. \I used to wonder why some folks don't vote; now I understand. After last Tuesday, I am embarrassed to be an American and a Pennsylvanian. My husband actually was moved to email our extended family in Australia to explain that we are not all like the people who voted for Trump.

The rejection letter stated, ""Solar panel installations don't fit with the 'aesthetics' of the Crossgates Community."" \So now my wife and I must continue to pay for dirty, polluting energy instead of clean, renewable, solar energy that comes at a more affordable rate. \We think it is our responsibility to leave this world a better place for future generations, but we were not given the chance. \M.

394,"For decades, the world has thought of Canada as America's friendly northern neighbor -- a responsible, earnest, if somewhat boring, land of hockey fans and single-payer health care. On the big issues, it has long played the global Boy Scout, reliably providing moral leadership on everything from ozone protection to land-mine eradication to gay rights. \But a dark secret lurks in the northern forests. Over the last decade, Canada has not so quietly become an international mining center and a rogue petrostate. It's no longer America's better half, but a dystopian vision of the continent's energy-soaked future.\That's right: The good neighbor has banked its economy on the cursed elixir of political dysfunction -- oil. Flush with visions of becoming a global energy superpower, Canada's government has taken up with pipeline evangelists, petroleum bullies and climate change skeptics. Turns out the Boy Scout's not just hooked on junk crude -- he's become a pusher.\With oil and gas now accounting for approximately a quarter of its export revenue, Canada has even lost its famous politeness. Since the Conservative Party won a majority in Parliament in 2011, the federal government has eviscerated conservationists, indigenous nations, European commissioners and just about anyone opposing unfettered oil production as unpatriotic radicals. It has muzzled climate change scientists, killed funding for environmental science of every stripe and systematically dismantled long-cherished environmental laws.\The author of this transformation is Prime Minister Stephen Harper, a right-wing policy wonk and evangelical Christian with a power base in Alberta, ground zero of Canada's oil boom. Just as Margaret Thatcher funded her political makeover of Britain on revenue from North Sea oil, Mr. Harper intends to methodically rewire the entire Canadian experience with petrodollars sucked from the ground. In the process he has concentrated power in the prime minister's office and reoriented Canada's foreign priorities.\Mr. Harper, who took office in 2006, increased defense spending by nearly $1 billion annually in his first four years, and he has committed $2 billion to prison expansion with a ""tough on crime"" policy that ignores the country's falling crime rate. Meanwhile, Canada has amassed a huge federal debt -- its highest in history at some $600 billion and counting.\Liberal critics like to say that Mr. Harper's political revolution caught many Canadians by surprise. That may be true, but though Canadians live in high latitudes, they're not above baser human instincts -- like greed.\Mr. Harper is aggressively pushing an economic gamble on oil, the world's most volatile resource, and promising national wealth based on untapped riches far from where most Canadians live that will fill their pocketbooks, and those of their children, for generations. With nearly three-quarters of Canadians supporting oil sands development in a recent poll, Mr. Harper seems to be selling them on the idea.\The resource underwriting many of these ugly behavioral changes is bitumen, a heavy, sour crude mined from oil sands. Deposits of the badly degraded asphalt-like substance lie under a forest the size of Florida in northeastern Alberta and comprise the world's third-largest petroleum reserves.\Over the last decade, as oil prices increased fivefold, oil companies invested approximately $160 billion to develop bitumen in Alberta, and it has finally turned profitable. Canada is now cranking out 1.7 million barrels a day of the stuff, and scheduled production stands to fill provincial and federal government coffers with about $120 billion in rent and royalties by 2020. And the government wants more; it's pushing for 5 million barrels a day by 2030.\Never mind that the entire process is a messy and wasteful one. It takes copious amounts of water, capital and energy to dig out the carbon-rich sands, let alone process the heavy crude, which can't even move through a pipeline until it is diluted with an imported gasoline-like condensate. With brazen cheek, the government nonetheless defends the Alberta megaproject as ""responsible"" and ""sustainable"" -- ""an enterprise of epic proportions, akin to the building of the pyramids or China's Great Wall. Only bigger.""\Bigger indeed: Approved bitumen mining projects could potentially excavate a forest area six times as large as New York City. Reclamation and reforestation remain an uncertain and costly proposition. To date, oil companies have already created enough toxic mining sludge (6 billion barrels) to flood the entirety of Washington, D.C.\Unsurprisingly, Ottawa has become a master at the cynical art of greenwashing. When Mr. Harper's ministers aren't attacking former NASA scientist and climate change canary James Hansen or lobbying against Europe's Fuel Quality Directive (which regards bitumen as much dirtier than conventional oil), his government is buying ads ($100 million since 2009) to convince Canadians that exporting this oil is ""responsible resource development.""\It's also bending over backward to entice Beijing. Three state-owned Chinese oil companies (all with dismal records of corporate transparency and environmental sensitivity) have already spent more than $20 billion purchasing rights to oil sands in Alberta.\The kowtowing to China, now the world's largest oil consumer, highlights Canada's big bitumen dilemma: how to get dirty, landlocked oil to global markets. The United States, Canada's biggest customer, doesn't seem to need it as much anymore; imports declined by more than 4 million barrels a day between 2005 and 2011, and with pipeline projects to the United States like Keystone XL stuck in the mud, Mr. Harper's vision of being an ""emerging energy superpower"" appears in danger.\Unsurprisingly, Mr. Harper has recently jettisoned criticism of China's human rights record. As a secret foreign-policy document leaked last fall to the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. makes clear, Canada has new priorities: ""To succeed we will need to pursue political relationships in tandem with economic interests even where political interests or values may not align.""\Now that oil-sands mining accounts for nearly 10 percent of Canada's greenhouse gas emissions, Ottawa no longer can brook discussion of a carbon tax, though a majority of Canadians would support one. Mr. Harper described the Kyoto Protocol on climate changes as ""a socialist scheme"" and a ""job-killing, economy-destroying"" accord before pulling out of the agreement in 2012.\Many of Canada's ministers are now die-hard skeptics even about the science behind climate change. To silence any would-be climate-change exaggerators, the government simply stopped funding the Canadian Foundation for Climate and Atmospheric Sciences, disbanded Environment Canada's Adaptation to Climate Change Research Group and eliminated the role of chief science adviser. Since 2008, political minders have vetted all media requests for the country's 23,000 federal scientists.\After the government barred a federal scientist from talking about the discovery of a large Arctic ozone hole, a 2012 editorial in the influential science journal Nature demanded that the Canadian government ""set its scientists free."" It seems Mr. Harper heard ""cut them loose"" instead: His government summarily closed the world-famous Experimental Lakes Area research station, a gem of Canadian environmental science that has helped spur global policy on acid rain, to save the princely sum of $2 million a year.\The single-minded pursuit of this petroproject has stunned global analysts. The Economist, no left-wing shill, characterized Mr. Harper, the son of an Imperial Oil senior accountant, as a bully ""intolerant of criticism and dissent"" with a determined habit of rule-breaking.\Lawrence Martin, one of Canada's most influential political commentators, says that Mr. Harper's ""billy-club governance"" has broken ""new ground in the subverting of the democratic process.""\Conservative pollster Allan Gregg has described Mr. Harper's agenda as an ideological assault on evidence, facts and reason.\To be fair, Mr. Harper's government does have a plan for climate change -- pumping the problem to the United States and/or China. Oil-sands crude transported to the United States by the proposed Keystone XL pipeline, for example, could over a 50-year period increase carbon emissions by as much as 935 million metric tons relative to other crudes.\All this underscores Canada's new reality: Just about any kind of rational evidence has now come under assault by a government that believes that markets -- and only markets -- hold the answers. Any act that industry regards as an obstacle to rapid mineral extraction or pipeline building has been rewritten with a Saudi-like flourish. One massive budget bill alone changed 70 pieces of legislation, gutting, for example, the Fisheries Act, which directly prohibited the destruction of aquatic-life habitats but stood in the way of the Northern Gateway pipeline, which must cross 1,000 waterways en route to the Pacific Ocean.\Meanwhile, funding for Canada's iconic park system has been cut by 20 percent in what critics have called a ""lobotomy."" The CBC, the respected state broadcaster and independent check on power, has suffered a series of cutbacks. The Health Council of Canada, which once ensured national health standards and innovation across Canada's 13 provinces and territories, also got the ax.\More than a decade ago, American political scientist Terry Lynn Karl crudely summed up the dysfunction of petrostates: Countries that become too dependent on oil and gas riches behave like plantation economies that rely on ""an unsustainable development trajectory fueled by an exhaustible resource"" whose revenue streams form ""an implacable barrier to change."" And that's what happened to Canada while you weren't looking. Shackled to the hubris of a leader who dreams of building a new global energy superpower, the Boy Scout is now slave to his own greed."
395,"As customers walk in and out of CermakTech - a small computer business on South Potomac Street in Waynesboro - they may not notice what's sitting right above their heads.\If they look up when entering the building, they'd see the 96 solar panels that span the entire south side of the roof.\""I wish they were a little bit more obvious,"" owner of CermakTech, Mike Cermak, said with a laugh. ""They kind of blend in too well to the roof.""\The panels have been there since between 2010 and 2011, when Cermak got the technology installed. He also opted to get solar panels for his home.\As clean, renewable and sustainable energy continues to be a hot topic across the country, solar energy has come to the forefront as one way to produce it. The panels harness the sun's light and convert it to electricity, which can be used in homes and commercial buildings.\Today, there are 1,508,000 solar systems installed all over the United States, and 17,138 of those in Pennsylvania, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association.\This number is still small compared to neighboring states like Maryland and New Jersey, which the association says has 49,695 and 73,279 solar systems, respectively.\But Pennsylvania is still making progress in clean, renewable energy.\This year, the SEIA ranked the state 19th in the country for the amount of solar systems installed - up from 26th in 2016.\Why go solar?\The production of clean energy is one reason Cermak installed the panels. As the father of two small children living in a house that utilizes two heat pumps, a heater for a pool and is consistently kept warm in the winter, he said it is more environmentally friendly and helps reduce his and his family's carbon footprint.\""Every year, we're getting more and more renewable electric from solar panels like mine, or other people, and it's just getting cleaner and cleaner every year,"" he said.\Another local business, Lady Moon Farms, also decided solar panels would be a great addition to its Chambersburg property. The company installed the technology around the same time as Cermak - in 2010 - over the roof of its packinghouse on its farm on Criders Church Road.\Like Cermak, Lady Moon Farms' decision was driven by a desire for environmentally friendly energy.\Lady Moon Farms Vice President Anais Beddard said the company decided to make the move, because it believes ""alternative energy needs to be our future, and we have an obligation to do it for the environment.""\Beddard and Cermak also feel the panels are a way to address and reduce the effects of global warming and climate change.\But being a friend to the environment is just one benefit of solar systems.\Brian McNew owns a Chambersburg company called EarthNet Energy, which sells solar panels to different dealers in the area. He said what makes the technology a good investment for homeowners is the potential to reduce utility bills by up to 90 percent.\Cermak said his utility bills decreased by 50 percent after installing the panels, which generate half of the electricity in his house.\Despite the solar system's benefits, the price tag could detour some businesses and homeowners from considering the technology.\For the installation at Lady Moon Farms, Beddard said it cost about $550,000 to cover part of the approximately 20,000-square-foot roof. Cermak said it cost tens of thousands of dollars to install solar panels at his business and his home.\It will be about six years before property owners see a return on their investment after installing solar panels, according to McNew.\Even with the hefty price tag, he said he would still recommend locals shell out the money to get the technology.\Solar systems are more affordable now than they were when Beddard and Cermak had them installed several years ago. According to the SEIA, the costs of solar panels in Pennsylvania declined 55 percent over the past five years.\In addition, there are a number of incentives available to encourage property owners to go solar, such as the federal government's income tax credit.\In fact, Beddard said the farm received a 10-percent rebate from the state, and a 25-percent rebate from the federal government to help subsidize the costs. Cermak also received a federal tax rebate and a Pennsylvania grant for his installation - something he said helped a great deal.\For locals with solar power, they also have the option of selling or storing the excess energy they produce, according to the state's Department of Environmental Protection.\In a recent blog post, the department said property owners have the choice of storing the energy in batteries to use when the grid is not operating, or sending the energy back into the grid and then having the electric company pay money for that energy, as long as the owner produced more energy than they consumed.\Being able to access electricity when the grid is down is one benefit McNew mentioned in favor of buying solar panels.\""Solar is an answer, one answer only that there is to be able to provide power when there is no power,"" he said.\McNew cited the recent hurricane that damaged Puerto Rico and left millions without power for several months as a reason why residents should consider the technology.\""Those kinds of things - even though we hear that it happens in other places - you know it could always happen in the U.S.,"" he said. ""We dabble, sometimes, and we're lucky we can have people to put the grids back up pretty quick.""\For locals thinking about investing in solar energy, McNew said now is the time.\He added he doesn't think the panels are going to get any cheaper than what they are now, and the state still has incentives available for people who want the installation.\Although, it's unclear how long this will last.\Dan Whitten, vice president of communications for SEIA, said President Donald Trump is looking at imposing tariffs on panels from out of the country, which could mean an increase jump in prices for solar technology.\Even so, interest is solar energy is rising in the area. Cermak said he sees more and more locals with solar panels when he drives down the road, and recently the Tuscarora School District considered the use of solar panels at several of its schools. An update on the project was not available by this story's print deadline.\Seeing neighbors and community members using solar technology is a critical component of helping others adopt it, according to Whitten.\""I think the visibility of solar in communities will lead to significant uptick across the state,"" he said.\McNew also said he has heard over the past several months that solar-panel dealers are getting busier.\Interest in solar systems is increasing on a state level, as well, according to the SEIA. From 2015 to 2016, Pennsylvania saw more than a 500-percent increase in homeowners installing solar panels. The state also saw about a 40-percent increase for other property owners who installed the panels.\Even with more interest, though, Whitten said he is surprised Pennsylvania is not more active in solar generation. The state currently has 321 megawatts worth of solar systems installed - which is enough to power more than 31,160 homes a year - but this is still relatively small compared to the amount of electricity Pennsylvania uses, according to Whitten.\He added that Pennsylvania has a clean energy standard that isn't as aggressive as some of the renewable standards in other states on the east coast, such as New York or Massachusetts.\""It's a state that is super-tuned to energy issues, and obviously, a big gas producer, has been a big coal producer,"" Whitten said. ""So, I think it's a state that has an opportunity to really grow over the next couple of years.""\And Pennsylvania has made efforts to grow in the solar energy sector.\Finding Pennsylvania's Solar Future is a 2017-2019 statewide planning project led by the DEP Office of Pollution Prevention and Energy Assistance to equip Pennsylvania to produce more solar energy by 2030, according to the department's website. The project's goal is to increase by 10 percent the amount of in-state electricity sales that come from in-state solar energy generation.\In addition, on Wednesday, Gov. Tom Wolf announced new measures to help advance solar energy in the state.\One measure states that Pennsylvania's Solar Energy Program will provide $30 million in grant funding for eligible applicants to promote the installation of new solar projects, and the manufacture or assembly of solar equipment to help encourage the deployment and creation of solar jobs.\Right now, there are 530 solar companies in the state, according to the SEIA.\For solar equipment manufacturing projects, the program will offer up to $40,000 in loans or $5,000 in grants for every new job created within three years. For new solar panel installations, the program will offer loans up to $5 million, and grants up to $1 million.\Despite this efforts, even though the state currently sits at 19th in the nation for solar energy systems, the association projects that it will lose this place and drop back down to 26th over the next five years.\However, Whitten predicts the state will do better.\""The opportunities that exist in Pennsylvania, I think, will lead to a higher adoption rate than we're projecting,"" he said.\Cermak added that he thinks more and more people in the area will invest in the technology.\""I think it'll continue to increase,"" he said. ""It'll make more and more financial sense as it becomes more economically viable.""\Ashley Books, 717-262-4764\Solar by the numbers\Solar systems installed: 17,138 systems\National ranking: 19th\Percentage of state's electricity from solar: .17 percent\Solar companies: 530 companies\Homes powered by solar: 37,000 homes\Price decline of panels: 55 percent over the past five years\Information courtesy of the Solar Energy Industries Association\CAPTION: \Lady Moon Farms installed solar panels on its Chambersburg farm's 20,000 square-foot packinghouse in 2010.

I applaud Snyder's of Hanover's innovative idea to install a field of solar panels (Solar Power a Bright Idea All Around 8/5/2010). If every company in Pennsylvania made an investment in clean energy, there would be many benefits. Obviously there would be a reduction in global warming pollution, but there would also be significant job creation. It is unfortunate that the residents of Penn Township aren't recognizing the bigger picture in this situation.
\
Hopefully, there will soon be more incentive in Pennsylvania to create clean energy. There is a bill in the state legislature (HB 2405) that would build upon the success of our 2004 Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard, increasing the amount of clean energy sources purchased in Pennsylvania to 15 percent.
\
This kind of legislation makes good sense for the environment and is good for the economy. In fact, five recent studies have found that incorporating no-cost fuels like wind and solar into the electric grid can reduce prices for all consumers while staving off the worst effects of global warming, including those that will disrupt industries like agriculture and outdoor tourism.
\
I urge Pennsylvanians to contact their state representatives and tell them to support HB 2405. With a more robust clean energy standard creation in place, it will be easier for companies like Snyder's to bring to fruition all of those ""bright ideas.""

399,"
Energy prices and the conflict in the Middle East, combined with growing concern over the progress of global warming, have jump-started a long overdue national conversation about the direction of America's energy policy. The public is clamoring for solutions and, in this generation, there has never been deeper support for increasing the amount of power we get from renewable energy.
\
Our nation has a track record of responding to major challenges and achieving unthinkable goals. If any nation in the world is capable of creating an energy system that can fuel our economy while preserving our environment and our long-term security, it is us.
\
But, right now, America is failing to take advantage of our almost unlimited potential to generate electricity from renewable sources of energy like wind and solar power.
\
The United States has historically been a leader in the deployment of renewable energy technologies. As recently as the mid 1990s, we were the world's leaders in solar power capacity and number two in wind. Unfortunately, that is no longer the case. By 2004, Japan had three times the solar photovoltaic capacity of the United States, while Germany had more than double the capacity. The U.S. is now third in installed wind power capacity behind Germany and Spain.
\
Germany employs over 40,000 workers in its wind energy industry and Denmark another 20,000. Both of these countries have wind resources that are only a fraction of those in our nation's windiest states. In Germany, the wind energy industry is the second largest consumer of steel next to the automotive industry.
\
Fortunately, an expanding number of communities are pressing the nation toward cleaner renewable energy. State and local officials are increasingly seeing the local economic development benefits of renewable energy. Farmers and ranchers recognize the benefits renewable energy provides for agricultural interests and rural economies. And, workers and businesses are beginning to understand that renewable energy technologies have the potential to create high-quality jobs that will drive our nation in the 21st century.
\
Already, 22 states--from Washington State to New Hampshire to right here in Pennsylvania--have passed renewable energy standards of their own, committing nearly half of our country's population to renewable energy targets as high as 25 percent by 2020.
\
By creating guaranteed markets for renewable energy, these policies have helped to jump-start new statewide energy economies and we are seeing evidence of the economic benefits.
\
For example, Pennsylvania's clean energy standard has spurred investment by Gamesa, a large Spanish manufacturer of wind turbines, in four plants outside of Philadelphia to assemble wind energy equipment for use in the U.S. One thousand men and women will go back to work on the same site of a former U.S. Steel mill outside of Fairless, Bucks County. And this is but one of many examples of the boom in investments in clean energy jobs we are seeing across the country.
\
Developing our renewable energy resources will create jobs, save consumers money and bolster rural economies. A 2004 study by the Union of Concerned Scientists found that a national standard requiring 20 percent renewable electricity by 2020 would save consumers tens of billions of dollars annually in lower electricity and natural gas bills, and create several hundred thousand new jobs--nearly twice as many as generating the same amount of power from fossil fuels.
\
In addition, by shifting away from fossil fuels, we can diversify and secure our energy supply while reducing global warming pollution. A recent UCS analysis based on assumptions of the Energy Information Administration indicates that a national standard requiring 20 percent renewable electricity by 2020 would could cut global warming pollution by 263 million metric tons in 2030; the equivalent of taking 43 million cars off the road.
\
Building on the momentum of the states, it is now time for Congress to act on a renewable electricity standard. Representatives Tom Udall (New Mexico) and Todd Platts (Pennsylvania) have introduced a national renewable electricity standard of 20 percent renewable energy by 2020, and we thank local Reps. Chris Carney and Paul Kanjorski for cosponsoring this important legislation--and encourage them to support this legislation when it comes up for a vote in the near future.
\
By adopting this policy, Congress can help build a cleaner and more secure economy for America, while reducing global warming pollution and making the U.S. once again the world's clean energy leader.

400,"The majority of Pennsylvanians support decisive action on climate change and a steady transition to renewable energy, a new poll indicates.\Seventy-three percent of Pennsylvanians surveyed in mid-February said they're concerned climate change will ""negatively impact"" their children and grandchildren, according to a poll conducted by Susquehanna Polling and Research and released by Clean Jobs for Pennsylvania and PennFuture.\The results mirror those of similar surveys conducted in the past year, suggesting that Keystone State residents are willing to make personal sacrifices in favor of alternative energy.\Nearly half of respondents were registered Democrats – and 39% Republicans – although more than one-third considered themselves independent or politically unaffiliated.\When asked if they would support a clean energy standard in Pennsylvania if it increased their electric bills by less than $5 a month, 65% of the 700 people surveyed said yes, including 87% of Democrats, 35% of Republicans and 71% of self-identified ""swing"" voters surveyed.\""Support for stronger state action is broad-based and includes majorities of voters in all political parties,"" said James Lee, president of Susquehanna Polling and Research in Harrisburg, in a statement.\As Pennsylvania moves to join the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a cap-and-trade program presented by Gov. Tom Wolf, 59% of those polled said they would support a proposed fund to help displaced fossil fuel workers during the transition. Additionally, 70% said they want lawmakers to better assist local communities hurt by layoffs at coal-fired power plants.\""...This poll shows that Pennsylvanians are serious about transitioning to a clean energy economy,"" said PennFuture President and CEO Jacquelyn Bonomo. ""And they support government action to help our communities and our workers break free from an economic reliance on fossil fuel extraction and consumption.""\Other surveys released in the past year reveal climate concerns among most residents. Still, the state is split on fracking and natural gas use.\A Progressive Policy Institute poll last year found 74% oppose an immediate ban on natural gas extraction, and 55% of voters polled said the country should use fossil fuels as a bridge to renewable energy sources. At the same time, 71% said climate change is a ""real and very serious problem.""\In a January 2020 Franklin & Marshall poll of 628 statewide voters, 48% said they support the natural gas industry and 44% said they opposed it. When asked whether they supported a ban on fracking, 48% favored a ban and 39% opposed it. Attitudes varied widely across urban, rural and suburban areas in Pennsylvania.\Chrissy Suttles covers business, energy and environment for the Beaver County Times and the USAToday Network.

401,"As of December 2013, Pennsylvania ranked second in the U.S. in the amount of electricity generated. None of our neighboring states was in the top six.\Pennsylvania exports a third of the electricity it generates to other states. These exports are worth about $4 billion a year. Norristown is home to the headquarters of the largest electric power market in the world, the PJM Interconnection Inc.\Will this economic powerhouse continue to benefit our state? That depends on whether our Commonwealth can be nimble in responding to the rapid changes in electric power generation that are sweeping the country.\Pennsylvania has a fairly traditional mix of fuels that are used in our power plants (see the figure). Our coal plants produce about the same percentage of power as in the rest of the country, while our natural gas plants' market share is only three-quarters as large as that for other states.\In the country as a whole, low-pollution sources of power (nuclear, hydroelectric and renewables) accounted for 32 percent of all electric power last year. Pennsylvania did better than the nation, with 38 percent.\But most of our state's low-pollution power is from a single source -- nuclear.\2013 saw four of the country's 103 nuclear plants close, three of them largely for economic reasons. Wholesale electricity prices are low because of both low natural gas prices and weak demand for power. When a generation plant requires significant maintenance (for example, a new steam turbine), the slim profits in today's weak market could make closing the plant an attractive option.\As many as five more nuclear plants may close in 2014. While I am not privy to the financial details of Pennsylvania's nuclear generators, it is reasonable to expect they are under the same financial pressures as plants in other states. That is the largest threat to clean electric power that the country currently faces.\Pennsylvania's reliance on nuclear for low-pollution power may make us vulnerable to these market conditions. Our hydroelectric and wind generation (totaling 2.6 percent) lag well behind that in other states (10.7 percent). Local firms like EverPower Wind Holdings are hanging on, but low market prices for power are not making investors keen to build modern water or wind plants.\New Jersey generates six times as much power from the sun as Pennsylvania does.\Pennsylvania's position as a leading power generation state is at risk. Our coal and gas plants are generally old. The current criminal investigations of contamination from fossil fuel ash in North Carolina and Tennessee have prompted tighter regulations on coal generating plants. The federal government has followed Pennsylvania's lead in putting stringent controls on mercury pollution from coal plants. Hatfield's Ferry power station in Greene County and Mitchell power station in Washington County both closed in October. \Pennsylvania has not yet taken advantage of its natural gas resources to bring the market share of power generated by gas up to that in the rest of the nation by building many new gas plants.\Industry values a clean environment to attract workers and a responsible environmental image.\Clean energy is a plus in convincing businesses to locate facilities like Aquion Energy's battery plant in Westmoreland County. The biomedical and technology companies in Pittsburgh and near Philadelphia that have spun out of our world-class universities all need bright people who like a healthy place to live and work.\What should we do to maintain our enviable position as a major electricity source with a high proportion of clean power?\All the action on energy is at the state level, rather than in Washington, D.C. Pennsylvania led the way in cleaning up the toxic heritage of waste coal piles with our Advanced Energy Portfolio Standard (AEPS). We have the tools we need to diversify our portfolio of low-pollution power.\We can broaden our AEPS to require that utilities in the state continue to supply about 40 percent of power from low-pollution sources. We might call it a Clean Energy Standard. \That would help the economics of our existing nuclear plant and encourage more renewables as well as hyper-efficient natural gas and combined heat-and-power plants. \Any candidate for governor who proposes such a standard would go a long way to ensure Pennsylvania's electric power future.\POWERSOURCE VOICE: JAY APT\Power Source Voice is a regular feature offering insight and opinion on energy subjects.

402,"Nathan Willcox is the energy and clean air advocate for PennEnvironment (nwillcox@pennenvironment.org). John DeFazio is the director of District 10 of the United Steelworkers, which represents 70,000 members across Pennsylvania (www.usw.org)\ Energy prices and the conflict in the Middle East, combined with growing concern over the progress of global warming, have jump- started a long overdue national conversation about the direction of America's energy policy. The public is clamoring for solutions and, in this generation, there has never been deeper support for increasing the amount of power we get from renewable energy.\ Our nation has a track record of responding to major challenges and achieving unthinkable goals. If any nation in the world is capable of creating an energy system that can fuel our economy while preserving our environment and long-term security, it is us. But America is failing to take advantage of our almost unlimited potential to generate electricity from renewable sources of energy like wind and solar power.\ The United States has historically been a leader in the deployment of renewable energy technologies. As recently as the mid- 1990s, we were the world leader in solar power capacity and No. 2 in wind.\ That is no longer the case. By 2004, Japan had three times the solar photovoltaic capacity of the United States, while Germany had more than double the capacity. The United States is now third in installed wind-power capacity behind Germany and Spain.\ Germany employs more than 40,000 workers in its wind energy industry and Denmark another 20,000. Both of these countries have wind resources that are only a fraction of those in our nation's windiest states. In Germany, the wind energy industry is the second largest consumer of steel, next to the automotive industry.\ Fortunately, an expanding number of communities are pressing our nation toward cleaner renewable energy. State and local officials are increasingly seeing the local economic development benefits of renewable energy. Farmers and ranchers recognize the benefits, too, as workers and businesses begin to understand that renewable energy technologies have the potential to create the sort of high-quality jobs that will drive our nation into the 21st century.\ Already, 22 states --from Washington state to New Hampshire to right here in Pennsylvania -- have passed renewable energy standards, committing nearly half of our country's population to renewable energy targets as high as 25 percent of total energy by 2020.\ By creating guaranteed markets for renewable energy, these policies have helped to jump start new statewide energy economies and we are seeing evidence of the economic benefits.\ For example, Pennsylvania's clean energy standard has spurred investment by Gamesa, a large Spanish manufacturer of wind turbines, in four plants outside of Philadelphia where the company will assemble wind energy equipment for use in the United States. One thousand men and women will go back to work at the site of a former U.S. Steel mill outside of Fairless, Pa. And this is but one of many examples of the boom in clean energy jobs we are seeing across the country.\ Developing our renewable energy resources will create jobs, save consumers money and bolster rural economies. A 2004 study by the Union of Concerned Scientists found that a national standard requiring 20 percent renewable electricity by 2020 would save consumers tens of billions of dollars annually in electricity and natural gas bills, and create several hundred thousand new jobs -- nearly twice as many as generating the same amount of power from fossil fuels. In addition, by shifting away from fossil fuels, we can diversify and secure our energy supply while reducing global warming pollution. A recent analysis by the Union of Concerned Scientists based on assumptions of the Energy Information Administration indicates that a national standard requiring 20 percent renewable electricity by 2020 could cut global warming pollution by 263 million metric tons in 2030 -- the equivalent of taking 43 million cars off the road.\ Building on the momentum of the states, it is now time for Congress to act on a renewable electricity standard. Representatives Tom Udall, D.-N.M., and Todd Platts, R-York, Pa., have introduced a national renewable electricity standard of 20 percent renewable energy by 2020 in the House of Representatives, and we urge local Congressmen Mike Doyle, Jason Altmire and Tim Murphy to cosponsor this important legislation. By adopting this policy, Congress can help build a cleaner and more secure economy for America, while reducing global warming pollution and making the United States once again the world's clean energy leader."

As Prepared for Delivery - Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, distinguished guests, and fellow Americans:
\
Last month, I went to Andrews Air Force Base and welcomed home some of our last troops to serve in Iraq. Together, we offered a final, proud salute to the colors under which more than a million of our fellow citizens fought - and several thousand gave their lives.
\
We gather tonight knowing that this generation of heroes has made the United States safer and more respected around the world. For the first time in nine years, there are no Americans fighting in Iraq. For the first time in two decades, Osama bin Laden is not a threat to this country. Most of al Qaeda's top lieutenants have been defeated. The Taliban's momentum has been broken, and some troops in Afghanistan have begun to come home.
\
These achievements are a testament to the courage, selflessness, and teamwork of America's Armed Forces. At a time when too many of our institutions have let us down, they exceed all expectations. They're not consumed with personal ambition. They don't obsess over their differences. They focus on the mission at hand. They work together.
\
Imagine what we could accomplish if we followed their example. Think about the America within our reach: A country that leads the world in educating its people. An America that attracts a new generation of high-tech manufacturing and high-paying jobs. A future where we're in control of our own energy, and our security and prosperity aren't so tied to unstable parts of the world. An economy built to last, where hard work pays off, and responsibility is rewarded.
\
We can do this. I know we can, because we've done it before. At the end of World War II, when another generation of heroes returned home from combat, they built the strongest economy and middle class the world has ever known. My grandfather, a veteran of Patton's Army, got the chance to go to college on the GI Bill. My grandmother, who worked on a bomber assembly line, was part of a workforce that turned out the best products on Earth.
\
The two of them shared the optimism of a Nation that had triumphed over a depression and fascism. They understood they were part of something larger; that they were contributing to a story of success that every American had a chance to share - the basic American promise that if you worked hard, you could do well enough to raise a family, own a home, send your kids to college, and put a little away for retirement.
\
The defining issue of our time is how to keep that promise alive. No challenge is more urgent. No debate is more important. We can either settle for a country where a shrinking number of people do really well, while a growing number of Americans barely get by. Or we can restore an economy where everyone gets a fair shot, everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules. What's at stake are not Democratic values or Republican values, but American values. We have to reclaim them.
\
Let's remember how we got here. Long before the recession, jobs and manufacturing began leaving our shores. Technology made businesses more efficient, but also made some jobs obsolete. Folks at the top saw their incomes rise like never before, but most hardworking Americans struggled with costs that were growing, paychecks that weren't, and personal debt that kept piling up.
\
In 2008, the house of cards collapsed. We learned that mortgages had been sold to people who couldn't afford or understand them. Banks had made huge bets and bonuses with other people's money. Regulators had looked the other way, or didn't have the authority to stop the bad behavior.
\
It was wrong. It was irresponsible. And it plunged our economy into a crisis that put millions out of work, saddled us with more debt, and left innocent, hard-working Americans holding the bag. In the six months before I took office, we lost nearly four million jobs. And we lost another four million before our policies were in full effect.
\
Those are the facts. But so are these. In the last 22 months, businesses have created more than three million jobs. Last year, they created the most jobs since 2005. American manufacturers are hiring again, creating jobs for the first time since the late 1990s. Together, we've agreed to cut the deficit by more than $2 trillion. And we've put in place new rules to hold Wall Street accountable, so a crisis like that never happens again.
\
The state of our Union is getting stronger. And we've come too far to turn back now. As long as I'm President, I will work with anyone in this chamber to build on this momentum. But I intend to fight obstruction with action, and I will oppose any effort to return to the very same policies that brought on this economic crisis in the first place.
\
No, we will not go back to an economy weakened by outsourcing, bad debt, and phony financial profits. Tonight, I want to speak about how we move forward, and lay out a blueprint for an economy that's built to last - an economy built on American manufacturing, American energy, skills for American workers, and a renewal of American values.
\
This blueprint begins with American manufacturing.
\
On the day I took office, our auto industry was on the verge of collapse. Some even said we should let it die. With a million jobs at stake, I refused to let that happen. In exchange for help, we demanded responsibility. We got workers and automakers to settle their differences. We got the industry to retool and restructure. Today, General Motors is back on top as the world's number one automaker. Chrysler has grown faster in the U.S. than any major car company. Ford is investing billions in U.S. plants and factories. And together, the entire industry added nearly 160,000 jobs.
\
We bet on American workers. We bet on American ingenuity. And tonight, the American auto industry is back.
\
What's happening in Detroit can happen in other industries. It can happen in Cleveland and Pittsburgh and Raleigh. We can't bring back every job that's left our shores. But right now, it's getting more expensive to do business in places like China. Meanwhile, America is more productive. A few weeks ago, the CEO of Master Lock told me that it now makes business sense for him to bring jobs back home. Today, for the first time in fifteen years, Master Lock's unionized plant in Milwaukee is running at full capacity.
\
So we have a huge opportunity, at this moment, to bring manufacturing back. But we have to seize it. Tonight, my message to business leaders is simple: Ask yourselves what you can do to bring jobs back to your country, and your country will do everything we can to help you succeed.
\
We should start with our tax code. Right now, companies get tax breaks for moving jobs and profits overseas. Meanwhile, companies that choose to stay in America get hit with one of the highest tax rates in the world. It makes no sense, and everyone knows it.
\
So let's change it. First, if you're a business that wants to outsource jobs, you shouldn't get a tax deduction for doing it. That money should be used to cover moving expenses for companies like Master Lock that decide to bring jobs home.
\
Second, no American company should be able to avoid paying its fair share of taxes by moving jobs and profits overseas. From now on, every multinational company should have to pay a basic minimum tax. And every penny should go towards lowering taxes for companies that choose to stay here and hire here.
\
Third, if you're an American manufacturer, you should get a bigger tax cut. If you're a high-tech manufacturer, we should double the tax deduction you get for making products here. And if you want to relocate in a community that was hit hard when a factory left town, you should get help financing a new plant, equipment, or training for new workers.
\
My message is simple. It's time to stop rewarding businesses that ship jobs overseas, and start rewarding companies that create jobs right here in America. Send me these tax reforms, and I'll sign them right away.
\
We're also making it easier for American businesses to sell products all over the world. Two years ago, I set a goal of doubling U.S. exports over five years. With the bipartisan trade agreements I signed into law, we are on track to meet that goal - ahead of schedule. Soon, there will be millions of new customers for American goods in Panama, Colombia, and South Korea. Soon, there will be new cars on the streets of Seoul imported from Detroit, and Toledo, and Chicago.
\
I will go anywhere in the world to open new markets for American products. And I will not stand by when our competitors don't play by the rules. We've brought trade cases against China at nearly twice the rate as the last administration - and it's made a difference. Over a thousand Americans are working today because we stopped a surge in Chinese tires. But we need to do more. It's not right when another country lets our movies, music, and software be pirated. It's not fair when foreign manufacturers have a leg up on ours only because they're heavily subsidized.
\
Tonight, I'm announcing the creation of a Trade Enforcement Unit that will be charged with investigating unfair trade practices in countries like China. There will be more inspections to prevent counterfeit or unsafe goods from crossing our borders. And this Congress should make sure that no foreign company has an advantage over American manufacturing when it comes to accessing finance or new markets like Russia. Our workers are the most productive on Earth, and if the playing field is level, I promise you - America will always win.
\
I also hear from many business leaders who want to hire in the United States but can't find workers with the right skills. Growing industries in science and technology have twice as many openings as we have workers who can do the job. Think about that - openings at a time when millions of Americans are looking for work.
\
That's inexcusable. And we know how to fix it.
\
Jackie Bray is a single mom from North Carolina who was laid off from her job as a mechanic. Then Siemens opened a gas turbine factory in Charlotte, and formed a partnership with Central Piedmont Community College. The company helped the college design courses in laser and robotics training. It paid Jackie's tuition, then hired her to help operate their plant.
\
I want every American looking for work to have the same opportunity as Jackie did. Join me in a national commitment to train two million Americans with skills that will lead directly to a job. My Administration has already lined up more companies that want to help. Model partnerships between businesses like Siemens and community colleges in places like Charlotte, Orlando, and Louisville are up and running. Now you need to give more community colleges the resources they need to become community career centers - places that teach people skills that local businesses are looking for right now, from data management to high-tech manufacturing.
\
And I want to cut through the maze of confusing training programs, so that from now on, people like Jackie have one program, one website, and one place to go for all the information and help they need. It's time to turn our unemployment system into a reemployment system that puts people to work.
\
These reforms will help people get jobs that are open today. But to prepare for the jobs of tomorrow, our commitment to skills and education has to start earlier.
\
For less than one percent of what our Nation spends on education each year, we've convinced nearly every State in the country to raise their standards for teaching and learning - the first time that's happened in a generation.
\
But challenges remain. And we know how to solve them.
\
At a time when other countries are doubling down on education, tight budgets have forced States to lay off thousands of teachers. We know a good teacher can increase the lifetime income of a classroom by over $250,000. A great teacher can offer an escape from poverty to the child who dreams beyond his circumstance. Every person in this chamber can point to a teacher who changed the trajectory of their lives. Most teachers work tirelessly, with modest pay, sometimes digging into their own pocket for school supplies - just to make a difference.
\
Teachers matter. So instead of bashing them, or defending the status quo, let's offer schools a deal. Give them the resources to keep good teachers on the job, and reward the best ones. In return, grant schools flexibility: To teach with creativity and passion; to stop teaching to the test; and to replace teachers who just aren't helping kids learn.
\
We also know that when students aren't allowed to walk away from their education, more of them walk the stage to get their diploma. So tonight, I call on every State to require that all students stay in high school until they graduate or turn eighteen.
\
When kids do graduate, the most daunting challenge can be the cost of college. At a time when Americans owe more in tuition debt than credit card debt, this Congress needs to stop the interest rates on student loans from doubling in July. Extend the tuition tax credit we started that saves middle-class families thousands of dollars. And give more young people the chance to earn their way through college by doubling the number of work-study jobs in the next five years.
\
Of course, it's not enough for us to increase student aid. We can't just keep subsidizing skyrocketing tuition; we'll run out of money. States also need to do their part, by making higher education a higher priority in their budgets. And colleges and universities have to do their part by working to keep costs down. Recently, I spoke with a group of college presidents who've done just that. Some schools re-design courses to help students finish more quickly. Some use better technology. The point is, it's possible. So let me put colleges and universities on notice: If you can't stop tuition from going up, the funding you get from taxpayers will go down. Higher education can't be a luxury - it's an economic imperative that every family in America should be able to afford.
\
Let's also remember that hundreds of thousands of talented, hardworking students in this country face another challenge: The fact that they aren't yet American citizens. Many were brought here as small children, are American through and through, yet they live every day with the threat of deportation. Others came more recently, to study business and science and engineering, but as soon as they get their degree, we send them home to invent new products and create new jobs somewhere else.
\
That doesn't make sense.
\
I believe as strongly as ever that we should take on illegal immigration. That's why my Administration has put more boots on the border than ever before. That's why there are fewer illegal crossings than when I took office.
\
The opponents of action are out of excuses. We should be working on comprehensive immigration reform right now. But if election-year politics keeps Congress from acting on a comprehensive plan, let's at least agree to stop expelling responsible young people who want to staff our labs, start new businesses, and defend this country. Send me a law that gives them the chance to earn their citizenship. I will sign it right away.
\
You see, an economy built to last is one where we encourage the talent and ingenuity of every person in this country. That means women should earn equal pay for equal work. It means we should support everyone who's willing to work; and every risk-taker and entrepreneur who aspires to become the next Steve Jobs.
\
After all, innovation is what America has always been about. Most new jobs are created in start-ups and small businesses. So let's pass an agenda that helps them succeed. Tear down regulations that prevent aspiring entrepreneurs from getting the financing to grow. Expand tax relief to small businesses that are raising wages and creating good jobs. Both parties agree on these ideas. So put them in a bill, and get it on my desk this year.
\
Innovation also demands basic research. Today, the discoveries taking place in our federally-financed labs and universities could lead to new treatments that kill cancer cells but leave healthy ones untouched. New lightweight vests for cops and soldiers that can stop any bullet. Don't gut these investments in our budget. Don't let other countries win the race for the future. Support the same kind of research and innovation that led to the computer chip and the Internet; to new American jobs and new American industries.
\
Nowhere is the promise of innovation greater than in American-made energy. Over the last three years, we've opened millions of new acres for oil and gas exploration, and tonight, I'm directing my Administration to open more than 75 percent of our potential offshore oil and gas resources. Right now, American oil production is the highest that it's been in eight years. That's right - eight years. Not only that - last year, we relied less on foreign oil than in any of the past sixteen years.
\
But with only 2 percent of the world's oil reserves, oil isn't enough. This country needs an all-out, all-of-the-above strategy that develops every available source of American energy - a strategy that's cleaner, cheaper, and full of new jobs.
\
We have a supply of natural gas that can last America nearly one hundred years, and my Administration will take every possible action to safely develop this energy. Experts believe this will support more than 600,000 jobs by the end of the decade. And I'm requiring all companies that drill for gas on public lands to disclose the chemicals they use. America will develop this resource without putting the health and safety of our citizens at risk.
\
The development of natural gas will create jobs and power trucks and factories that are cleaner and cheaper, proving that we don't have to choose between our environment and our economy. And by the way, it was public research dollars, over the course of thirty years, that helped develop the technologies to extract all this natural gas out of shale rock - reminding us that Government support is critical in helping businesses get new energy ideas off the ground.
\
What's true for natural gas is true for clean energy. In three years, our partnership with the private sector has already positioned America to be the world's leading manufacturer of high-tech batteries. Because of federal investments, renewable energy use has nearly doubled. And thousands of Americans have jobs because of it.
\
When Bryan Ritterby was laid off from his job making furniture, he said he worried that at 55, no one would give him a second chance. But he found work at Energetx, a wind turbine manufacturer in Michigan. Before the recession, the factory only made luxury yachts. Today, it's hiring workers like Bryan, who said, ""I'm proud to be working in the industry of the future.""
\
Our experience with shale gas shows us that the payoffs on these public investments don't always come right away. Some technologies don't pan out; some companies fail. But I will not walk away from the promise of clean energy. I will not walk away from workers like Bryan. I will not cede the wind or solar or battery industry to China or Germany because we refuse to make the same commitment here. We have subsidized oil companies for a century. That's long enough. It's time to end the taxpayer giveaways to an industry that's rarely been more profitable, and double-down on a clean energy industry that's never been more promising. Pass clean energy tax credits and create these jobs.
\
We can also spur energy innovation with new incentives. The differences in this chamber may be too deep right now to pass a comprehensive plan to fight climate change. But there's no reason why Congress shouldn't at least set a clean energy standard that creates a market for innovation. So far, you haven't acted. Well tonight, I will. I'm directing my Administration to allow the development of clean energy on enough public land to power three million homes. And I'm proud to announce that the Department of Defense, the world's largest consumer of energy, will make one of the largest commitments to clean energy in history - with the Navy purchasing enough capacity to power a quarter of a million homes a year.
\
Of course, the easiest way to save money is to waste less energy. So here's another proposal: Help manufacturers eliminate energy waste in their factories and give businesses incentives to upgrade their buildings. Their energy bills will be $100 billion lower over the next decade, and America will have less pollution, more manufacturing, and more jobs for construction workers who need them. Send me a bill that creates these jobs.
\
Building this new energy future should be just one part of a broader agenda to repair America's infrastructure. So much of America needs to be rebuilt. We've got crumbling roads and bridges. A power grid that wastes too much energy. An incomplete high-speed broadband network that prevents a small business owner in rural America from selling her products all over the world.
\
During the Great Depression, America built the Hoover Dam and the Golden Gate Bridge. After World War II, we connected our States with a system of highways. Democratic and Republican administrations invested in great projects that benefited everybody, from the workers who built them to the businesses that still use them today.
\
In the next few weeks, I will sign an Executive Order clearing away the red tape that slows down too many construction projects. But you need to fund these projects. Take the money we're no longer spending at war, use half of it to pay down our debt, and use the rest to do some nation-building right here at home.
\
There's never been a better time to build, especially since the construction industry was one of the hardest-hit when the housing bubble burst. Of course, construction workers weren't the only ones hurt. So were millions of innocent Americans who've seen their home values decline. And while Government can't fix the problem on its own, responsible homeowners shouldn't have to sit and wait for the housing market to hit bottom to get some relief.
\
That's why I'm sending this Congress a plan that gives every responsible homeowner the chance to save about $3,000 a year on their mortgage, by refinancing at historically low interest rates. No more red tape. No more runaround from the banks. A small fee on the largest financial institutions will ensure that it won't add to the deficit, and will give banks that were rescued by taxpayers a chance to repay a deficit of trust.
\
Let's never forget: Millions of Americans who work hard and play by the rules every day deserve a Government and a financial system that do the same. It's time to apply the same rules from top to bottom: No bailouts, no handouts, and no copouts. An America built to last insists on responsibility from everybody.
\
We've all paid the price for lenders who sold mortgages to people who couldn't afford them, and buyers who knew they couldn't afford them. That's why we need smart regulations to prevent irresponsible behavior. Rules to prevent financial fraud, or toxic dumping, or faulty medical devices, don't destroy the free market. They make the free market work better.
\
There is no question that some regulations are outdated, unnecessary, or too costly. In fact, I've approved fewer regulations in the first three years of my presidency than my Republican predecessor did in his. I've ordered every federal agency to eliminate rules that don't make sense. We've already announced over 500 reforms, and just a fraction of them will save business and citizens more than $10 billion over the next five years. We got rid of one rule from 40 years ago that could have forced some dairy farmers to spend $10,000 a year proving that they could contain a spill - because milk was somehow classified as an oil. With a rule like that, I guess it was worth crying over spilled milk.
\
I'm confident a farmer can contain a milk spill without a federal agency looking over his shoulder. But I will not back down from making sure an oil company can contain the kind of oil spill we saw in the Gulf two years ago. I will not back down from protecting our kids from mercury pollution, or making sure that our food is safe and our water is clean. I will not go back to the days when health insurance companies had unchecked power to cancel your policy, deny you coverage, or charge women differently from men.
\
And I will not go back to the days when Wall Street was allowed to play by its own set of rules. The new rules we passed restore what should be any financial system's core purpose: Getting funding to entrepreneurs with the best ideas, and getting loans to responsible families who want to buy a home, start a business, or send a kid to college.
\
So if you're a big bank or financial institution, you are no longer allowed to make risky bets with your customers' deposits. You're required to write out a ""living will"" that details exactly how you'll pay the bills if you fail - because the rest of us aren't bailing you out ever again. And if you're a mortgage lender or a payday lender or a credit card company, the days of signing people up for products they can't afford with confusing forms and deceptive practices are over. Today, American consumers finally have a watchdog in Richard Cordray with one job: To look out for them.
\
We will also establish a Financial Crimes Unit of highly trained investigators to crack down on large-scale fraud and protect people's investments. Some financial firms violate major anti-fraud laws because there's no real penalty for being a repeat offender. That's bad for consumers, and it's bad for the vast majority of bankers and financial service professionals who do the right thing. So pass legislation that makes the penalties for fraud count.
\
And tonight, I am asking my Attorney General to create a special unit of federal prosecutors and leading state attorneys general to expand our investigations into the abusive lending and packaging of risky mortgages that led to the housing crisis. This new unit will hold accountable those who broke the law, speed assistance to homeowners, and help turn the page on an era of recklessness that hurt so many Americans.
\
A return to the American values of fair play and shared responsibility will help us protect our people and our economy. But it should also guide us as we look to pay down our debt and invest in our future.
\
Right now, our most immediate priority is stopping a tax hike on 160 million working Americans while the recovery is still fragile. People cannot afford losing $40 out of each paycheck this year. There are plenty of ways to get this done. So let's agree right here, right now: No side issues. No drama. Pass the payroll tax cut without delay.
\
When it comes to the deficit, we've already agreed to more than $2 trillion in cuts and savings. But we need to do more, and that means making choices. Right now, we're poised to spend nearly $1 trillion more on what was supposed to be a temporary tax break for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans. Right now, because of loopholes and shelters in the tax code, a quarter of all millionaires pay lower tax rates than millions of middle-class households. Right now, Warren Buffett pays a lower tax rate than his secretary.
\
Do we want to keep these tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans? Or do we want to keep our investments in everything else - like education and medical research; a strong military and care for our veterans? Because if we're serious about paying down our debt, we can't do both.
\
The American people know what the right choice is. So do I. As I told the Speaker this summer, I'm prepared to make more reforms that rein in the long term costs of Medicare and Medicaid, and strengthen Social Security, so long as those programs remain a guarantee of security for seniors.
\
But in return, we need to change our tax code so that people like me, and an awful lot of Members of Congress, pay our fair share of taxes. Tax reform should follow the Buffett rule: If you make more than $1 million a year, you should not pay less than 30 percent in taxes. And my Republican friend Tom Coburn is right: Washington should stop subsidizing millionaires. In fact, if you're earning a million dollars a year, you shouldn't get special tax subsidies or deductions. On the other hand, if you make under $250,000 a year, like 98 percent of American families, your taxes shouldn't go up. You're the ones struggling with rising costs and stagnant wages. You're the ones who need relief.
\
Now, you can call this class warfare all you want. But asking a billionaire to pay at least as much as his secretary in taxes? Most Americans would call that common sense.
\
We don't begrudge financial success in this country. We admire it. When Americans talk about folks like me paying my fair share of taxes, it's not because they envy the rich. It's because they understand that when I get tax breaks I don't need and the country can't afford, it either adds to the deficit, or somebody else has to make up the difference - like a senior on a fixed income; or a student trying to get through school; or a family trying to make ends meet. That's not right. Americans know it's not right. They know that this generation's success is only possible because past generations felt a responsibility to each other, and to their country's future, and they know our way of life will only endure if we feel that same sense of shared responsibility. That's how we'll reduce our deficit. That's an America built to last.
\
I recognize that people watching tonight have differing views about taxes and debt; energy and health care. But no matter what party they belong to, I bet most Americans are thinking the same thing right now: Nothing will get done this year, or next year, or maybe even the year after that, because Washington is broken.
\
Can you blame them for feeling a little cynical?
\
The greatest blow to confidence in our economy last year didn't come from events beyond our control. It came from a debate in Washington over whether the United States would pay its bills or not. Who benefited from that fiasco?
\
I've talked tonight about the deficit of trust between Main Street and Wall Street. But the divide between this city and the rest of the country is at least as bad - and it seems to get worse every year.
\
Some of this has to do with the corrosive influence of money in politics. So together, let's take some steps to fix that. Send me a bill that bans insider trading by Members of Congress, and I will sign it tomorrow. Let's limit any elected official from owning stocks in industries they impact. Let's make sure people who bundle campaign contributions for Congress can't lobby Congress, and vice versa - an idea that has bipartisan support, at least outside of Washington.
\
Some of what's broken has to do with the way Congress does its business these days. A simple majority is no longer enough to get anything - even routine business - passed through the Senate. Neither party has been blameless in these tactics. Now both parties should put an end to it. For starters, I ask the Senate to pass a rule that all judicial and public service nominations receive a simple up or down vote within 90 days.
\
The executive branch also needs to change. Too often, it's inefficient, outdated and remote. That's why I've asked this Congress to grant me the authority to consolidate the federal bureaucracy so that our Government is leaner, quicker, and more responsive to the needs of the American people.
\
Finally, none of these reforms can happen unless we also lower the temperature in this town. We need to end the notion that the two parties must be locked in a perpetual campaign of mutual destruction; that politics is about clinging to rigid ideologies instead of building consensus around common sense ideas.
\
I'm a Democrat. But I believe what Republican Abraham Lincoln believed: That Government should do for people only what they cannot do better by themselves, and no more. That's why my education reform offers more competition, and more control for schools and States. That's why we're getting rid of regulations that don't work. That's why our health care law relies on a reformed private market, not a Government program.
\
On the other hand, even my Republican friends who complain the most about Government spending have supported federally-financed roads, and clean energy projects, and federal offices for the folks back home.
\
The point is, we should all want a smarter, more effective Government. And while we may not be able to bridge our biggest philosophical differences this year, we can make real progress. With or without this Congress, I will keep taking actions that help the economy grow. But I can do a whole lot more with your help. Because when we act together, there is nothing the United States of America can't achieve.
\
That is the lesson we've learned from our actions abroad over the last few years.
\
Ending the Iraq war has allowed us to strike decisive blows against our enemies. From Pakistan to Yemen, the al Qaeda operatives who remain are scrambling, knowing that they can't escape the reach of the United States of America.
\
From this position of strength, we've begun to wind down the war in Afghanistan. Ten thousand of our troops have come home. Twenty-three thousand more will leave by the end of this summer. This transition to Afghan lead will continue, and we will build an enduring partnership with Afghanistan, so that it is never again a source of attacks against America.
\
As the tide of war recedes, a wave of change has washed across the Middle East and North Africa, from Tunis to Cairo; from Sana'a to Tripoli. A year ago, Qadhafi was one of the world's longest-serving dictators - a murderer with American blood on his hands. Today, he is gone. And in Syria, I have no doubt that the Assad regime will soon discover that the forces of change can't be reversed, and that human dignity can't be denied.
\
How this incredible transformation will end remains uncertain. But we have a huge stake in the outcome. And while it is ultimately up to the people of the region to decide their fate, we will advocate for those values that have served our own country so well. We will stand against violence and intimidation. We will stand for the rights and dignity of all human beings - men and women; Christians, Muslims, and Jews. We will support policies that lead to strong and stable democracies and open markets, because tyranny is no match for liberty.
\
And we will safeguard America's own security against those who threaten our citizens, our friends, and our interests. Look at Iran. Through the power of our diplomacy, a world that was once divided about how to deal with Iran's nuclear program now stands as one. The regime is more isolated than ever before; its leaders are faced with crippling sanctions, and as long as they shirk their responsibilities, this pressure will not relent. Let there be no doubt: America is determined to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, and I will take no options off the table to achieve that goal. But a peaceful resolution of this issue is still possible, and far better, and if Iran changes course and meets its obligations, it can rejoin the community of nations.
\
The renewal of American leadership can be felt across the globe. Our oldest alliances in Europe and Asia are stronger than ever. Our ties to the Americas are deeper. Our iron-clad commitment to Israel's security has meant the closest military cooperation between our two countries in history. We've made it clear that America is a Pacific power, and a new beginning in Burma has lit a new hope. From the coalitions we've built to secure nuclear materials, to the missions we've led against hunger and disease; from the blows we've dealt to our enemies; to the enduring power of our moral example, America is back.
\
Anyone who tells you otherwise, anyone who tells you that America is in decline or that our influence has waned, doesn't know what they're talking about. That's not the message we get from leaders around the world, all of whom are eager to work with us. That's not how people feel from Tokyo to Berlin; from Cape Town to Rio; where opinions of America are higher than they've been in years. Yes, the world is changing; no, we can't control every event. But America remains the one indispensable nation in world affairs - and as long as I'm President, I intend to keep it that way.
\
That's why, working with our military leaders, I have proposed a new defense strategy that ensures we maintain the finest military in the world, while saving nearly half a trillion dollars in our budget. To stay one step ahead of our adversaries, I have already sent this Congress legislation that will secure our country from the growing danger of cyber-threats.
\
Above all, our freedom endures because of the men and women in uniform who defend it. As they come home, we must serve them as well as they served us. That includes giving them the care and benefits they have earned - which is why we've increased annual VA spending every year I've been President. And it means enlisting our veterans in the work of rebuilding our Nation.
\
With the bipartisan support of this Congress, we are providing new tax credits to companies that hire vets. Michelle and Jill Biden have worked with American businesses to secure a pledge of 135,000 jobs for veterans and their families. And tonight, I'm proposing a Veterans Job Corps that will help our communities hire veterans as cops and firefighters, so that America is as strong as those who defend her.
\
Which brings me back to where I began. Those of us who've been sent here to serve can learn from the service of our troops. When you put on that uniform, it doesn't matter if you're black or white; Asian or Latino; conservative or liberal; rich or poor; gay or straight. When you're marching into battle, you look out for the person next to you, or the mission fails. When you're in the thick of the fight, you rise or fall as one unit, serving one Nation, leaving no one behind.One of my proudest possessions is the flag that the SEAL Team took with them on the mission to get bin Laden. On it are each of their names. Some may be Democrats. Some may be Republicans. But that doesn't matter. Just like it didn't matter that day in the Situation Room, when I sat next to Bob Gates - a man who was George Bush's defense secretary; and Hillary Clinton, a woman who ran against me for president.
\
All that mattered that day was the mission. No one thought about politics. No one thought about themselves. One of the young men involved in the raid later told me that he didn't deserve credit for the mission. It only succeeded, he said, because every single member of that unit did their job - the pilot who landed the helicopter that spun out of control; the translator who kept others from entering the compound; the troops who separated the women and children from the fight; the SEALs who charged up the stairs. More than that, the mission only succeeded because every member of that unit trusted each other - because you can't charge up those stairs, into darkness and danger, unless you know that there's someone behind you, watching your back.
\
So it is with America. Each time I look at that flag, I'm reminded that our destiny is stitched together like those fifty stars and those thirteen stripes. No one built this country on their own. This Nation is great because we built it together. This Nation is great because we worked as a team. This Nation is great because we get each other's backs. And if we hold fast to that truth, in this moment of trial, there is no challenge too great; no mission too hard. As long as we're joined in common purpose, as long as we maintain our common resolve, our journey moves forward, our future is hopeful, and the state of our Union will always be strong.
\
Thank you, God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America.

404," I enjoyed ""The Paper"" and Marylynn Uricchio's review of it ("" 'The Paper' Delivers,"" Weekend Magazine, March 25), and it got me thinking.\ It's true that editors don't hit the streets with their reporters to run down quotes, but when issues like telling the truth confront them, people will do extraordinary things. The point of the story was to present the characters with such an issue (""This paper has done a lot of things, but it's never deliberately gotten the story wrong."") and to model a response that will guide and inspire us.\ The New York Sun is a metaphor for Pittsburgh and the truth it's faced with: a regional economy that could be competitive if not the envy of many, but it's neither. And the reason is us.\ Downtown, the Mon Valley, business and labor, the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, West Virginia University, various civic groups and agencies have conflicting visions, divided loyalties and squabbles over turf. We watch Cleveland, of all places, beat the economic pants off us! Then there's the guy in the street, christening every sign of initiative with a heavy dose of pessimism.\ If actor Michael Keaton's character could go to extraordinary lengths to make the Sun tell the truth in the movie, we can do as much.\ We can stop undercutting one another and work together. And, you know, there is ""a little bit of Iron in all of us"" all the way to Cumberland, Md., and Elkins, Buckhannon and Weston, W.Va. People there plug for the Pens, they watch KDKA and they can't fly anywhere without going to Pittsburgh International Airport.\ There are a lot more ""Pittsburghers"" around than what you'll find in Three Rivers Stadium. They have a lot to offer and they want to do their part.\ The truth is Pittsburgh hasn't risen to the challenge yet. But we do have a Michael Keaton, and he's doing something extraordinary. He's Robert Mehrabian, president of CMU.\ Mr. Mehrabian is rounding all of us up clear down to places like Garrett County, Md., Morgantown, Fairmont and Clarksburg, W.Va., and Waynesburg and Uniontown, getting us to focus on the issues, getting us to cut out the turf stuff and look at what Cleveland and Columbus are accomplishing that we're not.\ DAVID C. HARRISON\ Morgantown, W.Va.\ ------\ LETTERS TO THE EDITOR\ Monorail to airport\ If our Allegheny County commissioners had any brains they would have started to build a monorail to the Pittsburgh International Airport when they started to build the airport. That way they would have been finished at the same time. Now we have five to 10 years to wait for a rail system to the airport.\ Our government officials, both federal and local, can't get it into their heads that rail transportation is the best system. It's used all over Europe with great success. Let's rebuild the rail system we once had.\ We could run a monorail from Downtown to the airport and have a few stations in between so our suburbanites could use it daily. Put it on stilts to eliminate the road-bed upkeep.\ BILL MARTIN\ Mount Washington\ ------\ LETTERS TO THE EDITOR\ A bean-counter\ Criticism of Pittsburgh's tuition-reimbursement policies by City Controller Tom Flaherty marvelously illustrates the mindset of the bean-counter (""After City Pays Tuition, Grads Leave for New Jobs,"" March 29).\ Mr. Flaherty agonizes that 20 percent of those reimbursed have left the employ of the city. He seems to miss the point that 80 percent who remain on the job are better educated, better qualified and are quite probably doing a better job.\ Tuition reimbursement is an incentive to employment and an integral part of programs to promote from within. Most businesses offer tuition reimbursement to their employees with no strings attached, but Mr. Flaherty would have such employees legally bound to continue their employment with the city for a specified term. I cannot address the legal aspects of such an approach, but it certainly smacks of medieval bondage.\ Pittsburgh is to be commended for having a tuition-reimbursement policy, and city managers should resist attempts by the controller to impose guidelines on allowable courses or to mandate continued employment. Such policies should be left to the collective wisdom of the management team who can look beyond the short-term costs and focus on the long-term benefits to the city.\ KEITH H. SUEKER\ Penn Hills\ ------\ LETTERS TO THE EDITOR\ An eye on North Korea\ The United States and the United Nations cannot afford to wait and let North Korea make the first move. We need to make it known that any threats on its part toward South Korea or the United States will be viewed as a direct attack on the United States.\ I, like many, hope that this situation does not turn into a bloody conflict, but the United States should continue to utilize Ronald Reagan's peace through strength strategy.\ FRANK M. McELROY\ Monroeville\ ------\ LETTERS TO THE EDITOR\ Forcing box owners to buy stadium food isn't wise\ The first official act by the new chairman of the Stadium Authority, Mark Schneider, is a doozy (""Food Policy Spurs Stadium Rhubarb,"" March 29).\ I feel the box owners are already contributing to the city by entertaining at sporting events. The Pirates have had a hard time drawing audiences for their games. Who attends these games? The die-hard fans and people who are entertaining guests. The box owners are already paying for the use of the box and now they have to pay for stadium food and beverage?\ First, most of the boxes have caterers who have business throughout the city. If you take away their business in boxes, you are depriving them of future business by eliminating ""word of mouth"" advertising.\ Second, many box owners donate their boxes to charities to use in auctions or other fund-raising events. If you start charging them for stadium food and beverages, they may cut back on access to the boxes; hence, less money for charities and less money for programs to help Pittsburgh residents in need.\ I hope that Mr. Schneider thoroughly researched this decision. The ripple effect it has on the community is devastating. Sure, it helps the stadium concessionaires, but I am sure they do just fine without the box business.\ SARAH R. REED\ Aspinwall\ ------\ LETTERS TO THE EDITOR\ Demand-side management won't preclude building power stations\ DAVID D. MARSHALL\ Executive Vice President\ Duquesne Light Co.\ Downtown\ Demand-side management adds a conservation-based approach to energy planning, and it can be an important tool for meeting electric customers' needs on a least-cost basis.\ However, your story ""Electric Utilities Decide to Boost Conservation"" (March 13) presented demand-side management as an option that will preclude the need for utilities to build power stations or transmission lines in the future. This is simply not the case.\ Thirty-four states have added demand-side management to rate-based energy supply options. However, the results in terms of actual supplies delivered to customers at a reasonable cost have been mixed. That's why utilities in all states with demand-side management programs continue to build power stations and transmission lines. That's why, while planning to use demand-side management, every utility in Pennsylvania also plans to build power stations and/or transmission lines in the years ahead.\ Duquesne Light filed the first Pennsylvania utility plan for demand-side management with the Public Utility Commission in 1991 and supports it. Looking at demand-side management is a routine part of Duquesne Light's least cost planning process. And across the United States, virtually all electric utilities are adding demand-side management to available options for energy supplies. This is a good thing. But it is no panacea.\ Nationally, the forecast need for additions to our nation's current electric supply by the year 2010 is 210 gigawatts. Demand-side management will only provide a fraction of that need. For example, in Pennsylvania, by 2010, customers' needs for power supply are forecast to grow from current levels by 6,600 megawatts. However, demand-side management is forecast to provide only 850 megawatts of that need. Demand-side management thus represents a 13 percent solution.\ As a nation, our public policymaking on energy issues is susceptible to big swings in opinion. Yet, if we have learned anything, it is not to put all of our eggs in one basket. Thus, I was very disappointed by the cheap shot in your story about our nuclear power plants that were planned nearly 20 years ago. This issue is history. It was settled and is irrelevant to the demand-side management discussion because everyone knows that Duquesne Light has no plans to build any more nuclear power plants.\ Demand-side management was not an option 20 years ago when regulators were pressing utility companies to build environmentally clean nuclear power stations as a response to the famous New York City blackout and the oil and natural gas shortages of the 1970s. And while nuclear power has added to the cost of electric power supplies in our country, it does not provide the only reason to explain Duquesne Light's present rates.\ Duquesne Light is one of the cleanest utilities in the United States, and our people are proud of the company's investment in the region's environment. The cost of clean air is reflected in our rates. We also serve a major metropolitan area with one of the highest levels of service in Pennsylvania.\ It was not an accident that our customers continued to receive vital electric service when most of the rest of Pennsylvania endured blackouts this winter.\ Finally, the loss of 25 percent of our sales to customers when Pittsburgh's heavy industry collapsed in the 1980s continues to have an impact on rates. Even with this context, Duquesne Light's rates also compare reasonably to those in other major metropolitan regions of the Northeast.\ Neighboring rural utility systems with much lower service reliability are often used as an unfavorable point of comparison for our rates. Yet we see electric customers on rural systems suffering long interruptions in service and sometimes forced to seek protection in public shelters.\ And while customers on rural systems are just starting to pay for clean air with rates that are going up, our rates are coming down with an average 8.5 percent reduction that began for Duquesne Light customers this month."
405,"
Everyday, Pennsylvania's citizens waste millions of dollars consuming unnecessary electricity while needlessly contributing to global warming, acid rain and other forms of air pollution.
\
Why is this happening? Because the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PUC), the state agency that regulates electric utilities, has not yet taken steps that would encourage Pennsylvania's utilities to help their customers save money while protecting the environment in the same way that other states have done successfully.
\
But there is a way to change this situation. The Pennsylvania PUC is currently considering proposed changes in its rate-making system that would encourage the state's utilities to make significant investment in energy efficiency programs.
\
The objective of the proposed changes is to provide incentives for electric utilities to implement large-scale conservation programs that would reduce both customers' energy bills and environmental pollution created by the generation of electricity.
\
Similar regulatory changes have been made by public utility commissions in other parts of the country including California, the Pacific Northwest, New England and New York with pronounced economic and environmental benefits.
\
Utilities in these states are as a result investing between three and five percent of their total revenues to promote energy efficiency. Pennsylvania utilities are spending only about four-tenths of one percent of revenue annually - or $45 million dollars statewide - on such efforts, which are called demand side management (DSM) programs.
\
DSM programs involve a systematic effort by utility companies to encourage reduced electricity consumption and customer savings through conservation. These programs typically include energy audits of homes and commercial buildings, rebates on the purchase of energy-efficient light bulbs and appliances, the installation of high-efficiency equipment in commercial and industrial spaces, and technical assistance to builders so they invest in energy efficient materials and appliances when they construct new buildings.
\
In the last few years, utilities like Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison in California, Puget Sound Power and Light in Washington State and New England Electric Systems in the Northeast have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in these programs as a way to help their customers meet a substantial portion of their future energy requirements.
\
The potential benefits of these programs to the public and the nation as a whole are enormous. The Electric Power Research Institute, the electric utility industry's think tank, estimates that by using readily available technologies the nation could reduce its future electricity demand by twenty- four to forty-four percent - with no sacrifice in comfort or convenience.
\
The savings gained through the widespread use of these technologies translates into very tangible economic and environmental benefits. By reducing consumption, customers' electricity bills go down as does the cost of industrial production, allowing for greater consumer savings and increased competitiveness in the national and international marketplace.
\
Moreover, energy conservation reduces our consumption of fossil fuels such as coal and oil which, when burned to produce electricity, emit large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere which is the primary cause of global warming.
\
So why, given the availability of proven efficiency technologies and the demonstrated economic and environmental benefits of energy conservation, isn't Pennsylvania moving forward to implement aggressive energy efficiency programs?
\
The primary reason is that Pennsylvania's regulatory policies do not provide incentives for utilities to do so. Under the present regulatory system, utility companies make money for every kilowatt-hour of energy they sell, and lose money for every kilowatt-hour that's conserved (i.e., not sold). The industry's current emphasis on selling more electricity is merely a rational corporate response to the signals which they receive from the regulatory process.
\
However there is a way to change these signals. By instituting a new rate recovery system that rewards utilities for conserving energy and allows them to recover lost revenues and the costs of undertaking DSM programs, utilities can earn as much by saving electricity as they can from selling it. Maybe a little more.
\
Changing the rate formula produces immediate and significant results. In New England, for example, new regulatory structures led to energy savings in 1990 alone that equalled what a town of 100,000 people would normally consume - the equivalent of the energy produced by a medium-sized coal plant.
\
John Rowe, the CEO of New England Electric, the region's largest utility, has said that the revised rate formula transformed energy conservation ""from the most controversial expenditure I could make into my most profitable investment.""
\
By replicating the innovative regulatory structures that have been put in place by forward-looking utility commissions in New England and other parts of the country, the Pennsylvania PUC can break the link between electricity sales and utility profits, and help transform Pennsylvania's utilities from electricity producers to energy service providers.
\
Demand side management is an example of an innovative way to meet our energy needs where everyone wins: Utilities make money, consumers' electric bills go down, and the environment benefits.

"
406,"William G. Karis is an executive vice president for the CONSOL Coal Group.\ For three weeks in January, we were reminded how quickly mankind's sophisticated systems can be disrupted when confronted by the titanic forces of nature. Earthquakes, heavy snows and record cold made conducting the day-to-day affairs of life quite a challenge.\ In the East, businesses were asked to limit power consumption, or worse, to close altogether when the Arctic air arrived. At home, people were asked to lower their thermostats to 60 degrees and to forgo using electric appliances. Cold cereal and milk were to replace hot coffee and toast at the breakfast table. Even the federal government in Washington, always ready to respond to a crisis, shut down for a day to conserve electricity!\ The situation occurred because many electric utility systems didn't have sufficient reserve capacity to meet the increased demand while compensating at the same time for unplanned equipment problems that inevitably accompany cold weather.\ Ordinarily, if a utility is short of power, it buys power from neighboring utilities through the interconnected electricity grid. But there was not much to be bought during the January freeze, and the grid itself was at near capacity. The whole system was stretched nearly to its limits.\ Despite the severe operating problems they faced, the electric utilities managed the situation competently. Despite difficult transportation conditions, coal, gas and oil suppliers managed to keep their products moving so that fuel was available to nearly every generation station.\ Moderating temperatures in the East over the next few weeks will allow the system to recover and for life to return to normal. But the January freeze showed dramatically how critical electricity is to a modern society and how difficult life can become when it is not available.\ Shortages of electricity are not just an inconvenience. Shortages impact the economy. Businesses shut their doors; sales are lost; profits shrink; people lose wages. The effects of an event like this ripple through the economy like a fiscal aftershock.\ So who's to blame for the shortages? What caused the system to run so close to the edge of collapse? The calls for hearings and investigations already are being heard in state legislatures, public-utility commissions and energy planning agencies. Ironically, these are the very people whose policy decisions the last few years have placed the system in this precarious situation.\ Earl Dille, chairman of the North American Electric Reliability Council wrote in his 1992 annual report, ""We are starting to assume that reliability will always be with us. We knew back in the late 1960s that reliability was something we had to work at to develop and maintain. It was something we could not take for granted. We should not have to learn that lesson again.""\ Sadly, the policy decisions being made these days by public-utility commissions, state energy planners and legislatures show little evidence of a lesson learned. Conservation and demand-side management have become virtually the sole means by which we are expected to respond to the inevitable growth in power demand and consumption. Utilities are instructed to postpone construction and to convince customers not to use the electricity the utility is in the business to sell!\ These are policies being adopted in state after state despite recent estimates by the U.S. Department of Energy that a substantial amount of new generating capacity must be built by the year 2010 to meet the demands for electricity. The department estimated as many as 170 new coal-fired power plants and hundreds of new coal mines would need to be built.\ Even if some construction project actually is proposed, the chances are good that it will become hopelessly embroiled in the regulatory web that allows any small group of naysayers to bring needed projects to a halt.\ The usual arguments will be heard. The project is unsafe. It will harm the environment. The capacity isn't needed. We can meet our future electricity needs by installing energy-saving devices or by learning to do with less. The idea that we can conserve our way to an energy surplus makes about as much sense as solving hunger in America by enrolling hungry people in Weight Watchers. The plain facts are that as the population and the economy grow, we inevitably will be faced with the need to build power plants, even as we institute conservation measures.\ In recent years, those who oppose building new energy facilities have had the easier side of the debate to argue. It was hard to convince the public that construction was needed to protect the reliability of the electricity system when most people have never known a time when electricity was not reliable. The naysayers always seemed to win.\ The January freeze was not a failure of our electric-utility system. The system survived in the face of circumstances that may occur once in 100 years. But mark the date of the freeze down on your calendar because it was important nevertheless. The freeze highlighted the dangers of failing to continue to build sufficient reserve capacity into our electricity generation and distribution system in a timely fashion. Demand will rise. Without sufficient reserve capacity in place, the events of January will be repeated over and over again, only it won't require catastrophic events to trigger them.\ At least now people may have a taste of what that might be like. Now they may have a better feel for what's at stake in the debate. And now they may demand a higher burden of proof from those who argue that new plant capacity is not needed.\ Seems like a perfect time to reopen the debate on building new power plants. I'll argue the affirmative case."

If there is a great lament at the Pew Charitable Trusts, the Philadelphia-based $3.8 billion philanthropy, it is this: So little money, so much to do.
\
Poverty. Disease. Distress of all kinds. Where should the money go?
\
``Our resources are really very small,'' allows Rebecca Rimel, foundation president.
\
Those small resources, though, can be focused, and Pew does not shy from doing just that. In fact, in recent years the foundation has sought to expand the influence of its grant-making, in an effort to become a national force on issues of social welfare, health care, the environment, education, community development and culture. By carefully targeting large grants, the foundation increases its impact and opens a field to test its ideas.
\
Much of this grant-making takes place within a historic framework of charitable giving. Instead of funding soup kitchens, however, Pew might seek to jump-start the city's tourism industry in the hope of creating jobs.
\
But a significant amount of funding, particularly on a national level, is going into new and unusual areas - for the use, even, of private for-profit companies; and not a little funding has provoked political controversy and generated serious questions about the nature and obligations of philanthropic foundations in contemporary America.
\
What part should the private sector play in funding public programs? What influence should the public exercise in determining the direction of privately funded social programs? Should a foundation control independent operating units to promote foundation goals and dispense foundation money?
\
Should a nonprofit, private foundation make even indirect funding available to for-profit groups, such as media organizations and electric utilities? What standards of accountability should a foundation adhere to when it funds programs with a potentially broad public impact?
\
Who is watching the funders?
\
There are no clear answers to any of these questions.
\
Consider the environment.
\
In the last 10 years, Pew has become the most active private funder of environmental and conservation organizations in the country, awarding $19.7 million last year to various groups.
\
A substantial portion of the funding went to organizations that Pew founded in the last few years, or in which it maintains a powerful interest as a key funder, including these Washington-based groups:
\
* Earth Force, which seeks to harness the ecological fervor of children.
\
* The Environmental Information Center, a media and lobbying operation.
\
* Environmental Strategies Inc., a national policy and public relations group.
\
Pew officials say these new organizations seek to consolidate the activities of numerous groups and to focus attention on what foundation officials have determined are neglected concerns, particularly in the area of marketing.
\
Critics argue that such organizations siphon money and effort from established groups. The net effect, they maintain, is that Pew, in concert with other large philanthropies such as the W. Alton Jones and Rockefeller Foundations, has undermined longtime environmental activists.
\
In the summer of 1995, for instance, Pew became entangled in a dispute involving the Endangered Species Act Coalition, a group of national and regional organizations trying to shield the wildlife legislation from congressional attack.
\
According to several sources, Pew shifted its financial support away from the coalition and toward the Environmental Information Center - which it created. The coalition subsequently fell into disarray after failing in its efforts to renew the Endangered Species Act.
\
This rift was viewed with a dismay bordering on despair by some environmentalists.
\
``One thing seems clear - Pew has manipulated and controlled this coalition to accomplish a preconceived agenda,'' Sam Hitt, executive director of the Santa Fe, N.M.-based Forest Guardians, wrote in an anguished memo to other environmentalists in September 1995. Hitt believes Pew wanted the Environmental Information Center to handle media campaigns on the endangered-species issue, and muscled the coalition aside, leading to confusion, bad feeling and a failed effort.
\
``In effect,'' Hitt wrote, ``Pew has used its money like a blunt instrument to destroy a web of relationships that is finally working to save [the Endangered Species Act] from political death. The major issue here is power and control.''
\
In the Pacific Northwest, activists make similar allegations, contending that the power of money - largely Pew money - has undermined opposition to logging on public land by promoting compromise with logging interests. A number of national environmental groups, such as the Pew-funded Sierra Club, have also been riven as a result, with local members categorically opposed to logging pitted against leaders favoring Pew-backed compromise approaches.
\
Pew officials argue that their environmental support goes into strategies designed to succeed.
\
``We are going to have to work toward accommodation, which is probably a more palatable word than compromise,'' said Pew president Rimel. ``So I can see why some of the grassroots groups in the environment may feel like it's a cop-out, or it's not pushing as hard as it should be on the polluters, the loggers or whatever.
\
``There is also strategy. Do you take your resources and spread them in among a lot of smaller grassroots organizations? Or do you go for the top-down approach, working at the national level for regulatory reform or advocacy or public education to really change public opinion on a matter?''
\
Tim Hermach, head of the Eugene, Ore.-based Native Forest Council, said that opinion has changed in Oregon on the issue of stopping all logging on public land.
\
``We had a 100-member zero-cut coalition when Pew started up their national forest campaign a few years ago,'' Hermach said, referring to a coalition opposed to any and all logging on public land. ``There was a meeting in Washington and [Pew officials] said Pew was interested in funding reform, not revolution. They said they would fund whatever the environmental movement wanted, but they tried to prejudice everyone against zero-cut by offering money for things they said had some chance of success.
\
``These groups were so hell-bent on getting money, it was: Forget the forest. Getting money is the point.''
\
``What does Pew do?'' asked Charlotte Talberth, executive director of the Levinson Foundation in Santa Fe, which funds environmental organizations in the Southwest. ``They come into a region. They are by far the biggest pot of money anyone has ever seen. They put the pot on the table and then invite the 20 or 30 people they know to come to the table. And everyone tries to figure out what Pew wants them to say.
\
``The main problem with the Pew approach is that it doesn't take into account the hard work and the difficult analysis and the effort that people have put in over a long period of time.''
\
ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAM: UTILITIES It seems like a foolproof idea.
\
With a utility's assistance, a manufacturer modernizes production facilities to improve energy efficiency, saving money by using less electricity and thereby increasing profits.
\
By helping such customers cut electrical use, the utility is rewarded with rate increases, surcharges and credits by state regulators. An efficient manufacturer saves - even with higher rates - because it needs less electricity. In effect, inefficient customers subsidize efficient ones, and overall, less electricity is used, leading to less pollution.
\
In the last few years, the Pew Charitable Trusts has emerged as the largest single backer of such ``demand-side management'' plans in the country, pouring more than $6 million into the efforts. The money serves to promote the idea of utility-backed conservation and to induce utilities and regulators to clamber aboard the effort.
\
Describing the foundation's funding so far, Pew president Rimel says: ``It's a win-win situation.''
\
Except, maybe, for Philadelphia.
\
In 1994, the Northeast-Midwest Institute, a Washington research organization, published an enthusiastic Pew-funded study of a utility conservation effort in the Boston area. The study showed how Boston Edison, using state credits and incentives, worked with the Breyers ice cream plant in Framingham, Mass., helping Breyers reduce costs through energy efficiency.
\
The plant faced possible closure. But thanks to the state- and utility-subsidized renovation, that didn't happen; costs fell, profits increased, and 160 jobs were saved.
\
Yet Unilever, the giant Dutch conglomerate that bought Breyers in the months after the retooling, declined to duplicate the Framingham success. Instead, in 1995, touting Framingham's efficiency and the virtues of consolidation, the company shuttered the Breyers plant in West Philadelphia. About 240 jobs vanished from the city overnight. Retrofitting Philadelphia, the company said, would be too expensive.
\
Net Philadelphia-Boston job loss: 80.
\
``We've found over and over that cost-effective changes simply are not made by manufacturers,'' said Diane DeVaul, director of policy for the Northeast-Midwest Institute. ``A lot of times plants are built, they're state-of-the-art and they're run until they're not profitable and then they're shut down.''
\
Pew money still flows into demand-side programs, despite the fact that in the complex interaction of energy, capital, citizenry and environment, the unexpected and unintended often appears to rule.
\
It is largely because of this pinball effect that some community activists and environmentalists question the wisdom and cost of the foundation's focus on demand-side management. Efficiency programs in eastern Massachusetts can have a devastating impact in West Philadelphia. Who would think?
\
In making the case for their utility work, Pew officials argue that it was an important area largely ignored by the traditional, grassroots environmental movement.
\
``There are now a lot of people wrestling with this,'' said DeVaul of the Northeast-Midwest Institute, which has received about $227,000 directly from Pew. ``There's enormous concern about the environmental impact of energy use, and Pew has been essential in focusing attention.''
\
The work began in earnest in 1991 when Pew joined the Rockefeller Foundation and the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation in establishing a new charitable nonprofit, the San Francisco-based Energy Foundation. Since then, the Energy Foundation, with a $10 million annual budget supplied by the parent foundations, has used money from Pew to back nearly 30 demand-side management projects in as many states, leading to savings for customers large and small and to reduced energy use.
\
Critics, though, concerned about the pinball effect, worry about the unintended consequences of demand-side programs.
\
Consider the plight of residential utility users.
\
Lance Haver, of the Philadelphia Consumers Education and Protective Association, argues that offsetting the costs of conservation with rate increases - a key element in demand-side plans - could severely strain the finances of inner-city and low-income customers, possibly leading to an increase in homelessness. Low-income residents, in particular, may not participate in efficiency programs such as weatherization, he said, because they haven't heard about them, have no time, don't understand them, or simply can't cope. Without the benefit of efficiency savings, the customers wind up with higher and higher bills, he said.
\
It is at this point - where poor people come face to face with their utility bills - that Pew policy has been weakest, Haver contended.
\
Beyond that, Haver and others said, a larger issue looms that will intensify the pinball effect: utility deregulation. No one can say with confidence how that will play out.
\
Hal Harvey, executive director of the Pew-created Energy Foundation, said that every grant recipient is required to address issues affecting low-income and residential customers, although attention to such matters varies considerably from project to project and the foundation has no way to monitor what grant recipients are actually doing.
\
Said Harvey: ``We want to make sure that whatever rules are set up treat people equitably and protect the environment. . . . But if it's not politically realistic, we won't support it. We don't waste our money on quixotic adventures.''
\
Liz Robinson, director of the Energy Coordinating Agency of Philadelphia, a service group, said that attention to low-income customers has been virtually nonexistent here, despite the presence of the Pew-funded Mid-Atlantic Energy Project, which is working on demand-side management programs.
\
``Pew really hasn't done any low-income work,'' Robinson said, noting that the rate of electrical-service termination statewide has been rising for 10 years. ``The problem is that without federal or public support for what the utilities regard as a social issue, without federal money [to cover costs], the utilities will be looking very, very hard to get out of this burden.'' (Officials at the Mid-Atlantic Energy Project said they have been focusing attention on New Jersey, not Pennsylvania.)
\
Beyond the specifics of various programs, several observers wondered whether foundation money should be going into utility efficiency efforts at all.
\
Harvey, of the Energy Foundation, portrays the Pew program as the essence of ``responsible philanthropy.'' The trusts, he said, identified a serious area that virtually everyone else had ignored.
\
Others say that's just the problem, and the money might be better spent elsewhere.
\
``The environmental movement in this country is very sophisticated, very wide-ranging, and has even spurred the world environmental movement, and apparently this environmental movement did not think [utility efficiency] was of pressing significance,'' said Robert Bothwell, executive director of the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy. ``But Pew's attitude is: `We think we know better.' I find that troubling.''
\
CIVIC JOURNALISM What did the President know and when did he know it?
\
That question became a mantra during Watergate, flowing over the airwaves, repeated and analyzed in newspapers and magazines.
\
With good reason. Complex issues of public accountability and responsibility are the media's domain, the ultimate test of responsive and responsible journalism.
\
To meet that test, media organizations, particularly newspapers and news broadcasters, have traditionally sought to keep themselves free of outside influence and ties.
\
It may come as a surprise, then, to learn that Pew has become a force in the sprawling world of journalism, seeking to influence both the form and the substance of the nation's news coverage.
\
Since 1993, the foundation has poured more than $12 million into media activities, more than half going into so-called civic journalism projects. Civic or public journalism, broadly speaking, represents efforts by news organizations to strengthen citizen involvement in public life. Pew president Rimel first became interested in such efforts after hearing about them from James K. Batten, chairman and chief executive of Knight-Ridder, the corporate owner of The Inquirer and Daily News. Batten, who died last year, was a strong supporter of civic journalism, promoting it with colleagues throughout the Knight-Ridder organization.
\
What interested Rimel was the notion that Pew could leverage its own broader attempts to strengthen social and political engagement by funding civic-journalism projects.
\
A flexible concept - some argue, a meaningless one - civic-journalism efforts often attempt to take the public pulse on an issue, using marketing tools such as focus groups and polls to gauge and heighten public interest. Sometimes news organizations bring consultants into newsrooms to handle the logistics of community discussions. Newspapers may get together with broadcasters to hold ``citizen forums,'' with the media involved reporting such events as news.
\
Pew has become a powerful player in this arena. In 1993, the foundation gave $3.6 million to former television news executive Edward Fouhy to establish the Pew Center for Civic Journalism in Washington. The nonprofit center receives money from Pew and makes grants supporting news projects across the nation, such as an effort by North Carolina news outlets to coordinate election coverage this year around issues developed through statewide polls. (Foundations are prohibited by law from making grants to profit-making entities, so Pew cannot fund news organizations directly.)
\
Another large Pew grant has gone to the campaign to wrest free broadcast time for presidential candidates from the major TV networks. Pew has also acquired the Times-Mirror Center for the People and the Press in Washington, a polling operation, which is now the Pew Research Center for People and the Press.
\
``Many American citizens feel disaffected, cynical,'' Rimel said. Some feel a sense of hopelessness or helplessness that they can make any difference in the problems that have beset their communities. Look around at what are the levers to get people reconnected, reengaged, reenergized in their communities and the country. The press and particularly the media come out as clearly some of the most powerful forces to motivate people.''
\
Fouhy's Washington Pew center has funded 34 projects at newspapers and TV and radio stations. Pew center money went to the Charlotte Observer and a trio of North Carolina broadcasters to fund a consultant working on the paper's ``Taking Back Our Neighborhoods'' anticrime project last year. The consultant worked in the newsroom to arrange media events around Charlotte, and set up day-care services and rented halls for public meetings.
\
Earlier this year, in another example, Pew funded an outside coordinator at the Boston Globe to help arrange community meetings in Derry, N.H., as part of the paper's reporting on the presidential campaign. The consultant ``assigned the stories, assembled the people for forums, dealt with polls, worked with the copy desk'' and photo departments, said Globe executive editor Helen Donovan.
\
These projects raise troubling questions for journalists:
\
What differentiates a newspaper or TV station's marketing efforts from attempts to present important community issues?
\
Should the press accept outside funding for editorial content in its pages?
\
Does civic journalism simply hide a continuing failure of the press to do its basic job of informing the public on significant issues?
\
Should news coverage simply follow concerns developed from polls?
\
Critics argue that civic journalism is a corporate response to problems created by corporate control of news operations.
\
``At one point the description [of civic journalism] sounds like good, old-fashioned shoe-leather reporting,'' said Bill Kovach, curator of the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard. ``At another point it sounds like a manager came in and redesigned the newsroom on behalf of the chamber of commerce.''
\
Media corporations, said author and press critic Ben Bagdikian, ``now are accepting foundation and other grants for things they should do on their own.''
\
Fouhy is not insensitive to such criticism. But he says a civic-journalism approach also aims to go beyond reporting on problems simply as conflicts and clashes. News can be presented in other, more constructive ways, he says - the search for solutions can be news, too.
\
On the subject of outside payment, Fouhy contends that no Pew money goes directly into reporting and editing stories. Besides, Pew is in ``the idea business,'' not ``in the profit-making business.''
\
``I wouldn't seek money [for the journalism center] from corporations,'' Fouhy said. ``News organizations have to report on big corporations.''
\
Sometimes news organizations have to report on foundations, too.
\
In March 1995, The Inquirer published a 12-page special section, ``The Peirce Report: Reinventing the Region'' by Neal R. Peirce, as part of an editorial-board project exploring the prospects for cooperation between Philadelphia and its suburbs.
\
According to editor Maxwell E. P. King, The Inquirer applied to the Pew center for project funding but was turned down.
\
``Knight-Ridder was encouraging Knight-Ridder papers to come up with projects that encouraged more public involvement,'' King said, explaining the motivations of editors at the time.
\
Although the paper paid Peirce in full for his work, King said, some of his expenses were apparently paid out of a $50,000 grant from the Foundation for New Era Philanthropy.
\
New Era, which collapsed last year amid allegations it was a Ponzi scheme, had awarded a $50,000 grant to Ted Hershberg's Center for Greater Philadelphia at the University of Pennsylvania. The center co-sponsored the regionalism project, and paid for some of Peirce's work-related activities from the New Era grant.
\
Hershberg also applied for and received $50,000 from Pew after submitting a grant request stating that The Inquirer would provide ``news coverage, editorials, op-eds'' and the Peirce study as part of its project involvement.
\
King, who said he did not know of the foundation grants until the project was underway, argued that Hershberg's grant request improperly suggested that the paper's news and editorial pages would promote the regionalism project.
\
The problems implicit in accepting outside money became all too apparent to King following the collapse of New Era, which The Inquirer covered in detail. In the future, he determined, the paper would not accept outside money for editorial projects of any kind. The Inquirer subsequently sent a check to the New Era bankruptcy trustee to cover Peirce's expenses from the Hershberg grant.
\
Such difficulties have not deterred Pew from civic-journalism projects.
\
Said Rimel: ``If I thought that in any way the trust involvement was impinging on objectivity or on the critically important role of the press, which is basically to champion causes, to celebrate the good guys, and to not celebrate those that aren't acting in the public's interest, in a heartbeat I wouldn't want to be involved.''
\
*
\
In evaluating its programs - whether in media or environment, education or economic development - Pew brings in analysts and consultants. Panels are assembled. Assessments made.
\
``There's a fairly rigorous process here all along the way to monitor and to evaluate,'' Rimel said. ``Clearly, success in some of these situations is in the eye of the beholder.''
\
What direction should art take in America? How should the nation address environmental degradation? How best can Philadelphia survive? What should children learn, and how? What should people read in the newspapers and see on television?
\
Should funding continue? Should a program be dropped? What constitutes success? What is failure?
\
Tough questions. The answers will be determined by many of the same people who launched the programs in the first place.
\
``Saying the nonprofit foundation world will take on the burden to provide . . . is asking a lot,'' said Sanford Hirsch, executive director of the Adolph and Esther Gottlieb Foundation in New York City. ``You know, we want to be the best-educated country in the world, but we don't want to pay for it. We want the best health care in the world, but we don't want to pay for it. These are unrealistic expectations. . . . If the public is not paying and all funding is private, then expect to get out of that funding only what those funders want to see.''

"
408,"PPL Electric Utilities and its New Jersey partner, Public Service Electric & Gas, want permission to build a 500- kilovolt power line through Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area to meet projections of increased electricity demand. The utilities say they have picked the least disruptive path, routing the line along an existing transmission line. Environmentalists contend the new lines will damage the park's environment and aren't necessary. Reporter Scott Kraus interviewed representatives from each side of the issue.\Water Gap route provides best option\Q: Why is a new transmission line needed between Pennsylvania and New Jersey?\A: The 500 kilovolt transmission line system is truly the backbone of the power grid, and the grid operator has analyzed the system and forecasts there would be overloads on existing lines beginning in 2012 without a new power line. They say this line is needed for the reliability of the regional transmission system in the years to come. It is as simple as that. They originally called for the project in 2007; they did re-evaluate the project and affirm its need in October 2009.\Q: Why this particular path, through the Delaware Water Gap National Recreational Area?\A: When the two utilities started to evaluate potential routes, we looked at numerous options. Those options were evaluated based on local concerns, the state review process and federal agency review criteria, which can be done from a technical and economic perspective and which would have the least impact on the environment. The chosen route meets those criteria. It is the route that has the least impact on the community and the environment. The other routes that have been suggested or proposed would call for the clearing of many more trees, in one case 500 acres of additional tree clearing. The preferred route has 90 percent of the right of way where transmission lines already exist, where clearance is not necessary. Why are we crossing through federal lands? An existing line, 230kv, already crosses the Park Service land. It was built back in 1927, predating the Delaware River Water Gap.\Q: Critics say the new line will harm parks, vegetation and wildlife. What about that?\A: One of the objectives of the Park Service review is to identify environmental concerns and then work with the applicants -- in this case the utilities -- in developing a mitigation plan. PPL and PSE&G are very committed to completing this project in such a way that would strike a balance and ensure we can upgrade the regional power grid and provide greater electricity reliability and at the same time protect the environment. We are working with the Park Service on a conservation strategy. The construction schedule could take into account bird migration. Concerns about wetlands can be addressed in the mitigation plan. We are very sensitive to environmental concerns, and we feel the project can be completed in a way that is not detrimental. Other alternatives have a far greater impact on the environment, whether through land use, wildlife or other criteria.\Q: What are the chances PPL would agree to the alternative route that takes the line through Northampton County?\A: We won't speculate on its chances for being the option the Park Service suggests, but we certainly don't believe it is preferable. It crosses more land of the Appalachian Trail, crosses the Cherry Valley National Wildlife Reserve. It is longer than our proposed route. It would require a crossing of the Delaware River at a point in New Jersey that likely could never be completed. The state of New Jersey thought there would be much more significant impact to dense residential areas and increased costs that are unacceptable to the state. We understand what the Park Service must do in terms of reviewing our proposal against various alternatives, but many of the alternatives they have identified have critical or fatal flaws or technical or environmental flaws.\Q: Can conservation, demand management and alternative energy sources provide enough new energy and energy savings to make the line unnecessary?\A: Demand-side management and conservation certainly will help in the near term ... in light of the delay. The project was originally called for completion in 2012. Both utilities are fully supportive of the development of renewable energy sources. PPL and PSE&G have invested in solar and wind energy generating facilities. But in the final analysis, PJM is the grid operator and wholly responsible for ensuring reliability for the mid-Atlantic region. It still believes it is necessary and the utilities are obligated to pursue the new line. In the interim, other measures will need to be taken, even along with demand-side management and conservation. We work with some of our large users as well as PJM directly, working with large industrial customers to reduce demand on the peak days of the year. That certainly helps.\Michael Wood is a spokesman with PPL Corp.\Planned power lines are not necessary \Q: What is the biggest problem with the power line proposal?\A: The biggest problem with the plan is that the lines are not necessary. There are obvious issues with the specifics of the plan. In terms of the effects to the national park system, there are going to be clear impacts on the view with the new towers and the additional lines. There are issues with the construction of the roads that would have to be built if the lines go forward. The major issue the Sierra Club has is that the lines are unnecessary, and that the determination of the need for increased transmission by [PJM, the regional transmission organization that coordinates the movement of wholesale electricity] is not correct or exaggerated.\Q: What are the alternatives to building the lines?\A: With energy efficiency and demand-response measures in effect, the summer we had this year was extremely hot, and demand was actually lower than it was four years ago in 2006, which was the peak day for energy demand. Other alternatives have been working to reduce demand, and those things are going to continue to work and hopefully more projects will be put in place that make the need for the additional lines continue to decrease.\Q: So you think the utilities are mistaken about the need for the lines?\A: The PJM projections are different than other projections that are out there. Their data is not correct.\Q: Is there a path, among the several currently under consideration by the National Park Service, that would be the least disruptive?\A: There isn't a route that we support in terms of building the line.\Q: There are no acceptable alternatives?\A: There isn't a route that we support. I don't think it's a matter of PSE&G and PPL insisting on building it. It is an issue of the need for the line needs to be analyzed as part of the environmental review. PSE&G and PPL are going to continue to insist on building the line. That is really going to happen regardless of what happens with the environmental review. It needs to contain analysis of the need and ""no-build"" alternatives, which are weighted equally with ""build"" alternatives.\Q What are ""no-build"" alternatives?\A: Right now, energy efficiency and demand response have been shown to be working. We should continue with those programs. In the future, there will be offshore wind turbines that will be providing energy to New Jersey, rather than importing energy from Pennsylvania. The alternatives that have been discussed have been discussed in isolation: ""demand response itself cannot work, and energy efficiency cannot work, and alternative energy cannot work."" But the combination of the three can work.\Q: What damage would the new lines do to the wildlife and plant population.\A: I think the increased lines and the towers are going to be an issue for birds. There are instances of birds having been injured or killed by power lines. Having additional lines and towers and taller towers will affect the park. There is going to be a lot of tree and foliage removal associated with the project itself. There are roads that were supposed to be temporary roads that are still visible in the national park system now that were constructed 30 years ago. Even roads that are temporary they are going to have to do some clear cutting for. In addition there will be maintenance of rights of way, which will be wider for taller towers ... . The trees that are going to be removed are not going to come back.\Q: PPL says the lines would go through an existing corridor, and that's why it's the least disruptive of the options.\A: I've been to the location and seen the existing lines and existing towers. It is going to change significantly, especially if these utilities use the suggested right of way, which is 300 feet for the 200-foot towers. That is a significant difference. They are definitely going to be an eyesore. They will affect the view and will affect what is there now. I think part of the reason they feel it is least disruptive, there is the least amount in terms of building lines through peoples' backyards and in more populated areas in terms of residents and residential areas.\Christine Guhl is New Jersey field organizer with the Sierra Club.\Credit: Scott Kraus Of The Morning Call\Credit: Scott Kraus Of The Morning Call"
409,"
Pity the poor maintenance people at Du Pont. Over the last year, they have had to replace 175,000 bulbs.
\
Not to mention, of course, 80,000 light fixtures and 56,000 ballasts, the transformers that drive fluorescent lighting systems.
\
Du Pont Co.'s bulb-changing binge involved more than four dozen buildings in the Wilmington area and cost the chemical company some $4 million. It was fueled, company officials say, by a desire to be more environmentally responsible and to cut down on expenses.
\
The new lamps and fixtures will use less electricity, saving Du Pont about $1.8 million a year on the check it has to write Delmarva Power & Light Co., its electricity supplier.
\
Delmarva, in turn, by having to burn 10,000 fewer tons of coal a year to satisfy Du Pont's power demands, will cut by 20,000 tons the amount of pollutants spewed into the atmosphere, utility representatives say.
\
And soon Du Pont will have lots of company.
\
That's because the National Energy Policy Act, enacted in late 1992 and scheduled to begin taking effect next year, will force virtually everyone who flicks a light switch to change to lamps, fixtures and ballasts that use less electricity.
\
At its simplest, the act requires lightbulb manufacturers to label incandescent lamps - the kind that simply screw into a ceiling fixture or table lamp - to detail just how much energy they consume. That's intended to prod homeowners, apartment dwellers and others to compare regular bulbs with newer, energy-efficient ones and to buy the ones that use less electricity.
\
At its most complex, the National Energy Act requires lighting manufacturers to stop making energy-inefficient fluorescent light fixtures and begin, after 1995, churning out substitutes that draw less power. As a result, virtually all commercial and industrial buildings will have to convert to the new lights.
\
""One of the most popular lamps of all time is the four-foot fluorescent light, but come the end of 1995 you will no longer be able to buy it,"" says Peter Bleasby, director of codes and standards for OSRAM, a German lighting manufacturer that bought Sylvania Lighting on Jan. 29.
\
One immediate effect of the act will be to force lightbulb buyers to dig deeper into their pockets.
\
The energy-efficient bulbs cost more - ranging in price from $13 to $20, according to some estimates.
\
Moreover, while the new fluorescent bulbs are designed to fit existing fixtures, experts say, commercial and industrial users will find that to really cut their electricity bill they also will have to replace older, less efficient ballasts in their fixtures.
\
Offsetting these added costs will be ""significant"" savings for those who use energy-efficient lights, General Electric lighting experts say.
\
The average Pennsylvania buyer of a four-foot fluorescent lamp would save $38.50 in energy costs over the lamp's 8,000-hour average life span, GE adds.
\
Bleasby estimates the new lights will save office-building owners about 15 percent on energy costs.
\
Others see even higher potential savings because the lights will produce less heat, thereby lessening the demand for air conditioning. Russell D. Churchill, manager of the General Electric Lighting Institute, estimates that the total electric-bill savings for commercial buildings could be between 30 percent and 50 percent.
\
Du Pont officials, for example, point out that the $1.8 million a year it is saving in energy costs represents a 35 percent return on their $4 million investment.
\
""That is a figure any businessman should be able to understand,"" says J.R. Wilkerson, a manager involved with the program.
\
Beyond saving the nation money, the lighting provisions of the National Energy Policy Act will also help save the environment, its advocates say.
\
""The reduction in the release of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides is in the trillions of pounds,"" says Bleasby.
\
The National Energy Policy Act, however, is not without potential disadvantages, say some experts.
\
Many U.S. electric utilities, seeking to avoid the expense of building new power plants, undertook so-called demand-side management programs, in which they offered clients rebates, subsidies and free consulting services to lower the amount of power those clients buy.
\
Delmarva, for example, helped Du Pont's lighting-replacement program by giving the company $50,000 in rebates. The utility's engineers, moreover, helped Du Pont design its program, saving the company the need to use its own engineering resources for the job.
\
That kind of cooperation may fade.
\
The Energy Policy Act was drawn up because, among other things, Congress felt that too many utilities - including some in Pennsylvania, the Southeast and parts of the Southwest - were not pursuing demand-side programs aggressively enough, energy experts say.
\
In New England, where utilities are aggressive in promoting demand-side management, energy-efficient lights make up 25 percent of the bulbs used in the area, says Alden Hathaway, Sylvania's manager of energy systems before it was absorbed by OSRAM.
\
But where utilities have been reluctant to offer the program, energy- efficient lights represent only 4 percent to 6 percent of all bulbs.
\
To some extent, the failure of many states and regions to develop effective demand-side management programs provided the impetus for the National Energy Policy Act. But, paradoxically, say some experts, the act now could be responsible for undercutting the successful existing demand-side programs.
\
Once lighting manufacturers begin making only energy-efficient fluorescent bulbs and commercial and industrial users find they can't buy any other kind, it won't make sense for utilities to continue rebate programs. Customers will have no choice but to install efficient lighting systems, says Joseph Van den Berg of the Edison Electric Institute.
\
And without the rebates, homeowners keeping an eye on their budgets may not feel compelled to buy the more expensive energy-efficient lamps over the standard kind, which will still be available.
\
Moreover, there is also concern that the act will increase financial pressures on small businesses, which may find it difficult to absorb the initial outlays necessary to buy energy-efficient lamps and fixtures.
\
And real estate developers may find costs escalating under the act, says Hathaway.
\
Even though some energy-efficient lamps and fixtures are already available, builders anxious to control costs often avoid them because they are more expensive.
\
Once the act goes into effect, ""some buildings will not be built,"" says Hathaway, because developers ""could not afford"" to install the costly energy-efficient equipment.

"
410," Jack S. Levande doesn't like big risks.\ As manager for New York-based Shearson Lehman Advisors' $1.5 billion portfolio of electric utilities, he doesn't dabble in up-and- coming new issues or a fast-rising corporate stars.\ What he does is stick to the basics: Conservative companies that offer good, steady returns.\ Sure, they don't pack the pizzazz of medical and biotechnology stocks but, in 1991, the Dow Jones index of electric utility stocks posted a 21.17 percent gain, outpacing the 20.3 percent advance of the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials.\ Utility stocks and bonds have continued to shine this year as lower interest rates have increased the appeal of utilities, which are offering yields that are now besting those of most money-market investments.\ Levande's caution has paid off. In 1990, the mutual fund he manages topped its group, ranking first among the nation's utility sector funds.\ And he has no plans to change his strategy. The fund contains a mix of bonds as well as stocks that are considered conservative even for utilities. They include local players such as Pennsylvania Power & Light Co., General Public Utilities Corp. and Philadelphia Electric Co. along with national concerns such as Consolidated Edison and Kansas City Power & Light.\ Levande began his sales and trading career in 1974 at E.F. Hutton. He later became the company's product manager for convertible securities before joining Shearson Lehman Advisors in 1987.\ Since 1988, he has managed Shearson Lehman's utility fund, which has more than 90,000 investors.\ In Allentown recently for a visit to Shearson Lehman's local office, Levande talked about investing in utilities.\ Question: How do you determine the investment value of utility stocks and bonds?\ Levande: You have to look at utilities from two perspectives, from the longer-term historical perspective and from the point of view of what's been happening with them since the beginning of 1992.\ Historically, utilities have been very good investments, both for income and for long-term growth. They have good current yield -- the average utility stock now yields about 6.6 percent -- and you get some good dividend growth as well.\ What's been happening since the beginning of 1992 is that the fixed-income market in particular has been concerned about inflation. We don't see inflation as a problem, and we think that at this point utilities make a very appropriate investment for those people looking for additional yield, those who are conservative by nature and those who are looking for a combination of income and growth.\ The long-term Treasury bond has backed off from the highs that it reached at the end of 1991 and utility stocks are down from the end of 1991 and the beginning of 1992, so it presents an even more attractive investment opportunity.\ Q: Were you surprised at how well the utility index measured up against other indexes, making out better than the Dow Jones and several others?\ Levande: Well, last year was a very good year for the utility sector because you had a combination of declining interest rates -- utilities being interest-rate sensitive are the primary movers behind utility stocks.\ Also, the industry in general did not have any major problems. There weren't any major building programs or problems that we had seen during the the 1980s. And it was one of the few places where investors could go to achieve a competitive yield with a lot of the additional risk in other market sectors.\ Q: Did yields suffer since more people were moving into utilities and pushing up prices?\ Levande: Yields on utility stocks moved down from the beginning of 1991 because the utility index was up over 20 percent during the year.\ But the dramatic decline that you'd seen in the CDs and money- market rates meant that utilities -- even though the yields were down at the end of the year compared to the beginning of the year -- were still very competitive and very attractive.\ Q: Do you see anything coming up that will make utilities more or less attractive?\ Levande: Since we look at the group from a longer-term perspective, the fact that it is down a little bit from the beginning of 1992 doesn't really change our long-term outlook or our long-term picture of the utility industry.\ As I mentioned earlier, our feeling is that inflation is not going to be a major problem and we see interest rates staying stable to drifting lower through the balance of 1992.\ Therefore, they provide one of the few safer havens in the market. They're not completely without risk, but when you approach it from a diversified portfolio you certainly minimize that risk and you have the opportunity for an attractive current yield. It's more risk than CDs or money markets, but in return for the additional risk you're getting the element of long-term growth.\ Q: What are the drawbacks of utility investments?\ Levande: The drawbacks would simply be that utility earnings are more predictable and less volatile since utilities provide a basic necessity, and therefore you don't see the dramatic ups and downs in earnings that you see in some of the more cyclical sectors of the marketplace.\ When the economy recovers, the most dramatic gains are going to be seen in the cyclical stocks. But you also get the greatest volatility.\ So with the utility stocks you get a higher current yield, less volatility but also a lot more defensive investment for those investors who are a lot more conservative by nature.\ Q: Has the performance of utilities differed in certain parts of the country?\ Levande: Utilities aren't necessarily affected by region, it's more of a company-by-company analysis because there are good companies in all regions of the country.\ Our approach is to look at each company individually, look at the fundamentals, look at the management and its service territory and select the companies that we think make the most sense from a total- return perspective.\ Q: How do the local utilities stack up, namely Pennsylvania Power & Light Co., Metropolitan Edison and Philadelphia Electric Co.?\ Levande: We happen to own PP&L, Philadelphia Electric, GPU (General Public Utilities Corp., Met-Ed's parent) and a small amount of UGI. They're all in slightly different categories.\ Philadelphia Electric is recovering financially and doing extremely well. Their dividend had been reduced a number of years ago and now it's been reinstated. Their dividend growth rate is substantially above the industry average. So we like Philadelphia Electric very much.\ Pennsylvania Power & Light has more of an average yield. They're doing very well financially, are very well managed and have a little bit above average dividend growth.\ GPU's earnings are more stable in a narrower range than some of the other companies but the dividend growth rate is above average. The dividend payout ratio is lower than the industry average and they just raised their dividend from $1.50 to $1.60 and we anticipate another nice dividend increase next year.\ Q: How will compliance with the Clean Air Act regulations affect utilities?\ Levande: That's the next major industry development. The first part of complying with the new acid rain standards will come in 1995 with the next phase coming in the year 2000. Eventually, the expenses will probably be passed on to the rate payers.\ In the near term, there will be concern about some companies more than others. Companies in the Midwest, in particular, would be more dramatically affected or would have a greater financial expense than some of the other companies.\ Again, we have to look at them on a company-by-company basis and select the companies that are going to do well in any type of environment.\ We want to diversify the portfolio by managing a fund of 50 or 60 differ stock holdings and maybe 30 or 40 different bond holdings.\ Q: Is there a lot of diversity within the industry?\ Levande: Yes. We look at it from a number of different factors including company size, geographic area and fuel mix -- we don't like them to focus on one source of fuel entirely in case there's a problem with it.\ Q: How do you look at Pennsylvania's regulatory climate?\ Levande: Pennsylvania is fine. We don't have any problems with the regulatory environment in Pennsylvania. It's probably average to a little bit above average compared with the rest of the country.\ Utilities are very highly regulated groups and you have to look at the company itself, the regulatory environment and also the local or state political influences.\ Q: Besides the Clean Air requirements, is the industry heading up against any other major issues?\ Levande: We don't see any major new building cycles developing in the near term. Eventually, in the mid-1990s there will be a need for new capacity.\ The utility companies are focusing on demand-side management, which is trying to postpone a need for additional capacity. Because when you build another plant, you have to add the plant to the rate base, and it's a question of how much higher the local utility rates go as they recover the return on investment.\ Q: Historically, how attractive have utility investments been?\ Levande: There have been short-term cycles where utilities have had problems but usually when one company is building, another company can be doing very well financially. Or when one company has problems with regulators and rate-case filings, another company can be doing very well.\ Overall, we look at utilities from a three- to five-year investment horizon. Over that time, utilities have provided a very competitive total return and you tend to minimize the short-term emotional swings or some of the short-term problems that companies face in expanding.\ Q: Are the large building programs and resulting rate cases considered short-term problems?\ Levande: Situations like the one Philadelphia Electric went through would be a longer-term problem because you would have to see the financial impact of the problem.\ If the company is relying very heavily on one plant or relying on a substantial rate increase that is not approved by the regulators, that could have a long-range impact on the company.\ Q: It seems as though even the utilities that face big problems, like Philadelphia Electric trying to recover the cost of Limerick and GPU's troubles with Three Mile Island, always tend to recover, that it's just a matter of time before they get back. In other industries though, companies never recover from such big blows. Why is that?\ Levande: It's very simple. Utilities provide a basic necessity. They have to provide electricity. It's a question of working with the regulators, of working in the corporate world to earn a fair return on investment.\ You can't just close up the local utility and buy power from somebody. You need the electricity and that's where you get it."

As the thermometer rose Tuesday, so did expectations at the Tasty Baking Co. It was braced to shut down a production line and empty a few freezers. All to save a bundle on energy costs.
\
That never happened. Demand on the electric grid that supplies power to the Mid-Atlantic never got high enough to require such cutbacks.
\
It peaked at 136,716 megawatts at 4:50 p.m. - not a record.
\
But across the region, Tasty and an increasing number of companies, hospitals, and universities - all large users of electricity - are lining up to offer energy reductions on such hot days.
\
Places as varied as the Comcast Center in Philadelphia, a produce cold-storage facility in Ephrata, a Chester County mushroom producer, and a North Penn water-treatment plant are ready to turn the temperature up on thermostats, to cycle a building's air handlers, to shut off equipment that could just as well run at night - all to reduce power use during hours of peak demand.
\
Each has a financial incentive to do it.
\
Many programs exist with utilities or other companies that, as ""aggregators,"" can deliver demand reductions in return for lower energy payments.
\
The initiative is a response to an ever more stressed grid, run by PJM Interconnection in 13 states. In a command center in suburban Philadelphia, operators must match demand with supply.
\
The base load of power is provided by plants that can make power cheaply and cleanly. But as demand rises, PJM instructs plants that are more expensive and more polluting to rev up.
\
The cost of energy skyrockets at such moments. Last year, it ranged from 7 cents a kilowatt hour to 22 cents. Most customers don't see that fluctuation in their bills, but every charge reflects the cost of electricity overall.
\
Ultimately, as demand on the grid trends upward, new power plants might be needed.
\
Conversely, the grid can get ""virtual generation"" by asking large users to cut back.
\
This is both cheaper and faster, PJM spokesman Ray Dotter said. ""It takes a while for a power plant to get up to full output"" - not to mention building a new one - ""whereas you can stop using power fairly instantly,"" he said.
\
Stabilizing the grid leads to energy security for the nation, energy officials say.
\
""Each time we properly manage the system so that we can pull power demand off, that's less new generation we need to build,"" said Tom Tuffey, director of the nonprofit PennFuture's Center for Energy, Enterprise and the Environment.
\
Nationally, ""we feel like managing demand is a huge piece of the puzzle,"" said Katherine Hamilton, president of the advocacy group GridWise Alliance. ""You can make fairly minor adjustments and get major benefits.""
\
Homes, too
\
With technology and finesse, some buildings can reduce their loads - if only for a short time - by 20 percent or more.
\
Power reduction now is reaching even into our homes.
\
PSE&G in New Jersey has signed up about 100,000 residential and small-business customers who let the utility regulate central air conditioners via a small device on each unit.
\
When the utility gets the word from PJM, a microwave signal instructs each air conditioner to cycle off more often. If the unit was running 40 minutes an hour before, it may drop to 20 minutes.
\
Raymond Fernandez, director of demand management at PSE&G, said that through the program the utility can shed as much as 65 megawatts of power - about the capacity of a small coal-fired plant.
\
Customers who commit themselves to the program for two years - reachable at 800-854-4444 - get a $50 rebate plus a ""new thermostat worth $200,"" said Fernandez. Or, they can cancel at any time, but get only $4 a month, June through September.
\
No sweat
\
Peco has just introduced a similar program - reachable at 1-888-573-2672 - giving participants a $30 credit per month from June to September.
\
Peco has about 200 business customers signed up for demand management programs. One is mandatory. When a ""curtailment event"" is called, the company must cut back and receive a discounted electric rate throughout the year.
\
The second program is voluntary. Companies get a lesser financial incentive, but they are not penalized for declining to cut back when requested.
\
Malvern-based Liberty Property Trust, which owns 750 buildings, has enrolled 10 of its ""average"" office buildings in one of the Peco programs.
\
Thermostats typically are set at 70 to 74 degrees, said sustainability manager Marla Thalheimer. When the grid is overtaxed, temperatures might go up by one to four degrees while lights dim. ""In a perfect world,"" she said, ""people won't even know the difference.""
\
""If you're the tenant, we don't want you sweating in the dark on a hot day,"" she added.
\
Universities have also been among the first to embrace demand-side management.
\
The University of Pennsylvania has agreed to shed three megawatts of power on demand. Last month, the university conducted a test run to verify how much it could cut back.
\
Officials were astounded when power use fell 13 megawatts - a 21 percent drop.
\
Entire offices went dark while staff members convened for meetings in a building's central location - or even in a nearby ice cream parlor.
\
Meanwhile, yes, the air handlers in some buildings were less active. Temperatures rose.
\
Did people notice? ""The answer is that some did, and some did not,"" said Ken Ogawa, executive director of operations and maintenance. ""In our case, it was only a one-hour action.""
\
The trick to occupant satisfaction is to cut power elegantly, not just cut off the lights and the air-conditioning, he said.
\
Drexel University has embarked on a project with the Conshohocken company Viridity Energy, which Tuffey said was taking demand-side management one step further by offering real-time reductions.
\
While other companies often work a day ahead, prescheduling load reductions, Viridity's advanced software can factor in current energy prices, potential reductions, and ""essentially sell that reduction back to the grid,"" said company president Audrey Zibelman, formerly PJM's chief operating officer.
\
""We don't wait for the grid operator to identify the opportunity for us,"" she said. ""We identify the opportunity for the customer by allowing them to make an economic decision and voluntarily contribute reductions to the grid when it economically makes sense.""
\
Drexel is installing equipment so it can operate as a micro-grid, managing not only its power use, but eventually incorporating renewable power sources such as solar arrays and wind generation.
\
Typically, ""loads have not been controllable,"" said Chika Nwankpa, director of Drexel's Center for Electric Power Engineering.
\
""Now, we're entering this new frontier where we can transform these buildings to where they look to the grid like a virtual generator.""

412,"Don't be misled on role of married priests\The present scandal affecting the Roman Catholic Church in the United States, concerning the sexual abuse of minors by some members of the clergy, is sad and disturbing to many people and for many reasons. Regretfully, there are those who have tried to capitalize on this issue by promoting their own agendas, such as the ordination of women and a married clergy.\It is reprehensible, however, to exploit this tragic time in the church and cause great confusion among the faithful with misinformation regarding the alleged ministry of priests who were dispensed from their priestly obligations (that is, laicized), enabling them to enter a valid Catholic marriage. Such was the intent of the author and the result of the article ""Church rules allow active role for married priests"" (Community Voices, May 12).\The first admission by Joseph McOscar, a dispensed priest, is that he officiates at marriages and that he ""witnessed about 75 marriages last year alone."" According to the canon law of the Catholic Church, any marriage ""witnessed"" by McOscar, or by any dispensed priest, is absolutely invalid in the eyes of the church; it is as though the marriage never took place.\While it is true that ""a dispensed priest is still sacramentally a priest"" due to the permanent nature of the sacrament of Holy Orders, it is false to state, as McOscar does, that the ""dispensation only relieves him of the obligations of the clerical state.""\The Code of Canon Law, as well as the document from Rome that informs the priest he has been dispensed by the Holy Father, and which the dispensed priest is required to sign in acceptance of this favor, states unequivocally that this action ""inseparably includes a dispensation from sacred celibacy, and, at the same time, loss of the clerical state."" In addition to losing the rights proper to the clerical state and no longer being bound by its obligations, the document states that a dispensed priest is also ""excluded from the exercise of the sacred ministry,"" with the sole exception of hearing confession and granting sacramental absolution for someone in danger of death. This exception is granted, not as a privilege for the dispensed priest to exercise whenever he so desires, but as an extraordinary accommodation to the person who is in danger of death, for the sake of that person's own spiritual welfare.\McOscar writes that ""there should be no question regarding baptism administered by a married priest since anyone ... can baptize in a situation of need."" The operative phrase is in a situation of need. Certainly, no lay person, which means also a dispensed priest, is to baptize someone outside of a genuine case of necessity, such as danger of death.\Regarding bringing Holy Communion to the sick, a dispensed priest is explicitly prohibited from doing so, in accord with the document informing him of his dispensation, which states that he ""is not able to function ... in the distribution of Eucharistic Communion."" McOscar states that ""any priest is allowed to anoint the sick if there is adequate reason."" The truth is that a dispensed priest is prohibited from administering the sacrament of Anointing of the Sick, since he is excluded from the exercise of the sacred ministry. For this same reason, a priest who has been dispensed is strictly forbidden from celebrating Mass, even if requested by well-meaning individuals. The shortage of priests is no excuse for the unlawful celebration of such a sacred act as the Mass.\McOscar asks, ""How can I resume my ministry after having been dispensed and allowed to marry?"" Well, the answer, simply put, is, he cannot! Instead, what he is doing as an alleged ""service"" to certain members of the Catholic faithful is actually a fraudulent disservice. The so-called ""understanding of the Code of Canon Law"" McOscar proposes, is, in effect, a false interpretation meant to justify his own unlawful and, at times, invalid actions.\There are many priests who have been laicized who are faithful to the church and who take part in its life in a manner consistent with the lay state. These men, who have proven themselves as most loving sons of the church, are to be commended for their fidelity to the church's laws.\On the other hand, McOscar, and those dispensed priests who offer similar services to the faithful, are acting in contradiction to the church's teaching and laws, and are leading others to do the same, despite any arguments they make to the contrary.\The law of the church is clear, and no Catholic should be misled by McOscar's duplicitous article.\Msgr. Alexander J. Palmieri\Philadelphia\ \Msgr. Palmieri is licensed in canon law and is the chancellor for the Archdiocese of Philadelphia.\ \The benefits of electric-industry deregulation\Three recent articles (Inquirer, May 19, 22 and 24) examined the state of retail electric deregulation, and debated the validity of the new marketplace and benefits from competition. Such an evaluation should examine conditions before and after the retail deregulation law was enacted five years ago in Pennsylvania.\Success in utility deregulation has meant different things to various parties. Those widely divergent views created our market, and on balance, the shift to this new environment has been quite successful.\Partly, it's a matter of how we define success. I would offer that electric competition has brought significant value, such as:\Savings over the last five years of $560 million, resulting from rate reductions that offered Peco customers immediate benefits from industry restructuring.\Rate caps through 2010 that provide the longest period of rate stability in history, dating back to 1990, a predictability that helps all customers manage their energy costs and will help to attract businesses to the area.\A 10-year transition period recognized the need for competitive wholesale and retail markets to develop while providing protections against California-like electricity price spikes and threats to service reliability, and a market environment that will attract necessary new generation investment.\Consumers have more choices in a deregulated environment, including alternative suppliers, the option of being served by their local utility, and different product offerings such as premium ""green"" solar and wind power.\Deregulation has resulted in a more customer-focused, efficient utility with improved reliability and customer service and new products and services, such as enhanced outage notification, e-billing, online usage analysis, and expanded demand side management.\New local investment in power generation and an active wholesale energy and capacity market that invites participation from independent generators and marketers.\Unfortunately, our overall economy has changed. The dot-coms have vanished, and investment in new ventures has declined significantly. Such factors have limited opportunities for new entrants to our market.\Over time, energy markets will further evolve and, ultimately, consumers will remain in the driver's seat. That's what it's all about.\Ken Lawrence\President\Peco Energy Co.\Philadelphia\Courts and rights\The writers objecting to Mark Bowden's reservations on an international court treaty (Letters, May 18) ignored the main reservation: Such a treaty would override the civil, criminal and legal protections afforded Americans by our Constitution.\If you want an international court system, if you want Americans to die fighting all over the world upholding that system, then give us a treaty that provides those rights to all nationals the world over. I don't think China, Saudi Arabia and the African dictatorships will sign on to that concept.\Jack Schmohl\Levittown\jschmohl@pioneer.net\Appreciating America\The other day, my 14-year-old son wanted to know why people had changed so much in their loyalty or patriotism toward America after Sept 11. ""What were they thinking before Sept 11?"" he asked. I enthusiastically agreed with him. Tragedy can make us feel more dedicated to preventing its causes, or more vulnerable, or more compassionate. But why would it make us rethink how we regard our country? I appreciated America before, as I do now. And I'm glad my son does, too.\Neil Greenberg\Melrose Park\gfggroup@aol.com\Mother's Day gift\While watching the news on a Saturday night, I questioned why local news had to focus on such harshly negative stories.

Thank you, Mike Vitez, for sharing the lives of some beautiful mothers on Mother's Day.\Jeanne Grimes\Haddonfield\ \ \Credit: "
413,"
Like many Americans, Tina Brunetti worries about climate change and wanted to spend her household's energy budget on a power supplier more mindful of the environment.
\
But the Chadds Ford pharmacist said she was overwhelmed with conflicting information from electricity suppliers that promised ""green"" alternatives, including some offers from acquaintances who peddled electricity plans in their spare time.
\
""The quantity of information was way too much,"" she said. ""I was getting bombarded with offers from people I knew.""
\
Rather than choosing a new supplier, Brunetti opted to stay with the default service provided by the local utility, Peco Energy Co., even though much of its supply is what green-power advocates derisively call ""brown"" power.
\
Like Brunetti, about 65 percent of Peco's customers have chosen to stick with the utility's power supply, despite an array of alternatives, including discount suppliers and green-energy producers.
\
Though 34 percent of Americans surveyed by Gallup in March said they worry a ""great deal"" about the environment, that has not translated into a mass exodus from conventional power suppliers.
\
Only 141,786 Pennsylvania customers, or about 2.5 percent of the state's 5.7 million electricity customers, have chosen a clean-energy supplier, according to the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission's 2013 numbers, the latest available.
\
(New Jersey offers Electric Choice, but the market is more opaque than Pennsylvania's, and the state offers no independent one-stop shopping.)
\
Green power's higher cost is one reason few customers switch. But there's also a crowded bazaar of suppliers offering a dizzying menu of options.
\
The PUC's power-shopping website, papowerswitch.com, lists 117 offers for Peco Energy residential customers from 57 suppliers.
\
When the list is filtered to include only renewable-energy offers, there are still 45 deals to compare. Of those, 13 derive some or all of their power from Pennsylvania renewable sources. Ten get some or all of it from Pennsylvania wind turbines.
\
And those are just the suppliers listed with the PUC. Other green-energy suppliers, such as the Washington-based nonprofit Groundswell, engage in more direct-marketing methods through environmental organizations and community groups.
\
Green-energy customers are highly desired by the industry because they are more likely to remain loyal to their suppliers than customers who shop strictly for price.
\
""A customer on a renewable-energy product has actively decided what is important to them and has selected their supplier accordingly,"" said Ritchie Hudson, Pennsylvania chairman of the Retail Energy Supply Association, a trade group.
\
Yet price still matters for some renewable-energy customers. So a word of caution to those who might be shopping right now: Summer is typically the worst time of year to test the market because wholesale prices tend to be higher.
\
Plus, Peco's ""price-to-compare,"" the cost it charges customers who don't shop, is set until the end of August at its lowest point since Pennsylvania adopted market rates in 2011. At 8.2 cents a kilowatt hour, Peco's price is very difficult for any supplier to beat, much less a green-energy provider.
\
Still, several green-energy suppliers now offer short-term introductory fixed-rate deals lower than Peco's rate: Green Mountain Energy; Frontier Energy; NRG Home; Oasis Energy; and Talen Energy.
\
Most renewable suppliers come in at least 10 percent or 20 percent higher. One producer quotes a rate 68 percent above Peco's. That would cost a typical Peco customer about $38 more a month.
\
A decision to go green is further complicated by the different types of energy supply available.
\
The terms ""green"" energy and ""renewable"" energy are often used interchangeably by marketers. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says renewable-energy technologies rely on non-diminishing fuel sources such as sun, wind, moving water, organic plant and waste material, and the earth's heat (geothermal). But some renewable-energy technologies, such as large hydroelectric dams, can have adverse environmental trade-offs. ""Green power"" is a superior subset of renewable power, according to the EPA.
\
For some consumers, the source of renewable energy is an important aspect of their clean-energy decision. Many suppliers buy renewable-energy credits from giant Midwestern wind farms, which are much cheaper than credits from Pennsylvania producers.
\
The Energy Co-op, a Philadelphia member-owned organization with about 3,000 electricity customers, takes pride in offering wind and solar power generated in Pennsylvania. Its solar energy is derived from individuals in the area, to whom it pays above-market prices to incentivize solar adoption.
\
But its prices range from 27 percent to 35 percent above Peco's current price, and its membership rolls have been static, largely because of a lack of marketing, said Glenn Smith, the co-op's new executive director.
\
""For us as a cooperative, it's important to offer a Pennsylvania product,"" Smith said. ""What we're trying to convey to our members is that we're paying more for a product that has local benefits, and that resonates with many of our members.""
\
To an extent, all customers in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware already derive some electricity from green producers by virtue of state mandates that require an increasing percentage of power to come from qualified renewable sources.
\
New Jersey's renewable portfolio standard will require 22.5 percent renewable power by 2021. Delaware will require 25 percent by 2025.
\
Pennsylvania's alternative-energy portfolio standard, created in 2004, requires 18 percent of the supply from alternative sources by 2021.
\
The Pennsylvania law is not as strict as those in neighboring states because it allows more than half of its power to come from ""Tier II"" sources, including waste coal, distributed generation systems, demand-side management, large-scale hydro, municipal solid waste, wood pulping and manufacturing by-products, and coal-to-gas technology.
\
In the current renewable-energy fiscal year, which began June 1, Pennsylvania suppliers must obtain 13.7 percent of their power from alternative suppliers: 8.2 percent from the Tier II sources; 0.25 percent from solar; and 5.25 percent from non-solar Tier I sources, primarily wind.

Renewable energy provides a growing amount of the U.S. electricity supply, but it still accounts for a small percentage compared with the Big Three: coal, natural gas, and nuclear.
\
In 2013, renewable power provided about 13 percent of the nation's energy, according to the Energy Information Administration. Hydroelectric power accounted for about half of that.
\
Wind energy accounted for 4 percent of the nation's power production. Solar energy, for all the attention it gets, accounted for 9 million megawatt hours, or 0.2 percent of the more than 4 billion MWh produced by the U.S. power industry.
\
By comparison, fossil fuels, primarily coal and natural gas, accounted for 67 percent of electricity production. Nuclear power accounted for 19 percent.
\
Pennsylvania, which exports power to other states, generated 1.5 percent of its power from wind and 0.2 percent from solar. Fossil fuels accounted for 61 percent, and nuclear provided 35 percent.
\
New Jersey, a net importer of power from other states, is a leading producer of solar power, which accounts for 0.7 percent of state production. Wind accounts for 0.02 percent. Nuclear reactors account for 51 percent of the Garden State's production.- Andrew Maykuth

"
414," Before buying into conventional wisdom about environmental programs hurting the economy and costing jobs, maybe you'd better save your energy.\ That's the message of a study prepared for the Campaign for an Environmental Economy. The study found that investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies totaling $25.2 billion over the next 26 years would yield a $53.3 billion savings in energy costs in Pennsylvania and annually create an average of 23,000 jobs.\ Such a recasting of energy priorities -- including more energy-efficient residential, industrial and commercial buildings, lighting, automobiles, refrigerators and industrial motors -- also would have environmental benefits, shrinking carbon emissions in the state by up to 13 million tons annually, and reducing air pollution, acid rain, mine water pollution and radioactive waste.\ ""This study makes the strong case that increased investment in 'clean' energy sources wins for the environment and the economy,"" said David Hamilton, Campaign for an Environmental Economy project director. ""It shoots down the popular myth that environmental gain necessarily means economic pain.""\ The study by the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, a Washington D.C.,-based research organization, found Pennsylvania's energy bill is almost 8.8 percent of its Gross State Product, while the United States as a whole spends only 8.2 percent of its Gross Domestic Product on energy.\ Such energy over-consumption can be a drag on the state's economy, the study said, and urged Pennsylvania to develop an energy efficiency plan and work to have business, industry and the public ""buy into it.""\ ""We're not talking about a decrease in consumption, so we're not threatening existing coal and energy jobs,"" Hamilton said. ""What we are trying to do is recommend a policy aimed at lowering the state's anticipated energy growth. To do that, we need a broad-based effort backed by the people of Pennsylvania.""\ Daniel Desmond, executive director of the state Energy Office, endorsed the study findings, adding that demonstration programs promoting use of alternative fuels and demand-side management of electric usage through retrofitting state office buildings are already under way."

County did audit, should collect taxes
\
Editor: In your April 12 front-page story, Single Tax Office solicitor John McGovern is quoted as saying, ""...nobody asked for the ... audit for so many years. No one from the city, school district or county. Where were they for the last four years?""
\
I assume Mr. McGovern did not mean to include the county, but in his frustration he did. He forgot that the county conducted an audit in 2007, which resulted in $256,000 being identified as overpaid county taxes and another $198,000 of interest.
\
Since January 2004 I have stated my displeasure with the Single Tax Office, not its employees, but the system of tax collection itself. Your newspaper has labeled me as the STO ""antagonist"" because of my constant request of accountability. It was so bad in 2004 that our revenue and finance department had to establish procedures whereby remittances of collected taxes were done on a regular basis.
\
I also questioned why the controller's office never did yearly audits of STO as required by law. Finally in 2007, then-controller John Mellow added a CPA to his staff and conducted an audit of 2001 through 2006. The results benefited the taxpayers to the tune of $454,000. I do not know how we are going to audit 2007.
\
Mr. McGovern is correct in saying that the city and school district never did audits. Answers from the city have been provided, but no one has asked the school district why it never did an audit. Perhaps, by law, it is not required to perform one.
\
I believe the county should collect its own taxes. It would result in efficiency, accountability and cost savings.
\
In March 2008 I asked our representatives in Harrisburg to consider changing the 80-year-old law that allowed the Single Tax Office to collect county real estate taxes within the city limits. We are researching as to how the STO received authority to collect county taxes outside of the city.
\
The county commissioners will be responsible for the process of selecting a single collection office for all earned income taxes throughout the county. The law will eliminate 30 income tax collectors, which will ease the burden in 2012. It is assumed that the STO will be one of the bidders. However, that is three years away and the taxpayers cannot wait that long for accountability.

Demand declines; don't build line here
\
Editor: PPL has failed to prove there is a need for the Susquehanna Roseland Transmission Line, and should not be allowed to pass along the billion-dollar cost to regional ratepayers. The rationale given to construct Line B was an anticipated 1.4 percent demand increase. But demand for electricity in the region was actually down this past summer: the 2008 unrestricted peak declined 10,000 megawatts from 2007, with further declines expected this year.
\
As demand declined, PPL's profits decreased and Pennsylvania workers have been laid off. But PPL investors would get a 12 percent to 14 percent guaranteed rate of return for the project, and continue to profit by exporting cheaper coal and nuclear electricity into New Jersey.
\
The state and county have spent millions of dollars to preserve the unique ecosystem barrens on Moosic Mountain and prevent fragmentation from development. Comprehensive environmental impact studies are needed to understand the line's effect on the barrens' rare plant communities, upon which at least 18 rare species depend.
\
Before we approve new transmission lines, a comprehensive regional energy plan is needed with the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and minimizing environmental impact. This plan should maximize non-polluting local renewable energy generation, offshore wind, efficiency, demand side management, and smart grid technologies. Impacts of anticipated natural gas and sprawl development can be considered, along with transmission lines that support wind.
\
Attend PPL's open houses to emphasize comprehensive planning is needed to protect the environment and taxpayers in Northeast Pennsylvania.

Direct route

Editor: Bill Scranton Sr. (Your Opinion, March 22) makes a lot of sense about the circuitous proposed route for the power line from Berwick to New Jersey.

Why should PPL not use the shorter, more direct route that would not scar the land? If that would still be a problem, intelligent people could probably come up with other routes that would be less offensive.

Not on same level

Editor: Your April 9 editorial ""Good call, ND"" suggests that the bishops who criticize Barack Obama's visit to that school are hypocrites by making several points that are in conflict with their basic beliefs.
\
Most of these could be debated, but I find fault in some of your initial points. To say that Dick Cheney opposes any law banning gay marriage (most likely because of his daughter) is one thing, but to compare his ""view"" with Barack Obama's proactive pursuit of legislation to promote abortion on demand at any stage is reprehensible.
\
Moreover, you claim that the execution rate was high when George Bush was governor of Texas. This may well be contrary to church doctrine, but common sense dictates that equating a vicious convicted murderer to that of unborn baby in its mother's womb is at best, pure nonsense.

Regardless of any political persuasion and views, he is the president of the United States and deserves our respect, at least for the office he holds.

Smart grid trumps more dumb lines
\
Editor: Long-distance interstate transmission lines are part of an inefficient transmission line system designed to export power to other states for profit, not benefit the residents of Pennsylvania. Global warming requires us to have better transmission line siting policies, with the goal of reducing energy consumption while maximizing the use of local nonpolluting renewable energy resources.
\
Ratepayers will absorb the billion-dollar price tag for overbuilt interstate transmission lines, like PPL's proposed Susquehanna Roseland Line B.
\
Ironically, Pennsylvania utility companies are required by Act 129 to reduce demand at the very same time they propose to build an infrastructure to accommodate an increase in demand. According to the Energy Information Administration, in 2008 electric demand actually fell by 1.6 percent and is expected to fall by another 1.8 percent this year. Peak demand declined for 2008 for the intended service area of the transmission line and further declines are predicted.
\
Recent testimony before a House subcommittee on energy and the environment revealed that smaller, locally distributed generation projects, which benefit the Pennsylvania consumer and economy most, require little transmission line upgrade and can be developed faster than traditional utility scale generation.
\
In addition, new cap and trade policies emphasize investment in smart grid technologies that utilize new digital technology for better demand-side management. These technologies, along with compatible appliances and equipment, can help identify when and where energy demand is high, enabling users to adjust how much energy is used, and when.
\
Unfortunately, Pennsylvania utilities continue to submit proposals for individual transmission lines without regard to regional carbon reduction, efficiency initiatives, smart grid technologies or the new green economy.
\
More than 50 percent of our nation's power is already fueled by dirty coal and environmental groups predict that these massive power lines will rely on even more coal-generated power. To realize President Obama's vision of the development of smart grid for renewable energy, a priority for any massive transmission line investments should focus specifically on supporting off-shore wind development for the East Coast, and appropriately scaled upgrades for in-state distributed energy generation.
\
Please attend the public meeting Thursday from 5 to 8 p.m. at the Abington Community Library in Clarks Summit to show your support for regional planning that truly creates a new Pennsylvania Smart Grid, not more dumb lines.

Halt power play
\
Editor: I agree with Martha McAndrew's June 29 letter concerning the proposed 500-kilovolt power line that PPL is seeking to build from the Berwick area, north and east across the region and into the New York City metro area.
\
It is not too late to halt this monstrosity, which will do little, if anything, to benefit local residents. The only beneficiaries will be those in the metro area, who will have the least invested.
\
The reasons for the new line cited by David G. De-Campli, president of PPL Electric Utilities, in his May 31 op-ed, are vague at best. It lacks specific details as to how the line will benefit Northeast Pennsylvania.
\
Ten acres (including a pond and wetlands) upon which I live will be permanently disrupted if this project proceeds. This does not include tens of acres more adjoining the right-of-way, which will become virtually worthless due to their proximity to the gargantuan towers. Nor does this include the tens of acres for a proposed housing development on the opposite side of the line. A neighbor's home will be directly under the line (if he is allowed to keep it), and a dozen or more families in the area will have their property values reduced to pocket change if the line is built.
\
I would oppose the new line even if it did not directly impact my home. Anyone who has a view of West Mountain and the other mountaintops comprising the view for much of the county will be negatively impacted. The new towers to be built alongside the current power line and towers that scar the ridges will dwarf the current towers.
\
If the health, aesthetic, environmental and property values aren't enough of a concern, the new line will cost hundreds of millions of dollars, most of which will be borne by PPL customers who are about to be hit with a massive rate increase. Yet the local benefits, as put forth by PPL, will be minimal at best, with the lion's share of the power going to New York and New Jersey residents.
\
It is obvious that the potential harms from this project far outweigh the benefits (if any) to the region as a whole.
\
The next PUC hearing on the proposed line will be Thursday at 5 p.m. in the Abington Community Library in Clarks Summit.

Cuts too severe

Editor: Public broadcasting in the United States is a unique endeavor. This is largely true because it draws support, unlike commercial television, from multiple sources: federal and state funding, business sponsors and especially public subscriptions.
\
This enables it to be independent and unbiased in its programming. However, this is now threatened by a state budget that is eliminating PBS funding. In difficult times, a reduction in support may be justified, but elimination of all support puts in jeopardy the entire enterprise.

Editor: WVIA-TV (Channel 44) is telling us that the state is considering cutting funding of all public stations in the state. The reason is, of course, that income to the state has fallen sharply, as it has for nearly all governmental bodies.

There is an answer to this dilemma. Pennsylvania has one of the largest, most costly state governments. We have more state representatives and senators, with larger incomes and expense accounts, than we need. They get cars, mileage allowances and they get paid an extra ""per-diem"" just to show up.

419,"Ah, the 1990s: Sport-utilities ruled the roads. Computers, printers, and other office gadgets invaded homes. Energy to feed them was cheap and plentiful.\Conservation fell casualty to Americans' increasingly energy-dependent lifestyles.\But indulgence came at a price: As consumers have discovered via soaring gasoline prices and winter heating bills, payback time has arrived. And deregulation of the electricity industry could lead to similar sticker shock in coming years.\Now, New Power Co., a competitive electricity supplier based in Purchase, N.Y., is giving consumers a way to prepare for that day. In Philadelphia and Houston, it has begun testing an electronic gizmo that lets the utility control home heating and cooling systems, plus some lights and appliances, via the Internet.\Postal worker Bill Dobbins, who lives near the Franklin Mills Mall, is among the 300 Philadelphia-area volunteers trying out the high-tech devices.\One, a remote temperature control, lets New Power adjust Dobbins' thermostat by two to six degrees via signals sent over the Internet, so that his heating and cooling system conserves power.\Dobbins said he joined the experiment because he was ""interested in that type of thing."" Plus, ""there's the monetary reward.""\New Power is paying volunteers $25 to $75 to participate in the program through September.\For New Power, which is backed by Enron Corp. of Houston, the money is a pittance compared with the juicy customer data the test program should reveal.\""What we're really interested in is consumer behavior,"" said Tim Vail, New Power's vice president of energy technology solutions. He said the company wanted to know whether consumers would use the new system, and how they would use it.\New Power and other electricity providers think the setup can save them big bucks when supply on the electric grid is tight. Vail said the company was examining how to share some of those savings with customers if the program was delivered to a wider audience in coming years.\The company has divided this summer's test into three parts. The first uses an automated electricity meter, which will keep tabs on a household's daily energy use and help New Power understand typical consumption patterns.\The second part is a heating and air-conditioning control pilot, like the one installed in Dobbins' home. It commandeers a consumer's thermostat and adjusts it two to six degrees as directed by New Power. The consumer can override the automatic commands.\""You can't give them a widget and ask them while they're in the middle of a dinner party to sweat,"" said Lou Budike, president of Powerweb Technologies, an energy software company in Media that is negotiating with New Power to provide more detailed usage information to consumers online.\Part three of the test lets consumers remotely change their thermostats or switch lights on and off using any Internet device - a trick, the company says, that could come in handy for discouraging burglars and for conserving power while away on vacation.\The centerpiece of New Power's experiment - giving a utility the ability to control customer devices when needed - is a twist on an old theme in the electricity business: Get enough large customers off the power grid when demand is highest and you greatly reduce the risk of blackouts.\Power on the wholesale market is also most expensive at times of day when demand is highest. So getting big users off the system can save money for the power company.\In New Power's experiment, a ""big user"" is actually a bunch of small customers who have agreed to let New Power automatically adjust their thermostats based on conditions in the regional energy market.\New Power calls the plan ""joint energy management.""\It remains to be seen, though, whether companies such as New Power can corral enough small customers in this manner to turn a profit.\Even with small-business customers, ""the margin on that size of account is not tremendous,"" said Jean-Louis Poirier, an energy analyst with PA Consulting Group in Washington.\""The residential market is very difficult,"" Poirier said, because the cost of signing on a residential customer can range from $200 to $700.\Still, he said these ""demand-side management"" programs had great potential for savings.\""In the industrial and commercial market, many times you can save 15 to 20 percent with both changes in customer behavior and capital investment,"" Poirier said.\Under state law, retail prices for electricity in Pennsylvania are capped for several years. For Peco Energy Co.'s customers, the cap lasts through 2006 for transmission and distribution charges and through 2010 for generation charges.\After this safe harbor for consumers expires, utilities can pass along more costs to their customers.\In a deregulated environment, this could mean alarming price increases if consumer demand cannot be quickly reconciled with supply.\That, in simple terms, explains California's electricity crisis of the last several months: Retail customers had no incentive to respond to the turmoil in wholesale power markets until it was too late.\But, generally speaking, customers on alternative plans that adjust rates based on demand or time of day can receive big discounts or rebates over plain vanilla rates - if they use electricity at the right time.\For instance, consumers willing to dry clothes late in the evening instead of during peak hours of electricity use could pay less for the electricity they use. Conversely, they could wind up paying more by running the dryers during peak times.\It's an idea regulators want to see more of.\This year, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission ordered all utilities serving the state to implement programs that deal with the customer, or demand, side of the energy equation.\While Peco has a time-of-use rate available for residential and other customer classes, a spokesman, Michael Wood, said it was not heavily marketed.\The company is, however, starting its own pilot program this month with 50 Delaware County customers, offering a ""smart thermostat"" similar to New Power's. Peco will offer a discount to customers who let it raise their thermostats two to four degrees for up to four hours at a time when demand for electricity is high.\""Without that, there's no strong incentive for consumers to conserve when they don't see the benefit on a real-time basis,"" Wood said.\Vail said that by next summer, New Power hoped to offer homeowners throughout its territory a product based on the technologies in its pilot program.\Akweli Parker's e-mail address is aparker@phillynews.com.\ \ \Credit: By Akweli Parker INQUIRER STAFF WRITER"

Hey, big spender, ease up on taxpayers
\
Editor: Gov. Ed ""The Tax Man"" Rendell is at it again. Now that he is comfortably in his second term as governor, the ""Tax Man"" is unleashing his true agenda. Tax and spend the working person's hard-earned money. Increasing the sales tax from 6 to 7 percent, increasing the tax on cigarettes by 10 or 11 cents, new fees on electric bills, possibly increasing the gas tax and driver's license/registration fees. This is a direct burden on the working class of this state.
\
As a working single homeowner, each of these tax increases will directly take money out of my pocket and place it in the hands of the ""Tax Man."" The governor has shown no fiscal restraint when it comes to spending taxpayers' money. In his first term, Mr. Rendell created the emissions tax, allowed local municipalities to raise the ""privilege to work tax"" from $10 to $52 each year, added countless new high-paid positions on the gaming commission and my favorite, allowing the obscene pay raise to elected officials.
\
I believe it is time to look at cutting waste out of the budget instead of creating more. I hope the House and Senate put a stop to this out-of-control spending.
\
Another four years of this administration's tax and spend policy and the working person of this state would be better off stop working and go on public relief.

Halt wild spending on county level
\
Editor: I must agree with the Archbald resident whose Feb. 4 letter to the editor criticized the Lackawanna County commissioners.
\
The tax and spend policies of this administration far exceeds the past administration. When we were promised a 25 percent reduction in taxes -- an unfulfilled election promise -- we were instead hit with a 48 percent increase. The reason, they said, was due to the past administration's bill-paying practices. But this administration's spending practices have increased the county's indebtedness in the last three years.
\
Now the ""Yankees Are Coming"" is a huge smokescreen to downplay the mistakes of this administration. County residents will be promised many more things by the next set of candidates, but who and what can you believe?
\
The $500,000 for the Sorvino film was our money, not theirs. The Taj Mahal of a transportation center that they are building and the selling of the DPW building and land, only to rent the building and buy back one acre, are just nonsense.
\
It's time to take government back a step and make politicians accountable for their actions. I intend to petition the Board of Elections to put a referendum on the ballot to not allow a tax increase by any governing body in excess of 10 percent in one year, unless the governing body can show that there will not be any unnecessary increase in spending.

Warming warnings get cold shoulder
\
Editor: The articles about climate change on the front page of the Feb. 2 and 3 papers deserve some elucidation to help put the situation in perspective.
\
In 1896, Svante Arrhenius -- a Danish Nobelist -- postulated the possibility of man-made global warming. He found that the percentage of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was increasing as a result of emissions from power generation associated with the industrial revolution. Remember that automobiles were not a factor at that time. The greenhouse effect of certain chemicals such as carbon dioxide was already well understood in those days. However, the possibility of any major effect resulting from man-made greenhouse gas changes was still considered to be quite remote.
\
The scientific community did not pay much attention to the problem until the 1950s. When they began to study the situation in detail, they found the carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere was increasing at an uncomfortably rapid pace. The science of global temperature and climate changes was still in its infancy. About all that could be said was that there was a likelihood of anthropogenic (man-made) global warming. There was little specific information.
\
The scientific community tried to get the populace to recognize that caution was in order. However, all they could say was that there was a major change in the atmosphere which indicated the possibility, and even probability, of other dramatic changes.
\
In 1969 the American Chemical Society published a book, ""Cleaning Our Environment --The Chemical Basis For Action."" The book pointed out that carbon dioxide was not generally treated as a pollutant, but basically only because there was no known way to filter it out at the source. The only way to stop polluting with carbon dioxide was to stop burning fossil fuels (e.g., coal and oil).
\
However, the book also stated that by definition, carbon dioxide is a pollutant. In addition, the book pointed out that there are probably other materials (e.g., methane) with which mankind is increasing the greenhouse gas content of the atmosphere.
\
The United States' performance with regard to global warming since 1970 has been the equivalent of driving a car at breakneck speed, on a pitch black night, with the headlights not working, and then refusing to apply the brakes until the car lights came on so we could see if the was any danger. More specifically, do nothing to stop increasing the carbon dioxide emissions until the scientists had established exactly what the dangers of such emissions are.
\
Recently, there has been recognition that glaciers are receding at an unduly rapid rate as well as that there are many other measurable changes attributable to global warming, i.e., global warming is much more advanced than we had realized. It is not only our grandchildren who will suffer because we selfishly chose to ignore the warning of global warming, but also our children and maybe some of us alive today. With the article in the Feb. 2 paper, the headlights are back on.
\
Although President Bush and Karl Rove are hardly the only ones to ignore the signals foretelling global warming and the associated climate changes, they have certainly led the way. They both thrive on fooling the public. One hopes that finally they now, at least, understand you cannot fool Mother Nature.

Humans clearly part of the problem
\
Editor: The Feb. 3 Weather Wise column by Scott Stuccio made it clear that Mr. Stuccio, who claims it is his job ""to predict weather conditions and give facts -- not opinions,"" does have an opinion.
\
He implied that global warming was not really happening because it was so cold during the week in much of the country. He also said that ""Anyone with a solid education can figure out that the natural cycle of weather patterns that circulate the globe are like an oscillating wave. It may take time, but eventually a global cooling will take place.""
\
What he did not say is how long that would be. Thousands of years, maybe? The outdoor temperature this week is not an indication of global cooling or warming. The melting of glaciers, the average earth mean temperature and the temperature of the oceans are some of the things that show that the earth is warming.
\
Noted scientists around the world are telling us that we have a serious global warming problem and what we humans are doing is part of that problem. Let's listen to them.

421,"
As the thermometer rose Tuesday, so did expectations at the Tasty Baking Co. It was braced to shut down a production line and empty a few freezers. All to save a bundle on energy costs.
\
That never happened. Demand on the electric grid that supplies power to the Mid-Atlantic never got high enough to require such cutbacks.
\
It peaked at 136,716 megawatts at 4:50 p.m. - not a record.
\
But across the region, Tasty and an increasing number of companies, hospitals, and universities - all large users of electricity - are lining up to offer energy reductions on such hot days.
\
Places as varied as the Comcast Center in Philadelphia, a produce cold-storage facility in Ephrata, a Chester County mushroom producer, and a North Penn water-treatment plant are ready to turn the temperature up on thermostats, to cycle a building's air handlers, to shut off equipment that could just as well run at night - all to reduce power use during hours of peak demand.
\
Each has a financial incentive to do it.
\
Many programs exist with utilities or other companies that, as ""aggregators,"" can deliver demand reductions in return for lower energy payments.
\
The initiative is a response to an ever more stressed grid, run by PJM Interconnection in 13 states. In a command center in suburban Philadelphia, operators must match demand with supply.
\
The base load of power is provided by plants that can make power cheaply and cleanly. But as demand rises, PJM instructs plants that are more expensive and more polluting to rev up.
\
The cost of energy skyrockets at such moments. Last year, it ranged from 7 cents a kilowatt hour to 22 cents. Most customers don't see that fluctuation in their bills, but every charge reflects the cost of electricity overall.
\
Ultimately, as demand on the grid trends upward, new power plants might be needed.
\
Conversely, the grid can get ""virtual generation"" by asking large users to cut back.
\
This is both cheaper and faster, PJM spokesman Ray Dotter said. ""It takes a while for a power plant to get up to full output"" - not to mention building a new one - ""whereas you can stop using power fairly instantly,"" he said.
\
Stabilizing the grid leads to energy security for the nation, energy officials say.
\
""Each time we properly manage the system so that we can pull power demand off, that's less new generation we need to build,"" said Tom Tuffey, director of the nonprofit PennFuture's Center for Energy, Enterprise and the Environment.
\
Nationally, ""we feel like managing demand is a huge piece of the puzzle,"" said Katherine Hamilton, president of the advocacy group GridWise Alliance. ""You can make fairly minor adjustments and get major benefits.""
\
Homes, too
\
With technology and finesse, some buildings can reduce their loads - if only for a short time - by 20 percent or more.
\
Power reduction now is reaching even into our homes.
\
PSE&G in New Jersey has signed up about 100,000 residential and small-business customers who let the utility regulate central air conditioners via a small device on each unit.
\
When the utility gets the word from PJM, a microwave signal instructs each air conditioner to cycle off more often. If the unit was running 40 minutes an hour before, it may drop to 20 minutes.
\
Raymond Fernandez, director of demand management at PSE&G, said that through the program the utility can shed as much as 65 megawatts of power - about the capacity of a small coal-fired plant.
\
Customers who commit themselves to the program for two years - reachable at 800-854-4444 - get a $50 rebate plus a ""new thermostat worth $200,"" said Fernandez. Or, they can cancel at any time, but get only $4 a month, June through September.
\
No sweat
\
Peco has just introduced a similar program - reachable at 1-888-573-2672 - giving participants a $30 credit per month from June to September.
\
Peco has about 200 business customers signed up for demand management programs. One is mandatory. When a ""curtailment event"" is called, the company must cut back and receive a discounted electric rate throughout the year.
\
The second program is voluntary. Companies get a lesser financial incentive, but they are not penalized for declining to cut back when requested.
\
Malvern-based Liberty Property Trust, which owns 750 buildings, has enrolled 10 of its ""average"" office buildings in one of the Peco programs.
\
Thermostats typically are set at 70 to 74 degrees, said sustainability manager Marla Thalheimer. When the grid is overtaxed, temperatures might go up by one to four degrees while lights dim. ""In a perfect world,"" she said, ""people won't even know the difference.""
\
""If you're the tenant, we don't want you sweating in the dark on a hot day,"" she added.
\
Universities have also been among the first to embrace demand-side management.
\
The University of Pennsylvania has agreed to shed three megawatts of power on demand. Last month, the university conducted a test run to verify how much it could cut back.
\
Officials were astounded when power use fell 13 megawatts - a 21 percent drop.
\
Entire offices went dark while staff members convened for meetings in a building's central location - or even in a nearby ice cream parlor.
\
Meanwhile, yes, the air handlers in some buildings were less active. Temperatures rose.
\
Did people notice? ""The answer is that some did, and some did not,"" said Ken Ogawa, executive director of operations and maintenance. ""In our case, it was only a one-hour action.""
\
The trick to occupant satisfaction is to cut power elegantly, not just cut off the lights and the air-conditioning, he said.
\
Drexel University has embarked on a project with the Conshohocken company Viridity Energy, which Tuffey said was taking demand-side management one step further by offering real-time reductions.
\
While other companies often work a day ahead, prescheduling load reductions, Viridity's advanced software can factor in current energy prices, potential reductions, and ""essentially sell that reduction back to the grid,"" said company president Audrey Zibelman, formerly PJM's chief operating officer.
\
""We don't wait for the grid operator to identify the opportunity for us,"" she said. ""We identify the opportunity for the customer by allowing them to make an economic decision and voluntarily contribute reductions to the grid when it economically makes sense.""
\
Drexel is installing equipment so it can operate as a micro-grid, managing not only its power use, but eventually incorporating renewable power sources such as solar arrays and wind generation.
\
Typically, ""loads have not been controllable,"" said Chika Nwankpa, director of Drexel's Center for Electric Power Engineering.
\
""Now, we're entering this new frontier where we can transform these buildings to where they look to the grid like a virtual generator.""

422,"Don't be misled on role of married priests\The present scandal affecting the Roman Catholic Church in the United States, concerning the sexual abuse of minors by some members of the clergy, is sad and disturbing to many people and for many reasons. Regretfully, there are those who have tried to capitalize on this issue by promoting their own agendas, such as the ordination of women and a married clergy.\It is reprehensible, however, to exploit this tragic time in the church and cause great confusion among the faithful with misinformation regarding the alleged ministry of priests who were dispensed from their priestly obligations (that is, laicized), enabling them to enter a valid Catholic marriage. Such was the intent of the author and the result of the article ""Church rules allow active role for married priests"" (Community Voices, May 12).\The first admission by Joseph McOscar, a dispensed priest, is that he officiates at marriages and that he ""witnessed about 75 marriages last year alone."" According to the canon law of the Catholic Church, any marriage ""witnessed"" by McOscar, or by any dispensed priest, is absolutely invalid in the eyes of the church; it is as though the marriage never took place.\While it is true that ""a dispensed priest is still sacramentally a priest"" due to the permanent nature of the sacrament of Holy Orders, it is false to state, as McOscar does, that the ""dispensation only relieves him of the obligations of the clerical state.""\The Code of Canon Law, as well as the document from Rome that informs the priest he has been dispensed by the Holy Father, and which the dispensed priest is required to sign in acceptance of this favor, states unequivocally that this action ""inseparably includes a dispensation from sacred celibacy, and, at the same time, loss of the clerical state."" In addition to losing the rights proper to the clerical state and no longer being bound by its obligations, the document states that a dispensed priest is also ""excluded from the exercise of the sacred ministry,"" with the sole exception of hearing confession and granting sacramental absolution for someone in danger of death. This exception is granted, not as a privilege for the dispensed priest to exercise whenever he so desires, but as an extraordinary accommodation to the person who is in danger of death, for the sake of that person's own spiritual welfare.\McOscar writes that ""there should be no question regarding baptism administered by a married priest since anyone ... can baptize in a situation of need."" The operative phrase is in a situation of need. Certainly, no lay person, which means also a dispensed priest, is to baptize someone outside of a genuine case of necessity, such as danger of death.\Regarding bringing Holy Communion to the sick, a dispensed priest is explicitly prohibited from doing so, in accord with the document informing him of his dispensation, which states that he ""is not able to function ... in the distribution of Eucharistic Communion."" McOscar states that ""any priest is allowed to anoint the sick if there is adequate reason."" The truth is that a dispensed priest is prohibited from administering the sacrament of Anointing of the Sick, since he is excluded from the exercise of the sacred ministry. For this same reason, a priest who has been dispensed is strictly forbidden from celebrating Mass, even if requested by well-meaning individuals. The shortage of priests is no excuse for the unlawful celebration of such a sacred act as the Mass.\McOscar asks, ""How can I resume my ministry after having been dispensed and allowed to marry?"" Well, the answer, simply put, is, he cannot! Instead, what he is doing as an alleged ""service"" to certain members of the Catholic faithful is actually a fraudulent disservice. The so-called ""understanding of the Code of Canon Law"" McOscar proposes, is, in effect, a false interpretation meant to justify his own unlawful and, at times, invalid actions.\There are many priests who have been laicized who are faithful to the church and who take part in its life in a manner consistent with the lay state. These men, who have proven themselves as most loving sons of the church, are to be commended for their fidelity to the church's laws.\On the other hand, McOscar, and those dispensed priests who offer similar services to the faithful, are acting in contradiction to the church's teaching and laws, and are leading others to do the same, despite any arguments they make to the contrary.\The law of the church is clear, and no Catholic should be misled by McOscar's duplicitous article.\Msgr. Alexander J. Palmieri\Philadelphia\ \Msgr. Palmieri is licensed in canon law and is the chancellor for the Archdiocese of Philadelphia.\ \The benefits of electric-industry deregulation\Three recent articles (Inquirer, May 19, 22 and 24) examined the state of retail electric deregulation, and debated the validity of the new marketplace and benefits from competition. Such an evaluation should examine conditions before and after the retail deregulation law was enacted five years ago in Pennsylvania.\Success in utility deregulation has meant different things to various parties. Those widely divergent views created our market, and on balance, the shift to this new environment has been quite successful.\Partly, it's a matter of how we define success. I would offer that electric competition has brought significant value, such as:\Savings over the last five years of $560 million, resulting from rate reductions that offered Peco customers immediate benefits from industry restructuring.\Rate caps through 2010 that provide the longest period of rate stability in history, dating back to 1990, a predictability that helps all customers manage their energy costs and will help to attract businesses to the area.\A 10-year transition period recognized the need for competitive wholesale and retail markets to develop while providing protections against California-like electricity price spikes and threats to service reliability, and a market environment that will attract necessary new generation investment.\Consumers have more choices in a deregulated environment, including alternative suppliers, the option of being served by their local utility, and different product offerings such as premium ""green"" solar and wind power.\Deregulation has resulted in a more customer-focused, efficient utility with improved reliability and customer service and new products and services, such as enhanced outage notification, e-billing, online usage analysis, and expanded demand side management.\New local investment in power generation and an active wholesale energy and capacity market that invites participation from independent generators and marketers.\Unfortunately, our overall economy has changed. The dot-coms have vanished, and investment in new ventures has declined significantly. Such factors have limited opportunities for new entrants to our market.\Over time, energy markets will further evolve and, ultimately, consumers will remain in the driver's seat. That's what it's all about.\Ken Lawrence\President\Peco Energy Co.\Philadelphia\Courts and rights\The writers objecting to Mark Bowden's reservations on an international court treaty (Letters, May 18) ignored the main reservation: Such a treaty would override the civil, criminal and legal protections afforded Americans by our Constitution.\If you want an international court system, if you want Americans to die fighting all over the world upholding that system, then give us a treaty that provides those rights to all nationals the world over. I don't think China, Saudi Arabia and the African dictatorships will sign on to that concept.\Jack Schmohl\Levittown\jschmohl@pioneer.net\Appreciating America\The other day, my 14-year-old son wanted to know why people had changed so much in their loyalty or patriotism toward America after Sept 11. ""What were they thinking before Sept 11?"" he asked. I enthusiastically agreed with him. Tragedy can make us feel more dedicated to preventing its causes, or more vulnerable, or more compassionate. But why would it make us rethink how we regard our country? I appreciated America before, as I do now. And I'm glad my son does, too.\Neil Greenberg\Melrose Park\gfggroup@aol.com\Mother's Day gift\While watching the news on a Saturday night, I questioned why local news had to focus on such harshly negative stories. Then, on Mother's Day morning, I read the uplifting story of the Marfisi women (Inquirer, May 12). Thank you, Mike Vitez, for sharing the lives of some beautiful mothers on Mother's Day.\Jeanne Grimes\Haddonfield\ \ \Credit: "
423,"
Like many Americans, Tina Brunetti worries about climate change and wanted to spend her household's energy budget on a power supplier more mindful of the environment.
\
But the Chadds Ford pharmacist said she was overwhelmed with conflicting information from electricity suppliers that promised ""green"" alternatives, including some offers from acquaintances who peddled electricity plans in their spare time.
\
""The quantity of information was way too much,"" she said. ""I was getting bombarded with offers from people I knew.""
\
Rather than choosing a new supplier, Brunetti opted to stay with the default service provided by the local utility, Peco Energy Co., even though much of its supply is what green-power advocates derisively call ""brown"" power.
\
Like Brunetti, about 65 percent of Peco's customers have chosen to stick with the utility's power supply, despite an array of alternatives, including discount suppliers and green-energy producers.
\
Though 34 percent of Americans surveyed by Gallup in March said they worry a ""great deal"" about the environment, that has not translated into a mass exodus from conventional power suppliers.
\
Only 141,786 Pennsylvania customers, or about 2.5 percent of the state's 5.7 million electricity customers, have chosen a clean-energy supplier, according to the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission's 2013 numbers, the latest available.
\
(New Jersey offers Electric Choice, but the market is more opaque than Pennsylvania's, and the state offers no independent one-stop shopping.)
\
Green power's higher cost is one reason few customers switch. But there's also a crowded bazaar of suppliers offering a dizzying menu of options.
\
The PUC's power-shopping website, papowerswitch.com, lists 117 offers for Peco Energy residential customers from 57 suppliers.
\
When the list is filtered to include only renewable-energy offers, there are still 45 deals to compare. Of those, 13 derive some or all of their power from Pennsylvania renewable sources. Ten get some or all of it from Pennsylvania wind turbines.
\
And those are just the suppliers listed with the PUC. Other green-energy suppliers, such as the Washington-based nonprofit Groundswell, engage in more direct-marketing methods through environmental organizations and community groups.
\
Green-energy customers are highly desired by the industry because they are more likely to remain loyal to their suppliers than customers who shop strictly for price.
\
""A customer on a renewable-energy product has actively decided what is important to them and has selected their supplier accordingly,"" said Ritchie Hudson, Pennsylvania chairman of the Retail Energy Supply Association, a trade group.
\
Yet price still matters for some renewable-energy customers. So a word of caution to those who might be shopping right now: Summer is typically the worst time of year to test the market because wholesale prices tend to be higher.
\
Plus, Peco's ""price-to-compare,"" the cost it charges customers who don't shop, is set until the end of August at its lowest point since Pennsylvania adopted market rates in 2011. At 8.2 cents a kilowatt hour, Peco's price is very difficult for any supplier to beat, much less a green-energy provider.
\
Still, several green-energy suppliers now offer short-term introductory fixed-rate deals lower than Peco's rate: Green Mountain Energy; Frontier Energy; NRG Home; Oasis Energy; and Talen Energy.
\
Most renewable suppliers come in at least 10 percent or 20 percent higher. One producer quotes a rate 68 percent above Peco's. That would cost a typical Peco customer about $38 more a month.
\
A decision to go green is further complicated by the different types of energy supply available.
\
The terms ""green"" energy and ""renewable"" energy are often used interchangeably by marketers. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says renewable-energy technologies rely on non-diminishing fuel sources such as sun, wind, moving water, organic plant and waste material, and the earth's heat (geothermal). But some renewable-energy technologies, such as large hydroelectric dams, can have adverse environmental trade-offs. ""Green power"" is a superior subset of renewable power, according to the EPA.
\
For some consumers, the source of renewable energy is an important aspect of their clean-energy decision. Many suppliers buy renewable-energy credits from giant Midwestern wind farms, which are much cheaper than credits from Pennsylvania producers.
\
The Energy Co-op, a Philadelphia member-owned organization with about 3,000 electricity customers, takes pride in offering wind and solar power generated in Pennsylvania. Its solar energy is derived from individuals in the area, to whom it pays above-market prices to incentivize solar adoption.
\
But its prices range from 27 percent to 35 percent above Peco's current price, and its membership rolls have been static, largely because of a lack of marketing, said Glenn Smith, the co-op's new executive director.
\
""For us as a cooperative, it's important to offer a Pennsylvania product,"" Smith said. ""What we're trying to convey to our members is that we're paying more for a product that has local benefits, and that resonates with many of our members.""
\
To an extent, all customers in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware already derive some electricity from green producers by virtue of state mandates that require an increasing percentage of power to come from qualified renewable sources.
\
New Jersey's renewable portfolio standard will require 22.5 percent renewable power by 2021. Delaware will require 25 percent by 2025.
\
Pennsylvania's alternative-energy portfolio standard, created in 2004, requires 18 percent of the supply from alternative sources by 2021.
\
The Pennsylvania law is not as strict as those in neighboring states because it allows more than half of its power to come from ""Tier II"" sources, including waste coal, distributed generation systems, demand-side management, large-scale hydro, municipal solid waste, wood pulping and manufacturing by-products, and coal-to-gas technology.
\
In the current renewable-energy fiscal year, which began June 1, Pennsylvania suppliers must obtain 13.7 percent of their power from alternative suppliers: 8.2 percent from the Tier II sources; 0.25 percent from solar; and 5.25 percent from non-solar Tier I sources, primarily wind.

Renewable energy provides a growing amount of the U.S. electricity supply, but it still accounts for a small percentage compared with the Big Three: coal, natural gas, and nuclear.
\
In 2013, renewable power provided about 13 percent of the nation's energy, according to the Energy Information Administration. Hydroelectric power accounted for about half of that.
\
Wind energy accounted for 4 percent of the nation's power production. Solar energy, for all the attention it gets, accounted for 9 million megawatt hours, or 0.2 percent of the more than 4 billion MWh produced by the U.S. power industry.
\
By comparison, fossil fuels, primarily coal and natural gas, accounted for 67 percent of electricity production. Nuclear power accounted for 19 percent.
\
Pennsylvania, which exports power to other states, generated 1.5 percent of its power from wind and 0.2 percent from solar. Fossil fuels accounted for 61 percent, and nuclear provided 35 percent.
\
New Jersey, a net importer of power from other states, is a leading producer of solar power, which accounts for 0.7 percent of state production. Wind accounts for 0.02 percent. Nuclear reactors account for 51 percent of the Garden State's production.- Andrew Maykuth

424," Before buying into conventional wisdom about environmental programs hurting the economy and costing jobs, maybe you'd better save your energy.\ That's the message of a study prepared for the Campaign for an Environmental Economy. The study found that investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies totaling $25.2 billion over the next 26 years would yield a $53.3 billion savings in energy costs in Pennsylvania and annually create an average of 23,000 jobs.\ Such a recasting of energy priorities -- including more energy-efficient residential, industrial and commercial buildings, lighting, automobiles, refrigerators and industrial motors -- also would have environmental benefits, shrinking carbon emissions in the state by up to 13 million tons annually, and reducing air pollution, acid rain, mine water pollution and radioactive waste.\ ""This study makes the strong case that increased investment in 'clean' energy sources wins for the environment and the economy,"" said David Hamilton, Campaign for an Environmental Economy project director. ""It shoots down the popular myth that environmental gain necessarily means economic pain.""\ The study by the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, a Washington D.C.,-based research organization, found Pennsylvania's energy bill is almost 8.8 percent of its Gross State Product, while the United States as a whole spends only 8.2 percent of its Gross Domestic Product on energy.\ Such energy over-consumption can be a drag on the state's economy, the study said, and urged Pennsylvania to develop an energy efficiency plan and work to have business, industry and the public ""buy into it.""\ ""We're not talking about a decrease in consumption, so we're not threatening existing coal and energy jobs,"" Hamilton said. ""What we are trying to do is recommend a policy aimed at lowering the state's anticipated energy growth. To do that, we need a broad-based effort backed by the people of Pennsylvania.""\ Daniel Desmond, executive director of the state Energy Office, endorsed the study findings, adding that demonstration programs promoting use of alternative fuels and demand-side management of electric usage through retrofitting state office buildings are already under way."

County did audit, should collect taxes
\
Editor: In your April 12 front-page story, Single Tax Office solicitor John McGovern is quoted as saying, ""...nobody asked for the ... audit for so many years. No one from the city, school district or county. Where were they for the last four years?""
\
I assume Mr. McGovern did not mean to include the county, but in his frustration he did. He forgot that the county conducted an audit in 2007, which resulted in $256,000 being identified as overpaid county taxes and another $198,000 of interest.
\
Since January 2004 I have stated my displeasure with the Single Tax Office, not its employees, but the system of tax collection itself. Your newspaper has labeled me as the STO ""antagonist"" because of my constant request of accountability. It was so bad in 2004 that our revenue and finance department had to establish procedures whereby remittances of collected taxes were done on a regular basis.
\
I also questioned why the controller's office never did yearly audits of STO as required by law. Finally in 2007, then-controller John Mellow added a CPA to his staff and conducted an audit of 2001 through 2006. The results benefited the taxpayers to the tune of $454,000. I do not know how we are going to audit 2007.
\
Mr. McGovern is correct in saying that the city and school district never did audits. Answers from the city have been provided, but no one has asked the school district why it never did an audit. Perhaps, by law, it is not required to perform one.
\
I believe the county should collect its own taxes. It would result in efficiency, accountability and cost savings.
\
In March 2008 I asked our representatives in Harrisburg to consider changing the 80-year-old law that allowed the Single Tax Office to collect county real estate taxes within the city limits. We are researching as to how the STO received authority to collect county taxes outside of the city.
\
The county commissioners will be responsible for the process of selecting a single collection office for all earned income taxes throughout the county. The law will eliminate 30 income tax collectors, which will ease the burden in 2012. It is assumed that the STO will be one of the bidders. However, that is three years away and the taxpayers cannot wait that long for accountability.

Demand declines; don't build line here
\
Editor: PPL has failed to prove there is a need for the Susquehanna Roseland Transmission Line, and should not be allowed to pass along the billion-dollar cost to regional ratepayers. The rationale given to construct Line B was an anticipated 1.4 percent demand increase. But demand for electricity in the region was actually down this past summer: the 2008 unrestricted peak declined 10,000 megawatts from 2007, with further declines expected this year.
\
As demand declined, PPL's profits decreased and Pennsylvania workers have been laid off. But PPL investors would get a 12 percent to 14 percent guaranteed rate of return for the project, and continue to profit by exporting cheaper coal and nuclear electricity into New Jersey.
\
The state and county have spent millions of dollars to preserve the unique ecosystem barrens on Moosic Mountain and prevent fragmentation from development. Comprehensive environmental impact studies are needed to understand the line's effect on the barrens' rare plant communities, upon which at least 18 rare species depend.
\
Before we approve new transmission lines, a comprehensive regional energy plan is needed with the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and minimizing environmental impact. This plan should maximize non-polluting local renewable energy generation, offshore wind, efficiency, demand side management, and smart grid technologies. Impacts of anticipated natural gas and sprawl development can be considered, along with transmission lines that support wind.
\
Attend PPL's open houses to emphasize comprehensive planning is needed to protect the environment and taxpayers in Northeast Pennsylvania.

Editor: Your April 9 editorial ""Good call, ND"" suggests that the bishops who criticize Barack Obama's visit to that school are hypocrites by making several points that are in conflict with their basic beliefs.
\
Most of these could be debated, but I find fault in some of your initial points. To say that Dick Cheney opposes any law banning gay marriage (most likely because of his daughter) is one thing, but to compare his ""view"" with Barack Obama's proactive pursuit of legislation to promote abortion on demand at any stage is reprehensible.
\
Moreover, you claim that the execution rate was high when George Bush was governor of Texas. This may well be contrary to church doctrine, but common sense dictates that equating a vicious convicted murderer to that of unborn baby in its mother's womb is at best, pure nonsense.

Smart grid trumps more dumb lines
\
Editor: Long-distance interstate transmission lines are part of an inefficient transmission line system designed to export power to other states for profit, not benefit the residents of Pennsylvania. Global warming requires us to have better transmission line siting policies, with the goal of reducing energy consumption while maximizing the use of local nonpolluting renewable energy resources.
\
Ratepayers will absorb the billion-dollar price tag for overbuilt interstate transmission lines, like PPL's proposed Susquehanna Roseland Line B.
\
Ironically, Pennsylvania utility companies are required by Act 129 to reduce demand at the very same time they propose to build an infrastructure to accommodate an increase in demand. According to the Energy Information Administration, in 2008 electric demand actually fell by 1.6 percent and is expected to fall by another 1.8 percent this year. Peak demand declined for 2008 for the intended service area of the transmission line and further declines are predicted.
\
Recent testimony before a House subcommittee on energy and the environment revealed that smaller, locally distributed generation projects, which benefit the Pennsylvania consumer and economy most, require little transmission line upgrade and can be developed faster than traditional utility scale generation.
\
In addition, new cap and trade policies emphasize investment in smart grid technologies that utilize new digital technology for better demand-side management. These technologies, along with compatible appliances and equipment, can help identify when and where energy demand is high, enabling users to adjust how much energy is used, and when.
\
Unfortunately, Pennsylvania utilities continue to submit proposals for individual transmission lines without regard to regional carbon reduction, efficiency initiatives, smart grid technologies or the new green economy.
\
More than 50 percent of our nation's power is already fueled by dirty coal and environmental groups predict that these massive power lines will rely on even more coal-generated power. To realize President Obama's vision of the development of smart grid for renewable energy, a priority for any massive transmission line investments should focus specifically on supporting off-shore wind development for the East Coast, and appropriately scaled upgrades for in-state distributed energy generation.
\
Please attend the public meeting Thursday from 5 to 8 p.m. at the Abington Community Library in Clarks Summit to show your support for regional planning that truly creates a new Pennsylvania Smart Grid, not more dumb lines.

Halt power play
\
Editor: I agree with Martha McAndrew's June 29 letter concerning the proposed 500-kilovolt power line that PPL is seeking to build from the Berwick area, north and east across the region and into the New York City metro area.
\
It is not too late to halt this monstrosity, which will do little, if anything, to benefit local residents. The only beneficiaries will be those in the metro area, who will have the least invested.
\
The reasons for the new line cited by David G. De-Campli, president of PPL Electric Utilities, in his May 31 op-ed, are vague at best. It lacks specific details as to how the line will benefit Northeast Pennsylvania.
\
Ten acres (including a pond and wetlands) upon which I live will be permanently disrupted if this project proceeds. This does not include tens of acres more adjoining the right-of-way, which will become virtually worthless due to their proximity to the gargantuan towers. Nor does this include the tens of acres for a proposed housing development on the opposite side of the line. A neighbor's home will be directly under the line (if he is allowed to keep it), and a dozen or more families in the area will have their property values reduced to pocket change if the line is built.
\
I would oppose the new line even if it did not directly impact my home. Anyone who has a view of West Mountain and the other mountaintops comprising the view for much of the county will be negatively impacted. The new towers to be built alongside the current power line and towers that scar the ridges will dwarf the current towers.
\
If the health, aesthetic, environmental and property values aren't enough of a concern, the new line will cost hundreds of millions of dollars, most of which will be borne by PPL customers who are about to be hit with a massive rate increase. Yet the local benefits, as put forth by PPL, will be minimal at best, with the lion's share of the power going to New York and New Jersey residents.
\
It is obvious that the potential harms from this project far outweigh the benefits (if any) to the region as a whole.
\
The next PUC hearing on the proposed line will be Thursday at 5 p.m. in the Abington Community Library in Clarks Summit.

Cuts too severe

Editor: Public broadcasting in the United States is a unique endeavor. This is largely true because it draws support, unlike commercial television, from multiple sources: federal and state funding, business sponsors and especially public subscriptions.

This enables it to be independent and unbiased in its programming. However, this is now threatened by a state budget that is eliminating PBS funding. In difficult times, a reduction in support may be justified, but elimination of all support puts in jeopardy the entire enterprise.

There is an answer to this dilemma. Pennsylvania has one of the largest, most costly state governments. We have more state representatives and senators, with larger incomes and expense accounts, than we need. They get cars, mileage allowances and they get paid an extra ""per-diem"" just to show up.

That means encouraging the use of energy-saving light bulbs, offering energy audits for homes and businesses to help them use electricity more efficiently and even offering loans to companies for efficiency improvements.\ Pennsylvania's electric utilities, which sell about $9 billion of power annually, earlier this year pledged to increase their spending on conservation programs by about $50 million in 1995.\ Though environmental groups have criticized the pledge as insufficient, utilities say they are on the way to learning more about saving energy now to avoid adding more capacity later.\ ""If you manage demand well, maybe you could put off building a new power plant that would have cost you a lot of money that you can't afford to spend right now,"" Schoumacher said.\ ""It's a business decision, of course, but sometimes business decisions can be good for everyone.""\ Just before Memorial Day, the institute kicked off a program in which 18 utilities offered customers who turn in a charcoal grill or gas mower a $50 coupon toward the purchase of an electric grill or mower.\ The offer came a few weeks after the Environmental Protection Agency reported estimates that 10 percent of the nation's air pollution comes from ""off-road"" engines such as garden tools and equipment.\ Also, the EPA estimates that the nation's 83 million gasoline mowers produce as much pollution as 3.5 million cars.

429,"Ah, the 1990s: Sport-utilities ruled the roads. Computers, printers, and other office gadgets invaded homes. Energy to feed them was cheap and plentiful.\Conservation fell casualty to Americans' increasingly energy-dependent lifestyles.\But indulgence came at a price: As consumers have discovered via soaring gasoline prices and winter heating bills, payback time has arrived. And deregulation of the electricity industry could lead to similar sticker shock in coming years.\Now, New Power Co., a competitive electricity supplier based in Purchase, N.Y., is giving consumers a way to prepare for that day. In Philadelphia and Houston, it has begun testing an electronic gizmo that lets the utility control home heating and cooling systems, plus some lights and appliances, via the Internet.\Postal worker Bill Dobbins, who lives near the Franklin Mills Mall, is among the 300 Philadelphia-area volunteers trying out the high-tech devices.\One, a remote temperature control, lets New Power adjust Dobbins' thermostat by two to six degrees via signals sent over the Internet, so that his heating and cooling system conserves power.\Dobbins said he joined the experiment because he was ""interested in that type of thing."" Plus, ""there's the monetary reward.""\New Power is paying volunteers $25 to $75 to participate in the program through September.\For New Power, which is backed by Enron Corp. of Houston, the money is a pittance compared with the juicy customer data the test program should reveal.\""What we're really interested in is consumer behavior,"" said Tim Vail, New Power's vice president of energy technology solutions. He said the company wanted to know whether consumers would use the new system, and how they would use it.\New Power and other electricity providers think the setup can save them big bucks when supply on the electric grid is tight. Vail said the company was examining how to share some of those savings with customers if the program was delivered to a wider audience in coming years.\The company has divided this summer's test into three parts. The first uses an automated electricity meter, which will keep tabs on a household's daily energy use and help New Power understand typical consumption patterns.\The second part is a heating and air-conditioning control pilot, like the one installed in Dobbins' home. It commandeers a consumer's thermostat and adjusts it two to six degrees as directed by New Power. The consumer can override the automatic commands.\""You can't give them a widget and ask them while they're in the middle of a dinner party to sweat,"" said Lou Budike, president of Powerweb Technologies, an energy software company in Media that is negotiating with New Power to provide more detailed usage information to consumers online.\Part three of the test lets consumers remotely change their thermostats or switch lights on and off using any Internet device - a trick, the company says, that could come in handy for discouraging burglars and for conserving power while away on vacation.\The centerpiece of New Power's experiment - giving a utility the ability to control customer devices when needed - is a twist on an old theme in the electricity business: Get enough large customers off the power grid when demand is highest and you greatly reduce the risk of blackouts.\Power on the wholesale market is also most expensive at times of day when demand is highest. So getting big users off the system can save money for the power company.\In New Power's experiment, a ""big user"" is actually a bunch of small customers who have agreed to let New Power automatically adjust their thermostats based on conditions in the regional energy market.\New Power calls the plan ""joint energy management.""\It remains to be seen, though, whether companies such as New Power can corral enough small customers in this manner to turn a profit.\Even with small-business customers, ""the margin on that size of account is not tremendous,"" said Jean-Louis Poirier, an energy analyst with PA Consulting Group in Washington.\""The residential market is very difficult,"" Poirier said, because the cost of signing on a residential customer can range from $200 to $700.\Still, he said these ""demand-side management"" programs had great potential for savings.\""In the industrial and commercial market, many times you can save 15 to 20 percent with both changes in customer behavior and capital investment,"" Poirier said.\Under state law, retail prices for electricity in Pennsylvania are capped for several years. For Peco Energy Co.'s customers, the cap lasts through 2006 for transmission and distribution charges and through 2010 for generation charges.\After this safe harbor for consumers expires, utilities can pass along more costs to their customers.\In a deregulated environment, this could mean alarming price increases if consumer demand cannot be quickly reconciled with supply.\That, in simple terms, explains California's electricity crisis of the last several months: Retail customers had no incentive to respond to the turmoil in wholesale power markets until it was too late.\But, generally speaking, customers on alternative plans that adjust rates based on demand or time of day can receive big discounts or rebates over plain vanilla rates - if they use electricity at the right time.\For instance, consumers willing to dry clothes late in the evening instead of during peak hours of electricity use could pay less for the electricity they use. Conversely, they could wind up paying more by running the dryers during peak times.\It's an idea regulators want to see more of.\This year, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission ordered all utilities serving the state to implement programs that deal with the customer, or demand, side of the energy equation.\While Peco has a time-of-use rate available for residential and other customer classes, a spokesman, Michael Wood, said it was not heavily marketed.\The company is, however, starting its own pilot program this month with 50 Delaware County customers, offering a ""smart thermostat"" similar to New Power's. Peco will offer a discount to customers who let it raise their thermostats two to four degrees for up to four hours at a time when demand for electricity is high.\""Without that, there's no strong incentive for consumers to conserve when they don't see the benefit on a real-time basis,"" Wood said.\Vail said that by next summer, New Power hoped to offer homeowners throughout its territory a product based on the technologies in its pilot program.\Akweli Parker's e-mail address is aparker@phillynews.com.\ \ \Credit: By Akweli Parker INQUIRER STAFF WRITER"

This is a direct burden on the working class of this state.

As a working single homeowner, each of these tax increases will directly take money out of my pocket and place it in the hands of the ""Tax Man."" The governor has shown no fiscal restraint when it comes to spending taxpayers' money. In his first term, Mr. Rendell created the emissions tax, allowed local municipalities to raise the ""privilege to work tax"" from $10 to $52 each year, added countless new high-paid positions on the gaming commission and my favorite, allowing the obscene pay raise to elected officials.

Halt wild spending on county level
\
Editor: I must agree with the Archbald resident whose Feb. 4 letter to the editor criticized the Lackawanna County commissioners.
\
The tax and spend policies of this administration far exceeds the past administration. When we were promised a 25 percent reduction in taxes -- an unfulfilled election promise -- we were instead hit with a 48 percent increase. The reason, they said, was due to the past administration's bill-paying practices. But this administration's spending practices have increased the county's indebtedness in the last three years.
\
Now the ""Yankees Are Coming"" is a huge smokescreen to downplay the mistakes of this administration. County residents will be promised many more things by the next set of candidates, but who and what can you believe?
\
The $500,000 for the Sorvino film was our money, not theirs. The Taj Mahal of a transportation center that they are building and the selling of the DPW building and land, only to rent the building and buy back one acre, are just nonsense.
\
It's time to take government back a step and make politicians accountable for their actions. I intend to petition the Board of Elections to put a referendum on the ballot to not allow a tax increase by any governing body in excess of 10 percent in one year, unless the governing body can show that there will not be any unnecessary increase in spending.

Warming warnings get cold shoulder
\
Editor: The articles about climate change on the front page of the Feb. 2 and 3 papers deserve some elucidation to help put the situation in perspective.
\
In 1896, Svante Arrhenius -- a Danish Nobelist -- postulated the possibility of man-made global warming. He found that the percentage of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was increasing as a result of emissions from power generation associated with the industrial revolution. Remember that automobiles were not a factor at that time. The greenhouse effect of certain chemicals such as carbon dioxide was already well understood in those days. However, the possibility of any major effect resulting from man-made greenhouse gas changes was still considered to be quite remote.
\
The scientific community did not pay much attention to the problem until the 1950s. When they began to study the situation in detail, they found the carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere was increasing at an uncomfortably rapid pace. The science of global temperature and climate changes was still in its infancy. About all that could be said was that there was a likelihood of anthropogenic (man-made) global warming. There was little specific information.
\
The scientific community tried to get the populace to recognize that caution was in order. However, all they could say was that there was a major change in the atmosphere which indicated the possibility, and even probability, of other dramatic changes.
\
In 1969 the American Chemical Society published a book, ""Cleaning Our Environment --The Chemical Basis For Action."" The book pointed out that carbon dioxide was not generally treated as a pollutant, but basically only because there was no known way to filter it out at the source. The only way to stop polluting with carbon dioxide was to stop burning fossil fuels (e.g., coal and oil).
\
However, the book also stated that by definition, carbon dioxide is a pollutant. In addition, the book pointed out that there are probably other materials (e.g., methane) with which mankind is increasing the greenhouse gas content of the atmosphere.
\
The United States' performance with regard to global warming since 1970 has been the equivalent of driving a car at breakneck speed, on a pitch black night, with the headlights not working, and then refusing to apply the brakes until the car lights came on so we could see if the was any danger. More specifically, do nothing to stop increasing the carbon dioxide emissions until the scientists had established exactly what the dangers of such emissions are.
\
Recently, there has been recognition that glaciers are receding at an unduly rapid rate as well as that there are many other measurable changes attributable to global warming, i.e., global warming is much more advanced than we had realized. It is not only our grandchildren who will suffer because we selfishly chose to ignore the warning of global warming, but also our children and maybe some of us alive today. With the article in the Feb. 2 paper, the headlights are back on.
\
Although President Bush and Karl Rove are hardly the only ones to ignore the signals foretelling global warming and the associated climate changes, they have certainly led the way. They both thrive on fooling the public. One hopes that finally they now, at least, understand you cannot fool Mother Nature.

Humans clearly part of the problem
\
Editor: The Feb. 3 Weather Wise column by Scott Stuccio made it clear that Mr. Stuccio, who claims it is his job ""to predict weather conditions and give facts -- not opinions,"" does have an opinion.
\
He implied that global warming was not really happening because it was so cold during the week in much of the country. He also said that ""Anyone with a solid education can figure out that the natural cycle of weather patterns that circulate the globe are like an oscillating wave. It may take time, but eventually a global cooling will take place.""
\
What he did not say is how long that would be. Thousands of years, maybe? The outdoor temperature this week is not an indication of global cooling or warming. The melting of glaciers, the average earth mean temperature and the temperature of the oceans are some of the things that show that the earth is warming.
\
Noted scientists around the world are telling us that we have a serious global warming problem and what we humans are doing is part of that problem. Let's listen to them.

431,"
Nearly four months after the implementation of the new stricter auto emissions testing in the Philadelphia area, the air is clearing - at least the air around the test itself.
\
After a slow start last fall in signing on stations to perform the test, the state has 1,364 stations conducting the new, stricter anti-smog test in the five-county Philadelphia area, according to Rich Kirkpatrick, press secretary for the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT).
\
And some early problems with the shipping of testing equipment and one particular model dynamometer - the instrument that measures an auto's emissions with its drive wheels spinning - seem to have been ironed out, according to Terry Liller, PennDOT's manager of the Vehicle Inspection Division.
\
The only remaining hurdle, said Liller, is price gouging by some test stations.
\
``We continue to have a problem with a few garages who appear to be charging exceptionally high prices to process, for example, a mileage exemption. It's not a majority, but a few, and those are the ones to get the attention. They give the whole program a bit of a black eye,'' he said.
\
Under the new testing program, exemptions include those vehicles that were driven less than 5,000 miles the previous year. They are given an ``exempt'' sticker after mileage verification has been performed by the test station.
\
``I had a call from an individual who was going to be charged $35 for an exemption. The individual asked if this was reasonable, and said, 'It seems like they're going to charge me almost what I would have been charged for the test.'
\
``We had our program manager look into it and found five other garages within a mile of this station were charging $10-18 for the exemption. Obviously, the individual then went somewhere else,'' said Liller.
\
Liller said PennDOT will be requiring garages to post prices for tests and exemptions, and he thought ``that will come close to eliminating the problem.''
\
Lou Ferrara, owner of three service stations in Philadelphia, agreed that prices should be posted.
\
But, he said, ``a lot of people, when they hear 'exempt,' they tend to think it's free. Sure, you don't have to run the car on the dynamometer. But you have to put the information into the computer, and PennDOT still charges $3.70 to send each car's report to Harrisburg. Plus, there's my time involved. I've got to research the mileage, because there are a lot of scam artists out there.''
\
Ferrara said that if the motorist did not have the previous test performed at his station, he asks which inspection station performed the test and checks the mileage recorded with that station.
\
A random survey of Franklin Mills Mall shoppers found most whose vehicles had undergone the stricter test had passed, few thought much of the need for the test and even fewer liked the increased price they had to pay.
\
``This emissions test cost me $47, almost twice as much as my annual $25 state of Pennsylvania inspection. For what?'' asked Ardie Larson of Bristol Township. ``I drive a 1984 Toyota that gives me 30 miles to the gallon. I don't generate pollution. Why don't they put that emission test on the big gas guzzlers? Or is it an emissions tax and not test?''
\
Said Kevin Doherty of Parkwood Manor in Torresdale: ``Emissions are a lot of hot air. It's the hot air people in Washington and Harrisburg that gave us this one. People are going to drive whatever, no matter if they pass this test or not. I have a new pickup, so I don't need it, even though I was forced by the dealer to pay for it. I should be left alone. Emission test those old junkers instead.''
\
John Crane of Andalusia said he paid $52 to get his 1996 Ford Explorer tested. He described himself as ``philosophical.''
\
``It's supposed to improve the environment by limiting the amount of pollution cars put in the air. But let's face it: It's just one more expense for the car owner. I love the expression of `luxury tax' on a car. A car is a necessity, not a luxury like some big-assed boat,'' he said.
\
``Remember how drivers fought seat belts when they first became mandatory?'' asked Mort Sazin of Yardley, Bucks County. ``Now look at all the lives saved by belts. But the emissions test is too high in cost. My mechanic says it has to be high to pay for his testing machine. `So listen,' I said, 'How about a rollback when the machine is paid for?' Fat chance, I said to myself.'' Sazin said he couldn't remember how much he paid for his 1995 Infiniti to be inspected but it was ``around $50.''
\
Ruth Meyers of Somerton, however, thought the $40 she paid for her 1993 Honda Accord to be inspected was well worth it.
\
``When you consider the rain forest, and the fact that America, one country, contributes 25 percent of the world's greenhouse gases, isn't it about time somebody did something to stop this madness?'' she asked.
\
Liller said the average price for the emissions test is currently in the ``low $40s, but it also has been coming slowly down.'' Ferrara thought that was reasonable.
\
``That's $40 a year - you want to figure out what it comes to in a day? Half a cent a day? For a few dollars, you can have clean air. It's only right,'' he said. ``If they gave us the machines free, we'd probably be charging $10 for the inspection.''
\
Liller said that PennDOT hadn't received complaints about the test's accuracy from motorists, but some drivers had expressed frustration.
\
``We've had people who have a vehicle they just can't seem to get to pass the test, and they end up getting a waiver. It's hard to find the problem in some cars here and there. You just can't figure out why they're doing what they're doing. It's not model- or year-specific. But the opposite extreme is you can also find a really old car, with only average maintenance, and for whatever reason it runs clean as a whistle,'' Liller said.
\
Motorists who spend $150 in emissions-related repairs and still have a problem are eligible for a one-year waiver under the new test program.
\
``In most cases, the things that cause high emissions also cause the car to not run well,'' said Liller. ``The frustration occurs when you get that small - it's way less than one percent - number of vehicles with which everything appears to be working right but it still isn't operating cleanly. And it's tough to figure out why.''
\
The new emissions test, the result of a deal between the state and the federal government to clean up Philadelphia's increasingly dirty air, replaced the less-sophisticated, 15-year-old ``tailpipe'' emissions test last Oct. 1. Dynamometers, which enable a vehicle's emissions to be measured under simulated extreme load conditions - going up a steep hill at 15 mph - are now used. Previously, emissions were measured at idle, a far more lenient standard.
\
However, Ferrara, who is also president of the Pennsylvania Gasoline Retail Association & Allied Trades in Northeast Philadelphia, said feedback from those of his 400-member stations performing the test has indicated a failure rate of between seven and eight percent.
\
PennDOT wasn't releasing failure rates of vehicles taking the test because, said spokeswomen Gretchen Toner, it was too soon. After a year of new test, she said, the numbers should be valid.
\
Ferrara said ``not maintaining the car like you need to'' was the primary cause of failure, with such items as vacuum hoses, fouled spark plugs, oxygen sensors, exhaust gas recirculation valves and improper timing appearing as reasons for failure.
\
Although the agreement between PennDOT and the federal government calls for the test to be implemented on a short-term basis until air quality improvements can be measured, Liller said PennDOT was confident the test would clean up the Philadelphia-area air.
\
``We expect that this program will help clean up the air,'' he said. ``As hard as we fought the (Environmental Protection Agency), we would have fought them even harder if we didn't believe it would clean up the air.''
\
``Unfortunately, one of the difficulties is you can never measure the air and say, `This improvement is specifically because of this program,' but I would expect that in the future the air quality would improve.''
\
But there's a caveat.
\
``The one unknown factor we always have to deal with is, people continue to drive more and more all the time,'' he said. ``More miles driven tends to offset gains in air quality or technology improvement.''
\
``And the number of miles driven in the Philadelphia area has doubled in the last 20 years. Technology on cars has gotten a lot better, true, but with twice as many miles driven it leaves it tough for you to predict with absolute precision the air quality result five or 10 years down the road,'' said Liller.

"
432,"Staff Writer\acrable@lnpnews.com\The Three Mile Island nuclear plant has made another list of U.S. nuclear facilities vulnerable to being closed.\And the plentiful Marcellus Shale natural gas in Pennsylvania is cited as one of the primary reasons.\This time, Morningstar Inc., a global independent investment research firm, lists TMI among five U.S. reactors on its ""most exposed"" list.\In Morningstar's 38-page ""Utilities Observer"" for November, analysts stressed that overall the country's nuclear fleet is secure because of the industry's low variable costs, predictable source of energy and efficiency in regional power markets.\""It's our view that existing nuclear operations are essential to energy supply stability in the developed world and still warrant economic moats,"" the analysis says at the outset. Moreover, fuel costs for nuclear plants are contracted well into the future.\However, competition from other power generation sources such as natural gas, coal, hydro and renewable energy has become a critical factor to nuclear power in regional markets, according to the analysis.\Still, Morningstar thinks that despite the outlook of prolonged low natural gas prices, nuclear power will hold up well, although with lower profit margins.\But there is this caveat: ""outside of some select situations.""\And TMI is listed among those special circumstances.\Here is what the analysis has to say about the Dauphin County reactor: ""Exelon's Three Mile Island in Central Pennsylvania is in slightly more favorable power markets but still faces challenging economics, especially if gas prices stay low and construction goes forward on several proposed large high-efficiency gas plants in the region.\""Pennsylvania's renewable portfolio standard (18 percent by 2020) and energy efficiency standard will keep pressure on power prices.""\In response to the Morningstar analysis, Exelon spokesman Ralph DeSantis said, ""At Three Mile Island, we are focused on important things, like completing our refueling outage and preparing for the next operating cycle. Exelon continues to invest in TMI so we can keep providing safe and reliable power to nearly 800,000 homes and businesses in the region.""\The other four plants on the most vulnerable list are Exelon's and Electricite de France's Ginna plant in New York, Entergy's Pilgrim 1 plant in Massachusetts, Entergy's James A. Fitzpatrick plant in New York and FirstEnergy's Davis Besse plant in Ohio.\Despite the listed vulnerability of TMI, the analysis considers Exelon's nuclear fleet - largest in the U.S. - as the most stable in the country because of its efficiency and because it operates in competitive markets.\""Exelon's nuclear plants continue performing at world-class levels,"" the report says. Exelon's 14 nuclear plants produce 20 percent of all nuclear power and 4 percent of all electricity generated in the U.S.\Morningstar Inc., based in Chicago, provides independent investment research in North America, Europe, Australia and Asia.\In July, TMI was listed as one of 38 nuclear plants in the U.S. ""poised on the razor's edge of economic abandonment"" in a report by Mark Cooper, a senior fellow for economic analysis at the Institute for Energy and the Environment at the Vermont Law School.\At that time, Exelon spokesman DeSantis said, ""Exelon is not considering closing any nuclear plants at this time, except for Oyster Creek (in New Jersey in 2019), which was announced in 2010."""
433," Senate Democrats conceded yesterday that a temporary repeal of the 1993 gasoline tax increase is unavoidable, and Republican leaders prepared to tap the nation's savings institutions to pay for it.\ Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole said the Senate could vote as soon as today on the tax cut, which he proposed less than two weeks ago. He planned to discuss the timing, as well as a Democratic proposal to raise the minimum wage, with Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle.\ ""We think (it) is inevitable,"" Daschle, D-S.D., told reporters. Republicans are ""in the majority. They have the votes to pass legislation.""\ The leading proposal for paying for the cut, according to House and Senate aides, was separate legislation that strengthens the government fund insuring savings and loan deposits.\ That plan requires a one-time premium payment from S&Ls, and, under budget rules, the money can be used to offset the tax cut.\ GOP leaders also are looking at a cut in Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary's travel budget.\ The Clinton administration supports the S&L legislation and Daschle said ""I'm not necessarily averse"" to using it to cut the gas tax.\ Republican leaders are pushing hard for the repeal, which is seen as having wide popular appeal. Dole, Clinton's rival in the presidential race, notes repeatedly that the tax increase was approved ""without a single Republican vote.""\ Many Democrats are criticizing the tax cut, saying it could amount to a windfall for the oil companies who pay the tax and ultimately pass it on to the consumer. And environmentalists maintain the tax cut would encourage more energy consumption and hurt the environment.\ Repeal is ""attractive as a matter of raw politics, but it is terrible as a matter of public policy,"" said Sen. Charles Robb, D-Va. ""Just as we were beginning to make sustained progress in bringing down the deficit we blink. We can't take the political heat.""\ However, some Democrats feel compelled to vote for the tax cut and Republicans are near unanimous in backing it.\ With gas prices soaring roughly 20 cents per gallon since February, Dole on April 26 proposed shaving the 1993 increase of 4.3 cents off the 18.3-cent federal gasoline tax.\ Dole, R-Kan., suggested the Senate should act today, which marks what the private, business-financed Tax Foundation has called Tax Freedom Day. That's the date, according to its calculation, by which the average taxpayer has earned enough to pay federal, state and local taxes for the year.\ It ""would be good day to pass the gas-tax repeal. It seems to me it might have a nice ring to it,"" Dole said.\ The cut would begin in mid-May or the start of June and end on Dec. 31. They hope to make it permanent as part of the 1997 budget.\ On Sunday, House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, suggested on NBC the cut could be offset by wringing waste from education programs. Democrats denounced the suggestion and House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., said yesterday, ""I don't think that will happen.""\ Asked what he thought Armey was up to with his comments, Gingrich said, ""I don't have a clue. I didn't watch the show and I don't know what the context was.""\ S&Ls don't mind their money being used for the tax cut because the deposit insurance measure also would require commercial banks to share the cost of paying off S&L bailout bonds sold by the government in the late 1980s and early 1990s."
434,"All major natural gas producing states have a severance tax. Pennsylvania needs one too; here's why.\Fossil fuels such as natural gas are finite resources. There are only so much of them in the ground. and when they are removed, the jobs and businesses dependent upon them often go elsewhere and the communities dependent upon them typically suffer severe declines. Given that reality, it makes sense for the state to tax the depletion of those resources and use those funds to make investments that will create economic opportunities for Pennsylvanians outside these industries.\Gov. Wolf's use of his proposed natural gas severance tax to fund improvements in education is smart. It will help prepare the next generation of Pennsylvanians for a future with many fewer jobs in the industries based on natural gas extraction.\Another reason for a natural gas severance tax is environmental protection. Resource extraction in Pennsylvania has always had unintended consequences. The coal industry is an unfortunate illustration of this.\Many of the thousands of closed coal mines in Pennsylvania leak acid mine drainage. Sulfur in the rock unearthed during coal mining interacts with water, either from precipitation or from shallow ground water, to form sulfuric acid. This acid, sometimes with the aid of bacteria, dissolves heavy metals such arsenic in the mines. The result is, as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency describes it, fluids draining out of the mines which ""may be highly toxic and, when mixed with groundwater, surface water and soil, may have harmful effects on humans, animals and plants.""\This is no minor problem as 2,200 miles of Pennsylvania's streams have been contaminated by this toxic brew of sulfuric acid and heavy metals.\It is likely that some time in the not too distant future, we will discover that fracking for natural gas with huge amounts of water (3 million to 5 million gallons per well per frack) injected under enormous pressure (9,000 pounds per square inch) -- and laced with ""frack fluid"" that often contains toxic and carcinogenic chemicals such as benzene and toluene -- will have unintended consequences to the state's water quality somewhat similar to that of our past history with coal.\Given this, Pennsylvania needs to dedicate more tax revenues to protect our environment from fracking's impacts, and taxes on natural gas are a logical source for these funds. Gov. Wolf's budget contains a very modest increase in funds -- $10 million -- to monitor air and water quality.\There is also the issue of equity -- getting natural resource extraction companies to pay their fair share of taxes in the commonwealth. In the red states of Wyoming, North Dakota and Texas, fossil fuel severance taxes make significant contributions to their budgets. The U.S. Energy Information Agency reports that such taxes contribute 54 percent of the revenues to North Dakota's budget, 39 percent to Wyoming's and 11 percent to Texas'. Pennsylvania's existing Marcellus natural gas impact fee contributes only around 2 percent to the state's budget, which amounts to $220 million a year. In comparison, a 7 percent severance tax in Texas raised $1.7 billion for its budget.\The industry and its supporters argue that passing a Pennsylvania severance tax will ruin the natural gas industry in the state and cost thousands of jobs. What these advocates regularly fail to explain, however, is why the natural gas industry in Wyoming or North Dakota can bear severance taxes, but not Pennsylvania's industry.\Further, Wyoming and North Dakota are very far from major urban markets. In contrast, Pennsylvania's natural gas sits right next door to the high demand markets of New Jersey, New York and New England. This means that Pennsylvania's natural gas has much lower transportation costs to large customers. Consequently, it is in a much better position to bear taxation than the natural gas industry in less advantageously situated states.\In short, Pennsylvania's natural gas industry can afford to pay a severance tax, and it is only fair to the rest of the state's taxpayers that it should do so. This tax, as the governor has proposed, needs to be applied to investments to safeguard the future when this natural resource will be depleted and Pennsylvanians will need replacement jobs and industries.\It also will provide funds to protect the environment. A natural gas severance tax is simply a sensible and sound policy to deal with issues of tax equity, natural resource depletion and environmental damage. As such, it is something that Pennsylvania very much needs.\John Paul Rossi is an associate professor of history at Penn State Erie, The Behrend College.

435,"Pennsylvania needs a ""competitive"" tax on the booming natural gas industry to guard against well blowouts and air and water contamination, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Dan Onorato said Thursday in Easton.\Speaking at a press conference near the confluence of the Lehigh and Delaware rivers, Onorato said Pennsylvania has a ""once in a lifetime opportunity"" to capitalize on the burgeoning gas extraction industry. The tax, which is in place in all the other major fossil fuel generating states, would be paid by the companies involved in gas extraction.\He said he doesn't want to see new taxes in a down economy, but ""this is the one exception."" He said, ""Marcellus shale is so important ... it warrants its own discussion.""\Natural gas being tapped from the Marcellus shale deposit, which covers about 60 percent of the state in a huge arc from West Virginia through southwest Pennsylvania up to the northern tier and into New York state, has become big business. According to state Department of Environmental Protection records, around 2,000 Marcellus shale wells have been drilled since 2008 -- with more than 3,800 permits for drilling issued this year alone.\Onorato didn't commit to a specific tax structure but said he would insist that the tax be used to restore the 28 percent cut that DEP sustained in the past two state budgets. He said some of the funds should go to an impact fund for municipalities affected by the truck traffic and environmental issues that accompany drilling, and a third should go to Growing Greener fund to preserve farmland, open space and restore brownfields.\In addition, Onorato said he would use the governor's power to insist that energy companies hire Pennsylvanians for an estimated 80,000 jobs not only in drilling and transporting the gas, but in related businesses such as hotels and restaurants and other service industries. He didn't specify how a governor could require hiring Pennsylvanians, but said, ""We have to give the permit to drill.""\Hiring more staffers at DEP would combat the kind of incidents that already have occurred in Pennsylvania, including a well blowout in June and a gas contamination of a number of drinking water sources. ""DEP is a skeleton of what it was two, three years ago,"" Onorato said.\The Democrat also slammed Republican candidate Tom Corbett, who opposes a severance tax. ""Tom's campaign is representing the gas drillers,"" Onorato said. ""He wants the Wild West out there.""\""This is a typical response from a liberal Democrat whose solution to everything is to tax it,"" said Corbett spokesman Kevin Harley. Corbett, the state attorney general, says the accelerated business growth that would occur by an industry unfettered by taxes would bring more revenue into the state, Harley said. Instituting a tax, he said, would make the state less competitive against other natural gas-producing states, including Louisiana, Texas and West Virginia -- states that already have a severance tax.\tim.darragh@mcall.com\610 778-2259\Credit: Tim Darragh OF THE MORNING CALL\Credit: Tim Darragh OF THE MORNING CALL"
436,"
Noticed you are paying about a dime per gallon more at the gasoline pump today than you were a few weeks ago?
\
Bob Dole has.
\
After weeks of backpedaling on issues framed by Democrats - such as whether to raise the minimum wage - Dole is trying to turn consumer anger about soaring gasoline prices into a broad political offensive against President Clinton.
\
Dole is demanding repeal of the 4.3-cents-a-gallon tax increase on gasoline enacted in 1993 as part of Clinton's big anti-deficit package.
\
Oil-industry spokesmen say market imbalances - including a harsh U.S. winter and global supplies - and not the tax increase are behind the recent price rise. Still, Dole has the White House on the defensive.
\
``The President is very concerned about these spikes in oil prices at the pump,'' White House spokesman Michael McCurry said yesterday, after Clinton ordered the sale of 12 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve as a way of increasing supplies and possibly bringing prices down.
\
The President also asked Energy Secretary Hazel R. O'Leary to review market conditions and report within 45 days ``about the factors that led to the run-up in prices'' and about expectations for the summer.
\
Asked about Dole's push to repeal the gas-tax increase, chief of staff Leon E. Panetta said Sunday that ``we're prepared to discuss it,'' but only as part of overall negotiations.
\
Gasoline prices are at their highest since the Persian Gulf war. The average price of a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline was $1.27 April 23, up 10 cents from a month before, according to the American Automobile Association. Subtracting all taxes means that the price of gasoline rose to 85 cents from 75 cents, an increase of 13 percent.
\
Dole's tactic is the leading edge of an emerging Republican strategy to turn political debate back toward subjects of the Republicans' choosing - such as broader tax reform, crime control and overhauling welfare - and away from topics favored by Democrats, such as Medicare, education and the environment.
\
GOP political consultants are cheering Dole on. ``Clearly an issue that works well for Republicans is taxes,'' said GOP pollster Linda DiVall. ``The gas tax is a very tangible example that every consumer can relate to. It's an excellent demonstration of the differences between the two parties. I think it's also a good demonstration of the ability Sen. Dole has as the majority leader to change the agenda and to provide a forum for it.''
\
Veteran GOP consultant Eddie Mahe agreed that the tactic shows a welcome new aggressiveness in Dole's campaign.
\
``At least it is demonstrating to me that they are going to take advantage of targets of opportunity. . . . just like the Democrats took advantage of the whole controversy on the minimum wage,'' Mahe said.
\
Dole's broadside stirred juices inside Clinton-Gore campaign headquarters. ``Dole finally has found something to run against. Unfortunately it's his own record,'' sniped campaign spokesman Joe Lockhart, who immediately faxed an eight-page record detailing Dole's many votes between 1982 and 1990 in favor of raising the tax on gasoline.
\
During those years, the federal gasoline tax rose from 4 cents a gallon to 14.1 cents a gallon, and Dole supported each increase, although like all Republican lawmakers, he opposed Clinton's 1993 proposal.
\
Today, taxes - state, local and federal combined - add about 42 cents to the average price of a gallon of gasoline, according to the American Petroleum Institute.
\
The industry says a number of factors have contributed to the recent price rises, including:
\
* The harsh winter, which raised demand for heating oil and led refiners to delay switching their production mix toward gasoline.
\
* Greater demand for gasoline as Americans drive bigger cars farther and faster.
\
* Perhaps most important, refiners keeping their inventories low in expectation that new supplies soon may flood the global market, especially if the United Nations lifts sanctions barring Iraqi oil sales, a move expected for months. Negotiations resume this week.
\
``I think we'll probably see some relief for motorists by early summer. I don't think we'll see prices drop dramatically, but they should level off,'' said Mike Morrissey, spokesman for the auto club. ``For the average motorist, the impact will just be a few dollars.''
\
Oil-market analysts don't blame Clinton's tax for today's gasoline-price spurt, but consumer anger over pump prices is rising, and Dole hopes to help them make the connection.
\
``These gasoline price increases come on top of the 4.3 cents more per gallon Americans pay as a result of the $265 billion 1993 tax increase,'' Dole said in his open letter to Clinton on Friday, asking him to join a bipartisan drive to repeal his gas-tax increase.

437,"Tracie Mauriello can be reached at tmauriello@post-gazette.com or 1- 717-787-2141.\ Pennsylvania drivers could get a break at the gas pump this summer if lawmakers approve a measure proposed by state Sen.

The tax, which funds road and bridge repairs, would return on Oct. 31.\ ""Drivers are being hit hard in their wallets as gas prices continue to climb almost daily,"" Mr. Logan said yesterday. ""People can barely afford to travel to work, and then end up spending a large portion of their paycheck on gas.""\ Officials from the governor's office and the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation said Mr. Logan's proposal would have little benefit for drivers while it would delay important infrastructure projects.\ ""There is simply no way to guarantee if the gas tax is suspended the gas stations are going to lower their price,"" said Rich Kirkpatrick, spokesman for PennDOT. ""The result would be no savings to consumers, a windfall to gas stations and potentially hundreds of millions less to repair roads and bridges.""\ Mr. Logan said it's worth it to cut back on road and bridge work. Some of the revenue loss could be recouped by dipping into the state's surplus, projected to be at least $600 million, said Mr. Logan, who is a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee.\ The gas tax generates about $80 million a month.\ ""If you're a bureaucrat, you say we're losing that $80 million a month, but if you're a good-government guy, you say we're giving breaks to consumers,"" Mr. Logan said. ""If we weren't expecting this surplus I would think [the tax suspension] is fiscally irresponsible, but I think we can afford to do it. It means we'll have to run our road and bridge projects a little more efficiently and see if there are some we can put on hold.""\ Other lawmakers have their own ideas about how to spend the surplus, including for business tax cuts.\ Mr. Logan said his plan will help everyone, including business owners.\ ""It helps the people that work at these companies and, if they have a fleet of cars or they're shipping products, it helps there. This will help the regular Joe and also helps the businesses,"" he said.\ Average gas prices in Pennsylvania reached $2.97 a gallon yesterday, up from about $2.10 a gallon a year ago, according to the Web site GasBuddy.com, which tracks prices nationwide. Pennsylvania's three-year high was $3.26 a gallon just after Hurricane Katrina.\ If prices continue to rise, people won't be able to afford summer vacations or even to drive to their jobs, Mr. Logan said.\ One constituent, Liz Travisano, said she won't be able to afford gas to drive her disabled 7-year-old son to East Liberty for summer camp for children with special needs.\ ""Anthony is nonverbal and has developmental delays. The structure of the Sharp Visions summer camp helps him with social activities and outdoor activities, but I might not be able to get him there this year,"" said Mrs. Travisano, of Monroeville.\ Mr. Logan's legislation would reduce gas prices by 31.2 cents, enough to put Anthony back on the road to summer camp.\ ""It would definitely make a difference,"" Mrs. Travisano said.\ Families like the Travisanos inspired the legislation, Mr. Logan said.\ ""If people can't send a special ed kid to a camp environment, if people can't get to work and can't provide the proper care for their kids, we've got problems,"" he said. ""The people of Pennsylvania are facing a crisis every single day at the pumps.""\ Other states, including New Jersey and Nevada, also are considering gas-tax suspensions.\ Mr. Logan's bill also would authorize the state attorney general's office to investigate complaints of price collusion and to create a committee to study other ways to reduce gas prices."

Rapid development of the Marcellus Shale natural gas formation has caught Pennsylvania's government well behind the curve. The state's regulatory and tax policies reflect an earlier era, short-changing the environment and the state treasury.
\
In some ways Harrisburg has been doing a pretty good job of playing catch-up. Lawmakers, for example, have authorized the hiring of 32 new inspectors by the Department of Environmental Protection in order to ensure that the water-intensive drilling industry doesn't foul one vital resource, at public expense, in pursuit of another that produces private profit.
\
Tuesday, the state House Environmental Resources and Energy Committee made another sound decision when it approved a ""severance tax,"" by which all Pennsylvanians will benefit from gas extraction.
\
The tax on extraction of natural resources would generate about $107 million in the 2010 fiscal year and rise with production to as much as $632 million in the 2014 fiscal year, according to administration estimates. The tax has two parts -- 5 percent on revenue generated by gas sales and 4.7 cents per 1,000 cubic feet of extracted gas.
\
Critics claim that the tax will hinder the development of the industry, but that is highly unlikely. Pennsylvania is the only state with a natural gas industry that does not have a severance tax. And the gas is here. Paying the tax is part of the industry's cost of doing business.
\
Pennsylvania's prospective tax is based on West Virginia's tax, which has not dampened exploration and development in that state.
\
The tax also is fair, in that it compensates the public for a commonwealth-wide resource, and for the damages caused to publicly funded infrastructure -- roads, bridges and waterways.
\
Under the committee-approved bill, the revenue would be allocated according to this formula: state General Fund, 60 percent; special environmental fund, 15 percent; host municipalities and counties, 4.5 percent each; state hazardous waste cleanup fund 4 percent; local road and bridge work, 5 percent; state game and fish and boating commissions, 2 percent each; and state-operated heating assistance, 3 percent.
\
The full House and Senate should approve the new tax as part of the next state budget.
"
439,"Across Pennsylvania, natural gas drilling in the Marcellus Shale has benefited not just companies but also human beings -- by creating tens of thousands of jobs, rescuing families from foreclosure, and generating fortunes and sustainable prosperity for farmers, workers and small-business owners.\At a time when family budgets are stretched too thinly, affordable natural gas prices -- a direct result of the drilling boom -- are saving Pennsylvania consumers hundreds of millions of dollars this year through lower utility bills. While the benefits are unquestionable, special interest groups and tax-and-spend politicians unwisely see the industry as a cash cow for unnecessary, unsustainable and unworthy statewide projects. In short, people are once again losing out to poor policy and politics as usual.\Supporters of a natural gas tax wrongly claim a tax would protect the environment. In truth, Pennsylvania's stringent laws and strict enforcement protect the environment and ensure drilling companies are held responsible for environmental and infrastructure damages. This is the responsible way to hold companies accountable and address environmental concerns, not with new taxes and policies that protect neither people nor the environment.\Moreover, tax advocates argue that gas extraction imposes environmental risks that justify an extraordinary tax. Both those supporting and opposing a tax care about the environment and believe businesses should pay for their costs, but many fail to understand the industry's true impacts or contributions to communities. Although much misinformation has been thrust into the public and erringly repeated, drillers pay the very same taxes as every other business -- more than $1.2 billion in state taxes since 2006. But the same just isn't good enough for some.\House Bill 1863 sponsored by state Rep. Thomas Murt and Rep. Gene DiGirolamo is yet another natural gas tax proposal and an attempt to redistribute other people's money to pet projects across the state. The bill even creates a special fund for Rep. Murt's alma mater, Penn State, where he teaches part time. The natural gas industry should pay for its impacts, but it shouldn't be a bonanza for crony-driven projects.\As the General Assembly considers natural gas tax and fee proposals, legislators should vote based on sound principals protecting people, not politics or pressure from special interest groups.\Let there be no doubt, all businesses, including natural gas drillers, should pay the cost for government they use. If a driller is not paying for its negative impacts on the environment or infrastructure, it is appropriate to charge a fee to pay for the government's cost to remediate the problem. This impact is not measured by how much money a company has, or how much profit a well makes, but for how much government it uses.\If equity is truly the aim of those crying for a fair share, then this type of fee should surely quench their thirst. Along these lines, any fee must consider what businesses are already paying in taxes, fees and contributions to local communities and the state, and only cover the difference in demonstrated impacts and current revenue.\However, before imposing a new fee, elected officials should consider whether the current tax and fee structures need to be revised to cover any uncompensated costs of government. For example, is it appropriate to adjust local hotel and emergency services taxes to address large numbers of seasonal workers? Or are there other fee mechanisms that can be more directly tied to government services being provided to gas drillers?\Finally, any fee should be optional for counties or municipalities to impose, not a statewide tax. This ensures competition among local governments, discourages excessive fee rates, and reduces the threat of cross-subsidization and redistribution of fee revenues to unrelated purposes. While some local officials are calling for more revenue, other county officials say they are already collecting enough in taxes and fees from drillers to cover the costs.\Unfortunately, HB 1863, like many other tax proposals, masquerades as an effort to protect communities and the environment while tragically forgetting that families and farmers will surely be left fractured. Before Pennsylvania's future is left in the dark, our legislators must be led into the light of the realities of natural gas drilling benefits.\Katrina Currie is a policy analyst with the Commonwealth Foundation, Pennsylvania's free-market think tank in Harrisburg.\Credit: Katrina Currie, Special to The Morning Call - Freelance\Credit: Katrina Currie, Special to The Morning Call - Freelance"
440,"HARRISBURG -- Gov. Ed Rendell hopes to keep momentum moving forward toward a tax on the removal of Marcellus Shale gas deposits when Senate Republicans join discussions today.\Mr. Rendell said some progress was made Monday during a meeting with some legislative leaders and gas industry officials, but that nothing had been finalized yet. Senate Republicans refused to meet on the Columbus Day holiday but are expected to participate today as the Legislature races a Thursday deadline to enact a new tax.\""We discussed options"" for a tax, including the West Virginia model, which has a 5 percent tax on the sale price of the gas extracted from the underground shale, along with another levy of 4.7 cents per thousand cubic feet (MCF) of gas, the governor said. \Mr. Rendell likes that idea, but House Democrats recently passed bill that would impose a tax of 39 cents per MCF, which critics have complained is far too high and could cost Pennsylvania jobs. \A third option is that favored by Senate Republicans, similar to the one in Arkansas -- 1.5 percent on the market value of the gas for up to five years, with the rate then increasing somewhat.\Several industry officials left the meeting without commenting to reporters, but Mr. Rendell said their idea was for something less than the House plan.\""Nothing has been decided yet,"" he said, adding that he'd meet today with Republican Senate leaders.\""I wish we had had this meeting a year ago,"" Mr. Rendell said. Asked if he was disappointed about the lack of a tax being in place by now, he said, ""I've stopped being disappointed.""\Mr. Rendell wants revenue from a shale tax to protect the environment from damage from drilling accidents, to help towns where drilling is happening fix their roads and to help fill a $282 million hole in the state budget.\Several House members, of both parties, were at the meeting, including Republican leader Sam Smith of Punxsutawney and Rep. Tim Solobay, D-Canonsburg.\Mr. Smith said House Republicans ""want to focus on what this industry can do to create jobs,"" rather than focusing on a tax. He said the high tax rate favored by House Democrats ""was driven by a feeding frenzy to spend.""\He said the ""big guys in the industry have always indicated they were willing to absorb a tax,"" but that the smaller gas companies, some of which have been in business in the state for 100 years, ""are concerned about the impact this tax would have on them.""\Gas companies in attendance included Range Resources, Chesapeake Oil & Gas, Chief Oil & Gas and Southwest Energy. While they didn't comment, Kathryn Klaber, president of the Marcellus Shale Coalition, which represents most of the drillers, issued a statement Friday.\""Our industry has been working with elected leaders and key stakeholders for months, in an effort to modernize the state's legislative and regulatory framework,"" she said.\Tax negotiations are facing a deadline of Thursday, the last scheduled day of the Senate's two-year session."
441,"
HARRISBURG - An effort to enact a state severance tax on natural gas production during the past 18 months ran into a dead end Thursday amid a round of political recriminations.
\
Gov. Ed Rendell pronounced the push to enact a severance tax on natural gas production dead this year - a tacit recognition that the legislative session is effectively over until January and his term in office ends that month too.
\
Rendell said the unwillingness of Senate and House Republican leaders to negotiate in good faith on a compromise tax is responsible for the breakdown. But leaders of those caucuses took sharp issue with the governor's assessment.
\
Rendell gave his verdict one day after receiving responses from the four caucuses to his request for counterproposals to a compromise tax plan he floated last week.
\
""It is irresponsible for Senate and House Republicans to refuse to compromise and simply turn their backs on these negotiations after days and weeks and months of work,"" he said in a statement. ""Their clear unwillingness to change their previous proposal or to resolve differences with the House Democrats and with my administration makes it obvious that they have killed the severance tax in this legislative session.""
\
In response, House Minority Leader Sam Smith, R-66, Punxsutawney, said the governor was attempting to turn the severance tax into a political issue, while a spokesman for Senate GOP leaders said Rendell had made a unilateral decision to end negotiations.
\
Rendell's statement came with Pennsylvania voters preparing to elect a new governor in less than two weeks. The issue of taxing the natural gas produced by the Marcellus Shale drilling boom in Northeast Pennsylvania and other regions is at the forefront of the governor's race between Republican Tom Corbett and Democrat Dan Onorato. Corbett opposes a severance tax while Onorato favors one with revenues going for specific purposes other than the state General Fund.
\
Rendell's statement also came after lawmakers missed an Oct. 1 target date to pass a severance tax by three weeks. As part of the state budget deal last July, House Democratic and Senate GOP leaders had declared their intent to pass a severance tax by Oct. 1 with an implementation date of Jan. 1.
\
The immediate impact of no tax is that Pennsylvania faces a $70 million revenue hole in the current budget, said Rendell spokesman Gary Tuma. When federal medical assistance aid that Pennsylvania counted upon fell short by $250 million, Rendell proposed using severance tax revenue and a 1.9 percent across-the-board spending cut to plug the gap.
\
That gap will have to be filled with either more spending cuts or a continued improvement in state revenue collections, Tuma added.
\
A broader impact of no tax is that local communities in boom areas won't get revenue to cope with the impact of drilling activities and help protect the environment, said the Pennsylvania Budget and Policy Center, a Harrisburg think tank that supports a severance tax.
\
""Legislative inaction has left the environment unprotected in the Marcellus Shale region of the state,"" center officials said. ""It has passed the local costs of increased drilling on to state and local taxpayers.""
\
Pennsylvania will remain the only mineral-rich state in the nation without a severance tax, the center said. Rendell's compromise calls for a tax rate starting at 3 percent and reaching 5 percent by the third year and exempting up to 10 percent of production and distribution costs from the tax.
\
Senate GOP leaders reaffirmed their position on Wednesday that a state severance tax rate should start at 1.5 percent and exempt up to 100 percent of well-production costs. Furthermore, Senate leaders set some conditions on the tax passage saying that issues concerning the distribution of tax revenue and easing of zoning hurdles must be dealt with at the same time.
\
Smith rejected the governor's contention that his caucus hasn't bargained in good faith.
\
""The priority should be on developing jobs which will generate more revenue in the long haul,"" he said.
\
House Democratic leaders said their main concern is that enough tax revenue be generated to offset the impact of drilling on the environment and roads and water systems. The House passed severance tax bills in October 2009 and again last month.
\
""Because of their (GOP caucuses) unwillingness to take the issue seriously, Pennsylvania misses out on badly needed revenue from the natural gas industry,"" said Brett Marcy, spokesman for House Majority Leader Todd Eachus, D-116, Hazleton.
\
Rendell first proposed a severance tax during a state budget address in early 2009. He removed it from the negotiating table as a budget stalemate dragged through the summer of that year. But Rendell included a severance tax proposal when he proposed his final budget as governor in February.

442,"In true executive fashion, Gov. Tom Corbett has convened another policy commission to help him deal with some of Pennyslvania's bigger issues.\He started with a commission on Marcellus Shale drilling. Its government- and industry-affiliated members' recommendations resulted in an optional impact fee in lieu of an extraction tax, and a loss of local control by municipalities.\In April, Corbett formed a transportation commission. In August, it reported that higher registration and license fees and lifting the wholesale gas tax cap could fund the $2.7 billion the state needs for its crumbling transit infrastructure. To date, nothing more has been done.\And finally, on Monday, Corbett hosted the first meeting of his Advisory Commission on Postsecondary Education, a group heralded in his budget proposal address last month. ""As we move forward in this new century, it is essential that we analyze ways to make higher education available, affordable and meaningful,"" Corbett said in a Monday statement.\The commission will identify issues and review policies, procedures, regulations and legislation that affect Pennsylvania higher education and develop long-range strategies, according to the statement. It will also evaluate trends, including the role of technology, and how education can increase collaboration with the private sector and government. It will report to Corbett by Nov. 15 with its recommendations.\That sounds ... promising? In a nebulous sort of way?\But it's hard to take seriously the notion that Corbett values Pennsylvania higher education after he's massively cut its funding once, and announced plans to do so again.\Corbett's 2011-12 budget initially sought a 50 percent higher education cut. That was eventually reduced by under-fire lawmakers to between 10 to 19 percent. His 2012-13 budget would cut state-related universities by about 30 percent, and the 14 state universities by about 20 percent. Community colleges would see a cut of nearly 4 percent.\If the 2012-13 cuts for state system schools remain as proposed, they will see a two-year decline of 34.4 percent, according to a Feb. 27 briefing from Rep. Joe Markosek, minority chair of the state House Appropriations Committee.\When it comes to the governor's newest commission, we hope for the best. In a time of slow economic growth, when the U.S. is quickly losing its dominance as a global innovator, it's a bad idea to shortchange higher education.\But, long-range strategies aside, we might add that a good way to ""make higher education available, affordable and meaningful"" in the short-term would be to avoid any further cuts to state and state-related universities in the next state budget.\- By Matthew Major, opinion editor and member of Public Opinion's editorial board.

HARRISBURG -- Democratic gubernatorial candidate Dan Onorato today said House Democrats and Senate Republicans are wrong to propose extreme rates for a natural gas extraction tax, and that Pennsylvania should use a tax rate that averages those from 20 states.
\
He doesn't expect the Legislature to take action by next Wednesday, the Senate's last scheduled session day for the year.
\
""I really doubt they're going to pass anything,"" Onorato said.
\
Onorato spoke to reporters after appearing before the Pennsylvania Council on Aging. The group invited Republican gubernatorial candidate Tom Corbett but he did not attend, council officials said.
\
A severance tax on gas from the Marcellus shale formation is the top issue in the waning days of this legislative session.
\
Onorato for months has said he supports a ""competitive tax"" on the industry. He says Corbett's opposition to any tax is ""totally irresponsible"" and will leave taxpayers holding the bag for potential environmental damage.
\
In a television campaign ad, Corbett blasts Onorato for supporting a ""massive energy tax."" Corbett contends the focus should be on attracting investment to Pennsylvania's energy infrastructure, creating jobs and protecting the environment.
\
The state House last week supported a 10 percent tax; Senate Republicans have suggested a 1.5 percent tax.
\
""The Democratic House bill was wrong. The Senate Republican bill is wrong,"" Onorato said.
\
When reporters asked Onorato to give the average of 20 states' rates, he replied they should ""ask Tom Corbett"" why he isn't supporting a reasonable tax bill to protect the environment.
\
He said he doubts that Republican governors who supported a severance tax would consider it a ""massive energy tax.""

444," ""I've looked at my life as a parade,"" Drew Lewis, former secretary of transportation under the Reagan administration, told Lafayette College students yesterday. ""You can march in it and benefit from it or you can be oblivious to it . . . There is benefit in being a marcher.""\ Lewis addressed a group of about 30 students and faculty in the William E. Simon center for Business and Economics. His talk, titled ""The Future of Transportation and Its Effects on the Environment,"" covered a variety of subjects from transportation to government service.\ He encouraged the students to go into government service. ""When you make a commitment to serve, you put up with flack from the public and the press,"" Lewis said. ""But when you look at your life, there are limitations on what is really important to you . . . I think politics is important.""\ Lewis said the nature of transportation is changing from an industry that moves products to a more logistical industry. There is more emphasis on timing deliveries to customers who do not want to store a lot of extra stock.\ Lewis, the chairman and chief executive officer of Union Pacific, said systems coordinating train schedules are even more sophisticated than those for airplanes. He said computerization is also occurring in the trucking industry.\ ""The best rail transportation, trucking transportation and highway transportation is in the United States of America,"" Lewis said, comparing U.S. transportation to Japan and Europe.\ On the subject of airline deregulation, Lewis said he thinks the system Ronald Reagan developed will do to the air system what Dwight Eisenhower did for the highway system.\ The audience had questions covering a number of issues.\ One student wanted to know the condition of the highway system. ""There is a need for increased capital investment,"" Lewis said.\ Although he succeeded as secretary of transportation in convincing Congress to approve a 5 cent per gallon tax on gasoline, he said the highways are not seeing much of that money.\ ""If we kept our books at Union Pacific Rail Road like the federal government, I would be in jail,"" Lewis said about the methods of appropriation of funds.\ Lewis is a supporter of gasoline taxes as a means of balancing the budget. He said a 50-cent-per-gallon tax on gas could provide enough revenue to balance the budget by 1990.\ He said that the problem with this kind of proposal is that law makers are leery of increasing taxes. However, Lewis maintains that ""a deficit is a tax,"" because the borrowed money will have to be paid back eventually - with interest.\ In response to another question, Lewis discussed the Reagan administration's handling of the air traffic controller's strike in 1981. ""I think we did the correct thing,"" he said, although he regretted putting 11,400 people out of work.\ If he had it to do again, he said, he would still have ordered the workers to go back to work or lose their jobs, but he would have given them a week to comply rather than only two days.\ On a less serious note, Lewis was asked why road pavement seems to be so short lived and if technology exits to make roads last longer. He said it is a matter of climate. ""The best thing to do is not live in Connecticut and move to Florida,"" he said.\ And no, there will probably never be a railroad line from the Lehigh Valley to New York City, Lewis said. ""There are not enough people to travel it.""\ Lewis was transportation secretary from 1981 to 1983. He then became chairman and chief executive officer of Warner Amex Cable Communications.\ In 1985, President Reagan appointed Lewis as special envoy to study the problem of acid rain and its effect on the environment.\ The area native is a graduate of Haverford College and holds an MBA from the Harvard Graduate School of Business as well as various honorary degrees.\ Lewis is a member of the board of directors of American Express, Ford Motor Company, and Smith Kline Beckman Corporation. He is also co-chairman of the National Economic Commission and a member of the board of trustees of the Committee for Economic Development.\ The program was sponsored by Lafayette College's American Civilization Club. The newly formed organization plans to promote American cultural awareness by sponsoring events for the campus and community."

HARRISBURG -- House Speaker John Perzel on Monday predicted lawmakers aren't likely to increase state gas taxes, and said the Legislature should consider a long-term lease of the Pennsylvania Turnpike to raise money for bridge and road work.
\
Perzel said he will ask other House and Senate leaders to appoint a group to study reducing the size of the Legislature, in order to cut costs. The 253-member General Assembly is the largest full-time legislature in the nation, costing taxpayers roughly $347 million a year.
\
""In today's political climate, I don't see many legislators willing to increase the gas tax -- any tax -- let alone the gas tax,"" Perzel, R-Philadelphia, told the Pennsylvania Press Club. In his speech, he acknowledged Republicans have been too willing to go along with Democratic Gov. Ed Rendell on tax and spending issues.
\
Perzel, who helped engineer the pay hike, was Rendell's ally on the governor's key programs, such as increasing the state income tax and expanding gambling.
\
But Perzel said Republicans need to stand up to Rendell and say no to higher taxes and runaway welfare spending.
\
""The Legislature and I will lead where Gov. Rendell has failed,"" he said.
\
A report issued last week by a transportation panel Rendell created recommends raising the gas tax, state realty transfer fees and other fees to help pay for deteriorating roads and bridges and financially-strapped mass transit systems.
\
Perzel said he doubts leasing the turnpike would raise $30 billion, as some predict. But, he said, ""(It's) one of the options you have to take a look at.""
\
Perzel's remarks come as many predict a tight state budget in 2007. The transportation report identified $1.7 billion in needs for roads, bridges and transit systems, and suggested raising taxes and fees -- including a 12.5-cent gasoline tax hike.
\
Debate on such topics would take place in a tumultuous political atmosphere. The election ushered in 55 new House and Senate members following the failed 2005 legislative pay raise.
\
Kate Philips, Rendell's press secretary, said Perzel ""is trying to shore up his caucus.""
\
Much of Rendell's legislative success comes in large part from Perzel ""building consensus in his (GOP) caucus around the governor's agenda,"" Philips said.
\
Rep. Mike Turzai, R-Bradford Woods, the newly-elected House GOP Policy Committee chairman, said: ""Welfare reform, lower taxes, a competitive business environment -- these are all the right themes. Republicans need to push for this agenda. I was excited to hear John talking about it.""
\
Turzai believes raising the gas tax isn't likely to happen.
\
""We have to look at other options as alternatives to the gas tax, and I agree it's not likely people will support it. The gas tax should not be the answer.""
\
Rep. Dwight Evans, D-Philadelphia, ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, was noncommittal about a gas tax hike. He called for hearings across the state.
\
""I'd rather wait to hear what people have to say,"" Evans said.
\
G. Terry Madonna, a political science professor at Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster County, believes Perzel targeted other Republican legislators with his remarks about Rendell and taxes.
\
""Conservatives now dominating his caucus may well revolt against continued support for Rendell. The proof will be whether (Perzel) ends up making deals with Rendell as he did"" during the past three years, Madonna said.
\
Perzel is viewed as one of the most powerful political figures at the Capitol. Though Republicans appear to have maintained control of the state House by a narrow margin, results in two Chester County races remain unclear. If Republicans lose the majority, Perzel likely would lose his hold on the speaker's office.

With straining state budgets and the burden of natural gas exploration on governments and communities, a movement to tax natural gas production in Pennsylvania gained another supporter and more momentum.
\
The Harrisburg-based Pennsylvania Budget & Policy Center weighed in on imposing a so-called ""severance"" tax an natural gas production, saying it would both boost government revenue and help cover the public cost of increased drilling. The group issued a report surveying how natural gas is taxed in other states.
\
Gov. Ed Rendell, who supports the levy, said the tax would generate about $150 million annually, although the natural gas industry says the figure is exaggerated and that the tax may deter exploration.
\
The gas rush and infusion of money to individuals and communities from leases and royalties has clouded the discussion about drilling and its impact, said the center's director, Sharon Ward.
\
The group said the revenue could be used to pay for the impact of drilling on the environment, local communities and regulatory agencies.
\
With the state just beginning gas exploration, oil & gas industry officials warn the tax, on top of the recession and plunging energy prices, will deter and delay full exploration and development, said Steven Rhoads, executive director of Pennsylvania's Oil & Gas Producers, a trade association.
\
The study, however, said the pace of exploration is rarely affected by taxation level. The price of natural gas, the availability of credit and the number of on-shore drilling rigs have far greater influence on exploration.

448,"Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia share borders, roads and waterways.\Yet, when it comes to severance taxes on shale gas, the policies are all over the map. West Virginia has a 5 percent severance tax. Ohio has proposed a 2 percent extraction tax per 1,000 cubic feet of gas. Pennsylvania has an impact fee but no gas severance tax.\Given the range of taxes and impact fees in each state, it's little wonder that drilling companies play the states against each other as they seek concessions.\But what if the three states joined together to establish a standard regional severance tax rate? Wouldn't that be a more efficient way for all concerned to do business?\Monday, three progressive policy groups - the Pennsylvania Budget and Policy Center, the West Virginia Center on Budget & Policy and Policy Matters Ohio - sent letters to the governors of the three states urging them to take a regional approach to taxing natural gas and oil.\Noting that all three states have made substantial investments in infrastructure, to protect the environment and to manage the impact of the industry, the groups argued that an ""adequate severance tax would ensure that industry contributes to these costs.""\Ohio state Rep. Robert Hagan, D-Youngstown, is preparing legislation that would tax natural gas and oil extraction at 7.5 percent - the same rate Texas charges drillers.\In a conference call, Hagan said he believes a collective, regional tax approach makes sense. He said the state's current tax on Utica shale drilling is inadequate but has remained low due to concerns that drillers will go to Pennsylvania or West Virginia.\Pennsylvania state Rep. Gene DiGirolamo, R-Bucks, is circulating a co-sponsorship memo in Harrisburg to impose a 4.9 percent severance tax on drillers.\Pennsylvania, which ranked second in the nation in natural gas production last year, earned $200 million from impact fees. But if the state had a severance tax similar to that in West Virginia, Pennsylvania would have reaped $425 million - enough to cover much of the projected state budget deficit.\The policy groups have been studying this issue for the past 15 months. They discovered that despite the fees and taxes now being imposed on drillers, state taxpayers are footing the bill for road maintenance, site inspections, pollution, increased housing costs and an increase in the number of safety and emergency service personnel.\They are asking the governors to adopt a joint severance tax no lower than West Virginia's 5 percent tax.\""Setting a common tax no lower than the West Virginia rate, as we recommend, would bring the entire region more in line with gas-producing states in the West and in the South.\That, the letter states, ""would take taxes out of the competitive equation.""\Pennsylvania Democrats jockeying to challenge Gov. Tom Corbett, largely support a severance tax.\There are other concerns - Ohio has a commercial tax and Pennsylvania's corporate net income tax is the highest of its kind in the nation.\But that should not derail what amounts to a progressive regional approach to natural gas extraction."

Pennsylvanians overwhelmingly like the natural gas industry and favor taxing it, but are divided about whether the benefits outweigh possible environmental harm, according to a new Franklin & Marshall College released Wednesday.
\
They also strongly oppose opening more state forest land to drilling and think drilling has improved the state's quality of life.
\
The poll of 525 Pennsylvania adults was conducted between Aug. 22 and Monday and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.3 percentage points, meaning each percentage could actually be that much higher or lower.
\
When asked if they favor or oppose taxing companies that extract and sell natural gas, almost two-thirds (65 percent) of adults said they favor taxation with 45 percent saying they are strongly in favor. Only about two in 10 (21 percent) said they oppose taxation.
\
And just shy of two-thirds (66 percent) said they have a favorable view of the industry with almost a third (31 percent) saying they have a strongly favorable view.
\
They were warier when asked to weigh the benefits of drilling against the environmental effects.
\
The percentage of people who said the benefits of drilling outweigh the environmental damage was barely greater than the percentage who think the opposite (39 to 35 percent).
\
More said drilling improved the quality of life in Pennsylvania (35 percent) than said it reduced the quality of life (26 percent).
\
They were especially protective of state forests with almost three quarters (72 percent) opposing the opening of more of forest land to natural gas drilling, including more than half (54 percent) strongly opposed. Less than a quarter (22 percent) at least somewhat favored more forest drilling.
\
Almost three-quarters (72 percent) also think any revenues from taxation should be shared by the state and local communities.
\
The results arrived after months and millions of dollars of television, newspaper and other advertising across the state by the natural gas industry meant to buff its image.
\
The state General Assembly is expected to take up the question of imposing a tax or fee on the natural gas industry when it returns next month.
\
Gov. Tom Corbett, who opposed an fee or tax while he ran for office last year, has since opened the door a bit saying he favors using a fee to clean up the environment.
\
""I think that (poll) shows the ambivalence that people feel about the gas industry,"" said Jan Jarrett, president and chief executive officer of PennFuture, an environmental group. ""When faced with a lot of changes they showed anxiety. I think it captures the reality on the ground.""
\
Pennsylvanians understand ""there are upsides,"" Jarrett said.
\
""They know the upsides have significant costs in some way,"" she said. ""They would like to see those costs covered by a severance tax.""
\
Pennsylvanians clearly embrace their state forests and fear they will be harmed, Jarrett said.
\
""I imagine that extends to state parks,"" she said, though the poll did not ask specifically about parks.
\
The Marcellus Shale Coalition, a gas industry trade group, issued a statement quoting coalition president Kathryn Klaber, who said the poll shows Pennsylvanians ""understand the enormous environmental, economic and national security benefits associated with this historic opportunity before us.""

450,"As the state's budget debate drags on, we've seen encouraging signs of principled leadership from some in Harrisburg who are committed to creating an environment that encourages job and economic growth opportunities. Unfortunately, some remain singularly focused on jamming through job-crushing energy taxes.\Pennsylvania is in the very early stages of potentially realizing long-term natural gas-driven opportunities. From using more natural gas to provide affordable and reliable electricity, such as projects underway in Archbald and Jessup, to delivering energy savings to thousands of consumers, small businesses and schools and growing good-paying manufacturing jobs, the commonwealth has the opportunity for a brighter future.\According to a report commissioned by the Wolf administration, Pennsylvania's abundant shale resources present a multibillion-dollar opportunity to transform the state into a global petrochemical manufacturing leader. To fully realize these important manufacturing opportunities, Pennsylvania needs competitive policies that strengthen our economic climate.\We're at a crossroads. Do lawmakers support domestic natural gas production and the opportunities for steady, sustained economic and revenue growth? Or will we go down a path of higher taxes, fewer local jobs and frankly, very little revenue?\Gas producers pay a special impact fee, our tax on natural gas, that has generated more than $1.2 billion. This unique fee is on top of all the other business taxes, including the second-highest-in-the-nation corporate net income tax.\Last year, this tax equated to a 9.1 percent effective production tax rate, the highest effective rate of any state that imposes a drilling activity tax. This impact tax generated more revenue than the combined severance tax collections of West Virginia, Ohio, Colorado and Arkansas, despite the fact that production in those four states exceeded Pennsylvania's.\These proposed energy tax increases, combined with chronic permitting challenges, an onslaught of new unnecessary regulations, and local natural gas pricing that is a third less than what operators and landowners receive in other competing regions, will put the commonwealth on a path that threatens growth and new energy investment.\Just last week, natural gas production in Louisiana, hit a four-year high. What's more, we've watched as hundreds of millions of dollars in new investments have been made recently in petrochemical manufacturing across the Gulf Coast region.\Pennsylvania is already lagging as the latest state data shows that Ohio and West Virginia have realized much larger production rate increases this year.\Given these fragile dynamics and the need to encourage job growth, our leaders in Harrisburg should work toward common-sense solutions that make Pennsylvania more competitive.\Credit: David Spigelmyer"
451,"A few weeks after proving yet again that the state government needs reliable, recurring sources of revenue, the state House went home Tuesday for its two-week Thanksgiving break without passing a means to provide it.\Four months late, the Legislature recently passed a budget that irresponsibly achieves supposed “balance” primarily by borrowing $1.5 billion to cover most of a $2.2 billion deficit. It also vastly expands gambling to provide another $200 million, but that is not guaranteed to produce any new revenue. As a result, the Independent Fiscal Office already has estimated that next year’s deficit will be at least $1 billion.\After passing the borrow-and-gamble budget, the House took up a bill to establish a long-overdue tax on natural gas extraction. A version of such a tax, which passed the Senate with Gov. Tom Wolf’s support, would produce about $100 million a year under current market and production conditions.\According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, drillers extracted 5.3 trillion cubic feet of natural gas from Pennsylvania in 2016. That ranked second among the states and accounted for 18.7 percent of the national total.\Yet lawmakers continue to treat the industry as a fragile startup that will go screaming into the night if the state imposes a fair tax. They maintain that fiction even as state taxpayers subsidize a massive petrochemical refinery in Beaver County that will use vast amounts of gas, electricity producers plan at least 40 gas-powered plants in the state, and pipelines expand to carry gas to bigger markets, including abroad as liquefied natural gas.\Because a severance tax is not included in the budget, it’s not yet clear whether the House debate is aimed at establishing one or is a political charade to provide cover for representatives who serve the gas industry more so than taxpayers in their districts, as legislative and gubernatorial elections loom in 2018.\After the bill was introduced, legislators filed more than 300 amendments. Many have been defeated, rendered moot or withdrawn - including a farcical one that would have renamed as a severance tax the existing local impact fee. But tellingly, the major one that has been approved favors the industry. It would, in effect, accelerate the Department of Environmental Protection permitting process for wells. If the DEP does not deliver a verdict on a permit application within a certain number of days, regardless of the issues, the permit would be deemed to be approved.\When they slouch back to the Capitol on Dec. 4, House members should approve a severance tax without larding it with gifts to the industry. Pennsylvania is the only gas-drilling state that does not have a severance tax; there is no need to trade environment protection for it.\Credit: Standard-Speaker"
452," State Rep. Raymond Bunt Jr.'s constituents are unhappy about education and the environment.\ They don't like the idea of increasing the gasoline tax to pay for mass transit.\ And they think non-violent offenders should do their time under house arrest while young criminals should be put in boot camps and disciplined like military recruits.\ Those are some of the results of a survey mailed by Bunt to his constituents in Montgomery County. About 18 percent, or 1,151, responded, Bunt said.\ Bunt shares some of their views but not others.\ He sends out questionnaires about twice a year and uses them as a guide in voting on legislation.\ Bunt, a Republican, represents the 147th District, which includes Upper Hanover, Marlborough, Salford, Upper Salford, Lower Salford and Franconia townships and the boroughs of East Greenville, Pennsburg, Red Hill, Telford and Schwenksville.\ Here's how his constituents answered 13 questions on issues ranging from education to day care to video poker and what his views are on those issues:\ *Do you think parents should be permitted to choose which public school their children will attend?\ The constituents were nearly evenly divided, with 50.4 percent saying yes and 49.6 percent saying no.\ A majority, or 63.3 percent, believe the quality of education in local schools has deteriorated in the last five years. Just 36.7 percent think it has improved.\ Said Bunt: ""That's a direct indication of the labor strife and taxation they have incurred, especially in the North Penn and Indian Valley areas.""\ School administrators say quality is increasing along with the cost of education, but the public disagrees, he said.\ Concerned about rising taxes and teacher salaries, taxpayer groups have formed in the North Penn and Souderton Area school districts. A strike several years ago in the North Penn district closed classes for some weeks and led to a lawsuit by parents protesting teachers' right to strike. That matter is now before the state Supreme Court.\ Bunt likes the idea of letting parents choose their children's school.\ ""I see it as a way of forcing competitiveness among schools to raise standards.""\ *Is state government adequately addressing environmental issues to ensure clean air and water now and in the future?\ Three-quarters of those responding said no.\ But Bunt believes the state is doing a great deal.\ His constituents' answer ""indicates to me that perhaps the message is not getting out to the public on just how actively involved they are in addressing those issues,"" he said.\ *Do you support the installation of video poker machines in taverns to offset local property taxes?\ A slim majority, 51.1 percent, supports the idea.\ Bunt opposes it, although he would let voters in each municipality decide in a local referendum.\ ""It would jeopardize the lottery fund. That pays for every senior citizen program we have,"" he said.\ *Do you believe the state is doing enough to help families where both parents must work obtain adequate and affordable child day care?\ Fifty-nine percent think the state is doing enough.\ Bunt disagrees. He thinks the state and federal governments are not giving people a large enough tax deduction for their day-care expenses.\ *To ease prison overcrowding, do you approve of allowing inmates to earn time off for good behavior while they serve their sentences?\ A majority, 59.4 percent, said no.\ Said Bunt: ""They want to see them serve all the time they're committed to.""\ But he favors ""good time"" for non-violent offenders as a way to decrease prison crowding and the need to build new prisons.\ Sixty-one percent of those responding think the state should spend $200 million over 20 years to help counties build more prisons to end the crowding.\ Bunt said he would vote for the proposal, which could help Montgomery County expand its prison.\ Warden Lawrence V. Roth Jr. has said the county needs two new facilities -- one for women prisoners and one for short-term inmates.\ The county commissioners have not decided whether to approve an expansion. The present prison was finished in 1986 but already houses nearly twice the number of inmates intended.\ Bunt's constituents gave a thumbs-up to another proposal for easing crowding.\ Fifty-eight percent said non-violent offenders should be allowed to serve their sentences under house arrest with the use of electronic surveillance.\ Said Bunt: ""It's a great idea.""\ And 96.8 percent of those responding said that offenders ages 17 to 25 should be put in boot camps that have military discipline and that first-time offenders should be kept away from hardened criminals.\ Bunt also approves of the idea but thinks it could be used for all non-violent offenders. The camps could be set up in military facilities that are no longer being used, he said.\ *Would you support an increase in the gasoline tax if the money would be used for mass transit (the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority or SEPTA) and for roads and bridges?\ The answer was no, with 69.8 percent in opposition.\ But 53.3 percent said they would support a gas tax increase if the money was used only for roads and bridges.\ Bunt said he would approve of a gas tax increase that would be used for SEPTA if some of the money also went to roads and bridges.\ ""My district is suburban to rural. There is no existing public transportation,"" he said.\ ""The decision to place public transportation in my area has to be made by SEPTA and the county commissioners, and there has been no action on their part to push for it, perhaps for a very good reason,"" he said.\ ""There would probably not be the type of ridership necessary to subsidize it.""\ People in his district ""like the mobility and independence their own personal auto extends,"" he said.\ *Do you believe the state police initiative to conduct random checkpoints to stop motorists will result in a reduction of drunken driving situations?\ Most, or 71.8 percent, said they think it will.\ Bunt said that answer shows that the respondents think the state police should be allowed to use highway checkpoints to screen for drunken drivers.\ He favors the checkpoints if they are set up at random and not deliberately placed in front of taverns and restaurants.\ *Do you believe that government should place restrictions on handgun ownership?\ A majority, 58.7 percent, said yes. But Bunt thinks the question was worded too broadly, and he plans to ask questions about specific restrictions, such as waiting periods, in a future survey."
453,"HARRISBURG -- For the foreseeable future, Pennsylvania will retain its dubious distinction as the only state with underground shale that doesn't impose a natural gas extraction tax.\An unhappy Gov. Ed Rendell admitted Thursday that despite weeks of talks, he and General Assembly leaders have failed to agree on key details of a gas severance tax, including how high the rate should be and how the $100 million or more in annual revenue from such a levy should be divvied up.\Democrat Rendell had been pushing for enactment of a shale-gas tax since his 2010-11 state budget speech in February, but now says it ""clearly is dead this year"" -- and for a lot longer if Republican Tom Corbett is elected governor on Nov. 2, because he opposes such a tax.\""The refusal of Senate and House Republicans to negotiate in good faith on terms of a promised natural gas severance tax has killed the effort to enact it into law this year,"" Mr. Rendell said.\Legislative Republicans, in turn, put the blame back on Mr. Rendell and House Democrats.\Environmental groups such as Penn Future and the Sierra Club were angry, because some of the gas-tax revenue would be used to protect the environment from drilling-related damage. \Penn Future President Jan Jarrett assailed Senate GOP leaders for the failure to work out a deal.\But Kathryn Klaber, president of the Marcellus Shale Coalition, a group of large gas producers, said Senate leaders ""deserve credit for their months of work.""\Besides Pennsylvania, the only other shale state without a shale gas tax is New York, but it has imposed a moratorium on drilling."
454,"TO THE EDITORS:\It's shocking to me that Pennsylvania remains the only major drilling state in the nation that has failed to implement a severance tax on natural gas drilling.\Due to the destructive and dangerous nature of Marcellus shale drilling, it only makes sense to direct a portion of the funds to the state's environmental and conservation programs.\One way revenue from a severance tax should be put to work to protect our environment is by funding Pennsylvania's Growing Greener program. This program is one of the state's most successful environmental protection programs, working to protect the outdoor spaces that make the state great and protecting and restoring Pennsylvania's rivers, lakes and streams.\Unfortunately, the Growing Greener program is about to run out of money to do this important work. It's sensible to use severance tax revenue to renew the Growing Greener program and protect these natural resources. I hope that concerned citizens will contact their state representatives and senators and ask them to renew Growing Greener.\Meredith Meisenheimer \PennEnvironment\Philadelphia\(Editors' note: PennEnvironment is a statewide, citizen-based environmental advocacy organization with citizen members in Lancaster and across the Commonwealth.)"

HARRISBURG -- Democratic Gov. Ed Rendell and Senate Republicans remained ""worlds apart"" on a natural gas severance tax after a meeting Tuesday, and prospects for its approval diminished with two Senate voting days remaining in the 2009-10 legislative session.
\
""I don't believe we're any closer to a deal,"" Senate President Pro Tempore Joe Scarnati of Jefferson County said after the meeting in the governor's mansion. A compromise Rendell proposed didn't exempt producers of gas from shallow wells and could drive them out of state, Scarnati said.
\
Rendell said he was disappointed, reminding legislative leaders they promised to devise a plan by Oct. 1 to tax gas from the mile-deep Marcellus shale formation. He said some technical objections Senate Republicans raised were ""a bunch of bull."" He said he would consider exempting shallow gas well producers.
\
The deadlock over a severance tax is ""politics, pure and simple,"" said Jerry Shuster, a professor of political communications at the University of Pittsburgh.
\
The stance taken by the candidates for governor on taxing Marcellus shale gas is ""a major reason for the stalemate,"" Shuster said. Republican Tom Corbett, the state attorney general, is airing TV ads criticizing Democrat Dan Onorato, the Allegheny County executive, for supporting a ""massive energy tax"" that's under debate. Corbett opposes a severance tax.
\
A looming state budget deficit of at least $4 billion in 2011 likely will prompt lawmakers to reconsider a shale tax next session, even if there's a governor who campaigned against it, Shuster said.
\
Rendell's plan at least was closer to one the Senate would consider than was a measure the House approved last month, Scarnati said.
\
The Senate would levy a tax of 1.5 percent for the first three years and 5 percent thereafter. One proposal Rendell offered would impose a tax of 3 percent the first year, 4 percent the second year and 5 percent the third year, Rendell said. The House bill imposes a tax of 39 cents per 1,000 cubic feet of gas, based on the price of natural gas; at current prices, that's a 10 percent tax.
\
Rendell said his proposal was ""fair to the industry. It was fair to the taxpayers. It's fair to protecting our environment.""
\
""The Senate Republicans have a singular goal -- to protect big gas drilling companies at the expense of Pennsylvania taxpayers and landowners -- and that stance is simply unacceptable,"" said House Majority Leader Todd Eachus, D-Luzerne County.
\
Even if legislative leaders reach agreement on a tax rate, getting a bill to the governor's desk in two days remains problematic. The House recessed until after the Nov. 2 election, and the Senate plans no post-election session. But lawmakers could be called back.

457,"HARRISBURG -- With just over a month to go before the deadline, state officials are still far apart in working out an agreement for a new tax on natural gas extracted from deep underground areas of Marcellus Shale.\Gov. Ed Rendell traveled Friday to Wellsboro in Tioga County, on the northern fringe of Pennsylvania but in the heart of Marcellus Shale country, to repeat his call for the state Legislature to enact a gas severance tax by Oct. 1. That target date for enacting such a tax was established in early July, when a deal on the 2010-11 state budget was reached.\Mr. Rendell is counting on $70 million being generated by the Marcellus Shale tax this fiscal year to help erase a $282 million deficit in the budget.\He'd like to see a tax structured like the one in West Virginia -- imposing a 5 percent levy on the value of the natural gas that's sold, plus an additional 4.7 cents for each 1,000 cubic feet of gas produced.\Some Marcellus gas producers think that's too high, and say the tax shouldn't be prohibitive when the industry is just getting started.\But Mr. Rendell said, ""Pennsylvania is the 15th largest production state for natural gas, but is the only major fossil fuel producer that does not levy a tax on natural gas extraction. That's just not fair.""\To his audience in Wellsboro, he added, ""With your help, we are going to change that.""\Mr. Rendell wants to get a tax in place because natural gas extraction, especially in the areas of the state where Marcellus Shale is located, has been significantly increasing in recent years, raising fears about damage to roads and water supplies.\So far this year, 1,765 natural gas wells have been drilled in the state, including 848 wells in areas of Marcellus Shale. And of those wells, 171 have been drilled in Tioga County alone. The state Department of Environmental Protection has already issued more than 1,900 permits for Marcellus Shale drilling in the state, a figure expected to reached 2,700 by year's end.\Lt. Gov. Joe Scarnati of Jefferson, the top Republican in the state Senate, said he wants to work with Democrat Rendell to meet the Oct. 1 tax deadline, but he criticized what he called ""the governor's almost punitive approach toward the [natural gas] industry"" in working toward such a tax.\Mr. Scarnati said the governor seems like he ""wants to punish the industry"" by raising new taxes to fill a budget hole, rather than helping towns to fix roads damaged by heavy trucks and drilling equipment and to protect water supplies from hazardous ""fracking fluids"" that are used to extract the gas from the underground shale.\Mr. Rendell said he too wants to protect the environment and groundwater supplies near drilling sites and to finance state inspectors who check to make sure drilling is being done safely.\""To accomplish these goals,"" Mr. Rendell said, ""the gas companies profiting from this rapidly growing industry should be willing to pay a fair share levy."" He said a recent poll showed that eight out of 10 state residents favored a tax on gas companies.\Mr. Scarnati said he is meeting with representatives of the industry, environmental groups and officials of the counties and towns where drilling is going on, and hopes to have a shale tax proposal ready when legislators return to the Capitol in mid-September. He said he wants to address how much money it is fair to raise and where it should be spent. \""Hopefully we'll come up with a comprehensive package that's a starting point for negotiations,"" he said. ""It's my goal to fulfill the obligation for Oct. 1, but I'm not going to fulfill it solely on what the governor wants or on what he will or won't accept."""

They signed a pledge to the people of Pennsylvania to enact a tax that requires drilling companies to pay their fair share for removing our state's natural resources from the ground, and now they are walking away from that commitment.""\Legislative Republicans, in turn, put the blame back on Mr. Rendell and House Democrats. Senate President Pro Tem Joe Scarnati said he and other Senate GOP leaders had worked hard this summer and fall to find a compromise, but Mr. Rendell himself got involved only in the last few days.\Senate GOP spokesman Erik Arneson said his caucus was ""surprised by the governor's unilateral decision"" to end the shale-gas talks and said Mr. Rendell should reconsider. But the governor said Republicans have been unyielding, so further talks wouldn't work.\""It's obvious they have killed the severance tax in this legislative session,"" Mr. Rendell said.\Environmental groups such as Penn Future and the Sierra Club were angry, because some of the gas-tax revenue would be used to protect the environment from drilling-related damage.\Penn Future President Jan Jarrett assailed Senate GOP leaders for the failure to work out a deal., claiming they ""stalled, delayed and threw up absurd excuses while claiming they wanted to pass a tax. They refused to take action and then left Harrisburg. Their promise to the people of Pennsylvania was worthless. There is no excuse for this failure.""\But Kathryn Klaber, president of the Marcellus Shale Coalition, a group of large gas producers, said Senate leaders ""deserve credit for their months of work."" in trying to fashion ""a competitive, well-balance package"" of regulations so Pennsylvania can be a leader in shale gas production.\About 30 other states, including well-known energy states like Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana, impose some level of tax on natural gas. Besides Pennsylvania, the only other shale state without a shale gas tax is New York, but it has imposed a moratorium on drilling.\The current General Assembly session ends Nov. 30, and a new two-year session opens in January. But if Republican Corbett is the new governor, there may never been an extraction tax, since he strongly opposes the idea. Democrat Dan Onorato said he will push for a tax but hasn't said what tax rate he would seek.\Some critics have linked legislators' inaction on a tax -- or their outright opposition -- to the hefty political contributions some state officials are getting from gas-drilling companies. According to a Common Cause/Pennsylvania compilation (available online at Marcellusmoney.org), Mr. Corbett is the largest recipient by far, at over $700,000. Mr. Scarnati is second, at $143,000. Mr. Rendell and Mr. Onorato are third and fourth.\""Pennsylvanians know that the drillers have spent millions in campaign contributions and high-powered lobbyists to achieve this [death of the tax],"" Ms. Jarrett said.\But legislators from parts of the state where Marcellus Shale is located -- the western and northern-tier sections -- said the gas drilling is a long-awaited economic bonanza and fear that a tax would drive gas companies to other states, costing Pennsylvania jobs and land-leasing revenue.\For weeks, House Democrats and Senate Republicans have been pointing fingers at each other over their inability to agree on a severance tax. The House noted that it had approved a shale gas tax in late September, but the Senate went home without acting on it.\But Republican senators said the House had delayed its action until just a day before Oct. 1, the self-imposed deadline that state officials had given themselves for enacting a severance tax, and even then had sent a legally flawed bill over to the Senate.\That bill was a measure previously passed by the Senate, with the language completely changed to include a tax of 39 cents per thousand cubic feet (MCF) of gas pumped from underground areas of Marcellus Shale. But Republicans said that under the state constitution, all revenue-related bills must originate in the House, not the Senate, so the bill would have fallen in a court challenge.\They also said that 39 cents per MCF rate was far too high. Senate Republicans proposed a 1.5 percent tax on the value of the gas at the wellhead for the first five years, rising to 5 percent after that.\Mr. Rendell had proposed a 3 percent tax the first year, 4 percent the second year and 5 percent a year thereafter, but not enough legislators supported it.\The two parties also clashed over how to spend the tax revenue. Mr. Rendell wanted to use $70 million to balance the state's $28 billion budget, but the GOP didn't think the revenue should go for ""bureaucratic"" spending. Democrats said the failure to enact a tax leaves a $70 million hole in the current budget, which may have to be made up through layoffs.\Some Republicans said the shale tax revenue should go just for repairing environmental damage done by gas-drilling operations or damage to municipal roads caused by drilling equipment."

WASHINGTON - Falling gas prices have been a boon not only to American drivers, but also to Uncle Sam.
\
They've spurred fuel consumption, generating about $1.5 billion in unanticipated gas tax collections. They've also sparked a budget battle between Clinton and the Republican-controlled Congress.
\
The president wants to spend the money on an array of transportation programs, but Republicans say the nation's new highway bill limits any extra spending to road construction.
\
""Instead of each transportation program receiving a proportional increase as was agreed to in the law, the president seeks to steer gas taxes away from flexible state programs to programs run by federal bureaucrats,"" said Rep. Bud Shuster, R-Pa., chairman of the House Transportation Committee.
\
The administration sees things differently. With some $25 billion already in the pipeline for highway construction projects, and $1.46 billion in extra gas tax money now expected, the new Transportation Department budget proposes diverting some of tax money elsewhere:
\
$730 million for road construction, congestion reduction and air quality improvements, as allowed by the highway bill.
\
$291 million for mass transit.
\
$250 million for surface transportation research.
\
$125 million for National Highway Traffic Safety Administration safety programs.
\
$35 million for rail programs, including grade-crossing eliminations.
\
$25 million for a transportation preservation program.
\
All told, roughly 50 percent would be spent in ways other than those outlined in the highway bill.
\
""We are proposing to direct those resources to programs that we think are strategic and are in keeping with the overall needs identified by the administration, where we focus on investments in the environment, safety, technology and the like,"" Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater said Monday during a briefing on the department's $45.5 billion budget.
\
No matter how low the price of gas goes, drivers still pay their local, state and federal governments an average of 43 cents per gallon in taxes. The federal take is 18.4 cents.
\
Congress and the administration appeared to end their battle over the money last June, when President Clinton signed into law the biggest transportation bill in the country's history. The measure allocated $167 billion to improve, widen and extend the nation's highway system through 2003. It also budgeted $36 billion for improving mass transit systems. The split was roughly 80-20 between highways and mass transit.
\
A hallmark of the bill was a provision requiring the government to spend all future gas tax collections on transportation projects. That was a major shift from past policy in which a portion of the receipts was held and used to reduce the size of the overall government budget deficit.

461,"Once again the PG's Dan Simpson drills straight to the proverbial gas deposit of truth (""Tax Shale Gas and Greedy CEOs,"" Sept. 8 column). Will we once again permit the extractive industry to make off with our natural resources while leaving us taxpayers to pick up the bill for the mess? \Well, if the Marcellus Shale Coalition has its way, I fully expect the term ""Pennsylvanian"" to become the latest synonym for ""sap."" I do believe, however, that we citizens of the commonwealth can overcome the drillers' fierce lobbying and obtain a fair return on the order of West Virginia's tax rate. We must pay attention during these last crucial weeks when the deal is going to be struck.\Just as important as passing a reasonable levy on extracted gas will be, so will where the revenues are allocated. Rep. David Levdansky proposes a fair split between state coffers and local governments, with a portion also set aside for renewing programs like the very successful Growing Greener. These programs have generated such benefits as bike trails and acid mine drainage mitigation and have been raided by the Legislature in its mad scramble to balance the budget. \We can be sure that if the gas income is used just to plug holes in the state General Fund, counties and municipalities as well as the programs and agencies that protect and improve our environment will be shortchanged.\ROBERT STEFFES\Aliquippa"
462,"It angers me to read about the reluctance of the state legislators to raise the tax on gasoline by 3 to 4 cents and increase other fees for licenses, etc. No one likes to pay taxes; however, when the tax is this small, it is easier to take. \It has to be obvious to everyone that the state needs money for public transportation and repairing the infrastructure. If the legislators wait until after the elections, nothing will be done. The state will still need money. The bridges and roads will still need to be repaired, and the general public, who depend on public transportation, will be stranded. \Also what happened to the agreement the legislators made to enact a new tax by Oct. 1 on natural gas extracted from deep underground areas of Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania? (""PennFuture Pushes for Tax on Shale Gas,"" Aug. 31). The gas drilling companies should save their money instead of spending enormous amounts on lobbying and advertising. I agree with PennFuture President Jan Jarrett, who said ""it's only fair"" to make the gas companies pay a ""reasonable tax"" to protect the environment, balance the budget and help communities. \If the legislators are so worried about the reaction of the citizens, I suggest that they give up their ""walking around money"" and other perks so that the citizens of the state would believe the legislators are acting in good faith and would re-elect the legislators and not hold it against them. \Something has to be done now.\LAURA LYNSKEY \Monroeville"
463,"It became apparent this past week where Gov. Tom Corbett will aim his biggest political cannons in what has become his desperate bid to get re-elected.\The main salvos target U.S. Rep. Allyson Schwartz, a Democrat from Montgomery County who is seen as a likely challenger to Corbett in next year's election.\A press release from the Tom Corbett for Governor Campaign attacked what it said was a tax increase being proposed by Schwartz.\""If this is a preview of Allyson Schwartz's tax and spend agenda, Pennsylvanians better hide their wallets,"" the release said.\The problem with that claim is that it focuses on a tax favored by Schwartz that would not hit regular Pennsylvanians, but would force wealthy gas industry robber barons from places like Texas to pay a gas extraction tax they already must pay in every major gas-producing state -- except Pennsylvania.\I generally avoid writing about partisan contests because I have nothing but contempt for the wholly corrupt two-party monopoly. Corbett's latest missive, however, is so offensive it cannot be ignored.\""Congresswoman Allyson Schwartz's proposal to drastically increase taxes on the shale gas industry will cost Pennsylvanians good-paying, middle class jobs by forcing the industry to relocate to more business and energy friendly states,"" the Corbett campaign bellowed.\""Gov. Corbett has consistently stood with the middle class in his efforts to create jobs, grow our economy and responsibly use our natural resources while protecting the environment,"" the press release said. ""Pennsylvania is fortunate enough to have a booming natural gas industry to help lead the charge in lowering energy costs ... and creating over 130,000 new opportunities for Pennsylvanians to return to work.""\Oh, really? Let's start with Corbett's marvelous job-creation program.\As I reported in May, data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics showed Pennsylvania was in seventh place in the nation regarding job growth when Corbett took office in 2011. By this year, the state was in 49th place, surpassing only Wyoming, where job growth depends partly on the number of cowpokes giddyapping around.\The best job growth was in Texas, perhaps thanks in part to Corbett's lavish assistance to the industrial interests there. Texas had an increase of 322,600 jobs while Pennsylvania, under Corbett, lost 1,800. In the meantime, Corbett chopped around $1 billion in funding for education.\Also in the meantime, Corbett engineered the Marcellus Shale Law, which provided for meager ""impact fees"" instead of a meaningful ""severance tax"" on gas extractions (the approach favored by Schwartz).\That law also forced municipalities to allow the Texas gas industry robber barons to drill in all zoning areas, even residential, using the environmentally devastating hydraulic fracturing (fracking) process.\And don't think the robber barons were not grateful. They filled Corbett's coffers with more than $2 million in so-called political campaign contributions.\Schwartz, by the way, is a strong supporter of the gas industry if it is regulated and taxed properly, as am I. So how much money did the gas industry robber barons send her way? According to Pennsylvania Common Cause, it was $5,500 during the same period.\No other politicians come close to Corbett, but the national Common Cause organization said others across the nation also received big contributions from fracking interests, including western Pennsylvania Congressman Tim Murphy ($275,499) and Sen. Pat Toomey, who is from the Lehigh Valley ($160,750).\The Schwartz proposal for a 5 percent gas severance tax indeed would have a significant impact.\The Corbett campaign was responding to a report, released Wednesday by Schwartz, that said such a tax would have raised $612 million in the state's 2013-14 budget year alone, and that would increase to more than $2 billion a year a decade from now.\Would that, as Corbett claims, chase gas-drilling jobs out of Pennsylvania? Where would they go? To West Virginia, which also has a 5 percent severance tax? To Oklahoma, where it's 7 percent, or maybe to Texas, where it's 7.5 percent?\That $2 billion in revenue may seem like a lot to Pennsylvanians, especially to those now trying to find ways to finance public schools, but it's peanuts when compared to the untold billions the gas industry robber barons stand to rake in.\It is understandable why the Corbett campaign might resort to desperate claims against a potential gubernatorial challenger.\A Quinnipiac University poll recently asked Pennsylvanians if Corbett deserves to be re-elected. Fifty percent said ""no"" and only 32 percent said ""yes."" Asked how they'd vote if the election were held now with Corbett running against Schwartz, the poll revealed he'd get clobbered by a 47 to 34 percent margin. Against Rob McCord, the state treasurer, it would be 44 to 35 percent; against former Congressman Joe Sestak, it would be 48 to 34 percent.\It seems that most Pennsylvanians have become keenly aware of why they really need to hide their wallets.\paul.carpenter@mcall.com 610-820-6176\Paul Carpenter's commentary appears Sundays, Wednesdays and Fridays.\Credit: Paul Carpenter Of The Morning Call\Credit: Paul Carpenter Of The Morning Call"
464,"Any transportation official knows how to deal with a broken-down car blocking rush-hour traffic: Move it to the side of the road and let everyone else get where they're going.\This comes to mind as Congress starts work on yet another transportation bill -- only a few months after passing the last one, which was just another in a long series of temporary extensions.\The problem is the gasoline tax. Set in nominal terms, it has declined in value drastically since it was last increased in 1993 -- even as the price of gas itself has tripled. As a result, both the main Highway Trust Fund and its transit account (often called the transit trust fund) are bankrupt.\Every bipartisan commission that has studied the situation has advocated raising the tax, but a polarized Congress has been unable to do it. Last year's funding law known as the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act, or MAP-21, even required a $21 billion transfer from general revenue, increasing the deficit but avoiding a tax hike.\A strong, smart, well-funded federal program would be great. But if Congress can't pass one now, it should just get itself out of the way, by eliminating the federal gas tax entirely and cutting Washington's role in surface transportation. It would be a big change, but it would streamline government. And it would probably lead to more investment in infrastructure and greener transportation policies.\The basic reason the present system isn't working is that there is no longer a consensus in Congress on what a national transportation program should be. From 1956 to 1991, the objective was to build the interstate highway system. Then, the focus shifted to highway maintenance and transit. Absent a grand policy, earmarks kept every congressman invested in a big transportation bill; but these are no more.\As a result, ""getting back our share"" has become the key objective, so that every state now gets as much (or more) money in transportation grants as it pays in federal gas taxes.\Eliminating the federal role would enhance state autonomy and streamline decision making. What's more exciting is that it would also lead to more and better spending on transportation.\In poll after poll, Americans say they are willing to invest in roads and bridges, as long as it brings about improvements they will use. However, people don't generally support raising the gas tax, for the simple reason that they think their current gas taxes, which are mostly federal, are wasted.\Getting rid of the tax would force a serious discussion in each state about how, and how much, to fund roads and transit. Because the biggest states have the biggest needs, this would probably increase investment nationally.\It would also lead to greener transportation policies. Traditionally, environmentalists have supported higher federal gas taxes as a way to discourage driving and fund federal programs for transit and to mitigate congestion. But the current tax -- roughly 6 percent at current prices -- is too low to change consumer habits. And funding formulas that can gain congressional support usually benefit those states with the most automobile-dependent policies.\In fact, the most car-centric states tend to be the ones most opposed to raising the gas tax. Without federal transportation money, they would be the most likely to reduce spending on new roads. Conversely, those states most willing to raise funds for transportation are already the ones most likely to invest in transit, walkable streets or bike lanes.\Ending the federal program would be relatively straightforward. The gas tax and all programs it funds would sunset, perhaps after a few years to allow states time to adjust. This would amount to a $29 billion annual federal tax cut, plus a reduction in the federal deficit of roughly $10 billion per year, because the trust funds would stop overspending. Some 4,000 federal jobs could be trimmed.\Washington's ability to set national standards for maintenance and highway design could even continue, because of commitments that the states made to the federal government years ago to obtain interstate highway dollars.\The Obama administration might find good politics in a proposal like this. Evoking Ronald Reagan's ""new federalism,"" it would position the president as being in favor of tax cuts, deficit reductions and smaller government -- when these things make sense.\It would force 30 Republican governors to wrestle with the question of how to fund their own highway spending. And it would be good policy, consistent with President Barack Obama's support for the environment and for rebuilding U.S. infrastructure.\Ending the federal surface-transportation program would be a radical move. But if Congress can't get in gear, moving its stalled car out of the way of American transportation policy might help us all get where we need to go.\WRITE TO US To submit a letter or an essay for consideration for Your Business, send it via email to business@post-gazette.com or to Post-Gazette Business Section, 34 Blvd. of the Allies, Pittsburgh 15222.

HARRISBURG -- Democratic gubernatorial candidate Dan Onorato said Wednesday that Pennsylvania should use a natural gas tax rate that averages those from 20 states, but he declined to say what number he would support.
\
Later, his campaign spokesman Brian Herman said Onorato ""wasn't saying, 'Look at a number and pick a number.' "" The point is, he said, ""so we're competitive with other states.""
\
Matt Pitzarella, spokesman for Range Resources, a Fort Worth energy company with local headquarters in Cecil, said the average among states with substantial drilling in the Marcellus shale formation would be 2 percent to 3 percent for the first four or five years, and probably a little more than 6 percent after that.
\
""The concept is good, but it's not feasible because not all 20 states have shale plays,"" said Pitzarella. ""However, it makes perfect sense to make that analogy and look at the average of the tax structures for leading shale gas states.""
\
But, said Robert Strauss, a professor of public policy at Carnegie Mellon University: ""There's nothing economically, ethically or morally compelling about taking an average of what other states do.""
\
Onorato said he doesn't expect the Legislature to act on a tax by Wednesday, the Senate's last scheduled session day of the year.
\
""I really doubt they're going to pass anything,"" he said.
\
Onorato spoke to reporters after appearing before the Pennsylvania Council on Aging. The group invited Republican gubernatorial candidate Tom Corbett, but he did not attend, council officials said.
\
A severance tax on gas from the Marcellus shale formation is the top issue in the waning days of this legislative session.
\
Onorato for months has said he supports a ""competitive tax"" on the industry. He says Corbett's opposition to any tax is ""totally irresponsible"" and would leave taxpayers responsible for paying for any environmental damage.
\
Corbett's spokesman Kevin Harley criticized Onorato's approach. ""He says he is for a tax but refuses to say how much it should be,"" Harley said. ""This issue is very simple: Corbett is for jobs; Onorato is for taxes.""
\
Corbett contends the focus should be on attracting investment to Pennsylvania's energy infrastructure, creating jobs and protecting the environment. Pennsylvania has an overall tax structure punitive to business and industry, and a severance tax would add to that, Harley said.
\
The state House last week approved a tax that -- at current gas prices -- equals a 10 percent rate; Senate Republicans have suggested a 1.5 percent tax.
\
""The Democratic House bill was wrong. The Senate Republican bill is wrong,"" Onorato said.
\
Democratic Gov. Ed Rendell urged Senate Republicans to ""put your counteroffer on the table this week.""
\
When reporters asked Onorato to give the average of 20 states' rates, he replied they should ""ask Tom Corbett"" why he isn't supporting a reasonable tax bill.
\
According to report by a Carnegie Mellon researcher, 29 states have some sort of a gas tax on either the volume or value of the product; 20 states base their extraction taxes on the value of natural gas. Strauss supervised the report on states' taxation rates, which student Niyazi Ozpehriz compiled.
\
States vary greatly not only in the rate they levy but in how they tax -- depending on whether they tax the gas only or byproducts that come with it, and whether they measure the price at the well or destination, said Strauss.
\
The report found rates ranging from just more than 1 cent per thousand cubic feet (mcf) in California to $2.85 per mcf in Florida.
\
Among states with large shale plays, such as the Marcellus formation, Arkansas taxes 1.5 percent of the market value for two to three years, then 5 percent after that; Louisiana has a tax of 16.4 cents per mcf; and Texas taxes 7.5 percent of the market value.

467,"New ideas can be scary, especially new ideas from government that have the potential to cost you money.\But I hope we can set aside any fears and take a serious look at a proposal for revamping how Pennsylvania pays for its road maintenance, road construction and mass transit.\A recommendation to scrap our oppressive gas tax and replace it by charging drivers for every mile traveled was delivered to Gov. Tom Wolf and state lawmakers last week.\People who use roads more should pay more for their maintenance.\The gas tax no longer can be the centerpiece of the funding system because it's no longer a fair measure, or sufficient to cover the needs.\Vehicles on our roads have a wide range of fuel efficiency. People who have to buy gas more often should not subsidize the system for others. People driving electric vehicles, especially, need to be made to pay their fair share.\Last Friday's report was written by the Transportation Revenue Options Commission.\Formed by Wolf in March, it had nearly 50 members, including state lawmakers and administrators, municipal and transportation industry officials, and representatives from the construction industry, business associations and labor unions. The executive director of the Lehigh Valley Planning Commission, Becky Bradley, was a member.\The commission's report recommends phasing out the gas tax - Pennsylvania's is the second-highest in the nation at 58.7 cents per gallon - and replacing it with an 8.1 cent fee for every mile driven.\Some people would pay more and others would pay less under that plan. I believe the idea has merit. And I say that knowing I could be paying more.\While I am working from home now, if I had to resume commuting to an office in Allentown and was charged for miles driven, I'd be paying about $5.18 cents per day. When I was commuting, I was burning about two gallons of gas a day, which cost me about $1.17 in state gas taxes.\My wife also works about an hour from home, and she will be returning to the office full-time soon.\As lawmakers and the governor consider the recommendations, they need to evaluate the impact of people working from home because of the COVID-19 pandemic. It's unlikely that everyone will resume traveling to work. Some offices have been closed permanently, as employers recognize they can operate with a remote workforce.\The decision makers also must keep in mind that everyone benefits from roads, not just those who drive on them regularly.\Roads allow emergency vehicles, trash trucks and delivery drivers to reach our homes. They are community assets, and everyone should contribute something to their construction and upkeep. The system should be supported with general tax revenue too.\A similar attitude should be held toward mass transit. Users should pay their fair share, but bus and subway systems should be funded as a public service, too. They reduce congestion, cut pollution and provide transportation for people who cannot afford a car.\Last Friday's report had other recommendations for restructuring transportation funding.\They include to expand tolling; double the cost of annual vehicle registration; increase the tax rate on vehicle sales; increase fees on vehicle rentals and leases; impose a fee on taxis and ride sharing services such as Uber; charge a $1 fee for every package delivery; increase the jet fuel tax and impose a registration fee on aircraft.\The aircraft revenue would be used strictly for air-travel improvements.\In addition to creating a fairer funding system, charging drivers for every mile they drive could help the environment, too, by reducing pollution.\People might drive less if they knew they were going to pay every time they got in their car. They already are through the gas tax, but that's a hidden cost.\Maybe they would carpool. Bike. Take a bus. Order products online instead of driving to the store. Run multiple errands in one trip instead of making separate trips.\Pennsylvania is $9.3 billion short every year on the money it needs to adequately care for the state transportation system. The longer that major expenses, such as bridge replacements, are put off the more they could cost in the future.\The recommendations from the commission would help to raise the additional money that is needed. And do it in a fair way. They deserve serious consideration.\Morning Call columnist Paul Muschick can be reached at 610-820-6582 or paul.muschick@mcall.com.\Caption: Pennsylvania's gas tax is the second highest in the nation, at 58.7 cents per gallon.

468,"Paul Carpenter hit the nail on the head in his Jan. 5 column describing the unfortunate conditions that our state politicians have permitted involving the Marcellus shale mining.\I was one of many presenters at the Dec. 17, 2009, hearing sponsored by the state Department of Environmental Protection to give citizens and organizations an opportunity to address the issue of shale drilling and the associated fracking process. I was one of three representatives of the Delaware Riverkeeper Network who made a presentation.\Many of the governmental points I placed into the record have never been addressed by DEP or the Legislature. This is a major breach of much-needed legislation to protect the environment. Are residents correct in assuming that contributions to various political funds by the gas industry have resulted in special treatment to the shale-drilling companies? It certainly seems that way. It would appear that the politicians do not plan to tax the gas that is extracted. This is a major void and results in the free extraction of a national wealth -- lining the deep pockets of the gas industry.\Pennsylvania's Legislature and governor have failed the residents in the environmental and financial areas.

469,"HARRISBURG -- The blame game and the partisan finger-pointing were in high gear at the Capitol on Tuesday, which meant the chances of enacting a Marcellus Shale gas severance tax were close to zero.\Major disputes between Republicans and Democrats were preventing progress, including disagreements over what tax rate should be used on the natural gas pumped from the deep underground shale, as well as what bill should be used as a legislative ""vehicle"" for enacting a tax.\Democratic Gov. Ed Rendell said Senate Republican leaders had, in early July, joined Democrats and the administration to promise citizens that a shale gas tax would be enacted by Oct. 1, adding, ""Republicans should join with us and fulfill our commitment to the people.""\Senate Republican leaders replied that they'd been working hard all summer to try to fashion a gas tax. ""I can look anyone in the eye and say that Senate Republicans lived up to the intent"" to have a gas tax, said Senate President Pro Tem Joe Scarnati, R-Jefferson.\Mr. Scarnati and Senate Republican leader Dominic Pileggi of Delaware County claimed Mr. Rendell had delayed for weeks before personally entering the tax negotiations a few days ago, adding, ""He wasn't part of the debate.""\This irked the governor, who called the comment ""a bunch of bull,"" adding that two top aides, Steve Crawford and Colleen Kopp, had worked diligently with legislators for months on the issue. He said he was personally involved ""because I was shocked at the lack of progress.""\Nonetheless, Mr. Pileggi said Tuesday, ""We are far apart from any agreement."" \While another negotiating session is set for today, Mr. Scarnati said, ""We are still worlds apart"" on a tax rate.\Two weeks ago, the House sent to the Senate a bill for a tax of 39 cents per thousand cubic feet (MCF) of gas, but senators say that's too high. They also complained that the method used to enact it would be constitutionally defective. They said House Democrats stripped out the language of a bill that originated in the Senate and substituted the gas-tax language, which Republicans said was a mistake because all revenue-raising measures must start in the House.\Mr. Scarnati called on the House to start over -- with a new, constitutionally acceptable bill -- and send it to the Senate no later than Nov. 1, the day before the election. Thursday is the Senate's last session day this year, but senators left open the possibility of returning in the next two weeks if the House sends them an acceptable gas-tax bill. However, Mr. Pileggi said the Senate wouldn't return for any business after the Nov. 2 election, and the current session will end Nov. 30.\Besides the issues of the tax rate and method of enacting the tax, there's a dispute over how to spend the $100 million or more in gas-tax revenue.\Mr. Rendell wants some revenue to go to the state general fund. Republicans would rather use it for protecting the environment and helping towns whose roads have been damaged by gas-drilling equipment. Mr. Rendell is willing to use some of the revenue for those purposes but said some was needed to balance the state budget.\Mr. Scarnati also said longtime gas producers in the state who drill shallow wells should be exempted from any new tax. The Marcellus gas wells go deep underground, he said, and those large drillers are more financially able than shallow-well drillers to bear the cost of such a tax.\Mr. Rendell said he could compromise on such an exemption. The governor disagreed with the contention that the House-passed gas tax bill was constitutionally flawed, calling that idea ""a red herring."" He said it was easy to solve the problem -- have the Senate add a gas-tax provision to one of two other House-passed bills now before the Senate.\One pertains to a state energy office and the other would place a moratorium on additional leasing of state forests for gas drilling.\House Speaker Keith McCall, D-Carbon, called on the Senate to amend one of those bills and return it to the House. But Republican senators were insisting that the House act first on a new bill, and neither side seemed willing to give in.\Mr. Rendell on Tuesday mentioned a new compromise on a gas tax rate. He was vague, but it apparently would be a 3 percent levy on the sale price of natural gas in the first year, rising to a 4 percent tax in the second year and a 5 percent tax in the third year. This would replace the 39 cent per MCF tax rate contained in the House-passed bill."

A study advising a $1-per-gallon gas tax hike - along with taxes to dampen the use of coal, oil and natural gas - is not exactly getting a bear hug from the Clinton administration. You'd have thought, given the rhetoric of the Bush campaign, that Clinton-Gore green team would have leapt at the opportunity. But Mr. Clinton knows full well the pitfalls of breaking tax pledges - and he's got one of his own: No new middle-class tax hikes (for the moment).
\
Some of the proposals appear lifted from the pages of Al Gore's Earth in the Balance, but Mr. Clinton is proceeding with extreme caution. He hasn't ruled out increased gas taxes, but says he doesn't want to consider them without first redressing middle-class ""tax unfairness.""
\
We don't blame the guy for keeping his powder dry. But we'd like to thank the National Commission on the Environment, the blue-ribbon group that made the suggestions, nonetheless. Its report keeps the pressure on. As former the Nixon Environmental Protection Agency chief, Russell E. Train, the panel's chairman, put it: ""Unless this country takes bold steps now to marry environmental and economic prosperity, the risks of continued environmental deterioration and long-term economic decline are grave.""
\
Before the knee-jerk anti-taxers start in on the proposals - which also call on the United States to encourage environmentally safe technology and to become more engaged in stabilizing global population - there are three points to consider. The first is that Mr. Fixit himself, Ross Perot, said a top order of business should be a 50-cent gas tax, the better to reduce the deficit, cut energy use and clean up the air.
\
The second is that the commission was hardly a bunch of tree-hugging naifs. Besides Clinton economic advisor Alice Rivlin, it included senior executives of the Aluminum Co. of America, BankAmerica Corp. and Southern California Edision Co.

471,"
Gov. Rendell on Thursday said the effort to strike a deal this year on a natural-gas tax was ""dead,"" finally uttering the one word that no one had dared even whisper about the issue.
\
In doing so, the governor blamed legislative Republicans, saying they had refused for weeks to ""negotiate in good faith"" on establishing a tax rate for drilling in the Marcellus Shale, and accusing them of pandering to the drilling industry at the expense of Pennsylvania taxpayers.
\
""They clearly desire to put the costs of natural-gas drilling on the backs of Pennsylvania taxpayers, rather than on the large multinational oil and gas corporations who stand to reap enormous wealth from our state's resources,"" Rendell said in a statement Thursday morning.
\
He argued that failing to enact a tax would harm the environment, make it harder for local governments to deal with the impact of drilling, and cost the state millions in revenue at a time when it desperately needs it.
\
Legislative Republicans were quick to dispute the governor's accusations, saying they had worked for months not just to establish a fair tax rate, but to tackle a whole host of regulatory and safety issues related to drilling.
\
""We are surprised by the governor's unilateral decision to end negotiations on Marcellus Shale issues,"" said Erik Arneson, spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Dominic Pileggi (R., Delaware).
\
He added: ""We are willing to continue negotiations. . . . We hope the governor will reconsider his position.""
\
But the chances the two sides will have a meeting of the minds this late in the legislative season are slim.
\
That means any future substantive negotiating on the issue will happen with a new governor: either Republican Tom Corbett or Democrat Dan Onorato. Rendell's second and last term ends in mid-January.
\
Corbett has said during the campaign that he is against a natural-gas tax. Onorato supports taxing natural gas from the Marcellus Shale.
\
In the meantime, gas companies continue to plumb the Marcellus Shale formation, which lies beneath most of the state, without paying a levy on what they produce. That makes Pennsylvania the largest natural-gas-producing state without such a tax.
\
A coalition of gas companies drilling in Pennsylvania has said it would support what it calls a ""competitively structured"" tax if it were part of a larger package of legislative and regulatory changes.
\
But other drillers outright oppose any tax, noting that they already pay various taxes and fees to the state.
\
Rendell early this year proposed a 5 percent tax on sales of the extracted gas, and an additional 4.7 cents for every 1,000 cubic feet produced.
\
During recent negotiations, however, he offered to phase in a levy on gas extracted from the shale formation, starting at 3 percent next year and topping out at 5 percent.
\
The Democratic-controlled House last month approved a much heftier rate: a levy of a minimum of 39 cents per 1,000 cubic feet of natural gas produced (or about a 10 percent tax).
\
Senate Republicans have been saying for weeks they would support a 1.5 percent tax on the market value of gas from wells producing more than 150,000 cubic feet of gas. That rate would apply for the first five years of production, at which point the tax would increase to 5 percent.
\
Rendell has said he cannot sign such a proposal into law.

"
472,"Henry Olsen is executive director of The Commonwealth Foundation, a public-policy research organization based in Harrisburg.\ Gov. Ridge's announcement that he is proposing an increase in the state's gasoline tax comes as only a marginal surprise to those familiar with state policy.\ The transportation secretary, Bradley Mallory, has been openly lobbying for such an increase since the fall. This winter's storms have created a large, $145 million one-time capital need to repair the weather damage. However, it is surprising that the governor's package does not contain some of the many alternatives to a gas tax increase, all of which would free up money for increased road construction and maintenance without increasing taxes.\ Without inclusion of some of these alternatives in the final legislation, the governor may once again find himself on the losing end of a controversial issue.\ As with any political issue in an election year, we must evaluate the gas-tax proposal in the context of public opinion. No nonpartisan entity has taken a poll since the winter storms on how Pennsylvanians feel about a gas-tax increase. Results from a Commonwealth Foundation poll taken in September of last year, however, suggest that Pennsylvanians are deeply suspicious of an increase, even though they believe that our state's roads are not in good condition.\ The poll found that while 73.8 percent of Pennsylvanians believe the roads are in only fair or poor condition and 58.8 percent believe the state needs to increase spending on state roads, 61.2 percent were opposed to a 5-cent gas-tax increase even if it were dedicated solely for maintenance and construction. The percent opposed jumps to 75.4 percent if another 5-cent increase is tacked on - as many in Harrisburg are currently suggesting - to cover operating deficits in public mass-transit systems in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia.\ The poll did not inform the respondents of one crucial fact: a 5-cent increase would give Pennsylvania combined liquid fuel taxes of 27.35 cents per gallon, the third highest of any state in the country. This information would probably have the respondents less, not more, likely to support the proposed increase.\ Nevertheless, it is clear that our roads need fixing, both in the short and the long term. If tax increases remain questionable to many, what can the state do?\ The first alternative it can adopt is authorizing private toll roads for new construction.\ Under this alternative, private companies raise the capital and hire the labor to build a road that is on the state's project list. In exchange, the private company receives a long-term contract to operate and maintain the roads and collect tolls to cover its costs and make a profit. This permits a cash-strapped state like Pennsylvania to continue road construction in times of lean budgets like today.\ In both Virginia and California, road projects were completed on time and on budget. Motorists are now enjoying quick, efficient travel rather than wasting time in traffic jams. The Commonwealth Foundation survey suggests that Pennsylvania would be receptive to this idea: When given the option of increasing toll roads or raising the gas tax, survey respondents supported the toll roads option by a 47 percent to 34 percent margin.\ This approach also helps increase funding for maintenance over time because revenue currently allocated in future years to construction can be redirected to maintenance when private firms build those new roads.\ Privatization can also be employed in the area of highway maintenance. Gov. William Weld of Massachusetts faced a large budget deficit when he was elected in 1990, as well as insufficient funds to maintain that state's roadways. He solved both problems through privatization.\ Indeed, his privatization of road maintenance in certain maintenance districts produced astounding results. Under a pilot program covering 40 percent of the state's roadways, statewide maintenance costs were reduced 32 percent between 1992 and 1994, from $50.1 million to $34 million annually. At the same time, road maintenance services (mowing, pothole repair, street sweeping, etc.) were dramatically improved. Why can't this be done in Pennsylvania?\ Another way to get more roadwork done with the same revenue base is to repeal the state's prevailing-wage provision as it applies to state highway construction. Prevailing wage requires that the state pay workers the ""prevailing wage,"" which is usually the higher union wage for all state-financed projects.\ A Commonwealth Foundation study found that this law adds about 10 percent to the cost of state-financed projects because it inflates the price of labor by 30 percent. Six states with prevailing wage legislation already exempt highway projects. Why not Pennsylvania?\ If taxes must be raised primarily to repair the winter storm damage, a temporary tax is the best option. Again, there is a precedent. When Northern California suffered its worst earthquake in 83 years in 1989, hundreds of millions of additional dollars were needed to fix the damaged and twisted roads and bridges and to bring them up to current earthquake-safe standards. California imposed a temporary -cent increase in the sales tax, statewide, to pay for this.\ By its own terms, this tax increase expired after the necessary funds were collected, which was about 13 months. Again, why not take this route to solve our temporary problem?\ Pennsylvania is now, no pun intended, at a crossroads. We must find a way to increase the funds available for road maintenance and construction, both in the short and long term. But in the current political environment, a simple tax increase will be very difficult to pass and to sell. Gov. Ridge should look very carefully at the many workable alternatives he has available if he wants to avoid a difficult and risky political fight."
473,"
New York Times NEVADA, Iowa -- President Bush began an intensive effort Thursday to sell his plan for developing new sources of energy to Congress and the American people.
\
He argued that the country had a future of ""energy abundance"" if it could break free of the traditional antagonism between energy producers and environmental advocates.
\
Bush's plea for a new dialogue came as his administration published the report of an energy task force, containing scores of specific proposals -- many of which he can impose by executive order - - for finding new sources of power and encouraging a range of new energy technologies.
\
But his critics swarmed over the specifics, noting that the plan sets no targets for improved energy efficiency, offered no short- term relief for out-of-control electricity prices in the West, and provided only modest funding for research into clean energy technology.
\
The president appeared at a highly efficient heating and cooling plant near St. Paul, Minn., that burns a variety of fuels, including oil, coal and waste wood, to sound a theme he plans to repeat day after day. The parties in the energy debate have ""yelled at each other enough,"" Bush said. ""Now it's time to listen to each other.
\
""Too often Americans are asked to take sides between energy production and environmental protection,"" Bush added, before flying here, to a farming town north of Des Moines, to continue his argument at a small plant that makes power by burning biomass, which is derived from animal waste and plants. ""As if people who revere the Alaskan wilderness do not also care about America's energy future; as if the people who produce America's energy do not care about the planet their children will inherit.""
\
Bush appeared to be weaving a careful political line, arguing that if America fails to act now, ""this great country could face a darker future, a future that is, unfortunately, being previewed in rising prices at the gas pump and rolling blackouts in the great state of California.""
\
Bush also asserted that rising energy prices have put an intolerable burden on families and farmers. But some of the statistics in his own report seemed to undercut that claim -- one chart showing the share of disposable household income spent on energy has declined from 8 percent during the early days of the Reagan administration to less than 5 percent today. (That percentage has begun to rise again, but only to levels of the mid-1990s, before a sharp drop in energy prices.)
\
Bush talked not only of blackouts but of blackmail, raising the specter of a future in which the United States is increasingly vulnerable to foreign oil suppliers. He argued, for example, that the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve, which he wants to open to drilling, can produce 600,000 barrels of oil a day for the next 47 years. ""That happens to be exactly the amount the United States now imports from Iraq,"" he said.
\
Opening the Alaskan refuge to drilling is just one source of contention with Democrats and some moderate Republicans, many of whom argue that the Bush administration has put undue emphasis on increasing supplies of fossil fuels at the expense of the environment.
\
Critics say that although the report seems designed to suggest a balanced approach, it minimizes the potential role of alternative sources of energy and the possibility of reducing future demand through efficiency and conservation.
\
""America must embrace the promise offered by new technologies,"" said Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn. ""The energy crisis is not an excuse for creating an environmental crisis.""
\
Republican offered far more support for the president. Sen. Frank H. Murkowski of Alaska, who chairs the Senate Energy Committee, said he plans to hold hearings next week to begin considering the 25 recommendations in the Bush report that require legislative action.
\
""Not everyone is going to like this plan,"" Murkowski said, ""but at least now we have a plan to kick around."" He said the previous administration failed to grapple with the nation's energy sources through a comprehensive plan, though Clinton administration officials dispute that assertion and blame Congress for failing to enact energy legislation.
\
Yet even Murkowski sounded a note of caution about Bush's approach. He said that the report offers few immediate remedies for California's electricity crisis or rising gasoline prices. He said Republicans might have to consider a rollback of the gas tax or temporarily suspending some environmental provisions to address supply bottlenecks.
\
Bush was praised by many groups for laying out a long-term energy policy, something that none of his recent predecessors, including his father, did in more than a piecemeal basis during their terms in office. His report contained 105 initiatives, although many endorse action already in place. And in his public comments he always started with talk of conservation -- though the report itself is much more specific when it comes to tapping new supplies.
\
""No matter how much we conserve, we're still going to need more energy. The state of California is the second best state at conservation -- and yet they are still running out of energy,"" he said here Thursday afternoon. ""I can't think of a better way to improve the security of America than to replace barrels of oil -- some of which come from countries that can't stand us -- with products made in America.""
\
Among those who took a different view was former President Jimmy Carter, who, in an op-ed article in The Washington Post on Thursday morning, wrote that the United States does not confront an energy crisis comparable with those of 1973 and 1979. ""World supplies are adequate and reasonably stable, price fluctuations are cyclical, reserves are plentiful,"" he argued. Carter said ""exaggerated claims seem designed to promote some long-frustrated ambitions of the oil industry at the expense of environmental quality.""
\
Some chapters of the energy plan resemble the annual reports issued by energy companies, with color photos of bears living happily in the wilderness, forests that can absorb carbon dioxide, and fly- fishermen wading in pristine water, practicing the favorite sport of the report's main author, Vice President Dick Cheney.
\
While the report clinically assessed all the available sources of energy and promised to encourage development of those that do the least environmental damage, it fell short of describing a moon-shot approach to efficiency and renewable energy that was an ambition of the Carter years.
\
Federal spending on research and development of wind, solar, geothermal and biomass energy sources, as well as energy efficiency technology, has never equaled the $3 billion spent in 1980, Carter's final year in office, even after adjustments for inflation.
\
If the Bush plan were implemented in full, it would potentially double what the administration had planned to spend over 10 years for renewable energy research and for tax incentives for people and companies that purchase energy-efficient products, like hybrid cars.
\
But the estimated $10 billion commitment over that period is below what the Clinton administration had projected spending for roughly the same period, and well below what energy experts say would be required to make some cutting-edge energy technologies commonplace.
\
""Americans spend $600 billion a year on energy,"" said John Holdren, an energy and environmental policy expert at Harvard who helped draft a Clinton administration study of clean energy sources. ""The Bush people are proposing to change habits by incentives that amount to about one-tenth of 1 percent of that amount each year. It's not very significant.""
\
Though the report is devoted more to the environment, conservation and renewable energy than traditional energy sources, the impact of what the administration intends to do to increase traditional energy supplies greatly outweighs what it aspires to do to diminish demand.
\
The report notes that efficiency in homes and offices could help reduce the need for new power plants, which it says must total at least 1,300 by 2020. But it adopts no goal for such improvements.
\
Likewise with auto efficiency standards, the report reviews how Corporate Average Fuel Economy mandates improved the performance of combustion engines in the 1980s. But it puts off any decision on whether to raise CAFE standards now, saying the administration will wait for a study to be completed.
\
The report is far less tentative in the area of regulatory reforms that it identifies as hindering the oil, gas, nuclear and utility industries.

474,"
The debate over imposing a natural-gas tax is swiftly spiraling into a standoff that threatens to doom the effort this year.
\
Gov. Rendell this week asked each of the four legislative caucuses to send him its best offer for setting a tax rate for the extraction of natural gas from the Marcellus Shale.
\
On Wednesday, Republicans who control the Senate sent him their response: a letter reiterating a position that the governor has called unacceptable.
\
The letter also states that the House should return to the Capitol before the Nov. 2 election to be the first to take action on any negotiated compromise.
\
If not, ""Marcellus Shale cannot be resolved this year,"" according to the letter, with some of the strongest wording yet, signed by Senate President Joe Scarnati (R., Jefferson); Senate Majority Leader Dominic Pileggi (R., Delaware); and Senate Appropriations Chairman Jake Corman (R., Centre).
\
Democrats who control the House reiterated that they would return to Harrisburg only if a deal had been brokered - a possibility that dims with each passing day. There were no talks Wednesday, and none yet scheduled for Thursday.
\
""The Senate Republicans have failed at every turn to act responsibly on this issue,"" said Brett Marcy, spokesman for House Majority Leader Todd Eachus (D., Luzerne).
\
Marcy said the House had already passed two shale tax bills with bipartisan support, and could not negotiate on a third piece of legislation without Senate cooperation.
\
""They continue to make excuses and punt the issue back to the House,"" Marcy said.
\
House Republican leaders said they would send Rendell their proposal for a shale tax Thursday.
\
In their letter to Rendell, the three Senate Republican leaders reiterated their caucus' position that they would support a 1.5 percent tax on the market value of gas from wells producing more than 150,000 cubic feet of gas. That rate would apply for the first five years of production, at which point the tax would increase to 5 percent.
\
Rendell has said he cannot sign such a proposal into law.
\
And late Wednesday, Rendell spokesman Gary Tuma said there was very little in the Senate GOP letter indicating that Republicans were willing to negotiate.
\
Said Rendell in a statement: ""I am extremely disappointed in the Senate and House Republicans for failing to provide any reasonable compromise on a severance tax rate. Not only have they broken their promise to the people of the commonwealth, they have left the local governments in serious financial trouble and have robbed the state of resources necessary to protect our environment.""
\
Rendell originally proposed a 5 percent tax on sales of the extracted gas, and an additional 4.7 cents for every 1,000 cubic feet produced.
\
During recent negotiations, however, he offered to phase in a levy on gas extracted from the rich shale formation, which lies beneath most of the state, starting at 3 percent next year and topping out at 5 percent.
\
The bill the House approved last month calls for a much heftier rate: a levy of a minimum of 39 cents per 1,000 cubic feet (or about 10 percent) of natural gas produced.

475,"
House Minority Leader William DeWeese was on a roll: eyes twinkling, hands flailing, alliteration flowing. Drawing guffaws with every third line.
\
``Ronald Reagan,'' the Democrat shouted from the podium at bemused Republican lawmakers who were about to pass a gas-tax increase, ``would be ashamed!''
\
But as DeWeese exhorted the House chamber audience to defeat the tax bill minutes before Wednesday's vote, Democratic Rep. Thaddeus Kirkland of Delaware County was elsewhere in the building - the governor's office.
\
Kirkland had already secured a promise in writing from Transportation Secretary Bradley Mallory that Route 291 through his Chester district would be widened if Kirkland voted for the gas-tax and registration-fee increase. Now the lawmaker wanted assurance that if Mallory departed, Gov. Ridge would keep the commitment.
\
He got it.
\
``The governor looked me in the eye and said, `Representative, I promise you that this highway will be built if you vote for this bill,' '' Kirkland said yesterday.
\
Kirkland was among 27 House Democrats who supported Ridge's 3.5-cent-a-gallon tax-increase proposal, which would raise $404 million more per year for roads and bridges. In so doing, they defied their leaders, not only DeWeese and Rep. Dwight Evans of Philadelphia, but Philadelphia Sen. Vincent Fumo, a gas-tax opponent who was unable to prevail on a group of House members who often heed his wishes.
\
In that environment, with each vote precious, the Democratic supporters arguably were able to affect the course of the legislation out of proportion to their numbers. Some, like Kirkland, won individual road projects.
\
But the biggest illustration of that phenomenon came from urban Democrats, particularly Philadelphians, who secured $150 million for mass transit from a suburban-dominated Republican legislature and a governor who initially proposed no mass-transit money at all. Struggling SEPTA will get $92.6 million.
\
``We were more concerned about Democrats - absolutely,'' said Mallory, who had trolled high and low for votes over the past several months. ``We were confident that we would have sufficient Republican votes.''
\
That didn't seem to be the thinking in March 1996, when Gov. Ridge first proposed a gas-tax increase in a joint speech to the Legislature. Ridge called for a 6.5-cent gas-tax boost to fix the roads - but didn't mention mass transit.
\
``We were looking at our highways and their maintenance needs,'' said Dennis Walsh, the governor's chief legislative liaison. ``We weren't looking at mass transit. That issue was driven by the Legislature.''
\
In getting to that point, Mallory, a longtime PennDot manager, had spent his first year in office compiling reams of information about the sorry state of Pennsylvania's roads and examining how little the state spends on them compared with other parts of the country.
\
The Department of Transportation chief also took a hard look at PennDot's 12-year plan, which had become a bloated wish list filled with items the state couldn't afford. Mallory shocked local officials by postponing several projects, including the reconstruction of dangerous Route 309 in Montgomery County.
\
So by the time Ridge made his speech last March, few doubted the need for additional spending on the state's roads.
\
But Republican leaders had little stomach for a tax increase before the election. And urban Democrats were flabbergasted at the absence of money for their struggling transit agencies, which had been hit hard by federal cuts.
\
``I can't imagine any Philadelphia Democrat or Republican voting for this,'' Rep. Anthony Williams (D., Philadelphia) said at the time.
\
Ridge and Mallory tried again after the election. By then it was clear to the administration that it had to offer something for mass transit, and $75 million was floated.
\
Not enough, transit officials said. And without their supporters, the votes weren't there.
\
``That was the low point,'' said Mallory, who many said had staked his tenure on achieving a gas-tax increase.
\
From Ridge's perspective, his aides said, there were several reasons to be concerned about boosting transit subsidies in the roads package. For one, the gas tax legally may only pay for roads and bridges, so transit money must come at the expense of something else in the budget. Second, Ridge had grave doubts about the ability of SEPTA and other agencies to spend the money efficiently.
\
In January, after consulting with leading lawmakers, including House Transportation Chairman Richard Geist, Mallory decided to take another shot.
\
Geist told the secretary what he, Geist, had been saying all along: There would be no roads bill without mass-transit support.
\
Mallory began meeting with transit interests, including Mayor Rendell and SEPTA's new chief, Jack Leary. They told him transit needed $150 million to come aboard.
\
Ridge reluctantly agreed to the number. A plan to require performance audits of transit agencies helped convince him, Mallory said, as did his confidence in the new SEPTA management.
\
Now they had to find the votes. But that would take place behind the scenes, without public exhortations from Ridge.
\
``It was going to be the Ridge tax increase, no question,'' one aide said. ``But there was no reason we had to remind people every week.''
\
Gas-tax increases in recent history have passed with at least tacit support of leaders from both parties. But DeWeese and Evans were feuding with the Republicans over unrelated matters. They made it clear they would actively oppose the plan.
\
That didn't trouble House Majority Leader John Perzel of Philadelphia. He had already forged relationships with Democrats on recent tough votes, such as worker's-compensation reform. He set out to ``cherry-pick'' Democratic lawmakers.
\
``We simply said, `We're going to deal with all of them,' '' Mallory said.
\
With SEPTA standing to gain so much, Rendell began canvassing Philadelphia lawmakers, who also heard from City Council President John Street, Democratic Chairman Robert Brady, and the powerful S.R. Wodjack lobbying firm.
\
On April 15, tax day, they counted exactly enough: 102 votes, Mallory and others said. But they wanted a margin of error, and waited one more day.
\
Fumo, who was on vacation in Disney World during the vote, called House Democrats urging a ``no'' vote, acknowledged his spokesman, Gary Tuma.
\
To Rep. Marie Lederer (R. Philadelphia) - who said she was assured of improvements to the Market-Frankford El and Interstate 95 in her district - it wasn't much of a choice.
\
``I couldn't possibly vote against it,'' she said.

476,"If his opponent's call for an extraction tax on natural gas in Pennsylvania is putting any pressure on Republican Gov. Tom Corbett, he wasn't showing it Wednesday.\Appearing at Lehigh Country Club for a taping of the locally aired ""Business Matters"" TV talk show, Corbett said he continues to oppose placing a severance tax on natural gas drillers because it will keep the state competitive with other natural gas-producing states such as Texas.\""You want to grow this industry; this is a very small industry still, although it has grown quite a bit,"" Corbett said. ""The valuable asset besides natural gas is something to get to the natural gas. That is the drill rig and they are very, very limited.""\If Pennsylvania's drilling environment becomes less favorable, some of those rigs may leave, slowing growth in the natural gas and related industries, he said.\Corbett said drillers and related industries have paid $2 billion in other taxes to the state since 2008 and that holding the line on a severance tax will help grow the business.\""I believe God gave us an opportunity to make up for maybe the past for environmental violations we had from industries year ago, but also to develop industry here in Pennsylvania, not just in the natural gas industry but in manufacturing,"" Corbett said.\After the event, the governor said he will oppose any effort to include such a tax in the state's upcoming budget -- even to close a revenue gap estimated at $569 million by June 30, the end of the state's fiscal year.\""I can't imagine there is anything that could be presented to me that would cause me to change that, when we know that we are on the right track,"" Corbett said.\His poll numbers in the doldrums, Corbett is gearing up for a general election fight against Tom Wolf, who handily won the Democratic primary last week. Wolf has proposed a 5 percent severance tax on natural gas extraction to help fund education, infrastructure and environmental protection.\""Republicans and Democrats alike support a reasonable extraction tax along with a majority of Pennsylvanians,"" said Wolf spokesman Jeff Sheridan. ""The revenue generated from an extraction tax will help fund top priorities, and Gov. Corbett continues to demonstrate how out of touch he is by refusing to make oil and gas companies pay up.""\Interviewed before an audience of Greater Lehigh Valley Chamber of Commerce members at the club in Lower Macungie Township, Corbett faced a very friendly crowd.\Attorney Michael J. Perrucci, who introduced Corbett, said the governor's policies, including his support for Allentown's downtown Neighborhood Improvement Zone and the City Revitalization and Improvement Zone in Bethlehem, have helped boost the region's economy.\Both allow developers to tap tenants' state taxes to fund construction and redevelopment.\""I don't think any other governor has made as significant an impact in the Lehigh Valley in less than four years than Gov. Corbett,"" Perrucci said.\Corbett's ability to keep taxes low and fund improvements to transportation have been a big help to business, Perucci said.\It was a sentiment echoed by a variety of other attendees at the taping, who said they appreciated Corbett's ability to maintain a business-friendly economic climate in the state.\""We had plenty of choices for where we were going to go,"" said Eric Schwartz, CEO of Windkits, an Upper Macungie Township company that moved to the Lehigh Valley in 2010 from New Jersey.\Heading into November, Corbett's business community support is probably fairly secure, he said.\""A known 'known' is better than a known 'unknown,' "" Schwartz said.\On another front, Corbett answered questions about his decision not to fight a federal court ruling that overturned the state's ban on same-sex marriage. The governor said he agonized over the decision, waking up at 4:30 in the morning the day after the ruling was issued to read and re-read the opinion.\In the end, Corbett said, he decided it was an expensive legal battle he simply couldn't win.\""I did not see any chance for us to prevail,"" Corbett said. ""We would have been required to make some arguments ... I could not have my lawyers making because of the sensitivity of issues that were in there.""\After the event, ""Business Matters"" host Tony Iannelli, president and CEO of the Greater Lehigh Valley Chamber of Commerce, said Corbett's conservative tax and budget policies give him a decided edge with business leaders. But he and others at the event admitted the governor may have a steep climb to re-election.\The electorate isn't made up of business leaders.\""It's going to be a very tough race,"" Iannelli said. ""Tom Wolf is a very formidable opponent.""\The full interview will air at 7 p.m. Monday on WFMZ-TV, Channel 69.\scott.kraus@mcall.com\Twitter @skraus\610-820-6745\Credit: By Scott Kraus Of The Morning Call\Credit: By Scott Kraus Of The Morning Call"
477,"
Pennsylvanians should expect to pay more in fuel taxes and other fees to cover rising transportation costs, city officials, local planners, and employer groups told state legislators Friday.
\
But many lawmakers, facing reelection in a recession year, are leery of raising any taxes.
\
""Every citizen wants everything fixed, but nobody wants to pay for it,"" said State Rep. Kathy Manderino (D., Montgomery). ""We are not going to have a vote [in the legislature] this year unless you get people off the 'I'm afraid to make a tax vote' dime they're on.""
\
Looking for ways to bail the state out of a $472 million transportation-funding hole and a long-term $3.5-billion-a-year shortfall, the House Transportation Committee held the hearing at St. Joseph's University. The committee is conducting similar sessions around the state, as a special session of the legislature struggles to solve the transportation-funding crisis.
\
City officials, local planners, and employer groups urged an increase in the gasoline tax as the easiest, fastest way out of the jam.
\
""In the short term, I believe the only way to generate sufficient revenue is through an increase in the gas tax, and I am asking you to play a leadership role in making that happen,"" said Rina Cutler, Philadelphia deputy mayor for transportation and utilities.
\
Pennsylvania's current gas tax of 32.3 cents a gallon (including the oil company franchise tax) is 13th-highest in the nation, according to the American Petroleum Institute. The national average is 29.3 cents.
\
""Raising the gas tax by a nickel would cost the average driver just two dollars per month and raise over $300 million statewide,"" said Barry Seymour, executive director of the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission. ""While it may never seem a popular idea to raise taxes or impose additional fees, particularly in the current economic climate, transportation services must be viewed as a utility that everyone uses, everyone benefits from, and everyone must pay for.""
\
Seymour said $1.5 billion in regional highway projects and $2.3 billion in transit projects had been postponed by the state's transportation-funding crisis.
\
Pennsylvania faces a $472 million shortage in transportation funding for the year that begins July 1, because the federal government rejected the state's application to make Interstate 80 a toll road and use the proceeds for transportation projects around the state.
\
Beyond that immediate loss of anticipated income is a chronic shortage of $3.5 million a year for highways and mass transit, a state transportation report said last month.
\
Gov. Rendell called a special session of the legislature last month to raise enough money to address crumbling highways and bridges and underfunded mass-transit agencies.
\
SEPTA general manager Joseph Casey, whose agency cut $110 million from its capital budget because it did not receive anticipated state funding, said European countries levy much higher gas taxes to pay for transportation projects.
\
""They make it almost a luxury to have an automobile,"" he said.
\
Casey told the lawmakers that SEPTA ridership rose when gas prices jumped in 2008 and that he expected a higher gas tax would produce a similar result.
\
Without the anticipated I-80 toll money from the state, SEPTA has postponed 22 major projects, including its planned electronic-fare system and a makeover of the decrepit City Hall subway station.
\
""That's really a disaster,"" Casey said of the 1920s-era station, SEPTA's busiest. ""That's what our passengers put up with every day.""
\
Groups as diverse as the Pennsylvania Motor Truck Association, the Bicycle Coalition of Greater Philadelphia, and the CEO Council for Growth also supported an increase in the gas tax.
\
State Rep. Richard Geist (R., Blair), the top Republican on the Transportation Committee, said he thought the House would support a gas tax, but he was less confident about support in the Senate.
\
Geist, an engineer, said he feared that lack of funding would lead to bridge collapses around the state.
\
""I'm absolutely terrified that we're going to have a major accident,"" he said.
\
Leaders of the Republican-controlled Senate have said they were in no rush to tackle the transportation-funding issue, especially as the state budget has yet to be passed.
\
The House Transportation Committee chairman, Joseph Markosek (D., Allegheny), said finding the votes for a $3.5 billion increase in transportation spending was ""quite a herculean task, with the economic and political environment we're in now.""
\
Peter Javsicas, executive director of Pennsylvanians for Transportation Solutions, said his protransit group had commissioned a poll that showed 64 percent of respondents would be willing to pay $50 more a year to improve transportation.
\
""Does this send a message to our legislators? I hope so,"" Javsicas said.
\
Manderino told officials of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation that they should dramatize the potential hazards of insufficient funding by closing bridges and forcing motorists to take long detours.
\
""I think the drastic measure we need is the orange barrels going up,"" she said, ""and . . . making citizens miserable.""

478,"
Pennsylvania legislators struggling to gauge public sentiment about a tax on Marcellus Shale natural gas can always turn to opinion polls.
\
As luck would have it, there is a poll to support every position.
\
Gov. Rendell, who has been pressing the legislature to enact a tax on gas production this week, often cites an August survey that found that 78 percent of Pennsylvanians support a gas severance tax, while only 14 percent oppose it.
\
That seems decisive.
\
Except that, in March, a Franklin & Marshall College poll arrived at a different conclusion. The poll, directed by G. Terry Madonna, indicated that only 35 percent of Pennsylvanians favor increasing taxes on natural-gas extraction companies. Nearly half - 49 percent - were opposed.
\
What to make of this?
\
It's all in how the question is asked.
\
Gas-industry supporters say the Rendell-commissioned telephone poll of 504 people, conducted by Republican pollster Frank Luntz and Democratic pollster Jefrey Pollock, was biased and designed to elicit a specific response to support the governor's position.
\
The 123-word question begins by explaining that the Marcellus Shale is a large natural-gas discovery and that ""large multinational gas-drilling companies from other states and other countries are coming here to lease land and extract this gas.""
\
""This discovery holds the promise of significant economic development and the creation of new jobs, but it has also placed new and difficult stresses on local services, harmed water supplies, and destroyed local roads.
\
""In other states, these companies pay a special tax to fund programs that will protect our environment and help local governments handle the increased demand on their services. Would you favor or oppose a special tax on these multinational gas companies for that specific purpose?""
\
Severance-tax opponents say it's no wonder three-quarters of the respondents agreed to tax companies that the question implies are foreign-owned.
\
""This is public-opinion polling malpractice at its worst,"" said Travis Windle, spokesman for the Marcellus Shale Coalition, an industry group.
\
Gary Tuma, Rendell's spokesman, said the poll question ""presents factual and relevant information.""
\
The Franklin & Marshall telephone poll of 964 registered voters in Pennsylvania asked respondents whether they supported or opposed several state tax proposals, including taxing cigars and smokeless tobacco or making I-80 a toll road.
\
Without attempting to describe the Marcellus Shale, the college's pollsters simply asked whether responents supported ""increasing taxes on companies that extract and sell natural gas."" A plurality said no.
\
A similar telephone poll of 600 registered voters in Pennsylvania conducted in July by Harris Interactive on behalf of the American Petroleum Institute found even greater opposition to more taxes on oil and gas, without specifically asking about a severance tax.
\
The Harris poll asked a series of questions about various taxes, including: ""Do you support or oppose increased taxes on America's oil and natural-gas industry?"" About 31 percent supported higher taxes, and 61 percent opposed.
\
Who's to say politicians in Harrisburg even read the polls?
\
The governor has proposed a 6.2 percent severance tax, the House Democrats have proposed a 9.8 percent tax, and the Senate Republicans have called for a 1.5 percent tax.
\
Madonna, director of Franklin & Marshall's Center for Politics and Public Affairs, said that no matter how the poll question is phrased, he does not detect much public upheaval about shale gas.
\
""I think it is not exactly something the residents of the state know much about or are very much concerned about, despite the fact it's a huge policy and political issue in the state,"" he said.

479,"
The governors of New Jersey and New York pledged their support yesterday for a congressional attempt to divert billions of gasoline-tax dollars to fixing roads and train stations instead of reducing the U.S. budget deficit.
\
Speaking at a politically star-studded congressional hearing in Manhattan, Gov. Whitman testified that shifting 4.3 cents out of the 18.3 cents-per-gallon federal gas tax to transportation would be ``a first step'' to improving infrastructure nationwide.
\
She, New York Gov. George Pataki and New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani all answered ``yes'' when asked by Sen. John Warner (R, Va.), whether they would support giving all of the 4.3 cents to transportation instead of continuing to use it to reduce the deficit, as the Clinton administration has done for several years.
\
Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D, N.Y.) said that the gas taxes were shifted into deficit reduction a few years ago ``at a time when it had to be done. But I think that we're past that now.''
\
The comments by Whitman, Pataki and Giuliani would be important if Congress tried to make up for the money by cutting into other federal programs. The 4.3 cents now amounts to about $6 billion a year to help whittle down the deficit. If invested in the existing federal Transportation Trust Fund and allowed to grow, it could add tens of billions of dollars a year for transportation projects on top of the money already there, said Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, (R, N.Y.).
\
The comments came during a field hearing by the Senate Subcommittee on Environment and Public Works, one of several committees weighing provisions this year of a massive, multi-year federal transportation funding package.
\
There is enormous pressure to find additional funding sources for the transportation package - such as the 4.3 cents from gas taxes - to placate competing sides in the looming congressional brawl over the way the trust funds are distributed among the states.
\
At issue is the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, or ISTEA. Pronounced ``Ice Tea,'' the 1991 law combined decades of disparate transportation, environmental and tax laws into a $157 billion, six-year package. ISTEA itself was the product of a brutal congressional fight six years ago. It expires this September, and Congress is wading into battle again to decide whether to extend, replace or scrap it.
\
Last July, a swath of states from Florida to California rebelled against ISTEA's formula that favors Northern and Northeastern states with aging, crowded highway and rail systems. The coalition, calling itself STEP 21, introduced legislation that would shift billions of dollars southward by requiring each state get back 95 percent of its gas taxes. It also would loosen federal rules on how to spend the money.
\
A dozen or so bills have followed, including President Clinton's $175 billion, six-year proposal called NEXTEA, for National Economic Crossroads Transportation Efficiency Act. It would keep the current funding formula largely intact but increase overall funds by about $17 billion, and propose new expenditures for Amtrak and for projects to help welfare recipients get to their new jobs.
\
Yesterday's hearing, the fourth by the committee nationwide, drew unanimous support for ISTEA, as expected for its location in the Northeast. Previous hearings in Idaho and Nevada were dominated by critics demanding a more equitable distribution of funds, said Sen. Max Baucus (D, Mont.)
\
With both sides predicting a political bloodbath over the formula issue, attention is focused on finding more money to placate all sides.
\
But the budget juggling may come at a price. Taking the gas-tax funds away from deficit reduction would leave a hole in the budget and force cuts in other federal programs. Agreement might also hinge on where the new gas-tax infusion went - to highways or mass transit, for example.
\
Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D, N.J.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, who was also present yesterday, said he supported the idea of shifting the 4.3 cents entirely to transportation if a way could be found to keep the budget in balance.

The environment important to all
\
This is a reply to a letter to the York Daily Record editor by Robert B. Smith Sr., president of the Local 1303 and employee of the P.H. Glatfelter Paper Co. of Spring Grove (""Union president supports Glatfelter,"" 5/27).
\
He suggested I ""stop to realize that P.H. Glatfelter Co. employs some 1,200 people who depend on jobs that help county, local and state taxes."" I happily acknowledge that is true.
\
He goes on to say, ""All the employees and their families know and have seen firsthand what Glatfelter does to help the environment. They do care."" I would categorize that as self-serving and ludicrous.
\
Using his logic, his only concern is about the economic welfare of himself and his ""followers."" My concern is about the quality of the environment that he and I share here in York County.
\
Why should the PHG plant be the ""main target"" for pollution of the Codorus? Look at all of the other paper mills in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania that have similar processes.
\
PHG is the only one in the state that has been granted permission to exceed the water temperature standards. Also, for the past half dozen years PHG has been in the top three releasers of toxins (not just pollutants but toxins) into our environment within the state. This is according to the latest data from the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency, not a department) for all industries reporting, not just the paper industry.
\
Regarding Rep. Todd Platts, he is obviously more concerned about the environment than the votes of the 1,200 employees of PHG.
\
I do not acknowledge having followers, but there are many who, like myself, share a concern about what is being done to their, my and your environment, Mr. Smith, by PHG. RICHARD J. CLARK SPRING GROVE Don't lump straight immorality with gays In the recent ""Adultery: Next moral to fall"" syndicated columnist Cal Thomas unfairly compares what are morally weak choices (premarital sex, divorce, adultery) with what basically amounts to an amoral non-choice (homosexuality).
\
Marriage, and the right to disregard, undermine, mock and just generally muck it up, has yet to be guaranteed to all Americans.
\
Until this unequalness ends and marriage finally reflects sexual reality, stop including homosexuals with heterosexuals who violate marriage vows (e.g., Lt. Kelly Flinn, Frank Gifford, Bill Clinton) as proof of how little society regards marriage.
\
Homosexuals are barred from the very social institution that so many married persons treat with such shocking indifference. Consequently, homosexuals themselves should not be subjected to the same condemnation on their local newspaper's op-ed page as are divorcees, philanderers and adulturers.
\
About the only thing for which homosexuals are to blame, may be the infliction of their natural good taste on the general public, but certainly not for contributing to any sort of national moral breakdown as suggested in Cal Thomas' column.

Dillsburg Library growth brings needs
\
Several months ago the Dillsburg Area Public Library employed a new librarian, Mrs. Jean Pelletiere, who resides in Mechanicsburg with her husband, a teacher at the U.S. Army War College.
\
Jean has lived in many parts of the country -California, Wisconsin, New York and Washington, D.C. -and worked in a variety of jobs in these places.
\
When Jean came to the Dillsburg Library, she said she was looking forward to getting to know her new community. It has been a very busy few months learning about the library and its new computer system, but Jean has now settled into her new position.
\
One area that Jean would like to work with is adding more people to the very capable crew of volunteers in the library. With the increased numbers of patrons using the library and the new services, more manpower is needed to help with the regular routines in the library.
\
Jean would like to get to know more people in the area and would especially be interested in talking with any potential volunteers. Feel free to drop in and meet Jean and her staff and to use the ever growing facilities in the Dillsburg Library.

Rep. Steve Stetler showed integrity
\
I read with interest the gas tax issue of Gov. Tom Ridge's and Rep. Steve Stetler's response to the Chamber of Commerce regarding it.
\
Frankly, it took a great deal of courage and determination to stand alone against this gas tax legislation. The ""back stratchin', good ole boy"" politics which permeate throughout our state and nation needs ""a few good men"" like Rep. Stetler to assure some of the ""politically correct parasites"" perform the job for which we all pay. (Wow, wouldn't that be novel?)

Regardless of whether or not we agree with his views, I commend him for the courage of his convictions. I think most of us could learn a valuable lesson from his example, it's called integrity.

Let's play a quick game of Jeopardy, picking economics as our category.

What is a gasoline tax?
\
In increasing numbers, business leaders, economists and even politicians are recommending higher gasoline taxes. During the economic summit here - which some Japanese journalists aptly dubbed ""the big talk show"" - the closest thing to a consensus to emerge from 19 hours of discussion among 329 participants was a call to raise gas taxes. Harold A. Poling, Ford's chairman and chief executive officer, stunned the summit with his call for higher gas taxes.
\
As Paul O'Neill, chairman of the Aluminum Co. of America, put it: ""There should be no doubt that we're ready for it. When the chairman of one of the largest automobile companies in the world says we need a gasoline tax, we need it.""
\
Another unlikely endorsement of higher gas taxes came from Drew Lewis, chairman of Union Pacific Corp., the Bethlehem company that claims to be the largest consumer of fuel in the world after the United States Navy.
\
""We burn about 600 million gallons a year between the railroad and our trucking company, so we will be paying more tax than anybody else in the country,"" Lewis told President-elect Clinton during the summit. ""We still think you should impose a tax.""
\
Clinton has been cool to gas-tax increases, telling reporters at the summit's conclusion that he was concerned it would impose an unfair burden on the poor and middle class.
\
Many of Clinton's economic advisers, including his designated budget director, Leon E. Panetta, and deputy director, Alice Rivlin, favor gas-tax hikes to close the budget deficit.
\
And a long-expected report released Monday by the National Commission on the Environment, a panel that includes many key transition aides, recommended a $1-per-gallon increase in the gas tax, phased in over five years - double what Dallas billionaire Ross Perot proposed in his maverick presidential bid.
\
Americans enjoy the lowest gasoline taxes in the industrialized world. At $1.13, the average price of a gallon of unleaded gas is less than half the price paid by consumers in Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, France and Italy.
\
In large part, this is because of the nation's low tax on gasoline. The federal tax on a gallon of gas, now 14 cents, has been raised just twice in the last 37 years. (States also impose taxes, bringing the total tax on a gallon of gas to about 35 cents.) Adjusted for inflation, gas prices have actually fallen by more than 60 percent since 1991.
\
As a result, Americans have little incentive to conserve fuel.
\
Fred C. Allvine, an economist at the Georgia Institute of Technology School of Management in Atlanta, says that U.S. car-makers started developing more efficient vehicles after the oil shock of the late 1970s.
\
But the efforts stalled as gas prices tumbled again. The result: The
\
average U.S. car sold today is bigger and uses more gas than one sold in 1988.
\
""People, being human, would naturally prefer to drive bigger, faster, less fuel-efficient cars unless they have an incentive not to,"" said Allvine. ''Three of the last four recessions have been made worse by energy crises, and yet we still do not have a policy that encourages Americans to drive more fuel-efficient vehicles.""
\
The primary objection to higher gasoline taxes is that they, like other consumption taxes, place disproportionate burdens on the poor. There also are huge geographic differences in the effect of the gas tax.
\
Robert S. McIntyre, director of Citizens for Tax Justice, a nonprofit organization in Washington, says he's not surprised that the gas tax had almost universal support from the participants at Clinton's economic summit.
\
""This is the sort of thing that is popular among people who are rich or who live in big cities like New York or Washington. You get away from the cities, and there is a different attitude,"" McIntyre said.
\
For example, consider the effect of a 50-cent-per-gallon gas hike on a family of four living in North Dakota with a household income under $12,700. A computer analysis prepared by McIntyre's group found the cost would amount to about 6.3 percent of that family's income.
\
But a family living in Washington, with an income of $82,000, would face a tax increase of only 0.5 percent as a result of a 50-cent gasoline tax.
\
(For the average resident of Pennsylvania or New Jersey, the effect would be between $572 and $679 annually, or about 1 percent of average household income in those states.)
\
Clinton, in an interview Friday in the Wall Street Journal, said he would consider even a 15-cent increase excessive unless it were phased in over a few years.

483,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi opposes lifting the moratorium on drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and on the Outer Continental Shelf. She won't even allow it to come to a vote. With $4 gas having massively shifted public opinion in favor of domestic production, she wants to protect her Democratic members from having to cast an anti-drilling election-year vote. Moreover, given the public mood, she might even lose. This cannot be permitted. Why? Because as she explained to Politico: ""I'm trying to save the planet; I'm trying to save the planet.""\A lovely sentiment. But has Ms. Pelosi actually thought through the moratorium's actual effects on the planet?\Consider: 25 years ago, nearly 60 percent of U.S. petroleum was produced domestically. Today it's 25 percent. From its peak in 1970, U.S. production has declined 47 percent. The world consumes 86 million barrels a day; the United States, roughly 20 million. We need the stuff to run our cars and planes and economy.\Where does it come from? Places like Nigeria where chronic corruption, environmental neglect and resulting unrest lead to pipeline explosions, oil spills and illegal siphoning by the poverty-stricken population -- which leads to more spills and explosions. Just this week, two Royal Dutch Shell pipelines had to be shut down because bombings by local militants were causing leaks into the ground.\Compare the Niger Delta to the Gulf of Mexico, where deep-sea U.S. oil rigs withstood Hurricanes Katrina and Rita without a single undersea well suffering a significant spill.\The United States has the highest technology to ensure the safest drilling. Today, directional drilling -- essentially drilling down, then sideways -- allows access to oil that in 1970 would have required a surface footprint more than three times as large. Additionally, the United States has one of the most extensive and least corrupt regulatory systems on the planet.\Does Ms. Pelosi imagine that with so much of America declared off-limits, the planet is less injured as drilling shifts to Kazakhstan and Venezuela and Equatorial Guinea? That Russia will be more environmentally scrupulous than we in drilling in its Arctic?\The net environmental effect of Ms. Pelosi's no-drilling willfulness is negative. Outsourcing U.S. oil production does nothing to lessen worldwide environmental despoliation. It simply exports it to more corrupt, less efficient, more unstable parts of the world -- thereby increasing net planetary damage.\Democrats want no oil from the American OCS or ANWR. But of course they do want more oil. From OPEC. From where Americans don't vote. From places Democratic legislators can't see.\On May 13, Sen. Chuck Schumer -- deeply committed to saving just those pieces of the planet that might have huge reserves of American oil -- demanded that the Saudis increase production by a million barrels a day. It doesn't occur to him that by eschewing the slightest disturbance of the mating habits of the Arctic caribou, he is calling for the further exploitation of the pristine deserts of Arabia. In the name of the planet, mind you.\The other panacea, yesterday's rage, is biofuels: We can't drill our way out of the crisis, it seems, but we can greenly grow our way out. By now, however, it is blindingly obvious even to Democrats that biofuels are a devastating force for environmental degradation. It has led to the rape of ""lungs of the world"" rainforests in Indonesia and Brazil as huge tracts have been destroyed to make room for palm oil and sugar plantations.\Here in the United States, one of every three ears of corn is stuffed into a gas tank (by way of ethanol), causing not just food shortages abroad and high prices at home, but intensive increases in farming with all of the attendant environmental problems (soil erosion, insecticide pollution, water consumption, etc.).\This to prevent drilling on an area in the Arctic one-sixth the size of Dulles Airport that leaves untouched a refuge one-third the size of Britain.\There are a dizzying number of economic and national security arguments for drilling at home: a $700 billion oil balance-of-payment deficit, a gas tax (equivalent) levied on the paychecks of American workers and poured into the treasuries of enemy and terror-supporting regimes, growing dependence on unstable states of the Persian Gulf and Caspian basin. Ms. Pelosi and the Democrats stand athwart shouting: We don't care. We come to save the planet!\They seem blissfully unaware that the argument for their drill-there-not-here policy collapses on its own environmental terms."
484,"WASHINGTON (AP) - The Senate took a big step toward passage of a multiyear highway spending bill as key lawmakers agreed to ensure that all federal gas tax revenues go toward highway and infrastructure improvements.\""We have reached an agreement today that will guarantee that over the next six years that every penny collected in the 4.3 cents-per-gallon tax on gasoline will go to build roads and only roads,"" Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said Monday.\Gramm, joined by Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., in pushing the gas tax issue, said it will allow the Senate to increase by $26 billion to $173 billion the amount allotted for highway spending over the next six years. That would increase highway spending 45 percent over the last six-year highway bill, which expired last fall, he said. A temporary, interim highway bill expires May 1.\The extra funds would boost Pennsylvania's six-year allocation by about $600 million above the $5 billion the state would have received under the original Senate bill, according to aides to Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.\The new total works out to $936,000 per year, which is less than the $1.2 billion envisioned in the version championed by House Transportation Chairman Bud Shuster, R-Pa. Still, it would represent an increase over the $747,000 the state got under the law that expired last fall.\Aides cautioned the figures could change slightly today, when the Senate committee is to approve the language.\The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which is expected to endorse the Gramm-Byrd plan today, agreed last fall to spend $145 billion for the highway bill, a figure arrived at with an eye toward staying under spending caps set in the balanced budget deal reached by President Clinton and Congress. Senate Commerce provided another $2 billion for highway safety projects.\But Congress finished last year's session without acting on the bill, and there has been growing consensus among lawmakers that the amount wasn't enough to deal with the nation's crumbling infrastructure.\Clinton's 1993 budget reduction package set aside 4.3 cents of the 18.3 cents-per-gallon federal gas tax for deficit reduction. Last year, the 4.3 cents was moved to the federal highway trust fund, but was still reserved for non-highway purposes.\Under the agreement reached after several days of meetings in Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott's office, all gas tax money would go for highway and mass transit purposes. The negotiators also agreed that no state should receive less than 91 percent of what they pay into the highway trust fund.\Currently some states, particularly in the South, get back as little as 70 cents for every dollar they pay into the system. More populated states have expressed concern about losing their current share of the trust fund pot, but Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., said Senate leaders agreed to create a pool of extra money for high-density states.\The deal would provide $1.8 billion over six years to be divided among nine states: California, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania.\Credit: AP"
485,"
Last summer, Amanda Smith got on her bike in Portland, Ore., and rode 3,600 miles to Washington, D.C., to demonstrate the benefits of cycling.
\
For most of her journey, Smith shared the road with cars and trucks. In some large cities, she had to abandon her bike altogether.
\
``It seemed like there were hardly any bike trails or bike lanes anywhere,'' said Smith, 20, of Colleyville, Texas, whose trip raised $2,000 for Bike-Aid, an environmental organization.
\
Smith is one of millions of Americans who have fallen in love with the bicycle in recent years. Now, these bike advocates are hoping to turn their passion into billions in new federal aid for biking.
\
Over the next few months, Congress will shape a major highway-spending bill and, in the process, will decide how much to spend on new bike trails, bike lanes and cycling-related facilities over the next six years.
\
About 105 million people own bikes, and four million ride them to work. Biking advocates say that if bike paths and lanes were more common, accessible and interconnected, an additional 17 million people might take their bikes to work.
\
That's not an outrageous estimate, some say, considering that half the nation's labor force lives within a 30-minute bike ride to work.
\
The environmental benefits of that trend would be enormous, they argue. Biking would take pressure off highways and mass-transit systems and offer significant benefits in reducing pollution.
\
Proponents also argue that there are safety and health reasons for the government to expand and improve bike paths and lanes.
\
About 16 percent of all fatalities on American roads are pedestrians and bicyclists.
\
``When people walk out their front door, they should have a choice of whether to take a car, bus, train, or bike to wherever they are going,'' said Beth Kirsch, campaign coordinator for Bikes Belong, a coalition in Washington of several major cycling organizations.
\
``Right now, there are too many people out there that don't have choices.''
\
But the car has deep roots in America's culture and economy, and bike advocates face a challenge in their efforts to divert more federal money to improving bike transportation.
\
Opponents say the federal government should not spend money on bike paths and other recreational amenities when the nation's highway system badly needs repairs. Moreover, they object to spending dollars from the highway bill on bike paths, because the money comes from the federal gas tax.
\
``We are not against bike trails. We just think they should be funded in a different manner,'' said Cheryl Uram, a spokeswoman for the American Highway Users Alliance, a group supported mainly by industries involved in highway construction.
\
``The money . . . is being collected under the pretense that it will go to improve the roads and bridges. We are losing over 42,000 lives a year on our roads because their condition is poor,'' said Uram.
\
``A bike trail is a nice thing to have, but when you're losing lives, we need to send this money to where it is needed most.''
\
The law that controls how all that transportation money is spent is called the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, a 1991 statute with a name so long and cumbersome it frequently is referred to as ISTEA, or ``Ice Tea.''
\
Congress is in the process of reauthorizing ISTEA. The law expired Sept. 30, the end of fiscal 1997.
\
The House has voted to extend the old law six months, giving the House and Senate time to work out their differences. The Senate still is drafting a new ISTEA and has yet to draw up an extension.
\
ISTEA directs how about $30 billion in federal funds will be spent annually. Nearly all of it comes from the federal tax of 18.3 cents that Americans pay on every gallon of gasoline.
\
While 4.3 cents goes toward reducing the deficit, the remaining 14 cents goes to transportation investments.
\
It used to be that every nickel collected went solely for highways. But when ISTEA was authorized in 1991, it allowed, for the first time, spending on projects that boosted or enhanced other modes of transportation. About $450 million a year since 1991 has been spent on ``transportation enhancements,'' including such matters as limiting rainwater erosion, acquiring historic sites related to highways, or removing billboards.
\
Also among those ``other modes'' is bicycling. Since 1991, the government has spent about $1 billion for bike paths, on- and off-road cycling, bike lanes on streets and roadways, and facilities for cyclists, such as bike stands.
\
Biking advocates across the nation have far more ambitious plans.
\
``We cannot just continue building roads,'' said Glenn Gadbois, executive director of the Texas Bicycle Coalition.
\
``For a small investment, we can create a diverse system for transportation in Texas that provides a solution to problems with pollution and congestion. I think it's clear that just pouring concrete is not going to address either one of those issues.''
\
Congress seems to agree.
\
Pending House and Senate ISTEA bills call for increased spending on such enhancements. The House Transportation Committee's three-year bill would spend $575 million through 2000. The six-year Senate bill would spend about $550 million through 2000 and $583 million from 2000 to 2003.
\
Rep. Peter A. DeFazio (D., Ore.), a former bike mechanic and avid cyclist, said he would like to see ISTEA help America move toward a system of interstate bike routes, so it would be easier for cyclists such as Smith to travel from city to city.
\
The bicycle industry says the federal government's commitment to trails is helping it grow. Of the 105 million Americans who own bikes, 53 million ride them at least once a week. The industry estimates that ridership is growing at a rate of 2 percent per year. Sales of bikes also have been booming, growing nearly 60 percent since 1985.

486,"
Gov.-elect Tom Corbett vows to get tough with the Marcellus shale gas industry, despite appointing industry lobbyists to his transition team overseeing environmental regulation.
\
""I am a cop,"" Corbett, the state attorney general, told the Tribune-Review last week in his first interview since the election. ""I always believe in fair enforcement of the regulations. Everyone knows I am pretty much a straight arrow. We will enforce the regulations. It's in the best interest of the companies and the environment.""
\
Corbett said he wants ""fair and consistent"" regulation of Marcellus shale gas extraction and that he would try to avoid doing anything that would stunt the growth of the industry at a time when Pennsylvania needs jobs. Corbett opposes additional taxes or fees on the industry, but said he would consider anything the GOP-controlled Legislature proposes.
\
""Right now, I say we're not going to do it,"" Corbett said about a natural gas tax. ""I will look at what the Legislature proposes. I do believe we need to take care of impacts at the local and county level.""
\
Lawmakers agreed during last year's budget negotiations to consider a severance tax on natural gas by Oct. 1, but did not adopt one. Republican legislators and Democratic Gov. Ed Rendell failed to agree on the amount of the proposed increase.
\
Industry insiders and environmentalists said they are eager to work with the incoming administration to set policy for natural gas drilling. Corbett's inauguration is Jan. 18.
\
'Clear direction' sought
\
The administration needs to look closely at regulating the industry and to be consistent in enforcing rules, said Kathryn Klaber, president of the Marcellus Shale Coalition trade group. Drillers are eager to see who Corbett appoints to key posts, such as in the Department of Environmental Protection and the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, she said.
\
""We're not looking for any special favors,"" Klaber said. ""We're looking for that clear direction.""
\
Corbett said he wants state government to help create demand for natural gas. He said he would explore converting the state's fleet of vehicles to using natural gas and whether state prisons, many of which are located near shale wells, could be powered by natural gas.
\
Corbett did not indicate who he will appoint to environmental posts, but he recruited industry lobbyists for his transition team. Tom Paese, co-director of the transition team, lobbies on behalf of The Williams Companies, an Oklahoma-based driller, and five members of Corbett's Energy & Environment Committee represent Marcellus shale gas companies.
\
The transition committees are reporting what existing agencies are doing but are not advising on policy, Corbett said.
\
$835K from gas companies
\
During the campaign, Corbett received $835,000 from gas companies, according to MarcellusMoney.org, a website run by Common Cause Pennsylvania and Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania.
\
""There's nothing nefarious about it,"" said Jack Treadway, former chairman of the political science department at Kutztown State University. ""If you're in the shale industry, who are you going to give the money to -- Corbett, or (his Democratic opponent Dan) Onorato? It's a natural tendency to support those who support your issues.""
\
In his campaign documents, Corbett said he wants to require drillers to provide detailed information about chemicals they use when fracturing shale to release gas. He wants to require more testing and protection of water supplies, to impose more frequent inspections and to increase fines for violators. He plans to create a bipartisan commission to help set policy for the Marcellus shale industry.
\
Commitments to protect water and air sound good, but the key will be how Corbett upholds them, said Nadia Steinzor, regional organizer for Earthworks, a New York-based nonprofit.
\
""The impression we all have is that Corbett is going to pave the way even clearer for the industry,"" Steinzor said.
\
The opposite might be true, said Matt Pitzarella, spokesman for Range Resources, a Fort Worth company with offices in Canonsburg. He expects the next governor to be as tough -- if not tougher -- than his predecessor.
\
""It's not going to get any easier,"" Pitzarella said. ""That's a misconception among the public and also within the industry. I think he's going to regulate us the same way he's approached everything.""
\
Pennsylvania does not have a state-mandated extraction tax on coal or other mineral resources, but it does receive money from a federal fee on coal extraction per ton, said Jamie Legenos, spokeswoman for the state Department of Environmental Protection.
\
Gas tax pressure
\
Corbett's pledge not to seek a gas tax ""poses a clear dilemma for him as his administration gets under way"" with a historic budget crisis looming, said Christopher Borick, a political science professor at Muhlenberg College in Allentown. The state faces a $4 billion deficit in 2011.
\
Public pressure will increase throughout the year for a severance tax on natural gas as the ""pain"" of potential budget cuts hits home with citizens, Borick said.
\
""I think eventually, in some shape, some form, (Corbett) gets resources from Marcellus shale,"" Borick said. ""It'll take some creative packaging, and it may even have industry support.""
\
Asked whether he sees any way that Marcellus shale companies could contribute to reducing the deficit without enacting a tax or fee, Corbett said: ""You are asking me that question way too early.""
\
Tom Baldino, a political science professor at Wilkes University in Wilkes-Barre, believes a gas tax is inevitable.
\
""They may not call it a tax, per se, and it will be very modest by nationwide standards,"" he said.
\
States vary greatly in the rates they levy and how they tax -- depending on whether they tax gas only or byproducts that come with it, and whether they measure the price at the well or destination, a Carnegie Mellon University study found. Rates range from just more than 1 cent per thousand cubic feet (mcf) in California to $2.85 per mcf in Florida.
\
Industry officials will use the fact that they've agreed to pay the tax as the basis to argue for ""very little in terms of new regulation,"" Baldino said. He contends lawmakers will insist on a tax as budget talks unfold. Corbett can ""strike a pose against it,"" but relent under certain circumstances, he predicted.
\
Treadway doesn't dismiss Corbett's promise not to raise taxes.
\
""When gubernatorial candidates make promises in campaigns, they tend to keep them,"" he said.
"
487,"
New Jersey state Sen. Daniel J. Dalton is the one in the middle of the group, the one gazing attentively at Senate President John F. Russo as he explains a bill to close down an industrial pipeline discharging treated effluent into the Atlantic Ocean.
\
Russo's constituents in the audience want the bill. Officials from the state Department of Environmental Protection are leery of it. Diplomatically, yet unmistakably, and in front of everyone, Dalton, a Gloucester County Democrat, tells Russo the bill needs work. A lot of work.
\
Which means that, at least for now, the senate president's environmental bill isn't going anywhere.
\
*
\
No one seems to want to bring it up again, especially after an election in which many politicians promised fiscal austerity. But there is a growing sense in the legislature that money is needed to fix roads, build bridges and finance mass-transportation projects.
\
Still, there is silence - and then Sen. Walter Rand speaks. Actually, the veteran Camden County Democrat, who has handily won re-election in what is, for him, a safe district, does more than speak. He proposes a graduated 6-cent increase in the state gasoline tax.
\
*
\
It is one of those long, late nights in the General Assembly. Lawmakers are arguing heatedly over a bill that would make low-interest loans available to towns and counties in which taxpayers face huge increases in their garbage costs.
\
With all the hubbub and impassioned rhetoric, one Burlington County Republican is quiet. Yet when other legislators have a question about the bill, they turn to him, Assemblyman Robert C. Shinn Jr.
\
*
\
If the legislature were giving out ""Mister"" awards, Dan Dalton, Walter Rand and Bob Shinn would each be getting one.
\
Dan Dalton is Mr. Environment, chairman of the Senate Energy and Environment Committee and a man willing to finesse even the senate president's bill when, in his words, ""At the time, and the way it was drafted, I didn't think it was a good bill.""
\
Walter Rand is Mr. Transportation, chairman of the Senate Transportation Committee and a key player when Gov. Kean wanted to increase the gas tax this winter.
\
Bob Shinn is Mr. Garbage (or Mr. Solid Waste, as some prefer to call him), chairman of the Assembly Solid Waste Management Committee and a man who, by all accounts, keeps a cool head when tempers get hot over escalating garbage rates in North Jersey.
\
These three legislators have attained their unofficial titles by dint of their legislative positions, their interest in their fields and the primacy of their issues - the environment, transportation and garbage - in New Jersey's political life.
\
And the three have done so at a time when South Jersey is achieving, well, if not exact parity with its North Jersey brethren, than at least greater stature than it had before.
\
It has been almost eight years since a majority of voters in six counties agreed in a non-binding referendum that South Jersey should become the 51st state. By many accounts, some things have changed. And perhaps the paramount symbol of that change is Camden's $32 million aquarium, which would be nothing more than a speck in the city's eye had it not been for the state.
\
""I think that, in a way, South Jersey, because of its militancy and defensiveness, probably gets more than it would on the basis of numbers,"" says Alan Rosenthal, director of Rutgers University's Eagleton Institute of Politics.
\
""It's like the old saying, 'The wheel that squeaks the loudest is the one that gets the grease,' "" says Assemblyman Thomas P. Foy (D., Burlington). ''We're squeaking louder and getting more funding and more clout.""
\
Which brings us back to three influential South Jersey lawmakers - Dan Dalton, Walter Rand and Bob Shinn. Or, Mr. Environment, Mr. Transportation and Mr. Garbage.
\
*
\
""Dan Dalton has spilled more of my blood than anyone in the legislature.""
\
So says Hal Bozarth. And because he is executive director of the Chemical Industry Council of New Jersey, he ought to have some idea.
\
Tall, gray-haired and lanky, Dalton is considered the grand doyen of the legislature's environmental leaders. He is the author of New Jersey's chemical-disclosure law, the ""Worker and Community Right to Know Act,"" a bill that Bozarth vigorously opposed.
\
Dalton also helped to pass measures that would protect the state's freshwater wetlands and provide financial incentives for towns to encourage waste recycling. In addition, he was a key figure in legislative efforts to develop a plan to pay for hazardous-waste cleanup.
\
When environmentalists and industry spokesmen speak of Dalton, they use words such as ""pragmatist,"" ""consensus-builder,"" and ""deal-maker."" He is, they say, a thoughtful rather than knee-jerk environmentalist, the kind of guy who doesn't automatically sign on to an idea unless he believes it is solid, doable.
\
Sometimes, that brings Dalton criticism for not pushing his colleagues hard enough or enthusiastically embracing some popular environmental proposals. Other times, though, it works to his advantage as a power broker.
\
""His role is not necessarily to be an advocate,"" says Rob Stuart of the New Jersey Public Interest Research Group. ""You have to be able to make your case.""
\
Dalton's approach to environmental issues may have something to do with the way he became an environmentalist - through political exigency. The constituents in his district had to grapple with the GEMS landfill, which was ranked 10th on the national Superfund's cleanup priority list. So Dalton says he had to grapple with such issues, too.
\
Born in Woodbury and educated at local parochial schools and then at Kings
\
College in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., Dalton tried many things before becoming a lawmaker. He had been a Peace Corps volunteer in Upper Volta, a high school teacher, a graduate student in public administration and a staffer for U.S. Rep. James J. Florio (D., N.J.) when he joined the family insurance business in 1978.
\
Dalton won a seat in the General Assembly the next year and a seat in the Senate two years after that, making a name for himself on environmental issues and also on auto insurance - it was his committee's bill that became the Senate's unsuccessful compromise solution. Dalton is considered Florio's heir apparent if the congressman ever decides to give up his seat.
\
As a boy, Dalton learned politics at the knees of his father, William L. Dalton, a Democratic leader in Gloucester County. Now, at 38, Dalton occasionally stares down other politicians, including senate presidents and governors.
\
Heard the one about the lawmaker who sued Kean over the governor's plans to abolish the Energy Department? That was Dalton. He lost.
\
How about the one about the lawmaker who has tried to keep the governor
\
from replacing his father on the Atlantic City Expressway Authority? That is Dalton, too. He says Kean wants to remove his father because William Dalton has been a consistent critic of patronage and mismanagement on the authority.
\
This year, Kean is seeking passage of a plan designed to prevent ocean pollution, beach closings and a repeat of the events that marred last summer at the Jersey shore. Key lawmakers have agreed to a package of bills that incorporates many of Kean's ideas. Dalton has yet to sign on to the package. Rest assured, he says, that his committee will review it carefully.
\
""The bottom line to the approach outlined by the governor,"" he says, ""is that I have some questions about whether it is ultimately going to be as effective as he would have the public believe.""
\
*
\
About that gas tax.
\
For months last year, Kean pushed for a 5-cent increase, but lawmakers were unwilling to go along. At least part of their reluctance had to do with the coming elections. Few wanted to bring the wrath of the public down upon their heads.
\
Walter Rand didn't seem to mind. Coming from a safe district, he says he was only too happy to speak out on behalf of money for transportation. But in deference to his colleagues, he says, he didn't say too much.
\
""My position was very clear,"" he says. ""I would have come out before the election. I was asked not to by people on both sides. I didn't want to hold a gun to anybody's head.""
\
So the election occurred. Kean started agitating for the gas tax. Two weeks
\
went by. Lawmakers were talking about the gas tax, but no one was making a move. Finally, Rand broke the deadlock, becoming the first prominent Democrat to favor a hike in the gas tax, in particular his proposed graduated 6-cent increase.
\
There was the inevitable debate, the inevitable negotiation. And in January, Kean signed into law a 2 1/2-cent-a-gallon increase in the gas tax, the first gas tax increase since 1975, designed to raise billions of dollars for new roads and mass-transportation improvements and to keep construction workers on the job.
\
It was not what Rand had proposed, but it was something.
\
""In this business, you don't get what you want,"" he says. ""You get what you get and take what you get.""
\
Transportation Commissioner Hazel Gluck has nothing but nice things to say about the Camden County Democrat, even though the two are from different parties. She credits him with helping to make sure that there is a stable source of money through the Transportation Trust Fund for construction of roads and bridges and mass-transportation projects.
\
""If he did nothing else . . . it would still be a lot more than most people do in their careers in the Senate,"" she says.
\
Rand, 68, has spent most of his life in Camden or close to it - say, as close as the University of Pennsylvania, where he graduated with honors. He was a member of the Camden Municipal Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission, assistant secretary and purchasing agent of the Camden City Board of Education, and an elected member of the Board of Education before getting elected to the General Assembly in 1975. He was elected to the Senate six years later.
\
Not long ago, Rand says, he moved from Camden to Bellmawr. ""When people are knocking on your door at 1 or 2 in the morning, it gets a little rough,"" he says. ""My wife wanted to move.""
\
So move the couple did. But local officials still look to Rand as the great uncle of Camden, a man who has helped to bring home money for the aquarium, a new dormitory and science center at Rutgers University's Camden campus, demolition of deteriorating housing stock and various transportation projects.
\
""He's been an excellent senator for Camden,"" says Camden Mayor Randy Primas.
\
Rand first became transportation chairman when he was in the Assembly. He wanted to be chairman of the Education Committee, but the job went to someone else. ""Boy,"" said then-Speaker Christopher J. Jackman, ""have I got a committee for you."" The rest is history.
\
Rand says his next crusade may be a half-cent increase in the gas tax. He is convinced that oil companies are boosting prices by 3 cents, rather than by 2 1/2, and pocketing the difference.
\
""Why should the state of New Jersey lose that half penny?"" he asks.
\
*
\
Quiet and unassuming though he is, Bob Shinn believes he has ""probably aggravated more people than anyone else in office.""
\
That is what it means to be an expert on trash in an age when garbage costs are soaring, landfills are closing and the state is demanding that counties build trash-to-steam plants that many residents oppose.
\
""I've been called everything in the book,"" says Shinn, who is often described as a man who takes the heat with aplomb.
\
Elected to the Assembly in a special election in 1985, Shinn is newer to the legislature than fellow ""Misters"" Dalton and Rand. Yet his expertise in solid-waste problems goes back a long time.
\
Here is a man who can make the case for resource recovery plants (""a good idea that needs to be explained better"") or explain why deregulating garbage haulers immediately would be a bad idea (the state is far behind in conducting background checks, he says).
\
It all started in the late 1960s and early '70s, Shinn recalls, when the Hainesport Township Committee, of which he was a member, helped the township make the transition from trash collection via regular dump truck to trash collection via fancy state-of-the-art garbage truck.
\
""The frustrations of that arena either get you out of the arena or drive you toward it,"" Shinn says. They drove Shinn toward it.
\
As a Burlington County freeholder, he was front and center when residents of Florence and Mansfield Townships unsuccessfully fought the county's plans for a landfill.
\
And as the county's special projects coordinator, a position he now holds, Shinn has been front and center again in the brouhaha over a newly built recycling center in Delran, where residents opposed the site. That fracas pitted him against fellow Assemblyman Foy, who is representing the township.
\
""Bob doesn't lose his cool,"" Foy says, and then, laughing, adds, ""but he's lousy at picking sites.""
\
Though the two men oppose each other on the issue of the recycling center, they have joined together to oppose construction of a hazardous-waste incinerator in Burlington Township, one site now under consideration by the state Hazardous Waste Facilities Siting Commission.
\
Shinn, 50, was born in Mount Holly and attended Drexel University. After serving in the Army, part of that time in Korea, Shinn came home, got a degree in engineering and founded his own company, Material Handling Systems, a building-materials concern now in Hainesport. His first exposure to public life was as a township committeeman in Hainesport, where Shinn also served as mayor. Later, Shinn became a Burlington County freeholder.
\
""He kept very quiet for the whole year,"" recalls fellow Assemblyman Harold L. Colburn Jr. (R., Burlington), who also served as a Burlington County freeholder. ""And then when he started talking, we found out how smart he is.""

488,"
Editor,
\
State Sen. John Yudichak recently praised the state Supreme Court's decision to overturn a part of Act 13 that stripped away local zoning control related to oil and natural gas drilling activities.
\
The senator correctly identified similarities between anthracite coal mining and the current boom in Marcellus shale drilling. He reviewed coal mining's detrimental impacts on the environment and health of the population and how current and future generations will continue to pay a heavy price from this activity. He emphasized how unconventional gas drilling (fracking) will have like consequences in our state. So far, the senator got it right.
\
Here's what he got wrong. The senator proposed stricter regulations on unconventional gas drilling and levying a gas tax to generate more revenue for the state than the current inadequate impact fee charged drillers for gas extraction. On the surface these actions look good. However, the process of unconventional gas drilling, like coal mining, is an assault on health and the environment. Regulations cannot make it safe. Regulations simply allow bureaucrats to choose how much poisoning will be permitted at any given time.
\
Sen. Yudichak understands this and justifies his proposed higher gas tax, explaining that more funds will be available to mitigate the inevitable negative environmental and health impacts in our commonwealth from unconventional gas drilling.
\
Sen. Yudichak is from coal country. He knows the history of coal mining and he knows the same repercussions will occur from unconventional gas and oil drilling. I urge the senator to look beyond the short-term economic benefits of a few more jobs for the locals and a lot more profit for big oil and gas.
\
I urge him to use his position of power to be a leader, securing clean air and water and protecting the health of his own family and the families of his constituents now and for generations to come. This cannot be done by regulating and taxing unconventional gas extraction, but by supporting a moratorium on the approval of any new drilling permits, thus curtailing this hideous practice and preventing the damage before it occurs. Regulations and taxes won't do this.
\
Remember, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.

489,"
WASHINGTON - When I was in Zimbabwe during the beginning of their current fuel crisis a few years ago, a popular joke about President Robert Mugabe's inept policies described a driver, sitting in his car in a long line of other cars waiting at a gas pump.
\
Unable to bear the wait any longer, he fumed, ""I'm going to drive to the presidential mansion and give Mugabe a piece of my mind.""
\
But, alas, the story goes, when he arrived at the mansion, he found that the line of cars there was even longer.
\
A similar nightmare of political backlash must have been swimming around in President Bush's head when he asserted in his State of the Union address that ""America is addicted to oil, which is often imported from unstable parts of the world.""
\
Addicted to oil? Strains of an old Robert Palmer hit wafted through my head: ""Might as well face it, you're addicted to ..."" Oil?
\
It hardly qualified as a new statement, except that we usually hear it from Democrats and environmental activists, not the head of the most oil-friendly administration in American history. If Americans are addicted to oil, the Bush administration has been a major pusher.
\
I don't remember the president admonishing the public for its oil ""addiction"" when he was working at oil companies like Harken or Arbusto, which is Spanish for ""bush."" Vice President Dick Cheney was CEO of Halliburton, a very large oil and gas services company. This is, I remind you, the only administration whose secretary of state once had an oil tanker named after her.
\
By now the president should know, as well as anyone, that Americans are not so much ""addicted"" to oil as dependent on it in the absence of better alternatives. That's simple economics. One becomes a junk food ""junkie"" when better food is either unavailable or unaffordable.
\
You could see this in the way we Americans howled when gasoline hit $3 a gallon, a price ceiling that much of the rest of the developed world broke through decades ago, mostly because of taxes various governments put on fuel consumption. The European consumers' response was to drive more fuel-efficient cars and invest in better mass transit systems. The Japanese auto industry's response was to produce the fuel-efficient hybrids that have proved to be wildly successful with American consumers.
\
What is to be the American response? Were Bush to break with typical political tradition and tell candid truth to the public, he would point out that history shows rising oil prices to be the most effective way to nudge the country out of its oil dependency because this reduces demand. But too much candor about such sensitive matters can be political suicide, especially in an election year.
\
Instead, Bush's oil remarks sounded as if they were inserted into his laundry list of promises in response to opinion polls that show his approval ratings slumped to around 45 percent, and news that Exxon Mobil Corp. had reported what analysts called the highest profit in U.S. history ($10.71 billion for the fourth quarter of 2005 and $36.13 billion for the year). Among other worries these days, the public wants fuel price relief. The public, like that fabled Zimbabwean in the gasoline queue, wants some kind of response from the White House to their own fuel price complaints, and the president was trying to give it to them.
\
But will Bush back up his words with real action? It was not a good sign that he called for more nuclear power and alternative fuels research just as the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Colorado was preparing to lay off researchers working on plant-based fuels, including the non-corn ethanol that Bush praised in his speech.
\
When liberals and environmentalists talk about oil ""addictions,"" they often talk in their next breath about new regulations, federal subsidies or tax breaks for alternative fuels and taxes for ""windfall profits."" But there's probably no way that the fiercely-anti-tax Bush will back up his ""addiction"" rhetoric with taxes or any other serious action to reduce oil demand by raising prices or reducing supplies.
\
New legislation, including a higher federal gas tax and higher vehicle mileage standards, would help to reduce our energy dependence, although it also would require the sort of sacrifices that Bush has been loathe to impose in his war against terrorism.
\
If he's true to his free-market conservative beliefs, Bush probably thinks in his heart of hearts that high fuel prices alone will create new demand for fuel-efficient cars and alternative fuels. He could be right. But, for those seeking relief soon, the free market could use some government help - before the angry drivers start lining up in front of the White House.

490,"
Two congressmen who represent this area say there are enough energy resources within North America to provide the gasoline and oil the country needs without being worried about supply from the Middle East costing more or being cut off.
\
At separate events Thursday, U.S. Rep. Lou Barletta, R-11, and U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., said America has to change its energy policy to rely on domestic oil supplies so the price can be regulated more effectively.
\
""It's a huge problem,"" Toomey said about gas prices as he was questioned at Hazleton Casting Co., which he toured Thursday morning. ""It's a real problem for family budgets. That's why we need to develop domestic energy sources.
\
""We have a tremendous amount of oil in the United States itself and in North America, much of it which we choose not to develop. This is the reason why prices occasionally get very, very high, and the reason we are overly dependent on oil from the most dangerous part of the world, the Middle East.""
\
Toomey said America should also look to Canada for oil.
\
""It is important we go ahead with Keystone Pipeline so we access Canadian oil, which diminishes our dependence on oil more from the most dangerous part of the world, and diminishes interruption in supply,"" he said. ""The more domestic production there is, the less to worry about an interruption in supply, and (we would have) lower prices.""
\
Barletta, speaking at a Greater Hazleton Chamber of Commerce Red Carpet Breakfast, said America has to cut its strings with foreign oil suppliers.
\
""We send $1 billion a day to foreign countries for oil,"" Barletta said. ""We're relying on Brazil and the Middle East, sending American dollars and jobs to countries many (of which) don't like us.
\
""We have all the energy we need right here, which would keep our dollars right here, in the United States,"" Barletta went on. ""Right here in Pennsylvania, we can be a leader not only in the country, but in the world, not only in natural gas, because below the gas there is oil.""
\
Barletta also lauded the Keystone Pipeline.
\
""America needs to be energy independent,"" he said. ""At same time, we are holding up oil from Canada.""
\
He said there is a bill in the House that proposes using royalties on domestic oil to rebuild the country's infrastructure.
\
""Our highways are funded through gas tax,"" Barletta said. ""Everything we're doing is to use less gas - less miles per gallon, electric cars. In a country that needs more money to fix its infrastructure, we're relying on something that brings in less money every year.
\
""So we're going to supplement that from offshore drilling for oil,"" he said. ""We also want to protect the environment. We can do that. We can find that balance. We're going to take those royalties and put them into rebuilding American roads and bridges.""
\
Gary Danish, a past chamber chairman of the board, pointed out that gasoline made in the United States is sold abroad - instead of in this country.
\
Barletta said government regulation sometimes make it more expensive to sell gas here than somewhere else.
\
Danish also told Barletta he believes the reason behind the high gas prices is that ""oil companies are hiding behind speculators. All it is is greed.""
\
Barletta also said the government can provide many incentives to get people to move away from using oil, but the Senate is ignoring many of the bills the House passes.
\
""We need to put partisan politics aside, and send people to Washington to put people before their party,"" Barletta said.

Editor: On Jan. 1, Pennsylvania began serving its citizens with a new level of transparency. For the first time, Keystone State law presumes that the vast majority of records held by state and local public bodies are accessible to any citizen who asks.
\
There are checks and balances built into the new Right-to-Know Law to keep it from becoming overly burdensome to government. Modest fees will help defray the costs of photocopying, and a staff of attorneys within the new Office of Open Records will serve as a resource to citizens, local and state agencies and the media to ensure citizens have access to the public records of their government.
\
The Office of Open Records will hear appeals from members of the public when their requests for records are denied. Among other responsibilities, the office has the legal authority to provide binding decisions about what documents are covered under the new law, set fees, establish an informal mediation program, conduct trainings and interpret the provisions of this new law.
\
In these times of great fiscal needs, government is under unprecedented strain to do more with fewer resources. The new office and its staff of attorneys strongly encourage citizens to use good judgment in seeking records. The new law is not intended to allow harassment of public bodies with repetitive, duplicative requests or to overburden them to an extent that they are hampered from performing their overall mission.
\
It is, however, intended to reinforce one of the great cornerstones of American democracy: Government is comprised of the people, dedicated to serve the people. Citizens have a right -- not a privilege -- a right to obtain records of their government and public servants at every level of government have an obligation to ensure that this access is unfettered. The Office of Open Records wants to ensure this is a practice, not a platitude.
\
I applaud the Legislature, particularly Senate Majority Leader Dominic Pileggi, for authoring a strong law. I applaud Gov. Ed Rendell's continued support and commitment to ensuring this office is created properly, particularly by exempting this office from the imposed hiring freeze during such difficult financial times. These measures send a strong message to the commonwealth: Pennsylvania and its leadership welcome and encourage their citizens' right to participate in good government. At the Office of Open Records, our doors are open for business.

Editor: I can't say I'm surprised by the Jan. 2 front-page story, ""Panel calls for 50% gas tax hike.""
\
Let's see if I get it straight. The left-wing greenies who think fossil fuels are Satan, and the Al Gore acolytes told us that in order to save fragile Mother Earth, we should buy golf cart-like hybrids, drive less, ride bikes and keep our tires inflated.
\
So Americans did as they were told. They reduced the demand for gasoline and thus drove down the price of gasoline. Now the very same people are in a panic because less tax money is flowing into Washington and Harrisburg. And we all know that government can never do with less. The taxpaying serfs have to do with less.
\
Congratulations, Americans, you did what you were told and will be rewarded with a tax increase. Get used to it.
\
Elections have consequences and not all ""change"" is good change. So come Jan. 20, hold on to your wallets because ""change"" is coming.

Keep secret ballot
\
Editor: Regarding Skip Mendler's Jan. 1 letter to your newspaper about the Employee Free Choice Act: as a member of the Teamster's Union, I certainly appreciate the protection of the rights of workers. The new legislation coined the Employee Free Choice Act is not in the best interest of workers. EFCA has great potential to create a hostile work environment for Pennsylvania workers as well as disrupt our economy at the worst possible time.
\
As one who is very involved in political elections, I also appreciate the secret ballot. Unions should not fear the secret ballot. If it is good enough to elect the president of the United Sates, how can it not be enough to decide on union organization of the workplace?
\
During the election, we heard much about change. This new change should not include stripping workers of the basic right to a secret ballot. The new leadership in Congress should not sacrifice the rights of worker simply to bolster union membership. Pennsylvania workers deserve better.

Fix financial mess
\
Editor: The $50 billion Madoff debacle appears to have blown the lid off the investment community, resulting in scrutiny for all those involved.
\
I am particularly disturbed after reading an alarming article in The Washington Post. It could lead one to conclude that the taxpayers may be stuck with another bailout.
\
It notes that the Securities Investor Protection Corp., an organization that guarantees securities held with brokerages up to $500,000 per customer, has sent 8,000 claim forms to people who had accounts with Bernard Madoff. The trustees say they have located $830 million that might be used to start paying back clients.
\
The article notes SIPC has $1.6 billion in assets and a $1 billion credit line from the Treasury Department. If that is not enough, SIPC will look to Congress for more funds.
\
How much is the taxpayer expected to swallow in these difficult economic times?
\
Where was the Securities and Exchange Commission when Harry Markopolos alerted authorities years ago, detailing the reasons that Madoff was running a Ponzi scheme rather than a legitimate investment group? His testimony in front of Congress should prove to be enlightening.
\
How deep does this go? Considering what has occurred on Wall Street lately, I am not convinced that more fraudulent schemes were not perpetrated on investors from other groups. Clearly the SEC was a player here and members may have actually turned their heads away when they should have been doing their job. It is time that appointed as well as elected officials be held accountable for their actions. If that means fines and jail time, so be it.
\
The taxpayer is getting a bit weary and impatient with all the fraud and greed occurring right under their noses.
\
The $700 billion bailout that was handed to Wall Street with no oversight is another example of congressional ineptitude paid for by the taxpayer. I have not heard of any efforts being made to trace this handout. When certain banks were questioned regarding the disbursement of said funds, they refused to answer. How outrageous does that sound?
\
From what I have read, these funds have gone into financial institution purchases, golden parachutes, executive bonuses and expensive junkets. The intention was to shore up their balance sheets so the money flow would begin to move. This has clearly not happened. Money is still tight.
\
I expect our government to stop posturing and begin to look at a real fix to this mess. Keynesian economics isn't the panacea, either.

492,"HARRISBURG -- With the gubernatorial election just a month away, Democrat Dan Onorato and Republican Tom Corbett are increasing the shrillness of their attacks on each other's campaign contributions.\Mr. Onorato, in a statewide conference call with reporters Friday, said that as of the latest campaign finance reports, his opponent has accepted more than $900,000 in donations from the gas industry.\""Tom Corbett is in the pocket of Big Oil and Gas,"" Mr. Onorato claimed. ""He will defend their profits and not do anything for taxpayers.""\The $900,000 figure is up from the $372,000 in campaign donations to Mr. Corbett from Marcellus Shale interests reported by Common Cause/Pennsylvania in August. Mr. Onorato, who himself has gotten at least $74,000 from Marcellus drillers, said additional contributions to Mr. Corbett are listed on the latest campaign reports submitted to the state.\Kevin Harley, a top Corbett aide, didn't dispute the $900,000 figure but countered that Mr. Onorato has accepted ""over $1 million"" in contributions from the Pennsylvania Trial Lawyers Association. ""He's in the pocket of the trial lawyers,"" Mr. Harley charged.\He said Mr. Corbett has 18,000 campaign contributors and he's not beholden to any of them.\Mr. Onorato brought up the gas industry contributions as he criticized Mr. Corbett for his opposition to any kind of tax on natural gas pumped from the many areas of underground Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania.\Mr. Onorato charged that Mr. Corbett's continuing opposition to such a levy means ""he is playing to the industry's interests instead of the people.""\Mr. Onorato urged the state Legislature to adopt a Marcellus Shale gas tax before leaving Harrisburg later this month.\Mr. Onorato said the money from the shale gas tax should go for restoring budget cuts to the state Department of Environmental Protection, for fixing municipal roads and bridges damaged by heavy drilling equipment and for refilling the state's Growing Greener fund to protect open space and preserve farmland.\Mr. Onorato wouldn't specify his preferred rate for a Marcellus tax but said the rate of 39 cents per 1,000 cubic feet of gas, approved by the state House this week, was too high. He also said that state Senate Republicans' plan for a 1.5 percent tax on the market price of gas pumped from the ground was too low.\He said that if legislators fail to enact a shale tax this month -- and if he's elected Nov. 2 -- he would unveil his own shale gas tax plan on the day he's sworn into office in January.\But Corbett aide Harley scoffed that voters ""shouldn't believe a word that comes out of Dan Onorato's mouth.""\Mr. Harley said the $1 million in contributions from the lawyers association has caused Mr. Onorato to side with trial lawyers in blocking ""lawsuit reform,"" such as a law to limit damages for ""pain and suffering"" in personal injury suits.\As for Marcellus Shale, Mr. Harley said, ""Tom Corbett is for jobs, while Dan Onorato is for taxes."" He said Mr. Onorato should divulge details of his shale tax plan now.\He said Mr. Corbett has already released a plan for environmental protection, such as increasing the amounts of bonds that drillers must post in order to get a drilling permit and increasing fines for harming the environment.\""Tom Corbett has prosecuted some of the worst polluters in Pennsylvania,"" Mr. Harley said. ""He's the only candidate with a record of protecting the environment."""
493,"HARRISBURG -- Gov. Ed Rendell wrote a tough letter Wednesday to Republican Senate leaders, urging them to stop stalling and meet with House leaders to forge an acceptable compromise tax on the natural gas that's pumped from underground Marcellus Shale.\Mr. Rendell, a Democrat who leaves office in January, wrote to Senate GOP leaders Joe Scarnati and Dominic Pileggi. Last week, the governor noted, the state House enacted a tax of 39 cents per thousand cubic feet of gas and he said it's time for the Senate to act.\""The House lived up to its end of the bargain and passed a tax bill for your consideration,"" Mr. Rendell said. ""It's now time for you to make the next move to bring this matter to a close.""\He said the Senate's ""failure to make a counter-offer seems to suggest that you are more interested in running out the clock than living up to your public commitment to impose a tax on this industry. ... I write today to urge you to put your counteroffer on the table this week and to begin to work in earnest and with a sense of urgency ... before you adjourn next week.""\He said the state needs the $100 million or so in revenue from the new shale gas tax to protect local roads and the environment from possible damage from shale drilling, as well as to fill a hole in the state budget.\""The time has come for these [gas drilling] companies to stop taxing our resources and challenging our environment and instead for us to tax them to ... protect our environment,"" he said.\When the 2010-11 state budget was adopted in early July, Mr. Rendell said, legislators committed to adopting a Marcellus Shale gas tax by Oct. 1, but that deadline has passed without action.\Mr. Rendell told the senators that their recent comments ""do not offer a shred of evidence that you have any intention of living up to this commitment you made to put the severance tax to a vote in the Senate before you adjourn the session.""\Some critics say the House's shale gas tax proposal would be the highest tax in the nation and would make Pennsylvania noncompetitive with other gas-producing states.\Critics also complained that the procedure the House used to adopt the tax is unconstitutional, because the House completely changed the wording of an unrelated Senate bill and because revenue bills must originate in the House, not the Senate. Mr. Scarnati has asked the Legislative Reference Bureau for an opinion on the legality of the House action.\But Mr. Rendell said he thinks such problems can be worked out through negotiation, and urged the Senate and the House to adopt a compromise quickly. But that could be a problem, since the House has recessed until Nov. 8. The Senate has three days of session left this month but won't return after the Nov. 2 election.\Pileggi aide Erik Arneson said gas-tax talks are continuing with all four legislative caucuses and with the governor's staff, including talks held Wednesday and more planned for today.\Senate Republicans are examining all available options, he said, ""in light of the constitutionally questionable bill approved by the House.""\Whatever tax bill legislators come up with ""must be drafted in such a way that it will withstand the constitutional challenges, which are sure to come."""

Hey, big spender, ease up on taxpayers
\
Editor: Gov. Ed ""The Tax Man"" Rendell is at it again. Now that he is comfortably in his second term as governor, the ""Tax Man"" is unleashing his true agenda. Tax and spend the working person's hard-earned money. Increasing the sales tax from 6 to 7 percent, increasing the tax on cigarettes by 10 or 11 cents, new fees on electric bills, possibly increasing the gas tax and driver's license/registration fees. This is a direct burden on the working class of this state.
\
As a working single homeowner, each of these tax increases will directly take money out of my pocket and place it in the hands of the ""Tax Man."" The governor has shown no fiscal restraint when it comes to spending taxpayers' money. In his first term, Mr. Rendell created the emissions tax, allowed local municipalities to raise the ""privilege to work tax"" from $10 to $52 each year, added countless new high-paid positions on the gaming commission and my favorite, allowing the obscene pay raise to elected officials.
\
I believe it is time to look at cutting waste out of the budget instead of creating more. I hope the House and Senate put a stop to this out-of-control spending.
\
Another four years of this administration's tax and spend policy and the working person of this state would be better off stop working and go on public relief.

Halt wild spending on county level
\
Editor: I must agree with the Archbald resident whose Feb. 4 letter to the editor criticized the Lackawanna County commissioners.
\
The tax and spend policies of this administration far exceeds the past administration. When we were promised a 25 percent reduction in taxes -- an unfulfilled election promise -- we were instead hit with a 48 percent increase. The reason, they said, was due to the past administration's bill-paying practices. But this administration's spending practices have increased the county's indebtedness in the last three years.
\
Now the ""Yankees Are Coming"" is a huge smokescreen to downplay the mistakes of this administration. County residents will be promised many more things by the next set of candidates, but who and what can you believe?
\
The $500,000 for the Sorvino film was our money, not theirs. The Taj Mahal of a transportation center that they are building and the selling of the DPW building and land, only to rent the building and buy back one acre, are just nonsense.
\
It's time to take government back a step and make politicians accountable for their actions. I intend to petition the Board of Elections to put a referendum on the ballot to not allow a tax increase by any governing body in excess of 10 percent in one year, unless the governing body can show that there will not be any unnecessary increase in spending.

Warming warnings get cold shoulder
\
Editor: The articles about climate change on the front page of the Feb. 2 and 3 papers deserve some elucidation to help put the situation in perspective.
\
In 1896, Svante Arrhenius -- a Danish Nobelist -- postulated the possibility of man-made global warming. He found that the percentage of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was increasing as a result of emissions from power generation associated with the industrial revolution. Remember that automobiles were not a factor at that time. The greenhouse effect of certain chemicals such as carbon dioxide was already well understood in those days. However, the possibility of any major effect resulting from man-made greenhouse gas changes was still considered to be quite remote.
\
The scientific community did not pay much attention to the problem until the 1950s. When they began to study the situation in detail, they found the carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere was increasing at an uncomfortably rapid pace. The science of global temperature and climate changes was still in its infancy. About all that could be said was that there was a likelihood of anthropogenic (man-made) global warming. There was little specific information.
\
The scientific community tried to get the populace to recognize that caution was in order. However, all they could say was that there was a major change in the atmosphere which indicated the possibility, and even probability, of other dramatic changes.
\
In 1969 the American Chemical Society published a book, ""Cleaning Our Environment --The Chemical Basis For Action."" The book pointed out that carbon dioxide was not generally treated as a pollutant, but basically only because there was no known way to filter it out at the source. The only way to stop polluting with carbon dioxide was to stop burning fossil fuels (e.g., coal and oil).
\
However, the book also stated that by definition, carbon dioxide is a pollutant. In addition, the book pointed out that there are probably other materials (e.g., methane) with which mankind is increasing the greenhouse gas content of the atmosphere.
\
The United States' performance with regard to global warming since 1970 has been the equivalent of driving a car at breakneck speed, on a pitch black night, with the headlights not working, and then refusing to apply the brakes until the car lights came on so we could see if the was any danger. More specifically, do nothing to stop increasing the carbon dioxide emissions until the scientists had established exactly what the dangers of such emissions are.
\
Recently, there has been recognition that glaciers are receding at an unduly rapid rate as well as that there are many other measurable changes attributable to global warming, i.e., global warming is much more advanced than we had realized. It is not only our grandchildren who will suffer because we selfishly chose to ignore the warning of global warming, but also our children and maybe some of us alive today. With the article in the Feb. 2 paper, the headlights are back on.
\
Although President Bush and Karl Rove are hardly the only ones to ignore the signals foretelling global warming and the associated climate changes, they have certainly led the way. They both thrive on fooling the public. One hopes that finally they now, at least, understand you cannot fool Mother Nature.

Humans clearly part of the problem
\
Editor: The Feb. 3 Weather Wise column by Scott Stuccio made it clear that Mr. Stuccio, who claims it is his job ""to predict weather conditions and give facts -- not opinions,"" does have an opinion.
\
He implied that global warming was not really happening because it was so cold during the week in much of the country. He also said that ""Anyone with a solid education can figure out that the natural cycle of weather patterns that circulate the globe are like an oscillating wave. It may take time, but eventually a global cooling will take place.""
\
What he did not say is how long that would be. Thousands of years, maybe? The outdoor temperature this week is not an indication of global cooling or warming. The melting of glaciers, the average earth mean temperature and the temperature of the oceans are some of the things that show that the earth is warming.
\
Noted scientists around the world are telling us that we have a serious global warming problem and what we humans are doing is part of that problem. Let's listen to them.

495,"If East Chestnut Street Mennonite Church is looking for a tagline, its members might want to consider “You’ll get a charge out of our church!”\A bit hokey, perhaps, but accurate.\Last weekend the church, 432 E. Chestnut St., opened its first electric vehicle charging stations at no cost to visitors.\The reason?\“We need to step back from the precipice of climate change,” said Marlisa Yoder-Bontrager, a member of the church’s Creation Care Committee.\Although there are dozens of electric vehicle charging stations in the Lancaster area (go to PlugShare.com for a map), this is believed to be the first established by a church.\ Good stewards \East Chestnut Street Mennonite’s commitment to the environment stretches back years. In the past, funds have been used for tree planting and insulating the church building to make it more energy efficient. For the past several years, church members have been encouraged to contribute a voluntary tax to the church for every gallon of gas purchased. Yoder-Bontrager and her husband, Daryl, who drive a hybrid, contribute 50 cents per gallon.\Now the money goes to a project designed to help others be good stewards of the Earth.\The two charging stations at the church are each 7.7 kilowatts. Translated, that means it takes roughly three hours to fully charge a 24-kilowatt battery.\The cost to create this electric oasis in the church’s parking lot?\“Ballpark for what we paid for our two commercial Level 2 charging stations installed (was) $10K,” Yoder-Bontrager explained.\Brandon Hollinger, who attends the church, installed the system. On Tuesday, he backed his 1968 Saab 96 up to the fueling station and plugged in.\Hollinger has been converting gasoline-powered cars to electric vehicles for more than a decade. A musician by profession, he was motivated to act after watching the 2006 documentary “Who Killed the Electric Car?” Politics, he admits, also played a role.\“I oppose a lot of government policies, like the war in Iraq,” he said. “It’s not about promoting democracy; it’s about fossil fuels. And every time I put gas in my car, it was helping to fund those policies. They’re all interrelated.”\Over the past decade, he has built his avocation into a business — BH Electrics LLC and www.ampREVOLT.com.\ Renewed interest \Electric vehicles once were deemed too expensive or exotic to build. But given the growth in hybrid vehicles, new batteries that can power cars for more than 200 miles and the introduction of the Nissan Leaf and Tesla EV vehicles, costs have come down and interest has picked up.\“The secret’s out,” Hollinger said.\Electric vehicle owners can purchase their own chargers, and newer models come with their own portable charging system.\Individual and Level 2 systems use alternating current that is converted to direct current. Level 3 commercial systems use direct current.\The power to run the two chargers comes from the church in the form of a 120-volt line. And while the church’s charging stations are free to use, Hollinger said they can easily be converted to a pay system. He carries a RFID card — a radio frequency identification reader — when he drives his electric Saab or 1971 Austin FX4 taxi longer distances.\“We’re exploring our options,” Yoder-Bontrager said.\According to the Environmental Protection Agency, motor vehicles cause 75 percent of carbon monoxide pollution in the U.S. The Environmental Defense Fund estimates that gas and diesel-powered vehicles cause one-third of the air pollution that produces smog in the U.S. Although the U.S. has less than a third of all the vehicles in the world, it is responsible for roughly half of the world’s emissions from cars.\The Rev. Todd Friesen, the church’s pastor, said the congregation is driven by a deep concern about the effects of climate change.\“It’s a small thing,” referring to the charging stations, “but a concrete way to address it.”\Citing Psalm 24 — “The earth is the Lord’s, and the fullness thereof” — he said it will take many more such charging stations to make an impact, “but we’re hoping this creates a little momentum.”\ Grants play role \The station’s installation was funded in part by a grant from Mennonite Church USA’s Creation Care Network as well as the church’s ongoing voluntary gas tax.\Yoder-Bontrager said the Creation Care Committee also has contacted the Gov. Tom Wolf administration seeking funds from the Driving PA Forward program. That was part of the $118 million settlement signed by Volkswagen after the automaker acknowledged it had installed a device on vehicles it sold in this country to deactivate emissions controls when the car wasn’t being tested.\“Members of the church have a significant foreign policy and environment approach,” Hollinger said. “I’m so excited to be a part of this.”\Added Yoder-Bontrager: “The more we can increase the understanding of electric vehicles, the more people are likely to adopt them.”\She and Hollinger cited one other reason to switch to electric cars.\“They’re fun to drive.”\Crédito: EARLE CORNELIUS | Staff Writer"

497,"The six ""Principles for Global Warming Legislation"" released recently by Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., were notable for what they lacked. There were no specific greenhouse-gas emissions targets. There was no determination on an auction of pollution permits vs. initially giving some or most of them away to polluters. But Ms. Boxer was clear on one thing: There will be no consideration of a carbon tax.\Sure, the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee said, ""We're willing to look at everything."" But she ended that declaration with ""... but we believe cap-and-trade is the way to go.""\Ms. Boxer's principles include enforceable reductions with periodic review. States and localities would be allowed to forge ahead on their own efforts to fight global warming. A transparent carbon market would be established. The proceeds generated by it would fund clean energy technology and assist the transition by consumers, manufacturers, states and localities to a clean-energy economy.\Cap-and-trade regimes have advantages, notably the ability to set a limit on emissions and to integrate with other countries. But they are complex and vulnerable to lobbying and special pleading, and they do not guarantee success.\The experience of the European Union is Exhibit A. Emissions targets were set too high. Too many pollution allowances were given away to industry. The value of a carbon credit plummeted. Companies made windfall profits by charging customers more for energy while selling allowances they didn't need. And the Europeans have not had much success reducing greenhouse-gas emissions. Disputes on the next round of reductions led to the creation of a two-tiered system to appease Eastern European countries fearful of the cost to their industries.\A carbon tax, by contrast, is simple and sure in its effects. Last summer, when gas prices shot up past $4 a gallon, average miles driven dropped significantly, as did energy consumption. Demand for fuel-efficient cars and overall energy efficiency skyrocketed.\If high prices had been the result of a gas tax, that money would have stayed in the United States rather than lining the pockets of oil-rich regimes all too happy to feed the U.S. addiction to fossil fuels. As with a cap-and-trade system, the money generated by a carbon tax could be given back to the American people.\Alluding to the climate-change bill that failed in the Senate last June, Ms. Boxer said that her committee would be ""starting afresh."" What better way to do that than by giving a tax on carbon a fair hearing?"
498,"
A Rendell administration official and three Democratic lawmakers joined an environmental advocacy group at a town hall Thursday night in Fayette County calling for state legislators to follow through on a pledge to enact a tax on natural gas extraction by drillers from the Marcellus shale formation.
\
PennFuture took its ""Keep the Promise Tour"" to a town hall at Penn State Fayette, The Eberly Campus last night before legislators' self-imposed Oct.1 deadline to adopt a possible severance tax as a key component of the state budget negotiations.
\
State Department of Environmental Protection Secretary John Hanger and Reps. Bill DeWeese of Greene County, and Tim Mahoney and Deberah Kula, both of Fayette County, said the tax was important for minimizing the potential side effects of drilling on communities, replenishing the dwindling funding available through Growing Greener recreation and conservation grants and ensuring state agencies have the necessary resources to regulate drilling companies.
\
About 20 people attended the town hall.
\
Hanger said arguments that a severance tax would ""kill the golden goose"" are ""hooey,"" explaining that Pennsylvania is the last of the 15 gas-producing states to consider passing a severance tax.
\
""Guess what? They haven't killed one golden goose yet,"" said Hanger, who served as the president and chief executive officer for PennFuture from June 1998 to August 2008.
\
The secretary said 75 drilling companies are invested in the formation, which has enough gas to power the nation's energy needs for 15 years.
\
Officials have said the state could collect between $70 million and $160 million in the six months after the tax's adoption.
\
DeWeese called for a ""modest"" severance tax, saying that the potential benefits of the formation represent a ""happy serendipity"" for a state dealing with its ""most trying economy since the 1930s.""
\
""If it's good enough for Sarah Palin in Alaska, if it's good enough for Dick Cheney in Wyoming, then it should be good enough for the Senate Republicans,"" he said.
\
Mahoney said the state's leaders made a costly mistake a century ago by not doing enough to mitigate the damage the coal industry did to the environment.
\
If legislators don't come up with a ""fair"" plan, they're not doing their jobs, he said.
\
""Far too long, we've been just run over by these big companies,"" Mahoney said.
\
Kula said the benefits of a tax will lead to job training so residents can find work and funding for rural municipalities.
\
But officials of a Canonsburg-based industry group, the Marcellus Shale Coalition, said the tax debate shouldn't be about posturing for an individual budget year. State leaders should focus on the adoption of tax and regulation policies that don't discourage economic growth, the group contends.
\
""It's something that we, in Pennsylvania, have been waiting for for a long time,"" the coalition's president, Kathryn Klaber, said Thursday afternoon during a phone interview before the town hall. ""It's a wonderful opportunity, but it's a long-term one.""
\
Because drilling also is going on in such states as Oklahoma, Arkansas, Texas and Louisiana, it's a misnomer for those supporting a high gas tax to think they can do whatever they want without hurting competition, she said.
\

499,"Cheryl Szymanski's letter ""Cyclists and Roads"" shows the one-sided type of thinking that affects this country so negatively in the past 30 years. My letter is not so much about bicycling, but about the lack of thought that occurs with all of the important subjects of the day, such as politics, schooling, religion and on and on. \I agree with the bikers sometimes and with the drivers sometimes. The problem with Ms. Szymanski's letter is that she points out all the things bikers don't pay for (such as gas tax for the roads and car insurance and car registration) but doesn't balance her thinking by mentioning all the things bad about automobiles. \We need automobiles with our lifestyle. However, they do cost so much money by polluting the environment and actually making people sick and even die in some cases, which bikes don't do. They tear up the roads, which bikes don't do. If you are in an accident with a car, there is a decent chance of being killed or very badly injured. This is also possible with bikes but to a much lesser degree. \Also, people who bike regularly usually are more healthy and thus cost everyone else less for insurance and less for health care overall. As we know, the insurance and health care industries base premiums on total cost, so people who are in better physical shape bring down these costs. \So I think anybody reading this would have to agree that automobiles, and not bikes, cost this country much more in money and, more important, in lives. Let's start thinking about all sides of an argument!"
500,"Pennsylvania has the nation's largest inventory of structurally deficient bridges -- 6,060 as of December, according to the Federal Highway Administration.\But bridges turn out to be the crown jewel, relatively speaking, in the state's deteriorating transportation network, according to a report card to be released today by the American Society of Civil Engineers.\It gives the state's roads and mass transit systems the same dismal grade: D-minus. Pennsylvania's bridges got a grade of C.\That is actually a step back for the state's overall transportation infrastructure from the ASCE's previous Pennsylvania report card, issued in 2006, which said ""the Keystone State is crumbling."" That report gave roads a D, bridges a C and transit a D-plus.\The report card comes at a time of looming drastic cuts in state spending on roads, bridges and transit, unless the Legislature comes up with an alternative to the $472 million for the coming fiscal year that was expected to be financed with Interstate 80 tolls.\The Federal Highway Administration in April rejected the state's request to toll I-80. That left a gaping hole in the funding scheme of Act 44, which the Legislature passed in 2007 to solve the state's chronic transportation funding shortages.\""Not only have many areas of our state's infrastructure been critically underfunded for decades, threatening our economy and quality of life, but we are currently facing a major crisis in funding roads, transit and other parts of our transportation system,"" said Greg Scott, ASCE Region 2 governor.\Amid the crisis, the House Transportation Committee has scheduled statewide public hearings to gather input on possible solutions. One will be held at 11 a.m. June 18 at Gateway High School in Monroeville.\The ASCE, representing 139,000 civil engineers worldwide, issued grades to Pennsylvania in 12 categories in its ""2010 Report Card for Pennsylvania's Infrastructure.""\Other grades were parks and recreation, B-minus; solid waste, C; dams and levees, C-minus; rail, B; storm water, D-minus; drinking water, D-plus; navigable waterways, D-plus; schools, B-minus; and wastewater, D-plus. The state's overall grade was D-plus.\Mr. Scott said water infrastructure is the second most pressing problem after transportation.\""We are reaching the point where the investments of the past have run out. Many parts of the water systems in cities and towns statewide are a century or more old, and major water main breaks are common.""\Roads -- D-minus\Based on the International Roughness Index, 38 percent of the state's roads are in fair or poor condition. Pennsylvania ranks fifth in the nation for miles of state-owned highways, and truck traffic on interstate highways in the state is double the national average.\""Simply keeping the road system from degrading, let alone improving it, requires more than is currently available in the budget,"" the report said.\While the economic slump reduced travel on the state's highways, demand and congestion are ""predicted to rise greatly in the near future,"" it said.\PennDOT has shifted its focus from building new capacity to maintaining what it already has. Only about 5 percent of its budget goes to capacity-increasing projects, down from 20 percent.\In addition to the uncertainty over state funding, Congress has not replaced the federal surface transportation law that expired in August, instead passing extensions that provide no growth in aid to states.\The state did get a one-time boost from the stimulus law, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which provided about $1.5 billion for road, bridge and transit projects.\The loss of I-80 as a revenue source already has put the brakes on 20 major projects and Gov. Ed Rendell has called a special session of the Legislature to tackle the shortfall.\""Other sources of funding that have been discussed are increases to registration and licensing fees and an increase to the [state motor fuel tax],"" the ASCE said. ""Recent proposals for gas tax increases have not been able to garner enough political support to become a reality. Until another major source of funding is agreed upon, however, the state's ability to maintain the existing roadway system will be severely affected.""\Transit -- D-minus\The Governor's Transportation Funding and Reform Commission reported in 2006 that revenue shortfalls were chronic for transit agencies across the state and were exacerbated by growth in fuel and health care costs. Another layer of woe came with the collapse of financial markets, which seriously eroded the agencies' pension funds.\""In the past, the overall financial underpinning of the commonwealth's transit program was weak and the program structure was dysfunctional,"" the ASCE said. ""Unless a long-term funding solution is found, transit system users throughout the state will face significant service reductions, fare increases and reduced mobility, including senior citizens and persons with disabilities.""\The service reductions ""will contribute to more cars on our already overburdened roads, more impact on the environment, and more gallons of gas consumed,"" Mr. Scott said.\Bridges -- C\Twenty-seven percent of the state's bridges are structurally deficient, compared with 12 percent nationwide.\The report said Pennsylvania's percentage is higher in part because of winter weather and the fact that the bridges are older, with the average age being 50.\It credited PennDOT with keeping the problem from getting worse with its Accelerated Bridge Program, begun in 2008. The number of bridges bid out for construction work rose from 225 in 2007 to 540 in fiscal 2008-09, and Pennsylvania devoted $390 million of its $1 billion in federal stimulus funding to bridge work.\""Without PennDOT's recent bridge program emphasis, the numbers would be significantly worse,"" the ASCE said.\It said there is $11 billion in ""immediately needed"" bridge repairs and urged the state to set a goal of reaching the national average of deficient bridges by 2033. It warned that inadequate funding would reverse the recent progress.\The ASCE report follows another this month by a state advisory panel that said Pennsylvania's transportation system ""is in a state of crisis"" and will require $3.5 billion a year to catch up.\""It is becoming increasingly difficult for the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, transit agencies and local governments to maintain, improve and provide the infrastructure and services to meet Pennsylvania's mobility needs,"" said Louis C. Schultz Jr., chairman of a task force of the Pennsylvania State Transportation Advisory Committee.\The ASCE report card can be viewed at www.pareportcard.org."
501,"
There are good reasons why the question of gasoline taxes was raised during the presidential election: The gross underpricing of gasoline costs our country hundreds of billions of dollars in uncollected revenue and in noncompensated social costs. Cheap gasoline is not a question, it is a major national problem. It is by far the biggest ""free lunch"" our country can no longer afford.
\
The reason our federal gas tax is by all standards and comparisons virtually nonexistent is that whenever the issue of increasing it is raised, the facts are skillfully distorted by various lobbyists or extremist consumer- protection groups. They overlook the problems that result from underpricing, including a negative impact on the economy, society and the environment.
\
Here are some of the relevant facts:
\
* Gasoline prices today (with adjustment for inflation) are lower than they were at any time during the last 50 years, except for a short period during the 1973 energy crisis.
\
* The average motorist in the United States pays only 4.6 cents for gas to drive his/her car one mile. (At that price, most people act as if driving is virtually free, once the automobile and insurance are paid.)
\
* The federal tax of 4 cents per gallon introduced in 1956 to finance the Interstate Highway System represented about 16 percent of the price of gas. Today, the 14.1-cent-a-gallon federal tax represents only 11 percent of the gas price.
\
The total costs of driving an automobile, according to AAA estimates, is 34 cents per mile. The current tax of 14.1 cents per gallon amounts to 0.5 cents per mile, slightly more than 1 percent of the total cost of driving.
\
Eventual introduction of a 50 cents per gallon tax (proposed by independent presidential candidates John Anderson in 1980 and Ross Perot in 1992) would result in an increase of the direct cost of driving from 4.6 cents to only 6.5 cents per mile. The total cost of driving would increase from 34 cents to 35.9 cents per mile, i.e. by less than 6 percent.
\
The claims that such a tax would severely punish the poor, all drivers, or the entire U.S. economy are obviously a myth rather than a fact.
\
There are two main reasons to support a major increase in the gas tax: to collect large revenues painlessly and to reduce the waste and damage caused by driving.
\
Each one cent a gallon of taxes generates $1.1 billion per year. Even assuming a slight decrease in driving, the 50 cent a gallon tax would generate about $50 billion per year.
\
No other source would generate that much tax revenue at such a negligible increase in consumer price. This tax would reduce the national deficit/debt in a much more socially equitable and painless way than alternative revenues, such as a sales or income tax.
\
There is a consensus that we need to repair our infrastructure, but candidates never seem to tell us how they'll finance it; well, here's the best way to accomplish that task.
\
Some projects that need to be funded with this revenue include: Bridge/ highway maintenance, mass transit improvement, Amtrak, high-speed rail systems and other infrastructures such as terminals, utilities, public spaces and recreational areas.
\
Furthermore, the tax would help finance the repair of damages caused by congestion, air pollution and the dehumanization of cities and suburban residential areas to masses of highways and expressways.
\
Even if the first reason, collection of tax revenues, were not needed at all - a remote hypothesis! - the second reason, reduction of vehicle miles traveled and the resultant savings, both to the environment and the economy, would be a sufficient reason for introduction of much higher gas taxes. For this reason most other industrialized nations have adopted higher gas prices.
\
Of course there will be groups arguing against gas tax increases and these include partisans of the industries which benefit from the volume of highway travel - namely, car manufacturers, the highway lobby and, with some notable exceptions, oil companies.
\
There is a major misconception about the problem of gas tax increases. Any increase, even 5 cents per gallon - about the difference in prices from some gas stations across the street from each other - have been criticized as an unacceptable, crushing burden on the American public and economy. Analysis of facts shows that the present gross underpricing of auto travel, and particularly the fact that 90 percent of the user costs of driving are fixed and independent of individual trips, leads to enormous waste and negative impacts.
\
Why do politicians ignore this problem? Because the propaganda against taxes, by the above mentioned groups, stimulates the popular desire of people to have a ""free lunch.' and because low-cost driving is a very popular convenience. But this convenience is now an obsolete luxury. It is time to educate the public of the consequences in order to make this taxation acceptable. Higher gas taxes represent a far more effective and equitable method than any alternative way of revenue collection and environmental protection.

502,"Alan Fager is old enough to remember when the Interstate 83 bridge over the Susquehanna River in the Harrisburg area didn't exist.\Back in the day, his family crossed the wrought iron Walnut Street bridge to reach the capital city. It cost a nickel, Fager said. The toll ended when the structure was paid for.\The I-83 South Bridge, as it is called, was built in 1960 as part of the national highway interstate system. It opened up travel for drivers and businesses.\Now that aging bridge needs to be replaced with one that meets modern standards, but the state Department of Transportation doesn't have the money to pay for it.\With declining revenues from the gas tax, Pennsylvania faces an $8.1 billion annual shortfall for interstate highway and bridge funding. Legislative, industry and community leaders are looking for solutions to the crisis.\Those could include tolling bridges and highways, charging drivers a price based on the miles they travel, and increases in taxes or fees.\One of the short-term solutions calls for tolling nine bridges around the state — including the I-83 South Bridge, to pay for their replacement or rehabilitation.\Other bridges are located throughout the Commonwealth, such as an Interstate 95 bridge in Philadelphia and an Interstate 79 structure in Allegheny County.\Some drivers objected to the tolling of the I-83 South bridge during a recent town meeting. One called it unfair to commuters who travel to work daily in the capital city.\Fager, who participated in the town hall, worries that the toll would become a forever tax, although PennDOT says the law requires that the tolling ends when the contract expires.\The York man also wondered about the construction on the capital beltway around Harrisburg and why a toll isn't being imposed for those improvements.\""It seems as though, to me, we have a simple solution for a more complex problem,"" he said of the proposed tolling.\Why does Pa. have\a funding problem?\Pennsylvania has one of the largest state-owned infrastructures in the country, said Ken McClain, PennDOT alternative funding director.\It owns 25,400 bridges and more than 40,000 miles of road.\""... anecdotally, we have more miles of roadway and bridges than New York, New Jersey and all of the New England states combined,"" McClain said during a recent phone interview.\Statewide, the average age of bridges is 50 years, he said. Many were designed to only last 50 or 60 years. The ones being built today have a life expectancy of 75 to 100 years.\The state currently receives about $6.9 billion annually for roads and bridges, mainly from gas taxes, but the actual need to maintain the infrastructure is $15 billion annually.\That's an $8.1 billion annual funding shortfall.\One of the biggest reasons for the shortfall is dwindling revenue from the gas tax, which funds nearly 75 percent of the money needed for roads and bridges.\The rest comes from driver's license fees, annual car registrations and smaller funds, including federal sales and use taxes.\""We've seen a steady decline over the last five years in our revenues, and that's the tip of the iceberg,"" McClain said.\Drivers are filling up at the pump less frequently than in previous decades because vehicles have become more fuel efficient. In the past, vehicles used to only get between 10 and 20 mpg. Now, they average between 20 and 35 mpg.\Hybrid cars, which switch from gasoline to electric at slower speeds, also have become more common, he said. These can go even longer distances.\And the future looks bright for all-electric vehicles — no gasoline required.\President Joe Biden's infrastructure proposal calls for spending $174 billion on electric vehicles, including a network of 500,000 electric-vehicle stations.\Vehicle manufacturers, such as General Motors and Volvo, have proclaimed that they will shift to producing all electric vehicles in the next 15 years, McClain said.\PennDOT is not opposed to electric vehicles, because they are good for the environment, McClain said.\But it does raise a problem with much of the revenue coming from gas taxes.\How to fix the problem?\Last fall, PennDOT Secretary Yassmin Gramian started an alternative funding office at the department and tapped McClain as the director.\He's in charge of looking at different strategies that have been used across the country and to try to bring them to Pennsylvania.\The goal is to develop short-term, mid-term and long-term funding ideas so that the state isn't reliant on the gas tax, McClain said.\PennDOT also asked high school students to come up with innovative ideas for solving the shortfall.\Students at Dover Area High School in York County won a regional competition with options such as leasing state-owned land around highways to clean energy businesses and developing a a Roundup for Roads donation campaign to raise awareness about the problem.\Earlier this year, Gov. Tom Wolf created the Transportation Revenue Options Commission to look at state-level transportation funding alternatives.\It is comprised of legislators, contractors, engineers, planners, equity groups, community stakeholders, and representatives of aviation, transit and trucking industries.\The commission has been looking at ways to help plug the shortfall, such as raising vehicle registration fees, implementing tolls and charging drivers for each mile they travel.\A high priority mentioned in commission meetings is a reduction in Pennsylvania State Police funding that comes from the Motor License Fund. This would free up money for roads and bridges.\At one time, the state police were taking upward of $850 million from the fund for patrolling the highways, McClain said. In 2016, the state Legislature made a change that started to reduce the amount going to the agency.\Currently, state police receive about $700 million a year — about 11.1 cents of the gas sales tax per gallon. Eventually, at the end of 10 years, it will be capped at $500 million.\From PennDOT's perspective, that's still $500 million a year that could be spent on roads and bridges, McClain said.\""We're not saying that the state police shouldn't be funded,"" he said. ""We're just saying that we're hoping that the General Assembly would come up with some other general fund mechanism to fund the state police so that more of this money can go toward highway and bridge funding directly.""\The commission must issue its report to the governor before Aug. 1. It will be given to the General Assembly in hopes of developing legislation to overhaul transportation funding in the state.\Pennsylvania is not alone\Nationally, funding for transportation has gradually eroded.\What's needed to bring infrastructure into a state of good repair exceeds what the country as a whole is spending on it, said Asha Weinstein Agrawal, director of education at the Mineta Transportation Institute at San Jose State University in San Jose, California.\""Even just fixing things is, frankly, underfunded,"" she said.\Transportation funding comes from a variety of sources, but the core has been from state and federal fuel taxes. Most are a flat rate per gallon — without an inflation adjustment — and legislators need to approve increases.\The federal gas tax has not increased since 1993.\In the last few years, the federal government has supplemented the fuel tax with money from the general fund. But no one is particularly happy about it, she said. It's unclear each year whether it will continue.\When the gas tax was first instituted, it was seen as an equivalent to a toll. It's roughly based on how much a driver travels.\Industry insiders have known for a while that some vehicles, such as electric cars, would lower revenues from the gas tax, but it seemed to be in the distant future, Agrawal said. Now, as drivers are switching to the alternative vehicles, the future might not be as far off as they thought.\Biden has proposed $621 billion for transportation in his proposed $2.25 trillion infrastructure and jobs package. It includes $115 billion for fixing roads and bridges as well as money for modernizing transit systems, improving aviation, ports, and rail; and switching to electric vehicle technology, according to USA Today.\U.S. Senate Republicans have countered with a $568 billion infrastructure plan. It includes more money for road and bridge improvements and airport renovations than Biden's proposal. However, less would be spent in other areas, including transit and rail, according to USA Today. Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pennsylvania, is a supporter of the counter-proposal.\Biden referenced Pennsylvania's deteriorating bridges in a recent speech. He shared that during a visit years ago, a fire station sat close to a deficient bridge. Firefighters had to travel nine miles to cross another span to reach a shopping center and a school just on the other side of a creek from the fire station.\""Well, there are bridges all over America — big and small — like that,"" he said.\What happens if nothing is done?\The interstates in Pennsylvania are too important to fail, McClain said.\They carry a quarter of the vehicle miles traveled in the state and are the economic engine for the state, local communities and businesses.\""We are the Keystone State, so there's a lot of movement of people and goods through the entire northeastern part of the country through Pennsylvania, so we can't afford for those interstate bridges to fail,"" McClain said.\The improvements will need to be paid for, one way or another, and if tolls can't be charged to drivers, the state will have to look for money elsewhere, he said.\That could impact residents in their own back yards.\Two years ago, some funding had to be taken away from metropolitan planning organizations, which plan road and bridge improvements in their local communities, to help pay for projects on the major arteries, McClain said.\The interstates are always going to be the priority, he said, so regional projects might have to be deferred to put money into the highways and bridges.\""...that doesn't mean that these more regional projects aren't important,"" McClain said. ""Those are the bridges and the roads that the people use to go to work, to school, to church, to extra-curricular activities ...""\He added that transit, emergency responders and delivery trucks also use those roads and bridges to reach residents and businesses.\That's why PennDOT has proposed the tolling — a dedicated revenue stream — to replace the aging bridges.\""Those are the bridges and the roads that the people use to go to work, to school, to church, to extra-curricular activities.""\Ken McClain\PennDOT alternative funding director"
503,"
Winners and losers in Gov. Tom Corbett's proposed 2013-2014 budget:
\
WINNERS
\
BUSINESSES: Large-enough companies will benefit because the capital stock and franchise tax goes away come January. The governor proposes cutting the corporate net income tax from 9.99 percent to 6.99 percent by 2025 with the first cut - to 9.89 percent - going into effect in January 2015. The cap on deductible net operating losses would rise from $3 million to $5 million over the next two years. New small business owners will be able to deduct up to $5,000 of startup costs from their taxes.
\
SCHOOL DISTRICTS: They get an extra $90 million in basic education funding, their first increase in two years, and more state funding than before, but still well below what they got in the last year of Gov. Ed Rendell's administration, because federal money went away.
\
The $1 billion from privatizing liquor stores goes toward a new block grant program. The grants can be used to beef up security in schools, boost early childhood education, plan for individual instruction and fund programs that emphasize science, technology, engineering and mathematics.
\
The budget also contains additional funding for pre-kindergarten education. Districts can also apply for waivers from mandated instruction if they can prove they have a better way.
\
TAXPAYERS: No income or sales tax hikes.
\
AGRICULTURE: More money for county fairs and farmland preservation.
\
RETIRED STATE EMPLOYEES: No cuts to their pension benefits.
\
ELDERLY/DISABLED/MENTALLY ILL: The budget provides $40 million more in funding toward keeping elderly and disabled people in their homes and community-based homes, among other things. It also sets aside $2 million to modernize senior-citizen centers. More money for mental health treatment.
\
STATE POLICE: Funding to produce 290 new troopers and 90 new civilian dispatchers to replace troopers in those jobs.
\
DRIVERS: The governor proposed a plan to raise money to fix the state's thousands of decaying roads and bridges - $5.4 billion over five years. They will also have to renew their licenses every six years instead of four and their vehicle registrations every two years instead of annually.
\
WINE AND LIQUOR CONSUMERS: The governor proposes privatizing the state liquor store system. Advocates say it will increase the availability of a wider variety of products.
\
CHILDREN: More money to cover more kids with health insurance.
\
PARKS: Almost $1.3 million for local park and recreation grants plus substantial renovations at state parks.
\
ENVIRONMENT: Almost $3.5 million more for operations and program management in environmental protection.
\
MUSEUMS AND HISTORICAL GROUPS: Slightly more money.
\
LOSERS:
\
STATE EMPLOYEES: They get a pay raise, but the governor wants them to work 40 hours a week instead of 37.5. New employees will have to go into a cash-based pension plan that requires them to contribute 6.25 percent of their salaries toward retirement. Future benefits for current employees would also be lowered through a lower multiplier and other reforms. Current employees can keep their current multiplier if they contribute more to pensions. The governor also proposes eliminating about 900 positions.
\
Plus, liquor store employees will ultimately lose their jobs, but the governor provides them with job training to find new ones.
\
SCHOOL DISTRICTS: Their special education funding stays the same - again.
\
DRIVERS: Their win is countered by likely higher costs for fuel. The governor lowers the per-gallon gas tax over two years from 12 to 10 cents a gallon, but the lifting of the cap on what is taxable by the oil company franchise tax will likely increase prices.
\
COLLEGE STUDENTS; Funding for state universities and state-related universities remains flat, which likely means more tuition increases.
\
ZOOS: All funding gone.
\
PEOPLE WHO SUFFER FROM EPILEPSY, LUPUS, TOURETTE'S SYNDROME AND LOU GEHRIG'S DISEASE: All support service money eliminated.
\
AGRICULTURE: Funding for agricultural, food marketing and hardwoods research is eliminated.
\
REGIONAL POISON CONTROL CENTERS: All funding eliminated.

504,"Over New Year's weekend - as the ball dropped in Times Square and the giant Peep dropped in Bethlehem - gas prices were headed in the opposite direction, rising from about $2.49 a gallon in the Lehigh Valley at the end of the day Friday to $2.63 a gallon by Wednesday afternoon.\The price, bolstered by a gas tax increase of 8 cents a gallon that went into effect Sunday in Pennsylvania, is now 48 cents more than a year ago, 25 cents more than a month ago and 16 cents more than a week ago, according to GasBuddy.\And Pennsylvania motorists should get used to paying more for gas in 2017, a year that will feature the highest gas prices in three years, according to GasBuddy's 2017 Fuel Price Outlook released Wednesday.\GasBuddy predicts the yearly average will be 36 cents higher a gallon than last year, and overall motorists are expected to spend $355 billion on gas in the United States in 2017, which would be $52 billion more than last year.\Patrick DeHaan, senior petroleum analyst at GasBuddy, said there's a ""good possibility"" that motorists in the Lehigh Valley see $3 gas in April, when oil companies schedule refinery maintenance as they switch from winter-blend to summer-blend gasoline, the latter of which costs more and takes longer to produce.\""A combination of high gas taxes and some refineries that will be doing maintenance will probably create a good environment for higher prices to occur,"" said DeHaan, adding that local residents will probably see dozens of stations in April offering gas for $3 a gallon or more.\The last time the Allentown area saw a $3 average for a gallon of gas was in early November 2014, according to GasBuddy's historical data.\Besides Pennsylvania being home to the highest combined gas tax in the country, gas prices have been rising since the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) announced an agreement in late November to cut crude oil production in an effort to boost oil prices.\""That worked with immediate effect,"" DeHaan said. ""They have single-handedly rebalanced supply and demand.""\Credit: Of The Morning Call - - - ; By Jon Harris"

Eventually, at the end of 10 years, it will be capped at $500 million.\From PennDOT's perspective, that's still $500 million a year that could be spent on roads and bridges, McClain said.\""We're not saying that the state police shouldn't be funded,"" he said. ""We're just saying that we're hoping that the General Assembly would come up with some other general fund mechanism to fund the state police so that more of this money can go toward highway and bridge funding directly.""\The commission must issue its report to the governor before Aug. 1.

It's roughly based on how much a driver travels.\Industry insiders have known for a while that some vehicles, such as electric cars, would lower revenues from the gas tax, but it seemed to be in the distant future, Agrawal said. Now, as drivers are switching to the alternative vehicles, the future might not be as far off as they thought.\Biden has proposed $621 billion for transportation in his proposed $2.25 trillion infrastructure and jobs package.

Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pennsylvania, is a supporter of the counter-proposal.\Biden referenced Pennsylvania's deteriorating bridges in a recent speech. He shared that during a visit years ago, a fire station sat close to a deficient bridge.

""Those are the bridges and the roads that the people use to go to work, to school, to church, to extra-curricular activities ...""\He added that transit, emergency responders and delivery trucks also use those roads and bridges to reach residents and businesses.\That's why PennDOT has proposed the tolling — a dedicated revenue stream — to replace the aging bridges.\No one solution will fix the problem\It's not going to be just one solution that solves the problem, but a combination of ideas to plug the $8.1 billion shortfall.\If PennDOT would recoup the money that's going to Pennsylvania State Police, it's not enough, McClain said.\Not even a federal infrastructure bill — unless it includes billions — will be the solution.\Tolling is a good solution, some say, to generate the funds to replace the aging bridges.

It opened up travel for drivers and businesses.\Now that aging bridge needs to be replaced with one that meets modern standards, but the state Department of Transportation doesn't have the money to pay for it.\With declining revenues from the gas tax, Pennsylvania faces an $8.1 billion annual shortfall for interstate highway and bridge funding. Legislative, industry and community leaders are looking for solutions to the crisis.\Those could include tolling bridges and highways, charging drivers a price based on the miles they travel, and increases in taxes or fees.\One of the short-term solutions calls for tolling nine bridges around the state — including the I-83 South Bridge, to pay for their replacement or rehabilitation.\Other bridges are located throughout the Commonwealth, such as an Interstate 95 bridge in Philadelphia and an Interstate 79 structure in Allegheny County.\Some drivers objected to the tolling of the I-83 South bridge during a recent town meeting. One called it unfair to commuters who travel to work daily in the capital city.\Fager, who participated in the town hall, worries that the toll would become a forever tax, although PennDOT says the law requires that the tolling ends when the contract expires.\The York man also wondered about the construction on the capital beltway around Harrisburg and why a toll isn't being imposed for those improvements.\""It seems as though, to me, we have a simple solution for a more complex problem,"" he said of the proposed tolling.\Why does Pa. have a funding problem?\Pennsylvania has one of the largest state-owned infrastructures in the country, said Ken McClain, PennDOT alternative funding director.\It owns 25,400 bridges and more than 40,000 miles of road.\""... anecdotally, we have more miles of roadway and bridges than New York, New Jersey and all of the New England states combined,"" McClain said during a recent phone interview.\Statewide, the average age of bridges is 50 years, he said. Many were designed to only last 50 or 60 years. The ones being built today have a life expectancy of 75 to 100 years.\The state currently receives about $6.9 billion annually for roads and bridges, mainly from gas taxes, but the actual need to maintain the infrastructure is $15 billion annually.\That's an $8.1 billion annual funding shortfall.\One of the biggest reasons for the shortfall is dwindling revenue from the gas tax, which funds nearly 75 percent of the money needed for roads and bridges.\The rest comes from driver's license fees, annual car registrations and smaller funds, including federal sales and use taxes.\""We've seen a steady decline over the last five years in our revenues, and that's the tip of the iceberg,"" McClain said.\Drivers are filling up at the pump less frequently than in previous decades because vehicles have become more fuel efficient. In the past, vehicles used to only get between 10 and 20 mpg. Now, they average between 20 and 35 mpg.\Hybrid cars, which switch from gasoline to electric at slower speeds, also have become more common, he said. These can go even longer distances.\And the future looks bright for all-electric vehicles — no gasoline required.\President Joe Biden's infrastructure proposal calls for spending $174 billion on electric vehicles, including a network of 500,000 electric-vehicle stations.\Vehicle manufacturers, such as General Motors and Volvo, have proclaimed that they will shift to producing all electric vehicles in the next 15 years, McClain said.\PennDOT is not opposed to electric vehicles, because they are good for the environment, McClain said.\But it does raise a problem with much of the revenue coming from gas taxes.\How to fix the problem?\Last fall, PennDOT Secretary Yassmin Gramian started an alternative funding office at the department and tapped McClain as the director.\He's in charge of looking at different strategies that have been used across the country and to try to bring them to Pennsylvania.\The goal is to develop short-term, mid-term and long-term funding ideas so that the state isn't reliant on the gas tax, McClain said.\PennDOT also asked high school students to come up with innovative ideas for solving the shortfall.\Students at Dover Area High School in York County won a regional competition with options such as leasing state-owned land around highways to clean energy businesses and developing a a Roundup for Roads donation campaign to raise awareness about the problem.\Earlier this year, Gov. Tom Wolf created the Transportation Revenue Options Commission to look at state-level transportation funding alternatives.\It is comprised of legislators, contractors, engineers, planners, equity groups, community stakeholders, and representatives of aviation, transit and trucking industries.\The commission has been looking at ways to help plug the shortfall, such as raising vehicle registration fees, implementing tolls and charging drivers for each mile they travel.\A high priority mentioned in commission meetings is a reduction in Pennsylvania State Police funding that comes from the Motor License Fund.

508,"Cyclists captured Pittsburgh's attention this summer after two bicyclists were killed and one was gravely injured in hit-and-runs and another was brutally attacked. Another cyclist was injured on Tuesday after being sideswiped by a driver who fled the scene. In comments on news websites, letters to the editor, tweets and Facebook posts, Pittsburghers offered their opinions on cyclists, drivers and the rules of the road. \Some of those comments make it sound as though the world contains only two kinds of people: bicyclists and drivers. \Some criticized cyclists for zipping through stop signs or red lights and otherwise failing to follow the law. Cyclists and their advocates lamented distracted drivers and speeding cars making the roads unsafe for cyclists, motorists and pedestrians alike. \Scott Bricker, executive director of Bike Pittsburgh, said some drivers view cyclists as just another obstacle -- ""the equivalent of a moving pothole."" \""We're not being seen as human beings just trying to get where we're going,"" he said. \And more often than not, cyclists are also drivers. \Last year, Bike Pittsburgh sent a survey to its 1,700 members. Of the 600 who responded, 90 percent said they own and drive vehicles, meaning that they have driver's licenses, pay fees to register their vehicles and chip in for the gas tax, all of which help fund road and bridge improvements. \""The whole idea that it's us versus them is completely unfounded,"" Mr. Bricker said. ""Most people who ride bikes also drive cars. We're multi-modal people."" \Law and enforcement \In a September letter to the editor printed in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, one woman asked ""if there are any rules for bikes riding on bridges."" \She said in the letter that because no car was on her left, she was able to allow the cyclist to travel on her right unharmed. \""If there had been a car on our left,"" she concluded, ""an accident might have happened."" \Bridges are just like any other roadway, and a statewide law that took effect in April requires motorists who pass cyclists to give them at least 4 feet of buffer space. If they cannot do so safely, they must wait to pass. \The law also prohibits what bicyclists call the ""right hook"" -- a vehicle making a sudden right turn directly in the path of a cyclist. \Stephen Patchan, Pittsburgh's bike-pedestrian coordinator, called the 4-foot passing buffer ""a very important law,"" noting that its intent is for motorists to slow down, evaluate their options and pass cyclists at a safe distance. \""Safety on our roadways is generally increased when people move slower,"" he said. \Mr. Bricker, who said he's been accused of being a militant cyclist, said he only wants drivers to share the road with bicyclists. \""We're not going to have a car-free city,"" he said. ""And I'm not pushing for that."" \He said cyclists have as much right to the road as drivers do, and he just wants ""an environment where everyone riding a bike feels safe."" \Mr. Bricker said a law that bans text messaging while driving, which took effect in March, was a good step in preventing distracted driving, but he said he'd like to see a ban on handheld cell phones as well. \""Put your phone away while you're driving,"" he said. ""It's not that important."" \Bike Pittsburgh recently submitted a proposal to Pittsburgh police for a program that would give officers more training on traffic laws and how to better enforce those laws. \Peter Flucke, president and founder of We Bike, Etc., is a former law enforcement officer who created one of the first police bicycle patrols in Minnesota. He now lives in Green Bay, Wis., and travels around the country to train local police forces on bicycle and pedestrian safety. Mr. Bricker hopes that Mr. Flucke soon will be able to share his expertise with Pittsburgh police. \Mr. Flucke teaches a two-day course that begins with taking officers on a bike ride. \""Who wants to work with a cop who learned how to shoot a gun by watching a video?"" he said. \Getting officers on a bike gives them some perspective and shows them that ""just because you're on a bike in traffic doesn't mean you're an idiot,"" Mr. Flucke said. \On the second day of the training, he has officers walk through crosswalks so they know how dangerous it can be to cross a street. \""If you're not stopping for a cop in uniform legally and safely crossing a crosswalk, I'm sure you're not stopping for my kid,"" Mr. Flucke said. \He said few officers would say they got into law enforcement ""to make the world a better place for pedestrians and cyclists,"" but most officers would say that traffic control is part of their responsibility, and the key is ensuring officers understand that ""traffic"" includes pedestrians and cyclists. \Mr. Flucke said that people depend on officers to manage the safety of bicyclists and pedestrians, but officers often aren't given the appropriate training to deal with crashes and other safety issues involving bicyclists and pedestrians. \""They already know how to be cops,"" Mr. Flucke said. ""They know how to enforce laws. \""They all got into law enforcement to help people. We haven't given them the tools they need to help pedestrians and cyclists."" \He said more laws aren't necessary -- officers just need to enforce the laws that, when broken, lead to the majority of crashes, such as speeding, running stop signs, drunken and distracted driving, and not stopping for pedestrians in crosswalks. \""Pedestrians and bicyclists become invisible if you're not looking for them,"" Mr. Flucke said. \Bill Nesper, vice president of programs for the League of American Bicyclists, said encouraging targeted enforcement of bad drivers is important and giving officers the appropriate training is the best way to ensure that happens. \Of course, drivers aren't the only ones at fault -- when cyclists and pedestrians break laws or behave unpredictably, that, too, can lead to accidents. \Mr. Flucke said one of the biggest mistakes cyclists make is riding contrary to the flow of traffic, contributing to one-third of cycling crashes. Riding a bike at night without lights and reflectors is another no-no, but police rarely cite cyclists for riding without lights. \""If you can't see them, you can't yield to them,"" Mr. Flucke said. \Bike Pittsburgh recognizes the danger of riding without lights and, in the past year, the organization has given out nearly 400 bike lights. \Mr. Flucke also isn't a proponent of what's called the ""Idaho stop"" -- when cyclists treat stop signs as yield signs and red lights as stop signs. It's been legal for cyclists to do that in Idaho since the 1980s, but it's illegal elsewhere, including Pennsylvania. \Mr. Patchan also isn't a fan of the Idaho stop law. \""No matter what you're doing -- driving, biking, walking -- if you do something unanticipated, then you're decreasing your safety and you're decreasing other people's safety,"" he said. \""Somehow, the message has gotten out there that bicyclists don't need to follow the rules of the road,"" Mr. Flucke said. But by Pennsylvania statute, bicycles are vehicles, so cyclists are supposed to follow the same rules as drivers. \But the Idaho stop law works in Idaho. That state's Ada County -- where Boise sits -- has a silver bicycle-friendliness designation from the League of American Bicyclists. Pittsburgh is one step below at a bronze designation. There are three levels above silver -- gold, platinum and diamond. \Matt Edmond, a senior transportation planner with the Ada County Highway District and the county's bike coordinator, said the law is sensible and a good concession for cyclists, who depend on their own power to get where they're going. \""I think unless a cyclist is doing something really flagrant, a lot of our law enforcement is reluctant to write out a $100 traffic citation for it,"" he said. \Because cyclists move more slowly than vehicles and because they have better visibility, they can see traffic at an intersection before a motorist can and so they can roll through stop signs safely. With traffic lights, Mr. Edmond said, the law allows cyclists to clear red lights ahead of vehicles. \Mr. Edmond did, however, echo Mr. Flucke's encouragement for cyclists to act like drivers. \""The more you act like a vehicle, the safer you are,"" he said. \Changing infrastructure, changing minds \Mr. Flucke, Mr. Bricker and Mr. Nesper all said infrastructure plays a big role in ensuring the safety of everyone on the roads. A lot of Pittsburgh's suburbs -- especially sprawling communities such as Cranberry, Robinson, North Huntingdon and Bethel Park -- aren't developed for bikes or pedestrians. \""If you don't own a car there, good luck to you,"" Mr. Bricker said. \Most of those communities have few or no sidewalks. Mr. Flucke said crashes are significantly reduced in areas that have sidewalks. \Pittsburgh has made ""significant strides"" in the past five to 10 years in improving infrastructure to accommodate cyclists, Mr. Patchan said. \The city has installed bike lanes and shared-lane markings all over the city, but Mr. Patchan said the more ""substantial"" the on-street infrastructure, the more bicyclists will use it. \The city has about 35 miles of on-street bike lanes and sharrows -- markings that indicate lanes should be shared by both vehicles and bicycles -- and 20 miles of separated pathways, Mr. Patchan said. \Sharrows will increase the number of cyclists on the road, but painted bike lanes -- or better yet, physically separated bike lanes -- will draw even more people to use bikes to get to work and to go shopping. \Mr. Nesper agreed. \""In the best cities in the country, you're seeing these separated facilities,"" he said. \The other Pittsburgh initiative is ""to make sure that everyone who uses this public right of way ... knows their responsibilities to maintain the highest level of safety for everyone,"" Mr. Patchan said. \The city partners with Bike Pittsburgh to inform people who want to bike about best practices and tips such as what to wear when biking in winter and what to look out for when cycling. \Biking in an urban area re-quires cyclists to be alert, Mr. Patchan said, because ""it can be like an obstacle course"" -- cars, pedestrians, grates, uneven pavement, debris. \MOVEPGH, the city's transportation plan, identifies areas where bike lanes and bike trails can be installed. The long-term plan for the property along the Allegheny River calls for a trail that would run parallel to the rail lines from the Strip District to Highland Park. \Mr. Patchan said future education campaigns will focus on reminding drivers that cyclists are allowed on the streets and why cyclists do the things they do. \For example, Mr. Patchan said, when a cyclist is taking up a whole lane, he isn't doing it ""out of spite"" -- there could be dirt, gravel, a sewer grate or parked cars within the ""door zone"" that force the cyclist to the middle of the lane to ride safely. \Almost all cyclists are motorists, so cyclists understand why motorists are doing what they're doing, but not all motorists routinely ride bikes, so cyclists' behavior can be confounding. \Mr. Patchan said he hopes the education campaign can ""mitigate any conflict between people."" \For people who may be impatient with cyclists, Mr. Patchan reminds them that cycling in the city is still a relatively new thing, and as more people ride bikes and bicycling becomes a mainstream transportation choice, cyclists will see less tension, frustration and anger from some motorists. \""I'm not convinced that the comments section in news outlets reflect the majority"" of drivers' opinions, he said. \PENNSYLVANIA BIKE LAWS PASSED IN APRIL \Clearance -- Drivers must pass bikes to the left and give a minimum of 4 feet of clearance ""at a careful and prudent speed."" If they cannot do so safely, they must wait to pass. \""Right hooks"" prohibited -- Drivers cannot make sudden right turns into the path of cyclists. \Ride on the right -- Bicyclists must ride in the right lane ""or as close as practicable to the right-hand curb or edge of the roadway,"" unless surface conditions are unsafe. \Crossing the line -- Drivers may cross the center line when passing a cyclist if there is no oncoming traffic."
509,"Cyclists captured Pittsburgh's attention this summer after two bicyclists were killed and one was gravely injured in hit-and-runs and another was brutally attacked. Another cyclist was injured on Tuesday after being sideswiped by a driver who fled the scene. In comments on news websites, letters to the editor, tweets and Facebook posts, Pittsburghers offered their opinions on cyclists, drivers and the rules of the road. \Some of those comments make it sound as though the world contains only two kinds of people: bicyclists and drivers. \Some criticized cyclists for zipping through stop signs or red lights and otherwise failing to follow the law. Cyclists and their advocates lamented distracted drivers and speeding cars making the roads unsafe for cyclists, motorists and pedestrians alike. \Scott Bricker, executive director of Bike Pittsburgh, said some drivers view cyclists as just another obstacle -- ""the equivalent of a moving pothole."" \""We're not being seen as human beings just trying to get where we're going,"" he said. \And more often than not, cyclists are also drivers. \Last year, Bike Pittsburgh sent a survey to its 1,700 members. Of the 600 who responded, 90 percent said they own and drive vehicles, meaning that they have driver's licenses, pay fees to register their vehicles and chip in for the gas tax, all of which help fund road and bridge improvements. \""The whole idea that it's us versus them is completely unfounded,"" Mr. Bricker said. ""Most people who ride bikes also drive cars. We're multi-modal people."" \Law and enforcement \In a September letter to the editor printed in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, one woman asked ""if there are any rules for bikes riding on bridges."" \She said in the letter that because no car was on her left, she was able to allow the cyclist to travel on her right unharmed. \""If there had been a car on our left,"" she concluded, ""an accident might have happened."" \Bridges are just like any other roadway, and a statewide law that took effect in April requires motorists who pass cyclists to give them at least 4 feet of buffer space. If they cannot do so safely, they must wait to pass. \The law also prohibits what bicyclists call the ""right hook"" -- a vehicle making a sudden right turn directly in the path of a cyclist. \Stephen Patchan, Pittsburgh's bike-pedestrian coordinator, called the 4-foot passing buffer ""a very important law,"" noting that its intent is for motorists to slow down, evaluate their options and pass cyclists at a safe distance. \""Safety on our roadways is generally increased when people move slower,"" he said. \Mr. Bricker, who said he's been accused of being a militant cyclist, said he only wants drivers to share the road with bicyclists. \""We're not going to have a car-free city,"" he said. ""And I'm not pushing for that."" \He said cyclists have as much right to the road as drivers do, and he just wants ""an environment where everyone riding a bike feels safe."" \Mr. Bricker said a law that bans text messaging while driving, which took effect in March, was a good step in preventing distracted driving, but he said he'd like to see a ban on handheld cell phones as well. \""Put your phone away while you're driving,"" he said.

Mr. Bricker hopes that Mr. Flucke soon will be able to share his expertise with Pittsburgh police. \Mr. Flucke teaches a two-day course that begins with taking officers on a bike ride. \""Who wants to work with a cop who learned how to shoot a gun by watching a video?"" he said. \Getting officers on a bike gives them some perspective and shows them that ""just because you're on a bike in traffic doesn't mean you're an idiot,"" Mr. Flucke said. \On the second day of the training, he has officers walk through crosswalks so they know how dangerous it can be to cross a street. \""If you're not stopping for a cop in uniform legally and safely crossing a crosswalk, I'm sure you're not stopping for my kid,"" Mr. Flucke said. \He said few officers would say they got into law enforcement ""to make the world a better place for pedestrians and cyclists,"" but most officers would say that traffic control is part of their responsibility, and the key is ensuring officers understand that ""traffic"" includes pedestrians and cyclists. \Mr. Flucke said that people depend on officers to manage the safety of bicyclists and pedestrians, but officers often aren't given the appropriate training to deal with crashes and other safety issues involving bicyclists and pedestrians. \""They already know how to be cops,"" Mr. Flucke said. ""They know how to enforce laws. \""They all got into law enforcement to help people. We haven't given them the tools they need to help pedestrians and cyclists."" \He said more laws aren't necessary -- officers just need to enforce the laws that, when broken, lead to the majority of crashes, such as speeding, running stop signs, drunken and distracted driving, and not stopping for pedestrians in crosswalks. \""Pedestrians and bicyclists become invisible if you're not looking for them,"" Mr. Flucke said. \Bill Nesper, vice president of programs for the League of American Bicyclists, said encouraging targeted enforcement of bad drivers is important and giving officers the appropriate training is the best way to ensure that happens. \Of course, drivers aren't the only ones at fault -- when cyclists and pedestrians break laws or behave unpredictably, that, too, can lead to accidents. \Mr. Flucke said one of the biggest mistakes cyclists make is riding contrary to the flow of traffic, contributing to one-third of cycling crashes. Riding a bike at night without lights and reflectors is another no-no, but police rarely cite cyclists for riding without lights. \""If you can't see them, you can't yield to them,"" Mr. Flucke said. \Bike Pittsburgh recognizes the danger of riding without lights and, in the past year, the organization has given out nearly 400 bike lights. \Mr. Flucke also isn't a proponent of what's called the ""Idaho stop"" -- when cyclists treat stop signs as yield signs and red lights as stop signs. It's been legal for cyclists to do that in Idaho since the 1980s, but it's illegal elsewhere, including Pennsylvania. \The Idaho stop law \Mr. Patchan also isn't a fan of the Idaho stop law. \""No matter what you're doing -- driving, biking, walking -- if you do something unanticipated, then you're decreasing your safety and you're decreasing other people's safety,"" he said. \""Somehow, the message has gotten out there that bicyclists don't need to follow the rules of the road,"" Mr. Flucke said.

It's been legal for cyclists to do that in Idaho since the 1980s, but it's illegal elsewhere, including Pennsylvania. \Mr. Patchan also isn't a fan of the Idaho stop law. \""No matter what you're doing -- driving, biking, walking -- if you do something unanticipated, then you're decreasing your safety and you're decreasing other people's safety,"" he said. \""Somehow, the message has gotten out there that bicyclists don't need to follow the rules of the road,"" Mr. Flucke said. But by Pennsylvania statute, bicycles are vehicles, so cyclists are supposed to follow the same rules as drivers. \But the Idaho stop law works in Idaho. That state's Ada County -- where Boise sits -- has a silver bicycle-friendliness designation from the League of American Bicyclists. Pittsburgh is one step below at a bronze designation. There are three levels above silver -- gold, platinum and diamond. \Matt Edmond, a senior transportation planner with the Ada County Highway District and the county's bike coordinator, said the law is sensible and a good concession for cyclists, who depend on their own power to get where they're going. \""I think unless a cyclist is doing something really flagrant, a lot of our law enforcement is reluctant to write out a $100 traffic citation for it,"" he said. \Because cyclists move more slowly than vehicles and because they have better visibility, they can see traffic at an intersection before a motorist can and so they can roll through stop signs safely. With traffic lights, Mr. Edmond said, the law allows cyclists to clear red lights ahead of vehicles. \Mr. Edmond did, however, echo Mr. Flucke's encouragement for cyclists to act like drivers. \""The more you act like a vehicle, the safer you are,"" he said. \Changing infrastructure, changing minds \Mr. Flucke, Mr. Bricker and Mr. Nesper all said infrastructure plays a big role in ensuring the safety of everyone on the roads. A lot of Pittsburgh's suburbs -- especially sprawling communities such as Cranberry, Robinson, North Huntingdon and Bethel Park -- aren't developed for bikes or pedestrians. \""If you don't own a car there, good luck to you,"" Mr. Bricker said. \Most of those communities have few or no sidewalks. Mr. Flucke said crashes are significantly reduced in areas that have sidewalks. \Pittsburgh has made ""significant strides"" in the past five to 10 years in improving infrastructure to accommodate cyclists, Mr. Patchan said. \The city has installed bike lanes and shared-lane markings all over the city, but Mr. Patchan noted that the more ""substantial"" the on-street infrastructure, the more bicyclists will use it. \The city has about 35 miles of on-street bike lanes and sharrows -- markings that indicate lanes should be shared by both vehicles and bicycles -- and 20 miles of separated pathways, Mr. Patchan said. \Sharrows will increase the number of cyclists on the road, but painted bike lanes -- or better yet, physically separated bike lanes -- will draw even more people to use bikes to get to work and to go shopping. \Mr. Nesper agreed. \""In the best cities in the country, you're seeing these separated facilities,"" he said. \The other Pittsburgh initiative is ""to make sure that everyone who uses this public right of way ... knows their responsibilities to maintain the highest level of safety for everyone,"" Mr. Patchan said. \The city partners with Bike Pittsburgh to inform people who want to bike about best practices and tips such as what to wear when biking in winter and what to look out for when cycling. \Riding a bike in an urban area requires cyclists to be alert, Mr. Patchan said, because ""it can be like an obstacle course"" -- cars, other cyclists, pedestrians, grates, uneven pavement, debris. \MOVEPGH, the city's transportation plan, identifies areas where bike lanes and bike trails can be installed. The long-term plan for the property along the Allegheny River calls for a trail that would run parallel to the rail lines from the Strip District to Highland Park. \Mr. Patchan said future education campaigns will focus on reminding drivers that cyclists are allowed on the streets and why cyclists do the things they do. \For example, Mr. Patchan said, when a cyclist is taking up a whole lane, he isn't doing it ""out of spite"" -- there could be dirt, gravel, a sewer grate or parked cars within the ""door zone"" that force the cyclist to the middle of the lane to ride safely. \Almost all cyclists are motorists, so cyclists understand why motorists are doing what they're doing, but not all motorists routinely ride bikes, so cyclists' behavior can be confounding. \Mr. Patchan said he hopes the education campaign can ""mitigate any conflict between people."" \For people who may be impatient with cyclists, Mr. Patchan reminds them that cycling in the city is still a relatively new thing, and as more people ride bikes and bicycling becomes a mainstream transportation choice, cyclists will see less tension, frustration and anger from some motorists. \""I'm not convinced that the comments section in news outlets reflect the majority"" of drivers' opinions, he said. \Pennsylvania bike laws passed in April \* Clearance -- Drivers must pass bikes to the left and give a minimum of four feet of clearance ""at a careful and prudent speed."" If they cannot do so safely, they must wait to pass. \* ""Right hooks"" prohibited -- Drivers cannot make sudden right turns into the path of cyclists. \* Ride on the right -- Bicyclists must ride in the right lane ""or as close as practicable to the right-hand curb or edge of the roadway,"" unless surface conditions are unsafe. \* Crossing the line -- Drivers may cross the center line when passing a cyclist if there is no oncoming traffic."
512,"Bill Wade/Post-Gazette\Pennsylvania bike laws passed in April\Clearance -- Drivers must pass bikes to the left and give a minimum of 4 feet of clearance ""at a careful and prudent speed."" If they cannot do so safely, they must wait to pass.\""Right hooks"" prohibited -- Drivers cannot make sudden right turns into the path of cyclists.\Ride on the right -- Bicyclists must ride in the right lane ""or as close as practicable to the right-hand curb or edge of the roadway,"" unless surface conditions are unsafe.\Crossing the line -- Drivers may cross the center line when passing a cyclist if there is no oncoming traffic.\Cyclists captured Pittsburgh's attention this summer after two bicyclists were killed and one was gravely injured in hit-and-runs and another was brutally attacked. Another cyclist recently was injured after being sideswiped by a driver who fled the scene. In comments on news websites, letters to the editor, tweets and Facebook posts, Pittsburghers offered their opinions on cyclists, drivers and the rules of the road.\Some of those comments make it sound as though the world contains only two kinds of people: bicyclists and drivers.\Some criticized cyclists for zipping through stop signs or red lights and otherwise failing to follow the law. Cyclists and their advocates lamented distracted drivers and speeding cars making the roads unsafe for cyclists, motorists and pedestrians alike.\Scott Bricker, executive director of Bike Pittsburgh, said some drivers view cyclists as just another obstacle -- ""the equivalent of a moving pothole.""\""We're not being seen as human beings just trying to get where we're going,"" he said.\And more often than not, cyclists are also drivers.\Last year, Bike Pittsburgh sent a survey to its 1,700 members. Of the 600 who responded, 90 percent said they own and drive vehicles, meaning that they have driver's licenses, pay fees to register their vehicles and chip in for the gas tax, all of which help fund road and bridge improvements.\""The whole idea that it's us versus them is completely unfounded,"" Mr. Bricker said. ""Most people who ride bikes also drive cars. We're multi-modal people.""\Law and enforcement\In a September letter to the editor printed in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, one woman asked ""if there are any rules for bikes riding on bridges.""\She said in the letter that because no car was on her left, she was able to allow the cyclist to travel on her right unharmed.\""If there had been a car on our left,"" she concluded, ""an accident might have happened.""\Bridges are just like any other roadway, and a statewide law that took effect in April requires motorists who pass cyclists to give them at least 4 feet of buffer space. If they cannot do so safely, they must wait to pass.\The law also prohibits what bicyclists call the ""right hook"" -- a vehicle making a sudden right turn directly in the path of a cyclist.\Stephen Patchan, Pittsburgh's bike-pedestrian coordinator, called the 4-foot passing buffer ""a very important law,"" noting that its intent is for motorists to slow down, evaluate their options and pass cyclists at a safe distance.\""Safety on our roadways is generally increased when people move slower,"" he said.\Mr. Bricker, who said he's been accused of being a militant cyclist, said he only wants drivers to share the road with bicyclists.\""We're not going to have a car-free city,"" he said. ""And I'm not pushing for that.""\He said cyclists have as much right to the road as drivers do, and he just wants ""an environment where everyone riding a bike feels safe.""\Mr. Bricker said a law that bans text messaging while driving, which took effect in March, was a good step in preventing distracted driving, but he said he'd like to see a ban on handheld cell phones as well.\""Put your phone away while you're driving,"" he said. ""It's not that important.""\Bike Pittsburgh recently submitted a proposal to Pittsburgh police for a program that would give officers more training on traffic laws and how to better enforce those laws.\Peter Flucke, president and founder of We Bike, Etc., is a former law enforcement officer who created one of the first police bicycle patrols in Minnesota.\He now lives in Green Bay, Wis., and travels around the country to train local police forces on bicycle and pedestrian safety. Mr. Bricker hopes that Mr. Flucke soon will be able to share his expertise with Pittsburgh police. \Mr. Flucke teaches a two-day course that begins with taking officers on a bike ride.\""Who wants to work with a cop who learned how to shoot a gun by watching a video?"" he said.\Getting officers on a bike gives them some perspective and shows them that ""just because you're on a bike in traffic doesn't mean you're an idiot,"" Mr. Flucke said.\On the second day of the training, he has officers walk through crosswalks so they know how dangerous it can be to cross a street.\""If you're not stopping for a cop in uniform legally and safely crossing a crosswalk, I'm sure you're not stopping for my kid,"" Mr. Flucke said.\He said few officers would say they got into law enforcement ""to make the world a better place for pedestrians and cyclists,"" but most officers would say that traffic control is part of their responsibility, and the key is ensuring officers understand that ""traffic"" includes pedestrians and cyclists.\Mr. Flucke said that people depend on officers to manage the safety of bicyclists and pedestrians, but officers often aren't given the appropriate training to deal with crashes and other safety issues involving bicyclists and pedestrians.\""They already know how to be cops,"" Mr. Flucke said. ""They know how to enforce laws.\""They all got into law enforcement to help people. We haven't given them the tools they need to help pedestrians and cyclists.""\He said more laws aren't necessary -- officers just need to enforce the laws that, when broken, lead to the majority of crashes, such as speeding, running stop signs, drunken and distracted driving, and not stopping for pedestrians in crosswalks.\""Pedestrians and bicyclists become invisible if you're not looking for them,"" Mr. Flucke said.\Bill Nesper, vice president of programs for the League of American Bicyclists, said encouraging targeted enforcement of bad drivers is important and giving officers the appropriate training is the best way to ensure that happens.\Of course, drivers aren't the only ones at fault -- when cyclists and pedestrians break laws or behave unpredictably, that, too, can lead to accidents.\Mr. Flucke said one of the biggest mistakes cyclists make is riding contrary to the flow of traffic, contributing to one-third of cycling crashes.

The all-time recorded peak was in 1959, with 40,000 cases.\In Allegheny County, the incidence has almost quadrupled: 201 cases so far this year compared with 51 cases in all of 2011. Patients have ranged from babies to those in their 70s, but most have been 12 or 13.\Megan Casey, nurse epidemiologist at the Allegheny County Health Department, said the local incidence peaked in June; the number of cases showing up now are back to normal levels. No one has died, she said, although seven have been hospitalized.\""We don't really know why the numbers jumped or why they're fading out again,"" Ms. Casey said.\At least one study, in California, suggests that the vaccine's effectiveness is waning in three years time -- a shorter duration than many doctors thought. The same vaccine has been given since 1995; it is considered safer than the earlier version that had side effects.\Other possible causes for the increase include better detection and reporting or a mutation of the pertussis bacteria.\The disease is marked by violent, uncontrollable coughing that makes it hard to breath. When the sufferer takes a gulp of air it sounds like a ""whoop.""\The common treatment is antibiotics. Left untreated, it can last four to 12 weeks.\Pertussis is highly contagious, so the county requires all children to be vaccinated before they begin school. It is most dangerous to infants who have not yet been immunized. Last month, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta recommended booster shots for all pregnant women, as well as all family members and caregivers who spend time with babies.\Whooping cough is also more dangerous for older adults, who tend to have other complications.\Even with immunization, whooping cough remains common in the U.S. The CDC says outbreaks tend to occur every three to six years, although the last peak year was only two years ago, with more than 27,000 cases reported nationally. Chances are the incidence was higher, however, because symptoms mimic those of other illnesses, such as colds and flu.\""This pattern is not completely understood,"" the CDC website says, ""but that's why it's important that everyone get vaccinated. If it weren't for vaccines, we'd see many more cases of whooping cough.""\The immunization schedule for children calls for the DTaP shot (diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis) at 2, 4 and 6 months, 15 to 18 months and 4 to 6 years, with a booster shot, or Tdap, at 11 or 12 years.\Allegheny County used to offer free vaccinations for all children, but last month the health department stopped including those with insurance. Ms. Casey said there was no connection to the epidemic, which began long before that policy change.\If you insist on sticking with your underperforming, overpriced Medicare Advantage plan, the federal government has some advice for you:\Please reconsider.\For the first time since 1997, when Medicare Part C, or Medicare Advantage, came on the market via private insurers, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, is trying to push seniors out of badly rated plans and into better ones.\It's doing so via letters sent to 525,000 or so beneficiaries who subscribe to 26 Advantage plans or drug plans, telling them that, ""You are currently enrolled in [a plan] that has been rated 'poor' or 'below average' for at least the last three years"" by way of Medicare's five-star rating system.\""We encourage you to compare this plan to other options in your area and decide if it is still the right choice for you.""\Two of those ""poor"" or ""below average"" plans are offered in Pennsylvania, the Medicare Rx Rewards plan offered through Wellpoint Inc. and UnitedHealthcare MedicareComplete offered by UnitedHealth Group.\Medicare Rx is offered in West Virginia as well, while WellCare Value, sold by Wellcare Of Ohio, is also on the list.\Medicare officials also have warned the poorly performing plans that they could be cancelled in the future, though the agency has no timetable for such a move.\""We are giving them a chance to correct deficiencies"" in the plans, Medicare spokeswoman Isabella Leung said. ""We don't have a hard date as to when [the plans might be canceled]. ... We don't want to disrupt coverage for seniors, obviously.""\If the seniors who subscribe don't switch to another, better-rated Medicare Advantage plan by Dec. 7 -- which is the end of the annual ""open enrollment"" period, during which seniors may tweak their health coverage -- they still will be able to do so throughout 2013, Ms. Leung said.\That's a perk, if you could call it such, that most seniors don't have. Typically, a choice of plan must be set by the end of the enrollment period and is locked in for the following year.\The other exception is for those who want to enroll in a top-rated five-star plan, who likewise may enroll throughout the year.\(Medicare also recently announced it would be extending the enrollment period for seniors in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and elsewhere still dealing with the effects of Superstorm Sandy.)\Insurers say they are on board with quality-measurement initiatives, but believe it's ""premature"" to send letters to seniors and threaten plans with cancelation.\""We strongly support the goal of recognizing and rewarding quality,"" said Robert Zirkelbach of America's Health Insurance Plans, a trade group representing health carriers.\But, ""The question becomes, how do you measure and what are you measuring?"" he said.\For example, among its more than four dozen performance and quality metrics, Medicaid seeks to measure things such as patient experience, overall satisfaction, how well the physicians followed up with the patient.\While much of the star-rating system is based on claims, cost and outcomes data, patients' answers to more subjective satisfaction-related survey questions are ""impacted by more than just their Medicare Advantage plans,"" Mr. Zirkelbach.\Insurer concerns aside, Medicare seems committed to weeding out the lower-quality plans.\Those who visit the medicare.gov website will find that if they search for the plans available in their area, the low-rated ones are marked with a red and black caution sign, warning potential subscribers.\And while the Medicare website allows visitors, with a click of a mouse, to apply for a plan online, that option has been disabled for the low-rated plans, meaning a potential subscriber would have to contact the insurer directly.\About 14.5 million people -- or about 30 percent of all Medicare beneficiaries -- will be buying Medicare plans through private insurers in 2013. The star-rating system began in 2008, and starting this year Medicare plans can receive bonus payments from CMS for having highly rated plans."

Pennsylvanians should open their constitution and seek to do away with the state Senate, according to independent senatorial candidate Dennis Baylor.
\
""I think it's time ... to sit down and have a constitutional convention,"" Baylor told The REPUBLICAN & Herald editorial board Oct. 10.
\
Baylor, seeking the 29th District seat held by the late Sen. James J. Rhoades, said he was ""dumbfounded"" by the news Rhoades died after a three-car crash near Brodheadsville on Oct. 17.
\
After briefly suspending his campaign -- Democratic candidate Peter J. Symons did the same -- Baylor is again calling attention to issues facing the state, such as an unfair tax system, diminishing local control and a spiraling economy.
\
Baylor said the poor national economy is the only thing voters are really thinking about right now.
\
""I really think people are going to visibly suffer,"" he said when discussing fuel prices and property tax burdens.
\
Baylor said a projected deficit in this year's state budget could be corrected by eliminating wasteful spending, particularly earmarks.
\
""You could easily identify $6 billion you could cut right now,"" he said.
\
To further assist those facing tough financial times, Baylor said property tax assessments should be eliminated.
\
""It's a really difficult system to manage,"" Baylor said. As part of his tax plan, the longer one resides in a community, the less property tax burdens would be.
\
""Your longevity should have some value,"" he said.
\
Baylor also called for extending rate caps on electricity prices, which are set to expire in 2009 and 2010. Electric rates are projected to skyrocket by as much as 30 percent.
\
""Some things by their very nature can't be made competitive,"" Baylor said of electricity deregulation in the 1990s, which critics said has done little to open up competition.
\
Baylor, who said he's never had a credit card or home mortgage after building his house by hand, said debt is a primary factor for the current economic climate.
\
While he supports tax credits for alternative energy projects, he said government money shouldn't solely fund such projects. In a free market, business owners need to go out on a limb and see which projects work, he said.
\
""Let people take the risk,"" Baylor said, also voicing support for increased natural gas use in place of foreign oil.
\
Much like state Rep. Tim Seip, D-125, Baylor supports a pay-as-you-go system for interstate highways.
\
He said paying for the miles you drive could be a fair way to generate much-needed infrastructure repair funds, although he strongly opposes tolling any highways.
\
""I'm opposed to tolling a particular road because of the economic impact it would have on that particular area,"" Baylor said. ""We have a system right now that tolls every road in the commonwealth. It's called the gas tax.""
\
He also said previous plans to lease the Pennsylvania Turnpike appear to be dead, but acknowledged many road repair projects are waiting in queue because of diminished funding.
\
""I think the people of Pennsylvania are grown up enough to recognize that taxes are a necessary evil if we're going to live in a regulated society,"" Baylor said.
\
Sticking with his mantra of smaller government, Baylor said the Agriculture, Communities and Rural Environment law, which established statewide farming guidelines, puts too much power in the hands of those in Harrisburg.
\
""There are a lot of problems that you can't manage centrally in Harrisburg ... Things like sewage sludge should be left up to the municipalities,"" Baylor said.
\
He also voiced strong opposition for the recently passed statewide smoking ban, arguing that if cigarette smoke is too dangerous, then big, gas-guzzling vehicles like the Hummer should also be banned because of environmental effects.

WASHINGTON -- Americans drove 9.6 billion fewer miles in May compared with a year earlier, according to a report Monday from the Federal Highway Administration.
\
""We have seen the longest decline in vehicular miles traveled since we started collecting this data,"" U.S. Transportation Secretary Mary Peters said.
\
Vehicle miles traveled on all U.S. roads fell 3.7 percent to 254.7 billion in May from a year earlier, the Federal Highway Administration said in the report. Driving decreased in all five regions for which the agency tallies results, led by a 4.5 percent drop in the northcentral U.S. It was the least travel for the month since 2003.
\
""Four dollars per gallon may have been the trigger point we've been looking for,"" said Kenneth McGill, managing director for travel and tourism at consulting firm Global Insight Inc. in Lexington, Mass. ""It's interesting to see Americans finally reacting to the price of gasoline by rationing consumption.""
\
The decline puts the country on track for the first annual downturn since 1980. The last one, which followed the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan and the taking hostage of U.S. Embassy personnel in Iran, was like the current one marked by rising fuel prices and a weak economy.
\
The report adds to evidence of a slowing U.S. economy already beset by the worst housing market since the Great Depression. Gasoline at U.S. pumps averaged as high as $4.11 this month before slipping to $3.96 Sunday, according to motoring group AAA. Spending more on fuel leaves consumers with less for other goods and services.
\
""It's not only not a good summer, but probably not a good fall,"" said Dennis Forst, a hotel and casino analyst with KeyBanc Capital Markets in El Segundo, Calif., ""and there's a big question mark in 2009 also about the state of domestic travel and domestic spending.""
\
As a result of the drop in gasoline usage, the federal highway trust fund -- which relies on per-gallon taxes that don't rise with the price of fuel -- faces a multibillion dollar shortfall next year, down from a surplus of more than $10 billion just three years ago.
\
No one expects traffic volume to bounce back anytime soon, if ever.
\
But the drop was not unforeseen. In February, the Bush administration forecast a $3.2 billion shortfall in the trust fund for fiscal year 2009.
\
Yesterday, transportation officials revised that number to $3.1 billion, despite logging a $1.5 billion decline in receipts.
\
""We've been spending more slowly than we contemplated when we put the budget together,"" Peters said.
\
The transportation secretary said in a statement yesterday that the drop in driving miles demonstrates that the federal gas tax is no longer sufficient to finance the nation's transportation infrastructure.
\
She plans today to propose policies that will include a ""more focused federal role"" and a movement away from the gas tax.
\
""We must embrace more sustainable funding sources for highways and bridges through more sustainable and effective ways such as congestion pricing and private activity bonds,"" Peters said.
\
In addition to a reduction in driving, rising gas prices are cited for a soaring use of public transportation, said Virginia Miller, spokeswoman for the American Public Transit Association, a private trade group.
\
Usage jumped in the first three months of the year by 88 million trips from a year ago, for a total of 2.6 billion, according to the most recent figures available from the APTA.
\
""It does seem that we are on track to beat last year's record (public transportation) ridership,"" Miller said, noting that the 2007 tally of 10.3 billion public transit trips was a 50-year high.
\
Some of the most dramatic increases occurred in the light rail systems in Baltimore, Minneapolis and St. Louis, the commuter rails of Seattle and Harrisburg, the buses of San Antonio and Denver, and the subways and elevated rails of and Boston.
\
The Boston Globe reported Monday that the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority broke a ridership record of 375 million passengers in fiscal year 2008, which is 21 million more than the prior year.
\
Other commuters, like Eric Creese, a senior database administrator in Eagan, Minn., switched to muscle power for commuting. Creese, a former triathlete, said that high gas prices inspired him to ""get back"" into biking.
\
""I asked myself, 'Why drive 150 miles a week when I can save my car, my money and do something good for my body and environment,?'"" said Creese, who said he has biked 1,000 miles to work since May and saved about $250 in gas.
\
Now Creese runs a Web site -- GasFreeCommute.com -- for bike commuters, with calculators to estimate calories burned and gasoline saved. His co-workers have logged their miles on his site, totaling 5,400 so far.
\
And if commuters really want to save money, they'll stay at home, said Chuck Wilsker, president and co-founder of The Telework Coalition. Wilsker estimates the nationwide tally of telecommuters to increase by 4 million or 5 million workers this year, from an estimated 28 million at the start of 2008.
\
""If you want to quickly reduce your commuting costs by 20 percent, leave your car at home one day a week; if you want to reduce your costs by 40%, leave your car at home two days,"" said Wilsker, who telecommutes from his suburban Maryland home to Washington.

David Ward's letter is a perfect demonstration of the kind of backward policy thinking that will only continue to lead America down the wrong path in its energy policy. Ward brings up many arguments in favor of offshore drilling, including that it will bring us much cheaper oil, that damage to the environment is not important, and that global warming does not actually exist.
\
Despite his assertions, offshore drilling will barely affect the price of oil (if at all) and will cause massive environmental damage, locally and internationally. Oil (like many products today) is traded on a world market, and any extra oil drilled here in the United States would be a drop in the bucket compared to oil from drilling giants like Russia. For years, offshore drilling has been banned for a reason, and it certainly isn't because the government hates oil companies, who managed to receive billions in tax breaks last year despite record profits.
\
The truth is simply that the age of oil is coming to an end. Maybe not next year, maybe not in 10 years, maybe not even in our lifetimes, but oil production is decreasing and demand is increasing. You can drill as much as you want, but if there's less oil coming out of Saudi Arabia, Russia and Venezuela and more oil being burned in China, India and Africa, prices will only rise, probably dramatically. Although people don't want to hear it and will deny it to the death, energy is going to get much more expensive before it gets cheaper, no matter what the politicians claim.
\
It's understandable that people want cheap energy, especially in times of economic recession like these. But shortsighted and blatantly populist policies like offshore drilling, a ""gas-tax holiday,"" and a windfall profit tax on oil companies are not the solutions to our problems. In fact, they will likely only make things worse. By artificially increasing the demand for oil (through cheaper gas, heating oil, etc.) we will only delay and worsen the inevitable price explosion, not to mention continue our pattern of reckless environmental damage. The only realistic solution to our energy problems is to rapidly introduce renewable energy sources, which would allow for a transition away from fossil fuels, rather than extending our addiction to them in the short term.
\
No one knows exactly what energy will cost in the future. Maybe energy prices will dip for a few more years, maybe they'll spike tomorrow, but until we see more investment in non-fossil fuel energy, the trend in prices will only go up. Although it won't be cheap getting there, the only way to stabilize energy costs is to invest in energy forms that cannot be depleted, such as wind, solar or other sustainable alternatives.

516," Every time you buy a gallon of gas, almost a penny of the purchase goes straight to the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission.\ Each year, Pennsylvania motorists hand over about $40 million, as they have ever since the turnpike began receiving 14 percent of a 5 1/2-cent-a-gallon state gas tax increase, which went into effect in September 1991.\ Now, the state wants to up the ante. On Thursday, the Ridge administration confirmed that it might seek legislative approval for a gas tax increase of up to 8 cents a gallon, and might appropriate 1 cent of that to the turnpike in addition to the 0.7 cents the quasi-state agency now receives.\ Some lawmakers, however, are already incensed with the way the turnpike has been spending the $155 million it has pocketed in little more than four years.\ The reason the commission got the money in the first place was to plan and begin construction of the most expensive public works project in the history of Western Pennsylvania -- the Mon-Fayette Expressway and Southern Beltway, which will cost an estimated $2.5 billion if all 88 miles are built south of Pittsburgh.\ But four years later, no major construction has started on the roadways. And the commission has spent more than $8 million on literally thousands of meetings, according to a Post-Gazette review of project documents confirmed by turnpike controller Sam Boova.\ The money went for the food, travel and lodging of turnpike employees and their highly paid consultants who've attended meetings, planning sessions and workshops, at resorts such as Seven Springs and the Lakeview Conference Center near Cheat Lake, W.Va.\ Those same officials have flown on chartered flights; run up charges on cellular phones and American Express cards; and bought flowers and souvenirs, often passed out to state legislators who attend turnpike ceremonies.\ The $8 million in expenses also doesn't include about $1 million in salaries to six retired state and federal highway officials for their part-time work as consultants on the turnpike projects.\ Critics contend that much of this spending was unnecessary or excessive. For instance, while representatives of state and federal agencies drive to meetings for the two regional projects, turnpike officials and their hired consultants fly.\ Turnpike officials say there are three reasons why so much money has been spent for travel and meetings:\ -- Federal mandates have grown more complex and extensive, requiring hearings and studies for everything from environmental impact to congestion management;\ -- The project covers a large geographic area, stretching from Pittsburgh south to the West Virginia border;\ -- And officials are working on a ""fast track"" schedule to build some sections of the highways as quickly as possible. The turnpike commission said it hopes to open the first two sections of highway in 2000 -- a 17-mile stretch of the Mon-Fayette Expressway from Interstate 70, Fallowfield, to Route 51 in Large, and an eight-mile section from Fairchance south to West Virginia.\ Some lawmakers contend, however, that these explanations just aren't sufficient. State Rep. Dave Levdansky, D-Elizabeth, who voted in favor of the gas tax now shared with the turnpike, was outraged when informed of the travel and meeting expenses for the two toll road projects.\ ""We cut business taxes and we're asked to turn around and raise gas taxes that working stiffs have to pay, so turnpike people and over-priced consultants can live high off the hog,"" he said.\ ""If I engaged in a fraction of that kind of lavish, extravagant lifestyle, I would be drummed out of office -- rightfully so.""\ Levdansky said project personnel should be reimbursed for reasonable expenses but that chartered planes and expensive meals were not in step with belt-tightening practices elsewhere in government and private business.\ ""The turnpike has no respect for frugality,"" he said. ""They don't have enough money to build the projects, but they spend on themselves like they have an unlimited pot of gold.""\ State Sen. Patrick Stapleton, D-Indiana, another past gas tax supporter, is also livid.\ ""They've taken advantage (of the gas tax) and they'll continue to do so until we make them answer to the people,"" he said. ""I'll keep fighting for them to show records, to open their books."" The Senate has failed to approve legislation that Stapleton sponsored to hold the turnpike accountable for its spending and hiring practices.\ Overseeing the activities of the turnpike are five commissioners, all of them gubernatorial appointees subject to the approval of the state Senate. They are Bradley L. Mallory, a member since January by virtue of his appointment as state transportation secretary; Robert Gleason, a Johnstown businessman; James F.\ Malone, a Pittsburgh lawyer; former Allegheny County solicitor James Dodaro; and Robert Brady, Democratic county chairman in Philadelphia. Members are appointed for four-year terms that are renewable.\ Mallory said he was unaware of how staff and consultants had been spending money for travel and expenses connected with the Mon-Fayette Expressway and the Southern Beltway.\ ""I know that because our funding is so severely constrained, we at PennDOT try to save,"" Mallory said. ""We even collect the scissors after a ribbon-cutting.""\ Mallory said he suspected that the turnpike might be more free-spending because, even though it is a quasi-state agency, it has traditionally been privately financed through tolls, not taxes.\ ""They have not been the recipient of public dollars and have a different way of doing business"" than government, he said. ""In the past, I suspect, the turnpike commission told staff and consultants to spare no expense, move heaven and earth, we want these things done.""\ John Durbin, promoted to turnpike executive director in April, said the agency had done ""an outstanding job of furthering the projects.""\ ""When we can economize, we do,"" Durbin said. ""From our perspective, we are dealing with extremely difficult projects and time-consuming requirements that eat up money. We don't do them because we want to but because we've been required by law.""\ But critics suggest the following expenses are anything but economical:\ -- The turnpike paid $1,825 to Seven Springs Resort to cover room and meal packages for five turnpike employees who attended a four-day Allegheny League of Municipalities annual conference in April. The turnpike also paid $840 to buy exhibit space to pass out expressway and beltway materials and to answer questions of public officials in attendance.\ -- Since they retired from PennDOT as a deputy secretary and as a district engineer, respectively, the turnpike has paid Dave Zazworsky $343,525 in salary and expenses, and Tom Ickes $337,660 in salary and expenses. The payments cover 35 months as special turnpike consultants through May 31. Both men, who also receive early retirement pensions from PennDOT, continue to work part time as consultants time for the turnpike, receiving up to $105,000 a year each in wages, plus expenses.\ -- Community involvement coordinator Tom Fox said the turnpike had bought mementos such as hats, key chains, shovels, mugs and paperweights to pass out to elected officials and dignitaries who attended groundbreaking and ribbon-cutting ceremonies. Gas taxes paid $63 for six potted mums for one ceremony.\ When PennDOT needed a ribbon for a ceremony marking the reopening of the Smithfield Street Bridge in Pittsburgh last November, the Pittsburgh History & Landmarks Foundation was asked to buy it. ""We can't spend one penny of taxpayer money for things like that,"" said local PennDOT spokesman Dick Skrinjar.\ -- The turnpike paid $2,559 to Marc Fruchter Aviation to charter a plane to fly six project officials from Harrisburg to the Allegheny County Airport and back for a Sept. 23, 1994, meeting.\ The turnpike commission claims that a charter plane is cheaper than USAir fares and that by flying, the top project officials can use their time for meetings instead of spending it traveling by car.\ Other charter flights and airplane rentals have cost at least $40,000. East Mall Travel of Harrisburg was paid $64,934 for flights to Pittsburgh, mostly on USAir. Many more flights by turnpike personnel were put on expense accounts. The turnpike also pays for consultants' air fare through ""direct costs"" submitted on their bills.\ ""When they travel (USAir) between Pittsburgh and Harrisburg, they pay one of the most expensive fares in the country,"" Stapleton said. Records show the turnpike paid as much as $490 for a coach class, round-trip USAir ticket to Pittsburgh.\ Turnpike officials ""don't use their own road,"" Stapleton said.\ In contrast, PennDOT and Federal Highway Administration personnel going to the same meetings for the Mon-Fayette Expressway and Southern Beltway almost always drive.\ When Kevin Mahoney, who until recently was FHWA engineer for the state's Western District, came to Pittsburgh for Mon-Fayette Expressway and Southern Beltway meetings, he picked up a compact-model ""pool"" car, left Harrisburg before 6 a.m. and drove back the same day.\ When PennDOT District 11 Engineer Henry Nutbrown goes to Harrisburg, he's on the road about 5 a.m. After his meetings, he often drives back to his Bridgeville office and works there before calling it quits for the day.\ ""It's appalling how the turnpike spends money,"" Levdansky said. ""That's the mindset over there.""\ John F. Graham, chief engineer for the turnpike, took an early pension after a 34-year engineering career with Allegheny County. He was hired by the turnpike at an annual salary of $85,000. Graham attributed high travel expenses to the fact that ""everybody's spread out,"" as well as the project's complexity.\ ""We're in Harrisburg, designing things for Pittsburgh,"" he said. ""At times, we go there, and at times, people come here to minimize costs. But the people involved have to go out into the field, and the field extends 65 miles south of Pittsburgh in some cases. Isn't travel what the turnpike is about?""\ A study completed in July by McCormick Taylor & Associates, a consulting firm, raised questions about whether the huge number of meetings was excessive. The study concluded that the meetings expedited the governmental approval process and would result in a savings of $75.4 million in construction costs if two sections of Mon-Fayette Expressway are built on schedule. But McCormick Taylor & Associates also documented that bringing key people together for so many meetings carried extra costs.\ The study, commissioned by the turnpike, PennDOT and the FHWA, estimated the project's participants had, over a four-year period, engaged in 200 weekly ""management team"" meetings, 50 monthly ""agency coordination meetings"" and nine ""executive committee"" meetings -- at a total cost of $1.4 million or an average of $5,405 per meeting.\ The study did not address whether the meetings and results could have been accomplished less expensively.\ Nor did the study address the travel expenses associated with the dozens of public meetings and hearings, or the more than 2,000 smaller meetings on such topics as design review. Nor did it address expenses for the numerous employees of the two dozen consulting firms who perform traffic counts, assess the environment, survey land or perform other field work.\ Most turnpike meetings, including high-level management team meetings where decisions are made, are closed to the public and news media."
517,"Editor's note: The writer is a Democratic candidate for state representative in the 40th District.\ State Secretary of Transportation Bradley L. Mallory, in his March 27 commentary (""We Need to Raise the Gasoline Tax""), makes an eloquent plea for the proposed increase in the gasoline tax. He accurately argues that better roads and bridges are vital to the state's economic health, also noting the lack of investment in our Pennsylvania road system.\ Clearly, public investment of any type costs money - taxpayers' money. It is unfortunate, however, that the pace has already been set by those who would not first analyze a public policy problem and then propose a solution. I am writing, of course, about the governor and the current legislative majority. Campaigns in 1994 ran on issues of overtaxation, arguing for tax rates without considering public needs, such as necessary public investment, and this rhetoric has come home to roost.\ The root difficulty is the false mantra of supply-side economics. It is a convention that proposes getting something for nothing, i.e., a free lunch. Indeed, it is an easy sell to the American electorate, but unforgiving to those who must govern. If it did work, why not cut the gasoline tax rate? According to supply-side philosophy, this would increase gas tax revenues. Why hasn't the Ridge administration suggested this? Because they know it is a bunch of garbage.\ In fact, the state of Pennsylvania is in this precarious budget position precisely because of the much-needed corporate net income tax cut. It was necessary because relative to other states, Pennsylvania had a high CNI. The state budget problem lies in the lack of planning and preparation, as well as the stark reality of losing structural tax revenues from the tax cuts.\ It is time for the voters to reconcile themselves with the hard choices that must be made in today's ""devolutionary"" environment. The devolution initiated by proud U.S. House Republicans continues to do what perspicacious policy analysts have known all along - the tax burden is shifting to the states, where the tax rates are the most regressive.\ A regressive tax accomplishes the opposite of a progressive tax. In its simplest terms, the less you make, the more you pay (as a percentage of income). It turns out that most taxes (including the gasoline tax) are regressive in nature.\ This bed was made by Gov. Ridge and the current legislative majority, and it is where they must sleep. Clearly, governing is more difficult than campaigning, a lesson often learned the hard way.\THOMAS KOVACH\ Bethel Park"
518,"
As an environmentalist, I was among the first to get a hybrid car, which helped me be among the first to admit that government-imposed fuel standards -- known as Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) -- don't work.
\
Before I bought my 2001 Toyota Prius (which gets 46 mpg), I drove my old, low-mileage Suzuki rarely because I wanted to save on gas and pollution. I opted to commute as much as possible on my bicycle, as well as ride it for pleasure. Then I picked up the Prius. Before I knew it, I seemed to be driving everywhere.
\
I was proof of economist David Greene's ""rebound effect"" -- that buyers of high-mileage vehicles drive more. With high-mileage cars, we pollute less per mile but we cancel that benefit by spending more time behind the wheel.
\
The fact is that after more than 30 years of CAFE, oil consumption, pollution and traffic congestion have soared; automakers have found ways around the tightest standards.
\
The U.S. Senate can hold CAFE hearings and chide Detroit. The president can say we'll be saved by ethanol or hydrogen. Presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain can claim that ""cap-and-trade"" systems are the answer. But all this falls apart when anyone does any real analysis of Americans' ""love affair with the automobile.""
\
We have about 226 million vehicles in this country. Will any of these efforts make families throw away the huge investments in their cars? No. But the real solution does lie with drivers; we must be pushed to realize the impact of our ""drive at the drop of a hat"" attitude.
\
We inhabitants of Earth are melting glaciers and raising sea levels at a frightening rate because we're spewing so much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The U.S. is fighting overseas, in part, because that's where the oil is. We Americans import 12.2 million barrels daily and put about 60 percent of that in our fuel tanks while we, with 5 percent of the world's population and 2.7 percent of the world's oil reserves, use 26 percent of its oil.
\
A major mitigation to all these problems is getting Americans to drive less. The way to do that is to build substitutions for driving. The way to build efficient substitutions such as mass transit and hiking and biking paths is from higher gasoline and diesel taxes.
\
The cars with the world's highest gas mileage are in Italy, a country that also has the some of the world's highest gas taxes. For decades, Europeans, overall, have used gasoline taxes to build better-developed mass transit and more bike and pedestrian trails.
\
Let's call America's higher gas tax a ""user fee."" Every fiscal quarter, the user fee should go up a dime (40 cents a year) until the fee reaches the average amount of Europe's gasoline ""user fees.""
\
This won't destroy the U.S. economy. And it requires no new bureaucracy because, after all, gas is already taxed. Revenues from this user fee should go toward construction of mass transit and hiking and biking trails, as well as a publicity campaign that connects excess driving with traffic congestion, pollution, global warming, peak oil and foreign-policy issues.
\
Drivers first will complain but will adjust. We'll walk in our own neighborhoods, rather than go for a ""mall walk."" We'll consider taking mass transit or carpooling for long commutes. When we go car shopping, we'll think, ""Gas taxes are going up. I think I'll buy a high-mileage car -- or try new technology.""
\
An incremental gasoline user fee would accomplish what CAFE hasn't been able to -- to reduce oil consumption and, hence, pollution, global warming and the $250 billion annual tab for importing oil.
\
The benefits of a healthier environment, less energy dependence and decreased congestion would be well worth the cost of the tax.

Each week, The York Dispatch will ask candidates in contested state House races a question about an issue affecting state government. Candidates are asked to respond in 125 words or less. In the 196th House District, incumbent Seth Grove faces Republican challenger Dan Bradley.
\
Week One:
\
Many York County residents are hoping the state Legislature takes action to reform the property tax system. Do you support reform? If so, what approach to reform would you support? If other taxes have to be raised to offer property tax relief, what tax/taxes should be considered? If you don't think reform is needed, why not?
\
Dan Bradley:At meetings in my district, West York, I have witnessed a free-spending attitude. Obviously, money does grow on trees in the eyes of our school directors and superintendents. This must be stopped. While local control is important, school boards should not be permitted to confiscate this ridiculous percentage of our incomes. As long as their ""keeping up with the Joneses"" view continues, we will have school boards making decisions, not based on student academic achievement, but on what neighboring districts have. Parental choice in education is the answer to high property taxes. Competition is what makes our country great. When we allow parents to make educational choices for their children, our education system will return to being the world's greatest, and at a reasonable cost.
\
Seth Grove:I fully support the elimination of school property taxes by any mechanism possible, and I would prefer a shift to a combination of sales tax and income tax. Most importantly, Pennsylvania must change the school funding formula. Growth areas like York County have lost out on the growth subsidy since 1991, when the formula was adjusted. I am the prime sponsor of legislation to reallocate all slots revenues to school property tax relief, as was promised when slots were initially considered by the Legislature. Additionally, I have co-sponsored many bills to provide significant reductions/elimination of school property taxes. Along with Rep. Miller, I also led the charge to have table games revenues designated to property tax relief, as they should have been.
\
Week Two
\
Republican state Attorney General Tom Corbett has charged 25 people in an ongoing corruption scandal. In some cases, the allegations are that the individuals misused of taxpayer-funded resources for political purposes. In other cases, staffers were allegedly given taxpayer-funded bonuses to perform campaign work. What measures would you support to ensure state legislators operate in a legal and ethical manner?
\
Bradley:The Hatch Act, passed in 1939, restricts federal employees from participating in partisan politics. A version of this law needs to be applied to state employees, specifically legislative staff. Along with a state version of the Hatch Act, we must enact term limits. The two main causes of the rampant corruption we see in our state Legislature are career politicians whose primary objective is to get re-elected and political party machines whose only role is to maintain power. Campaign reform is the final step in ending this environment of corruption. Our representatives have passed legislation designed to make re-election a given. We must level the playing field so all citizens can have a legitimate opportunity to serve the community without ""permission"" from party leadership.
\
Grove:I applaud the Attorney General for rooting out corruption in state government. Those persons found guilty of using taxpayer funds for political activities should be punished severely for such a breach of trust. Going forward, transparency and openness are key to ensuring that taxpayer funds are appropriately handled and not misused for illegal purposes. Information is power, and I believe information is the right of the people in our representative democracy. With that said, I am the prime sponsor of legislation to ensure legislators cannot work for registered lobbying firms, and I have co-sponsored numerous government reform bills, including legislation calling for a Constitutional Convention. We need leaders to set an example for the people and that leadership starts with me.
\
Week Three
\
The Pennsylvania Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this year voted to table a proposed amendment to the state constitution that would add the phrase: ""Only the union of one man and one woman shall be valid and recognized as a marriage in this Commonwealth."" Would you support such an amendment? Conversely, do you believe Pennsylvania should permit same-sex marriages?
\
Bradley:I absolutely would support such an amendment. Obviously, my support for such an amendment answers part two of the question as well.
\
Grove:Yes, I would support an amendment to the Pennsylvania constitution that would add the phrase ""Only one man and one woman shall be valid and recognized as a marriage in this Commonwealth.""
\
Week Four
\
Pennsylvania is facing a possible financial crisis in 2012 due to a spike in pension costs. Recent projections show the cost could spike from $617 million in the current fiscal year to more than $4 billion in the fiscal year that ends in June 2013. What specific measures would you take to address this problem?
\
Dan Bradley:Obviously the system must be changed. Those currently in the system have to be moved to a program that will require employee funding of their pensions, rather than a taxpayer-funded pension. The multiplier must also be reduced.
\
As for the budget shortfall that will result from this, those responsible must pay the biggest price. This means we must first look at reducing the size of the legislative staff, reducing pay for our elected officials, and holding the teachers' unions and school superintendents accountable. The taxpayers should not be held responsible for the inability of career politicians to do their job.
\
Seth Grove:First, we must ensure property owners will not bear the responsibility for funding the pension spike. I have proposed legislation to lock the school district employer contribution rate at 4% to guarantee school districts will not have to increase property taxes to fund pensions.
\
I also support legislation to create a hybrid pension plan, which would combine the current defined benefit plan with a defined contribution plan for new employees. Eventually, we may need to offer only a defined contribution plan to new employees, while ensuring proper precautions are established like base-line employer contributions to properly fund the system. We should also consider repealing the pension grabs of the last decade.
\
I am working diligently to find a tax-increase-free solution.
\
Week Five
\
Now that the federal government has rejected a proposal to place tolls on I-80, Gov. Ed Rendell has called for a special sesson to discuss transportation funding. Money from the tolls was supposed to address a backlog of bridge and highway projects across Pennsylvania. Is there a transportation funding crisis? If so, how do you think the state should address it? Would you support an increase in the gas tax? Why or why not?
\
Bradley:Maintaining our infrastructure is one of the few roles to which our government should be limited. This transportation funding crisis must be addressed, not with tax increases, but with fiscal responsibility. We must review the $5 billion PennDOT budget line by line and weed out waste. Pennsylvania provides 87 percent of the funding for public transportation. The taxpayers of Pennsylvania cannot continue to shoulder the cost of public transportation for a Philadelphia lawyer who uses SEPTA to get to work. The price to ride public transportation must increase before taxes are raised. Some are proposing tolling I-95. This is a tax increase that should be avoided. Our government is overextended. By streamlining government and returning to its limited role, we will have the funds.
\
Grove:We must look beyond the gas tax to fund vital road and bridge repairs and our mass transit system. Pennsylvania should toll Interstate 95 like surrounding states. Three other options I support for road and bridge repairs include design build, increasing private contractors for paving projects and private-public partnerships. Mass transit, specifically SEPTA and the Port Authority of Allegheny County, must be held accountable for their inefficiencies, lack of accountability, and stop the sweetheart union contracts. They eat up the bulk of mass transit funding. We must create a fairer system which supports all mass transit systems. The Legislature during the special session will be diligent in examining all options to ensure the state has the resources available to maintain its expansive transportation system.
\
Week Six
\
Gov. Ed Rendell earlier this year signed a bill that allows Pennsylvania casinos to operate table games, such as blackjack, poker, craps, baccarat and roulette. Some lawmakers want to further expand gambling. Gov. Ed Rendell earlier this year proposed allowing Pennsylvania bars and taverns to install video poker machines. Under his idea, the tax revenue from the machines would help students at the state's 14 universities and 14 community colleges pay their tuition. Some lawmakers are now proposing to use the money for the state's transportation needs. Do you believe the state should expand gambling further? If not, why not? If so, why? Where should the money be directed?
\
Grove:I do not support allowing video poker machines in bars and taverns because it will erode revenues from slot machines and table games, thus reducing the amount in the state Property Tax Relief Fund. Additionally, I am the prime sponsor of a bill that will ensure all slot revenues go to homeowners, as promised, rather than the governor's pet projects. I have also voted in favor of increasing these funds via table games in an amendment sponsored by Rep. Ron Miller. I also support an amendment proposed by Rep. Scott Perry to use some of the state drilling lease revenue for property tax relief. As seen, I have been a leader to ensure my constituents see property tax relief and I will continue to provide this leadership.
\
Bradley:History has proven that the revenues from these 'ventures' never end up where they are promised. Gambling is a very risky business (pun intended). It is especially risky for the government to be involved with it. The gambling industry has a long history of corruption and crime. I don't believe, with corruption already running rampant in Harrisburg, that adding salt to this wound would be beneficial to society. I oppose the expansion of the gambling industry. If the career politicians in Harrisburg would do their jobs, we would not be in a financial situation where we would even need to discuss gambling as a revenue option. Cut spending, streamline government, and cut spending. That is how we fix the problems.

Risks for many, rewards for few
\
Editor: While I support most of the positions that Gov. Tom Corbett has taken on other issues, I am perplexed by his unwillingness to tax the growing natural gas industry in Northeast Pennsylvania. It appears that the industry is here to stay and we can only hope that the DEP keeps on top of it.
\
Who benefits from the gas drilling locally? Those who sell or lease their property to the drillers stand to do very well. Temporarily, those renting hotel rooms or houses to gas workers benefit as do local gas stations and restaurants.
\
Who loses? The remaining residents of Northeast Pennsylvania. The gas trucks damage the roads and the wells wreak havoc on the local environment. There is a real probability that extensive fracking or drilling will contaminate the watershed in these areas. Wells, streams, lakes and rivers all will be affected and may well become undrinkable.
\
The few jobs offered by the drillers can be expected to dry up once the wells are completed as all they will require will be maintenance workers for the established wells. Are the natural gas prices in the area going to be lowered? It is expected that most of the natural gas will be exported and residents here won't reap any cost benefits from the drilling.
\
Lastly, will the negative environmental impact on the area be even greater than the damage left by the coal companies?
\
Perhaps I don't understand the issue but I don't see how the residents of this area are benefitting from this industry coming here. The profits stand to be enormous for the gas companies so why not give Pennsylvania its due? Once again I ask, why no gas tax?

\
Bag big spenders, then ponder tax
\
Editor: Before debating whether we should create a new tax on gas drawn from Pennsylvania soil, let's consider what our lawmakers do with the revenue they already have.
\
Slots were supposed to relieve school taxes but lawmakers directed a lot of it for other things like hockey rinks and baseball parks. So there's not enough money left for the schools.
\
They added table games. And don't forget the Pennsylvania Lottery for 40 years. Some states have none of that.
\
We have a state sales tax at 6 percent, personal income tax at 3.07 percent. Some states have neither. We have one toll road and they want another.
\
We receive 100 percent of the profit from every bottle of booze sold, plus the tax. Most states don't. We receive a settlement of hundreds of millions of dollars per year from the tobacco industry to supplement health care costs. They redirected some of that to unrelated projects and they're after more of it.
\
We have one of the highest taxes on gasoline but the worst roads and bridges. We have the highest cost per capita for our state Legislature.
\
Does this look like the best-run state in the country? Instead of a new tax, we should replace our entire Legislature with one much smaller, less expensive and more budget-minded.
\
Giving these elected officials billions more dollars to spend won't solve our money management problems. They'd just want more. Their big priority is to get re-elected for life.
\
After our makeover we can debate a gas tax.

Abnormal lifestyle
\
Editor: My reaction to seeing Tony Vellela's wedding announcement in The Sunday Times was a little bit different than that expressed by Wayne Wheeler and Elizabeth Brandt in March 18 letters to the editor. When I saw the announcement, I became physically ill.
\
I don't fault The Times-Tribune for running the announcement. It is, unfortunately, a reflection of the times that we live in. I lament that Mr. Vellela saw fit to submit it. It just seems as though we are being bombarded with television programs, movies, the media and announcement like this by those who seem to think that their lifestyle should somehow be condoned and accepted as normal behavior.
\
What they espouse is not natural. It is in fact, an aberration. I find their lifestyle morally reprehensible.

Happy for couple
\
Editor: I would like to extend my congratulations to Mr. Vellela and Mr. Fink on their marriage, and I wish them many more happy and loving years together.
\
I also would like to thank The Times-Tribune for doing them the honor of announcing this happy occasion to their friends and family who remain here. I hope my paper will continue to publish such announcements, and not cave in to the pressure and irrational fears of some who for some reason think that what goes on in other people's private lives is their business. It's not.
\
Marriage is symbolic of a few things: support, respect, and above all, love for one another. The ""institution of marriage"" truly has nothing to do with men or women, simply two people promising to be there for each other as family.

We are all entitled to the same legal rights and protections as Pennsylvanians and as Americans. How could this not apply to marriage as well? To say two men or two women shouldn't be allowed the same 1,100 rights, protections and benefits given to hetero couples in marriage is sad, and extremely prejudiced.

Editor: I enjoy reading Leonard Pitts (""No poll needed for civil rights,"" March 28). Even when I don't agree with him, his arguments are usually thoughtful and intelligent. He doesn't cry and carry on and throw chalk at blackboards.
\
Throughout the many centuries of human existence, the Catholic Church, Judaism, and even some secular governments have considered homosexuality a spiritual and psychological disorder. Now admittedly, this was applied with a rather broad brush, covering everything from ritual prostitution to the destructive habits of individuals to people who were simply gay.
\
And it is not exactly a key doctrine of the faith. God did not become man and the church has not preached the Gospel for 2,000 years to specifically discriminate against gays. Actually, the matter is probably as crucial to Christianity as the admonishment for women to cover their hair in church.
\
I cannot imagine what sort of damage gays could do to the institution of marriage that heterosexuals have not already done. And as Mr. Pitts points out, it's probably none of my business.

521,"Democratic Sen. Robert G. Torricelli and Republican challenger Douglas Forrester attacked each other relentlessly last night on matters of personal integrity and political ideology in the second debate of New Jersey's U.S. Senate campaign.\Forrester hammered away at the ethics controversy that has plagued Torricelli, declaring that the Democrat's reprimand by a Senate committee for taking gifts from a former campaign donor was the most important issue in the campaign.\Torricelli, mounting a vigorous counterattack, accused Forrester, who owns a pharmaceutical benefits company, of making millions of dollars by selling prescription drugs at inflated costs to consumers.\The heated debate raised the intensity level of a campaign that has drawn the attention and money of both national parties as New Jersey is one of a handful of states that will decide control of the Senate.\As he did in the first debate last week, Forrester used last night's encounter - cosponsored by The Inquirer and televised on New Jersey Network (NJN) - to highlight the ethics controversy that has clouded Torricelli's reelection hopes and made Forrester a serious challenger.\The Senate ethics committee concluded in July that Torricelli had violated Senate rules by accepting some gifts from a former campaign donor, David Chang, and then advanced Chang's business interests.\The sharp exchange between the two candidates last night was touched off by Torricelli's response to a question about whether he had accepted yet another gift - an expensive grandfather clock - from Chang.\Torricelli at first sidestepped the question, saying that the case had been concluded with the ethics committee report and that it was time to go on to other issues.\""These false and outrageous allegations were investigated and they were settled,"" Torricelli said. ""We cannot spend an entire United States Senate campaign discussing issues that have been concluded. . . . I'm going to make this campaign about issues that matter to the people in this state.""\Asked again whether he received the clock, Torricelli flatly denied it.\Forrester countered that there was no excuse for Torricelli's conduct in the case. Chang is serving an 18-month prison term for making an estimated $50,000 in illegal contributions to Torricelli's 1996 campaign and for obstruction of justice.\""The one [issue] that is most important . . . has to do with the integrity of its representation in Washington,"" Forrester said. ""Mr. Torricelli took gifts for himself, his friends, his family"" and then helped Chang's business interests.\Torricelli said Forrester was focusing on the ethics issue because he had little to offer the voters as a candidate.\""You hold on to these ethics issues like a drowning man to a life raft because if you lose that life raft you will drown in a sea of issues,"" Torricelli said.\He accused Forrester of being out of step with New Jersey's politically moderate electorate on issues such as abortion, gun control and the environment.\Torricelli's comments reflected his continuing struggle to shift the focus of the campaign from the ethics controversy onto issues that have worked to the advantage of Democratic candidates in New Jersey.\Torricelli used the abortion issue to illustrate his point, saying that his commitment to a woman's right to choose was so firm that he would not vote for a Supreme Court nominee who opposed abortion rights.\He said it would take just one more anti-abortion rights justice on the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn the Roe v. Wade decision allowing abortions.\Torricelli said that while Forrester says he is an abortion-rights advocate, he would disallow government funding for abortions even in cases of rape and incest.\Forrester said that he is an abortion-rights advocate, but that he favored parental notification for minors seeking an abortion, and opposed ""partial-birth"" abortions. He said that placed him in the political mainstream.\In his bid to counter Forrester on the ethics issue, Torricelli went after his business practices. He said a number of Forrester's government clients are prepared to drop Forrester's company or sue because they were overcharged and did not receive rebates that pharmaceutical companies had given Forrester's firm.\""You made $100 million in eight years,"" Torricelli said. ""How about if you made $90 million or $80 million and hadn't taken any rebates?""\Forrester adamantly denied the contention, saying that Torricelli was using his ""henchmen"" to persuade Democrat-controlled municipalities to make what Forrester said were unfounded allegations.\Forrester said his company operated in a highly competitive environment in which clients seek the lowest possible costs. He said those clients would have chosen other companies if his prices were not competitive.\The debate came on the same day that two polls showed Forrester with a slight lead over Torricelli. A survey by Quinnipiac University gave Forrester a lead of 4 percentage points among likely voters, while the Star-Ledger, Eagleton-Rutgers poll had Forrester up by 5 percentage points. The margin of error was 3.3 percent in the Quinnipiac poll and 4.2 percent in the Eagleton poll.\In last night's debate, Torricelli also accused Forrester of proposing to increase the gasoline tax to pay for Superfund cleanups instead of making corporate polluters responsible for the costs.\In his first misstep of the campaign, Forrester said earlier this week that it may be necessary to increase the gas tax to help pay for the cleanup of Superfund sites.\Forrester, who made his remarks in a meeting with the editorial board at the Star-Ledger of Newark, said again last night that his comment was taken out of context and that he would oppose any gas tax increase. A transcript of the interview, however, indicated that Forrester said increasing the gas tax was an option.\Torricelli has said that corporate polluters should be made to pay for the Superfund cleanups and has criticized Forrester for objecting to that idea.\Forrester accused Torricelli of ""playing on [voters] fears"" by alleging that he favored privatizing Social Security and opposed gun control and environmental improvements.\""My opponent is playing on your fears, not your hopes."" Forrester said.\Inquirer staff writer Elisa Ung contributed to this article.\Contact Tom Turcol at 856-779-3854 or tturcol@phillynews.com.\ \Senate Debate\The second debate between New Jersey's U.S. Senate candidates, Democrat Robert G. Torricelli and Republican Douglas Forrester, will be rebroadcast on New Jersey Network - the state's PBS affiliate - at noon Sunday. NJN is broadcast in Central and South Jersey over Channels 23 (Camden), 52 (Trenton), 58 (New Brunswick), and will be telecast on all New Jersey cable systems.

522,"
Large as the trade and budget deficits are on paper, they loom even larger in our consciousness. It has become a national cliche that the deficits have become so big, so complicated, so intractable that only an assembly of the wisest in the land, the National Economic Commission, can solve it. And now it looks as if they can't either, so divided are they in the face of the great intractable.
\
Rubbish. Before you succumb to budget pessimism, consider that a single action, involving a single commodity, could almost wipe out the budget deficit overnight: a $1-a-gallon gasoline tax.
\
To help you recover from the shock of $2-a-gallon gasoline (as I'll explain, shock value is one of the major advantages of this idea), consider that in real dollar terms, this is roughly what we were paying seven years ago. Moreover, with gas at $2, Americans will still be paying a half dollar less at the pump than the British, $1 less than the French and $1.50 less than the Japanese.
\
OK. I understand that the Japanese don't have to truck their goods across the Great Plains. Which is why I didn't propose a $2.50 tax to bring us up to Japan's pump price. With a $1 tax, American gas will still be 43 percent cheaper than what our toughest competitor pays.
\
Consider the advantages:
\
* The budget deficit. A $1 gas tax would cut the deficit, now about $150 billion, by $100 billion. The remaining deficit, about 1 percent of GNP, is pocket change. Moreover, the drop in interest rates that would result from so dramatic a solution to the American deficit crisis would virtually wipe out the remaining deficit - a bonus for boldness.
\
* The trade deficit. More than a quarter of our trade deficit comes from imported oil. Raise the price of oil and demand falls (the story of the '70s). And each gallon of gas conserved, Fred Bergsten points out, produces nearly a
\
dollar-for-dollar saving in the trade deficit (because at the margin the last barrel of oil burned is an imported barrel).
\
* Oil prices. One out of every six barrels of oil produced in the non- communist world ends up in our gas tanks. Doubling U.S. gas prices to lower U.S. demand would be an oil shock in reverse. It would kick OPEC just at the right time - when it is down. OPEC is already facing a large oversupply. Saudi Arabia is threatening to flood the market and drive prices down, perhaps to $5 barrels (it is now $12), if other OPEC producers don't stop cheating on their production quotas. The best way to keep the other producers cheating is to keep pressure on prices. And the sharpest way to do that is to knock down American demand.
\
The beauty of a gas tax is that it is in part self-financing. If it helps lower oil prices, part of the tax gets paid by OPEC (and other producers). If oil prices drop by say 25 percent, then 25 cents of the $1 gas tax would come out of the pockets of oil producers, which, remembering the '70s, seems only fair.
\
* National security and the environment. Our dependence on foreign oil, now 37 percent and rising, is approaching the disastrously high levels of the late 1970s. Burning gasoline is a major producer of air pollution, acid rain and greenhouse gases. Curbing demand will make us all breathe easier.
\
Now the cost. Certainly, a gas tax takes money out of consumers' pockets. But for a country with one of the lowest savings rates in the industrialized world, a rate one-fifth that of Japan, enforced savings of this kind is not a bad idea.
\
Moreover, at this point in the U.S. recovery, we cannot produce our way out of the trade deficit. We are in the middle of an export boom. We are producing at near capacity. What is driving the trade deficit is an excess of domestic demand. A good way to reduce demand and the deficit, therefore, is to shift money from the consumers' pocket to government savings (deficit reduction).
\
Raising the cost of any commodity as basic as oil would obviously have an inflationary effect. But so does the falling dollar. When Bush reiterated on Nov. 21 that he won't raise taxes, the dollar fell. And when the dollar falls, interest rates have to rise if we are to keep attracting foreign lenders.
\
A plan that would instantly abolish the deficit would increase the confidence of foreign lenders in the American economy, boost the dollar, and thus allow interest rates to come down.
\
It is a trade-off. We're increasing the price of one commodity, oil, to reduce the price of another, money. And since the effect of cheaper money (lower interest rates) would be spread everywhere - from cheaper housing to faster economic growth to easier financing of the national debt - we would be better off overall.
\
A $1 tax too radical for you? Then try 50 cents. But lance the boil and lance it now.

523,"
SHAMOKIN - Gov. Tom Wolf's proposed $30 billion budget brought local response of varying support and condemnation after he unveiled it Tuesday.
\
Cuts to property taxes and boosts to school funding caused local educators and homeowners to cheer while state congressional members and business owners are condemning the effects increased sales and income taxes will have on the state's economy.
\
Mount Carmel Superintendent Bernie Stellar called Wolf's proposal ""ambitious"" and said the changes to tax rates and school funding would greatly help the district.
\
""I've been a huge supporter of the severance tax of the gas tax and I'm very happy to see that that's possibly going to happen,"" he said. ""Any property tax relief that we could receive but yet still be sure that schools are adequately funded as well as other social programs for the county and for the disabled and the elderly, we would welcome any sort of property tax relief.""
\
Southern Columbia Superintendent Paul Caputo echoed Stellar's sentiments.
\
""The governor's budget is great for all school districts,"" he said.
\
All total, Caputo's district would experience a funding increase of $265,015 for the upcoming year under Wolf's budget.
\
""The governor's putting together a solid plan, a plan that would reverse the funding inequities we have experienced since 2011,"" Caputo said.
\
Stellar said the funding would the two biggest cost increases causing budgets to balloon: medical insurance and pension costs. Wolf's proposal includes a transfer of $1.7 billion to a fund for pension costs.
\
""They're both rising at an alarming rate so any assistance to the pension system that would reduce the local strain on school districts would be more than welcome at this point,"" he said.
\
When asked about shifting the tax burden from property taxes to increases in the income tax and sales taxes, Caputo said he was in favor of it.
\
""It shifts the burden to the people that are working and have children in school from the elderly living on fixed incomes,"" Caputo said.
\
Caputo hopes that legislators will look at Wolf's budget with an open mind.
\
""We need to have neutral bipartisan examination of the spending plan,"" the superintendent said. ""If the proposals cannot be dismissed just on their merit, then they need to be approved.""
\
State Rep. Lynda Schlegel Culver (R-108) approached the topic cautiously.
\
""This budget does a lot to help education, but we have to make sure that the money is going into our classrooms and working to keep students in Pennsylvania after graduation,"" Culver said. ""We still have to fund a $1.8 billion pension payment so we need to find a way to cover that.""
\
Troy Laudenslager, president of Line Mountain School Board and owner of several businesses, was also concerned with keeping students in the state after graduation
\
""Unfortunately, the budget proposal appears to focus more on increasing taxes and spending, rather than cutting costs and fostering an environment which promotes business growth and development,"" Laudenslager said. ""Without business growth and development within our state, we won't have jobs available for our children, let alone creating new jobs to attract people to Pennsylvania.""
\
State Senator Majority Whip John Gordner (R-27) voiced his concern for the pension payments in a press release issued by Senate Republicans.
\
""It is clear the number one budget issue for the state and school districts is the increasing pension commitment, which cannot be avoided,"" he said. ""Rather than focus on tax increases, we should look at pension reform as the first step in responsible budgeting.""
\
State Rep. Kurt Masser (R-107) voiced more concern for another aspect of Wolf's plan: increases to sales and income taxes.
\
""Our economy recovery has been sluggish at best and I am concerned that these additional income and sales taxes will not only weaken our future growth but will destroy any advances we've made to this point,"" he said in a statement. ""I know I have met with people who can barely afford to heat their home or put food on the table, let alone pay taxes.""
\
Culver was also wary of the tax hikes.
\
""There are some that look at the increase of the personal income tax and say it's not so much but it's still a 21 percent increase and money that could be better used to pay for a home, heat or other necessities,"" she said. ""Any tax that we look at, we always have to be mindful of the people we are serving and how it will affect them.""
\
Wolf's proposal includes increasing sales tax from 6 to 6.6 percent and eliminating exemptions from certain industries and items, such as funeral services and caskets, cable television, waste collection, legal services and amusement and recreation businesses.
\
Laudenslager pointed out that higher taxes means ""less money in our own pockets to invest and spend where we see fit.""
\
""I have a fundamental belief that we, the people, know how to spend our money due to our local perspective compared to the government throwing billions of dollars around like candy just hoping it will make a difference to improve our lives,"" he said. ""We can't feel the pride of improving our own lives if the government takes all of our money and makes all of our decisions for us.""
\
Stacy Ososkie, public relations specialist for Knoebels, warned that implementing a tax on the amusement industry could hurt the park's competitiveness.
\
""An increase in Pennsylvania's sales tax could cause consumers to be a bit more selective when deciding when they'd like to spend their hard-earned money on in the state,"" she said. ""Thinking about out of state visitors and vacationers - and even instate for that matter - they could always choose to vacation in at state with lower taxes.""
\
James F. Kelley, owner of James Kelley Funeral Home, said he disagreed with taxing funeral services and items like caskets and burial vaults.
\
You're paying taxes through your entire lifetime and I just don't think it's right for families, loved ones to be worried about paying a tax on the services that they're selecting to bury their loved ones,"" he said. ""There's plenty of other opportunities they can go about and use instead of that.""
\
Kelley said the price tag on caskets began at around $800 and could up as high as several thousand dollars. If the 6.6 percent tax increase is implemented, consumers would pay at least $52.80 additionally for a casket.
\
""As they say, there are two things a person could always be sure of, death and taxes,"" said Kelley. ""Now there may be three: death with taxes!""

524,"CORRECTION: 2/26/2014 FOR THE RECORD (Published Wednesday, February 26, 2014 ) - The estimated three-year amount raised by Pennsylvania's impact fee on Marcellus Shale operations is about $607 million. The amount was incorrect in a graphic that accompanied a story in Sunday's edition.\2/26/2014 FOR THE RECORD (Published Wednesday, February 26, 2014 ) - The estimated three-year amount raised by Pennsylvania's impact fee on Marcellus Shale operations is about $607 million. The amount was incorrect in a graphic that accompanied a story in Sunday's edition. \Due to newsroom front-end system production difficulties the entire text could not be electronically captured for the online archive. Please see microfilm or PDF for complete chart.\As he has done during each budget address since taking office, Gov. Tom Corbett this year praised the Marcellus Shale gas industry as the linchpin of his economic and jobs policies.\Pennsylvania, he told the Legislature on Feb. 4, has become the nation's second largest producer of natural gas with the help of an impact fee that was placed on fracking wells in 2012.\""And we were smart enough to welcome that industry, and all those jobs, by working together with local governments, industry and environmental organizations to craft a responsible impact fee that by April will have generated more than $600 million in less than three years,"" Corbett added.\But that impact fee, which came when the Legislature passed Act 13 in 2012, doesn't generate the kind of revenue a severance tax would.\A third of the collected fee, about $200 million, is expected to be distributed to counties and municipalities in the next two months.\However, that is less than half the amount the state would have collected in revenue this fiscal year had the Legislature adopted a 5 percent severance tax on extracted gas as West Virginia has.\The record-high 3.1 trillion cubic feet of gas uncorked from Pennsylvania's 4,904 wells in 2013 would have generated about $425 million for the 2013-14 budget if the Legislature had copied West Virginia's gas policies, The Morning Call found after analyzing records of the state Department of Environmental Protection and the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That's because severance tax revenue fluctuates with production, meaning the more gas that's extracted, the more money that goes to the state.\""These are astronomical numbers,"" said Sen. John Yudichak, D-Luzerne, minority chairman of the Senate Environmental Resources and Energy Committee. ""They show how Act 13 and the governor's impact fee has shortchanged Pennsylvania and will cost taxpayers in the long run.""\There is new interest in the Legislature to drop the impact fee for a higher severance tax, a move supported by many of the eight Democratic gubernatorial candidates.\The governor believes the impact fee works best because it strikes a balance, said Patrick Henderson, Corbett's deputy chief of staff and energy executive. It makes companies pay for the right to operate without being overburdened, he said. Local and county governments also have grown accustomed to receiving the tax in two annual payments, he said.\""We wanted to find a medium where you raise revenue to compensate local impacts and costs that are there for municipal county governments, but avoid that tipping point where you send a signal where we discourage you from coming to Pennsylvania,"" Henderson said.\The Marcellus Shale Coalition, a gas industry trade group in Pittsburgh, did not return calls for comment.\Range Resources, a Fort Worth, Texas, corporation that pioneered fracking and has the most wells in Pennsylvania apparently sees the value in the low tax rate here.\""Targeted drilling in the Marcellus Shale play in Pennsylvania drove our production growth,"" the company stated in its 2012 Securities Exchange report. ""Most energy analysts consider the Marcellus wet and super-rich area in southwest Pennsylvania to be some of the most economical gas plays in the U.S., and Range holds a dominant position in each of these areas.""\Boom years\Pennsylvania's shale gas output is far higher than West Virginia's. About 531 billion cubic feet of shale gas was extracted from 1,091 wells in 2013, according to the latest data from the West Virginia Geological and Economic Survey.\The Marcellus Shale formation does not observe state boundaries but gas companies do, said Calvin Kent, a Marshall University accounting professor who has studied states' shale taxation polices. Companies are tapping Pennsylvania's mineral rights because of the lower tax burden as evidenced by the number of wells on the West Virginia border in Green County, he said.\But that does not mean Pennsylvania has made the right economic decision, he said.\""It seems to me the state of Pennsylvania is just overlooking an incredibly lucrative source of revenue,"" Kent said.\If a 5 percent severance tax had been in place when drilling began in 2004, Pennsylvania would have generated $841 million in revenue by this spring, The Morning Call analysis found.\West Virginia's severance gas tax revenue is tied to the prior year's well production and the nation's annual average price of natural gas per 1,000 cubic feet. All but a few of the roughly 17 states that have shale drilling charge a severance tax. Some are higher or lower than West Virginia's, which is close to the national average.\By tying the tax to production, states capture more revenue quickly. When shale gas is tapped in a horizontal drilling process known as fracking, it shoots out of the well like champagne in a shaken bottle and then tapers off. So most of the extracted gas occurs in the first months before production settles down.\Pennsylvania's impact fee does not take advantage of that high production period.\It's a 15-year fee companies pay whenever they break ground on a well, regardless of whether that well is producing gas. The fee has a sliding scale that is tied loosely to the price of natural gas in a given year. That sliding scale allows drillers to pay more in the first years and less at the back end but does not take into account how much gas is extracted.\In addition to its severance tax, West Virginia charges drillers a 4.7-cent fee for every cubic foot of gas extracted. The Morning Call did not count that as part of its calculation.\Pennsylvania's fee structure equates to an effective tax rate on the gas industry of 1.3 percent, which is one of the lowest in the nation, according to an August 2013 report by Headwaters Economics, an independent research group in Bozeman, Mont.\With natural gas deposits trapped in the Marcellus and Utica shales that lie below roughly half the state, gas production is not expected to slow. More wells are expected to come online. And Corbett wants to open the door even more with a proposal to allow companies to use fracking to extract gas beneath state parks and forests to generate $75 million in lease payments for the state.\Environmental groups oppose fracking in general and Corbett's new plan for the parks and forests because the fracking process cuts through shale with chemicals that can pollute wells and waterways.\If drilling is here to stay in Pennsylvania, a severance tax is a far better solution to a revenue shortfall than Corbett's parks and forest plan, said Adam Garber, spokesman for Penn Environment, an advocacy organization in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. It would bring in more revenue without further hurting the environment, he said.\""The severance taxes are a good solution to a bad situation,"" Garber said.\Corbett's plan to allow drilling in parks and forests would not have any additional impact on the environment, Henderson said. Companies would be able to drill from existing wells pads on private land adjacent to parks.\Missed opportunities\In 2003, one year into Gov. Ed Rendell's first term, there were no horizontal wells in Pennsylvania, DEP records show. The next year there were 14, DEP records show.\By 2010, 849 wells were producing more than 307 billion cubic feet of gas. But energy companies paid no taxes on that gas.\Rendell, a Democrat, see-sawed between his support and opposition to a severance tax. In 2008 and 2010, he allowed drilling in state forests. It was not until the Great Recession ravaged state finances that Rendell pushed hard for a severance tax.\In the final fiscal year of his term, Rendell wanted a tax and fee structure similar to West Virginia's. Democrats, who controlled the House in 2010, passed a bill with a higher tax rate than Rendell had proposed. The Republican-controlled Senate passed a lower tax bill.\During the debate, gas companies advocated for a 5 percent tax rate, which included deductions that would have reduced their payments, said Michael Wood, research director at the Pennsylvania Budget and Policy Center in Harrisburg, which advocates for taxation that raises sufficient revenue for quality public services.\Then the legislative clock ran out and no gas tax bill was passed.\Corbett, who in 2010 pledged not to raise taxes, took office in January 2011.\Senate President Joe Scarnati, R-Jefferson, came up with the impact fee that Corbett used to keep his promise, said Scarnati's chief of staff Drew Crompton.\""In some ways it's like a tax and in some ways it's not,"" Crompton said.\Gas companies won, Wood said. The companies got a lower tax than what even the companies themselves had proposed, he said.\""Funny how things work out,"" Wood said.\The impact fee remains much lower than severance taxes in Wyoming, New Mexico and Texas. But it's higher than Ohio's severance tax, according to a report by Resources for the Future, an environmental policy group.\When the impact fee went into effect in 2012, it retroactively captured revenue that was not realized under the Rendell administration. That allowed the fee to generate $204 million by spring 2012.\That first year, the fee generated 34 percent more revenue than what a West Virginia tax would have garnered based on Pennsylvania's 2011 production levels of 631 cubic feet of gas.\But as gas production increased, the fee lost value.\About $202 million in impact fees was distributed in spring 2013. That's about $28 million, or 14 percent. less than West Virginia's tax would have raised on the 1.6 trillion cubic feet of gas fracked in Pennsylvania in 2012.\The amount of unrealized revenue exploded with 2013's record-breaking production.\With so much potential revenue lost and with a gubernatorial election in November, the debate over a severance tax -- not to mention the environmental and political issues surrounding gas drilling -- is heating up again in Harrisburg.\In December, the state Supreme Court struck down the main component of Act 13: statewide zoning laws for drilling. The decision, which the court upheld Friday, ruled the law violated municipal zoning rights and the state constitutional guarantee giving citizens the right to a clean environment.\As part of its ruling, the Supreme Court sent the case back to Commonwealth Court to decide if the impact fee and other elements of Act 13 must be tossed out. With that court ruling in the wings, lawmakers are crafting severance tax bills.\Yudichak is working with soon-to-retire Sen. Ted Erickson, R-Delaware, on a bill proposing a 4 percent severance tax. In the House, Republican Reps. Gene DiGirolamo of Bucks County and Thomas Murt of Montgomery County, are proposing a 4.9 percent tax.\The severance tax debate also is a hot topic in this year's gubernatorial election. At least five of the Democratic candidates propose tax rates similar to West Virginia's.\It's not fair to compare the state's impact fee to severance taxes in other states, Henderson said. Other states do not have the high corporate tax structure of Pennsylvania, which charges companies the highest corporate net income tax in the country and also levies a separate capital stock franchise tax on companies' physical assets.\""Our view is someone has to bear in mind other taxes,"" he said.\But, the amount of money the state is collecting in business taxes is dropping due in part to the $1.2 billion in business tax cuts Corbett and the Legislature have adopted since 2011-12.\The amount of tax money -- including corporate net-income, capital stock and other business taxes -- the state has collected from gas industry companies dropped 40 percent between 2011 and 2013 to about $265 million, state Revenue Department records show.\One reason for the decrease is that corporate net-income tax is paid only by companies that incorporate as a ""corporation."" Companies registered as a limited liability or subsidiary pay the smaller personal income tax.\In 2008, the Revenue Department identified 317 corporations in the shale gas industry. Five years later, there were 240 corporations.\During that same time, the number of gas-related companies paying the personal income tax in Pennsylvania rose by more than a quarter to 792.\It's not clear from Revenue Department records whether those companies changed corporate status to secure a lower tax because names are not included in the report.\sesack@mcall.com\717-783-7305\Credit: Steve Esack Of The Morning Call\Credit: Steve Esack Of The Morning Call"

Why apologies
\
aren't necessary
\
To the Editor:
\
Thank you for the common-sense editorial, ""No apologies: Congress needn't say ""we're sorry for slavery.' ""
\
These types of apologies can indeed be the foundations of future racial extortion schemes and even possible monetary reparations for black Americans and other aggrieved groups. The compulsion to take and humiliate only grows stronger the more the leaders of our race-hustling industry take and humiliate.
\
Is it any wonder why our Democrat-controlled Congress has approval ratings in the single digits? They put off debates and solutions on the issues of oil and the economy, but they take the time for this useless liberal posturing and then take a five-week paid vacation.
\
Is it now morning in America for black people because of this apology? Are our inner cities safer, the schools better, and poverty ended? And I guess it's a coincidence that this groveling takes place a few months before an important election. Now blacks know that the Great White Fathers and Mothers of our big government plantation truly care for them. It's a combination of Western-Christian moralizing and what appears to be a uniquely white impulse to abandon healthy group loyalties (and common sense) that can result in acts of racial altruism that are simply astounding.
\
We hear ad nauseam that whites profited from slavery. But 650,000 whites died because of slavery and another half a million were maimed. The present-day equivalent would be 6 million killed and 5 million wounded. One white person was killed for every slave that was freed. Poor Irish immigrants were conscripted into the Army -- at the same time they were being discriminated against because of their Catholic faith -- and forced to places like Fredricksburg, where they marched to their deaths beneath the guns of their own cousins in Georgia's Irish brigades.
\
If we are responsible for the deeds of our ancestors, shouldn't we also compensate the descendents of those who fell, ending slavery? There were hundreds of thousands of white widows and orphans who lost everything when their husbands and sons did not come marching home to take in the crops.
\
Once again, it should be obvious by now that white liberals do not want closure and racial healing; they are determined to keep the wounds festering in order to maintain their hold on the monolithic black vote. Republicans were the party of Lincoln and abolition. Our ancestors broke the chains off the feet of black Americans, and today we are still trying to tear down the chains of government dependence that Democrats have wrapped around the minds of too many black people.

Look for age of oil
\
to come to an end
\
To the Editor:
\
David Ward's letter is a perfect demonstration of the kind of backward policy thinking that will only continue to lead America down the wrong path in its energy policy. Ward brings up many arguments in favor of offshore drilling, including that it will bring us much cheaper oil, that damage to the environment is not important, and that global warming does not actually exist.
\
Despite his assertions, offshore drilling will barely affect the price of oil (if at all) and will cause massive environmental damage, locally and internationally. Oil (like many products today) is traded on a world market, and any extra oil drilled here in the United States would be a drop in the bucket compared to oil from drilling giants like Russia. For years, offshore drilling has been banned for a reason, and it certainly isn't because the government hates oil companies, who managed to receive billions in tax breaks last year despite record profits.
\
The truth is simply that the age of oil is coming to an end. Maybe not next year, maybe not in 10 years, maybe not even in our lifetimes, but oil production is decreasing and demand is increasing. You can drill as much as you want, but if there's less oil coming out of Saudi Arabia, Russia and Venezuela and more oil being burned in China, India and Africa, prices will only rise, probably dramatically. Although people don't want to hear it and will deny it to the death, energy is going to get much more expensive before it gets cheaper, no matter what the politicians claim.
\
It's understandable that people want cheap energy, especially in times of economic recession like these. But shortsighted and blatantly populist policies like offshore drilling, a ""gas-tax holiday,"" and a windfall profit tax on oil companies are not the solutions to our problems. In fact, they will likely only make things worse. By artificially increasing the demand for oil (through cheaper gas, heating oil, etc.) we will only delay and worsen the inevitable price explosion, not to mention continue our pattern of reckless environmental damage. The only realistic solution to our energy problems is to rapidly introduce renewable energy sources, which would allow for a transition away from fossil fuels, rather than extending our addiction to them in the short term.
\
No one knows exactly what energy will cost in the future. Maybe energy prices will dip for a few more years, maybe they'll spike tomorrow, but until we see more investment in non-fossil fuel energy, the trend in prices will only go up. Although it won't be cheap getting there, the only way to stabilize energy costs is to invest in energy forms that cannot be depleted, such as wind, solar or other sustainable alternatives.

526,"
169th House District:
\
Kate Klunk (R)
\
Gene Montanarelli (R)
\
Leroy Wentz (R)
\
Marc Woerner (R)
\
Our election page has more information about this race and the others that affect York County in 2014.
\
1. Two property tax reform bills were voted on last year in the House. House Bill 1189 from Rep. Seth Grove, R-Dover Township, gives each school district the choice to move from property tax to income and other taxes, passed the House and is awaiting approval from the Senate. House Bill 76, from Rep. Jim Cox, R-Berks County, would completely eliminate property taxes. However, the bill failed a vote in the House. Do you support either of these bills? Why or why not? If you don't support either of these bills, please explain your position on property tax reform.
\
Klunk:I support real, meaningful property tax reform for Pennsylvanians. Our school districts have a spending problem that has been created by Harrisburg and Washington. Reform must include school funding formula reform, pension reform, elimination of the prevailing wage requirement for school building projects, and the elimination of unfunded mandates. I fundamentally support House Bill 76 as a legislative mechanism to reform property taxes. However, we must ensure that HB 76 adequately replaces property tax revenue, addresses funding formula reform, and will not force consumers to purchase goods and services in neighboring states, hurting our local businesses.
\
House Bill 1189 is another legislative mechanism that can provide property tax relief by expanding the tax base to fund our schools. The bill provides local school districts the flexibility to diversify and expand their current tax base to address the needs of their local districts. HB 1189 will allow local school districts to reduce property taxes while ensuring adequate revenue to meet their school funding needs. Education is not one-size-fits-all and the school funding formula should not be either. HB 1189 allows individual school districts to establish a funding formula to best meet their local needs to educate their students without hurting homeowners.
\
Montanarelli:Considering all the factors I find myself in sympathy with the general concept of the 76s (House Bill 76 and Senate Bill 76). Half measures can't work. Bills that simply freeze taxes for people reaching 65 merely condemn them to an already high tax bill for the rest of their lives. Furthermore, the rest of the taxpayers in the school district will continue to take the brunt, which may even increase if the state doesn't come through with promised financial help. The 76's eliminate property taxes totally over the next two years with a tax-neutral shift to 1 percent increase in retail sales tax and roughly the same percentage on personal income tax. The savings will enable young families to buy homes, seniors to stay in their homes, and will ultimately enhance the economy. We have to hold our legislators' feet to the fire in order to bring about a solution to property tax reform. It is unacceptable to continue pushing this can down the road.
\
Wentz:I strongly support the need to eliminate property taxes. However, the ultimate solution must be fair to homeowners, adequately fund education and maintain local control of our children's education. We also need to ensure that this complex legislation does not cost local jobs. The ""Coalition for Fairness in Property Tax Reform,"" a collection of business organizations, has voiced strong opposition to both of these bills due to the detrimental impact on Pennsylvania employers and jobs. In their current form, I also have major concerns with both bills. I believe HB 76 fails to adequately replace the money to fund our schools. I also think it would be very detrimental to the strong retail business base that is located in our district because it proposes drastic increases to the sales tax structure and removes clothing and food exemptions. This would hurt restaurants and retailers who employee many local residents by chasing away out-of-state shoppers. Although I like that HB 1189 maintains local control of education decisions, I am very concerned with the confusing and complex tax structures that will be created as the 500 plus school districts pick and choose from the various options under that plan.
\
Woerner:I fully support HB 76 as the way to finally eliminate school property taxes for all property owners. Homeowners are not looking for more reform; they want the school tax eliminated.
\
HB 76 fully funds the schools at their current levels with annual increases based on the Consumer Price Index. Under the current structure, school taxes will continue to increase with no end in sight for property owners. Senior citizens are getting taxed out of their homes; having to make the decision to buy food and medicine or pay the school tax. Other property owners I have met in the district are struggling to make ends meet and are paying as much as $10,000 a year in school taxes.
\
HB 76 would do several things to help Pennsylvania's economy: it would boost the real estate market, allow business owners to reinvest, expand and create new jobs, and make Pennsylvania more competitive with other states. These three key components will help to get our economy moving again.
\
HB 76 has been under some of the most intense scrutiny of any legislation in recent memory, including three independent reviews, and has proven to be the only viable option to eliminate this burdensome tax.
\
2. Natural gas production from the state's Marcellus Shale formation has been a boon to gas companies who say the influx has kept prices low for consumers. In 2012, Pennsylvania enacted an impact fee on wells drilled into the shale. But analysts and groups such as the Pennsylvania Budget and Policy Center estimate the impact fee generates less revenue than a severance tax. Should natural gas drillers pay a severance tax? Or is the impact fee sufficient? Why or why not?
\
Klunk:The impact fee has generated millions of dollars for Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania is now the second largest producer of natural gas in the United States. Pennsylvania's residents are seeing the positive effects of cheap natural gas, thousands of family-sustaining jobs have been created because of natural gas drilling extraction, and the revenues from the impact fees are helping to support housing initiatives, highway and bridge improvements, and environmental programs.
\
Pennsylvania's businesses pay among the highest corporate taxes in the country, putting our state and local businesses at a competitive disadvantage. While other natural gas producing states do have a severance tax, their corporate taxes are much lower and their overall effective tax rates are lower. If we implemented a severance tax, the economic progress and development we are enjoying could slow job growth and could cause some companies to leave the state or choose to set up their businesses in other natural gas producing states. With the growing uncertainties in the world's energy markets, now is the time to promote Pennsylvania's energy potential so we can reduce our dependence on foreign sources of energy and make energy affordable for all Pennsylvanians.
\
Montanarelli:At least 36 states have imposed a severance tax on natural gas drilling companies. I support a severance tax over the impact fee. Severance taxes are based on a percentage of the volume of gas actually extracted from the shale. The fees generated are consistent, whereas the impact fee depends, partly, on the price of natural gas, which is variable. Other factors influencing the impact fee include the date the well was drilled or ceased operating and the number of wells. The severance tax seems to be a more reliable and dependable way to produce revenue.
\
Wentz:I believe we should be encouraging the safe, responsible development of our natural gas resources, which supports over 200,000 jobs in Pennsylvania. According to the most recent report, the impact fee generated $224 million from the natural gas industry. I believe the impact fee is generating significant revenue while still promoting job growth and energy independence here in Pennsylvania. In regard to the severance tax, I believe we need to look at the complete picture. Proponents of severance taxes usually try to draw comparisons to Texas. However, in doing so they usually overlook the drastic difference in other taxes and fees we impose on these companies in Pennsylvania that they do not have in Texas.
\
Woerner:Pennsylvania has jumped to number two in natural gas extraction and the Pennsylvania Utility Commission recently announced that the impact fee revenue hit record levels in 2013. The Marcellus Shale extraction operations are bringing good paying jobs and raising revenue for Pennsylvania. The severance tax fluctuates with production. The impact fee could possibly be adjusted; however, there needs to be a balance between generating the revenue for the people of Pennsylvania and welcoming business to the Commonwealth. Increasing Marcellus Shale exploration and production will help us to move toward energy independence and will continue to bring more jobs with it.
\
Pennsylvania cannot continue to further tax business owners and job creators. We have to show that Pennsylvania welcomes new and existing businesses as well as the new jobs that come with them. The impact fee is obviously having the desired effect of raising record revenues and any further taxation will result in higher natural gas prices to the consumer.
\
3. Last year, the state Legislature approved a $2.3 billion transportation bill paid for by increased motorist fines, fees, and a gas tax that made its way down to drivers in the state. Did you support the approved funding plan? Why or why not? If you did not support the funding plan, how would you have funded the necessary infrastructure repairs in Pennsylvania?
\
Klunk:I support Act 89, because I believe transportation and public safety are core functions of state government. We need to ensure the safety of drivers and passengers on Pennsylvania's roadways. Our citizens must be able to get to and from work safely, businesses need to be able to transport goods, and for interstate commerce to thrive, we must ensure that our infrastructure is properly maintained. Without action on this critical public safety issue, our citizens' lives would be in jeopardy on Pennsylvania's roadways, and our businesses would be put at a disadvantage. Throughout the Commonwealth, there are thousands of bridges that are structurally deficient and fail to meet engineering and traffic safety standards. Act 89 will provide for much needed investment in Pennsylvania's transportation system, which will help to boost our economy while also improving public safety. In addition to providing much needed repairs to Pennsylvania's roadways and bridges, Act 89 provides aid to local road project budgets and municipal police forces through annual officer and cadet training reimbursements. Act 89 also provides much needed prevailing wage reform by raising the dollar threshold for public construction projects that require the use of union-scale pay from the current $25,000 to $100,000.
\
Montanarelli:I support the transportation bill, although I wish it could have been more. However, if we continue to provide enhanced funding for transportation, then we should ultimately bring our transportation up to standard. Our roads are still run down, and bridges are in various stages of decay. In Shrewsbury, for example, PennDOT is unwilling to spend part of that $2.3 billion to properly finance the rebuilding of Exit 4. Instead they are insisting on a makeshift temporary solution that does not address the overall problem. I must also point out the dishonesty of our representatives who tried to claim that they were saving us taxes when, in fact, they knew full well the taxes they levied on the gas companies would simply be passed on to the consumers.
\
Wentz:Without quality infrastructure we cannot bring jobs to Pennsylvania and provide for the public safety of our families. However, what most people don't understand is that the recently passed gas tax will generate an additional $2.3 billion every year. This new revenue is in addition to the $6 billion dollars already provided to the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation each year to maintain our roads and bridges. In my opinion, the most pressing issue now is how to best prioritize transportation dollars to ensure they are spent wisely and not wasted on politicians' pet projects. If elected, I would support efforts to set specific guidelines on how this money can be spent so we know our most immediate highway, road and bridge needs are being addressed. I will fight for York County's fair share of transportation funding to ensure our many local road and bridge projects are fully funded. I was pleased that strong reforms of PennDOT were passed last year and will work to ensure PennDOT is held accountable.
\
Woerner:I would not have supported this additional taxation on the citizens of the 169th district. As most people in York County, I struggle to fill my vehicle with gas. These new taxes will have a negative effect on household budgets at kitchen tables all across York County.
\
Pennsylvania spends over $11 billion per year on transportation; the 11th highest amount per road mile in the country. The transportation bill forces the people of York County to subsidize mass transit in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh instead of increasing the costs to the people who actually use the services.
\
Without good infrastructure, we can't move our goods and services throughout the Commonwealth. Instead of increasing taxes, we need to target ways to reduce costs and becoming more efficient with the current funds available. We need to focus on our already existing crumbling roads and bridges and restore them to operational integrity before starting new projects.
\
As a West Manheim Township Supervisor, I have seen the impact of the prevailing wage on our local road projects. Repealing the prevailing wage would save tens of millions of dollars on infrastructure projects. Its repeal would positively affect PennDOT and every municipality all across the Commonwealth.
\
4. In January, a bill was introduced by state senators Daylin Leach and Mike Folmer that would allow the use of medical marijuana in Pennsylvania. The bill was subsequently the subject of a Senate committee hearing on the issue. Should Pennsylvania legalize medical and/or recreational marijuana? Why or why not?
\
Klunk:I oppose the legalization of recreational marijuana and any use of smoked marijuana.
\
To legalize medical marijuana in Pennsylvania, the U.S. Federal government would first need to take steps to change the current classification of marijuana as a Schedule 1 narcotic. Our local congressman, Rep. Scott Perry, is currently working on legislation to allow for certain legalization of medical marijuana. Before supporting legalization of marijuana for certain medical purposes, I would want to hear definitively from the medical community about the efficacy of such treatments and the associated risks. If the Federal government were to reclassify marijuana to recognize its potential medical uses and the medical community could provide definitive evidence of the medical benefits, I would support legalizing cannabidiol oil to treat serious medical problems. The cannabidiol oil would need to be prescribed by a doctor and would need to be in a certain form such as a pill or oil-based medicine.
\
Montanarelli:I must applaud Senators Leach and Folmer for taking a bold step in introducing a bill regarding the use of medical marijuana in our conservative Pennsylvania environment. There is sufficient anecdotal and clinical evidence to support continued research to justify its use. At least ten other states (including New York and Maryland) are examining the possibility of legalizing marijuana for medical use. I propose the decriminalization of marijuana with possession of up to one ounce being a misdemeanor subject to a fine. According to Pew Research, over 48 percent of the adult population admits to having used marijuana recreationally. While I do not support legalization of recreational marijuana for our state, I do not believe these people should be saddled with a criminal record. Clearly, there is a movement afoot to decriminalize marijuana in the United States. It would behoove us to look at existing policies and research studies and learn from those successes and failures to determine what is best for Pennsylvania.
\
Wentz:I am adamantly opposed to legalizing the recreational use of marijuana. Research shows that marijuana is a gateway drug to even more dangerous and addictive drugs. However, like many who have experienced a loved one's battle with cancer or other debilitating illness, I have compassion for that difficult and painful struggle that the advocates of medical marijuana are debating. I believe the ""medical"" issue should be decided and regulated at the federal level like all other drugs, but also believe that any medical use should not contain the ""high"" sought by recreational users.
\
Woerner:I am opposed to the recreational use of marijuana, as I believe that it is a gateway to other more serious and harmful illegal drugs. After researching cancer.gov, there have been studies that have shown that medical marijuana can be effective. Based on this research, I believe non-addictive medical marijuana in a pill form could provide benefits for the treatment of seizures and other ailments. The plant would have its medicinal properties extracted and placed into a non-addictive pill form. As with any powerful prescription medicine, there is the potential for abuse and would need to be strictly monitored with dispensing requirements.
\
5. What would be your other priorities if elected, and why should voters support you?
\
Klunk:I believe the voters of the 169th District want a state representative who will carry a message of fiscal responsibility, personal and professional integrity, and government accountability to Harrisburg. York countians are feeling the devastating effects of higher taxes (especially property taxes), the looming pension crisis, the need for more family-sustaining jobs, and the disproportionate amount of funding our local schools are receiving from the state.
\
As a member of the General Assembly, my goal is to make York County a better place to live, work, and raise a family. To accomplish this goal, I will use my proven experience, conservative Republican values, and community dedication to fight for lower taxes, more economic opportunities, and less government intrusion.
\
My experiences working as a private practice attorney, as a congressional intern for Rep. Todd Platts, and as a trusted member of President George W. Bush's National Economic Council and Communications teams have prepared me well to serve as State Representative for the 169th District. I promise to use my proven experience and will work hard to ensure our state government is efficient, fiscally responsible, and effectively addresses the needs of all taxpayers.
\
Montanarelli:As a township supervisor for the past six years, I have faced adversity. Despite sometimes being the lone dissenting voice, I was able to overcome and change how the township conducts business. We need a proven fighter to represent us, and I know that I am that person. I have learned how to get the most out of tough situations so that everyone comes away with a sense of success. I have never voted to raise taxes and the programs that I helped to put in place will ensure that my community will continue to grow and remain financially stable. Mine is a record of which I am proud. I will accomplish the same for the 169th. If I had to label myself, it would be as a pragmatist who can look at the pros and cons of all positions and proceed based on facts and not party affiliation. Elected officials need to represent their entire constituency; not just the faction that got them elected. My top priorities include property tax reform, pension reform, and term limits. I would also support licensing of general contractors to ensure quality building and repairs. I support full funding of education and existing pension plans.
\
Wentz:I decided to run for State Representative because I believe we need to elect a proven conservative who will put taxpayers first. That's why my pledge to voters is simple: I'll refuse a state pension, fight for real reforms like term limits, cut wasteful spending and uphold our pro-life and pro-Second Amendment values.
\
Long committed to public service, I began a career as a firefighter while attending Messiah College. After volunteering with the Hanover Fire Department, I served for nine years as a professional fire fighter.
\
With more than 30 years of experience as the co-owner of a small business, Office Annie, I gained valuable skills balancing budgets, controlling costs and creating jobs.
\
As the elected tax collector in Hanover, I have always focused on ""one-on-one"" public service. I streamlined my office to control costs and have always balanced my accounts to the penny.
\
My wife Ellen and I are active members of the Bethel Assembly of God Church and the Tender Care Pregnancy Center in Hanover.
\
The experience I've gained as a firefighter, small businessman and local elected official has prepared me well to fight for our conservative values and I would be honored to earn your vote.
\
Woerner:Along with eliminating school property taxes via HB76, I will work to create a stable business-friendly environment by lowering the tax burden and regulation on job creators, which will expand business and create new jobs.
\
As a homeschooling family, I understand the need for parents to have more influence on their children's education. I will support a school choice voucher initiative, giving parents the freedom to decide how their child is educated. School choice should be a basic educational right.
\
I am proudly pro-life and will always defend the rights of the unborn. As a hunter, and someone who understands the right to defend life, liberty and property, I am a steadfast supporter of the Second Amendment and a member of the NRA.
\
As a West Manheim Township Supervisor, I have cut wasteful spending and increased transparency in our local government. Through sound fiscal discipline, I have helped bring the township under budget for four straight years and saved taxpayers over 1.3 million dollars.
\
I pledge that I will not accept a taxpayer-funded pension, per diem or pay raise.
\
I will draw on my leadership experiences, principles and values to fight for and be the voice of the citizens of the 169th district.

528,"
With five people vying for the seat, the 15th Senate District race is one of the more hotly contested state races in the area.
\
Running are Republicans John McNally, Williams Seeds and Josh First, as well as a Democrats Alvin Q. Taylor and Rob Teplitz.
\
McNally, 49, is an attorney with the Harrisburg law firm Thomas, Thomas, and Hafer LLP and lives in Dauphin County. Seeds, 69, is a longtime Lower Paxton Township supervisor. First, 47, of Harrisburg is the owner of Appalachian Land and Conservation Services.
\
Whoever wins the Republican primary will meet either Taylor or Teplitz, depending on who wins the Democratic primary, in the November election.
\
Taylor, 58, has been a chaplain, a lecturer, a writer and the CEO of his own counseling service. Teplitz, 41, is the chief counsel and policy director for Auditor General Jack Wagner.
\
Whoever wins the November election will fill the seat that will be vacated by Jeffrey Piccola, who announced he won't seek re-election.
\
In York County, the district includes Conewago and Newberry townships, plus Goldsboro, Lewisberry and York Haven.
\
The York Dispatch asked the candidates the following questions.
\
1. What measures should the state Legislature take to improve Pennsylvania's economy and help create more jobs in the Commonwealth?
\
First: Reduce spending on unnecessary things.
\
Exhibit A is prevailing wage requirements, which artificially and dramatically inflate the cost of state projects like road and school construction. Those extra costs are passed to Pennsylvania taxpayers, who thereby lose tens of millions of dollars every year and see their property taxes increase.
\
Exhibit B is the unsustainable defined benefit packages that state workers and elected state officials continue to receive. New state workers and new elected officials must get the same type of 401(k) retirement fund that private workers get. Defined benefit government programs that pay out tens of millions more than they take in are obviously broken and must be altered.
\
Exhibit C is welfare fraud and abuse. The Rendell administration took great pride in increasing the number of welfare dependents; evidence suggests that those funds are being wasted. That is your money, Mr. and Mrs. Taxpayer.
\
McNally: This issue is Job 1 for the Commonwealth and the country. Legislators must create a business-friendly tax, regulatory and legal environment, focused on job creation and growth, in order to bolster the private sector in its efforts to attract companies to Pennsylvania, give life to small start-up businesses, empower entrepreneurs, and sustain ""mom and pop"" stores and restaurants. I have fought for small business and working families my entire career and will continue to do so as a state senator.
\
A business-friendly climate must include reducing the corporate net income tax, streamlining costly and burdensome regulations, and cutting red tape. We also need prevailing wage reform, continued common-sense tort reform, and workers' compensation reform. State officials must work with the federal and local governments to encourage businesses to create family-sustaining jobs. The state cannot go it alone; we must be an active partner in a larger nationwide and global strategy.
\
The government should not be competing with the private sector, but should seek opportunities to outsource public-sector functions. This will give the private sector more prospects while achieving cost-savings in government. The state needs to be more innovative in stimulating private sector innovation. We need to collaborate with the job-creators to assess and address their needs.
\
Seeds: Lower the corporate tax to become more competitive with other states. Look at tax reduction incentives statewide and on a local level to entice companies and corporations to move to our state. Eliminate school property taxes.
\
Taylor: The measures to improve the economy and create more jobs in the Commonwealth are multi-layered and are the following, summarized:
\
a) Get the national politics of disunity out of the politics of Pennsylvania. The D.C. gridlock has made our residents suffer as the governor tries to follow the lead of the national party leaders in Washington. This has a detrimental effect on the citizens of the Commonwealth.
\
b) Get a fair deal on the Marcellus Shale natural gas extraction tax. We need to represent the citizens of Pennsylvania and not be a lapdog to the Marcellus Shale industry. A win-win situation exists for all parties on this vast reserve of energy if we meet as honest brokers on behalf of the residents of Pennsylvania. Political contributions to the governor's campaign have been an economic rip-off for every citizen in Pennsylvania, with regards to the current setup and taxation.
\
Teplitz: The most important issue today is the creation and retention of high-quality, family-sustaining jobs. I will target the billions of dollars spent on so-called ""economic development"" programs, in which the state -- often unsuccessfully -- attempts to pick job-creating winners and losers. Instead, I'll fight to redirect those funds toward the creation of a better job climate overall in the Commonwealth, with strategic investments in education and training, infrastructure, transportation and tax relief.
\
To the extent that direct state financial assistance continues, I will set a priority on developing and nurturing small, locally owned businesses and using my experience from tough audits to make sure the recipients create and retain the jobs they promised -- and to make sure they pay back our money if they don't.
\
The new Marcellus Shale energy resources present a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to build an industry that will create thousands of jobs and reduce our dependence on foreign oil while at the same time help address our state's multi-billion-dollar budget deficit. Unfortunately, the politicians are letting this opportunity slip away. I will make the out-of-state gas companies pay their fair share for using our resources while maximizing the job creation possibilities that this new industry offers.
\
2. The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation can point to a large backlog of road and bridge projects across the state. How dire are Pa.'s transportation needs? And how should it fund those backlogged projects?
\
First: Pennsylvania is known as the Keystone State because of its geographically central location, connecting the Eastern Seaboard to the mid-western interior and beyond. Some of America's longest, most traveled highways pass through Pennsylvania, and our highways are critical to the success of private commerce, logistics and ordinary citizens.
\
The backlog of billions of dollars is real and must be paid off. Far too often, new road construction is treated like an economic development program, with the huge operations and maintenance costs ignored up front, yet borne on the backs of future generations. Pennsylvania must freeze new road construction until it gets a handle on fixing the roads and bridges we already have.
\
McNally: The needs are great, and they grow greater as years of neglect produce a cumulative effect. However, current revenue streams are not the automatic answer. The gas tax is the chief source of funding for roads and bridge projects, but as gas prices climb upwards of $5 a gallon, raising the gas tax now would be ill-advised and poorly timed, and would be devastating for drivers in this economy.
\
We need to reprioritize our transportation funding system to shift dollars away from failing public transit systems in Philadelphia and toward roads and bridges. I will advocate strongly for local projects instead of sending money to Philadelphia. I also support streamlining the operations and administration at PennDOT and the Turnpike Commission. While I do not see the need to toll additional roads or lease the Turnpike, I think we should continue to pursue the automation of the toll collection system to save money and look for other out-of-the-box cost-cutting solutions. The state needs to cut costs and re-prioritize so that additional dollars can be shifted toward failing roads and bridges.
\
Seeds: We in Pennsylvania experience more freeze-thaw cycles than any other state. We need to do a better job of maintaining our existing roads and bridges. We need to better prioritize our project needs and cut out ""bridges to nowhere.""
\
Too much money is going to Philadelphia and SEPTA (South-Eastern Pennsylvania Transit Authority). We need to keep more of our transportation tax dollars here in Central Pennsylvania.
\
Taylor: We need to make improvements to our roads to reflect our need to invite the motoring public and industry to travel our highways. Our highways are noted as being the worst. Therefore, you cannot have tourism and industry, if your roads are not suitable for travel. We can fund those backlogged projects by the following:
\
a) Getting a fair deal on the Marcellus Shale natural gas extraction tax.
\
b) Making adjustments to the federal fuel tax and making priority choices on those roads industry and tourists use, to cover highway improvements and maintenance.
\
c) Better usage of casino revenue funding allocations.
\
Teplitz: Our transportation and infrastructure needs are serious and urgent, with thousands of roads and bridges in poor and unsafe condition. Drilling in the Marcellus Shale, while presenting a great opportunity to create jobs, is making our problems worse.
\
Legislators often seem more concerned about who a road or bridge is named after than whether the public will be safe traveling over it. We can no longer kick this can down the road, no pun intended.
\
I know firsthand where the waste, fraud and abuse are in government programs from my experience in the Department of the Auditor General. As state senator, I will use my experience to reduce the cost of state government and direct the resulting cost savings to other areas, such as addressing this critical issue.
\
We must also make sure that state government is pro-active -- investing in quality construction and proper maintenance up front and not wasting our limited resources on unnecessary projects.
\
3. With a focus on highway safety, state government has adopted new rules for teen drivers and a texting ban for everyone in the past year. Are more measures along those lines needed? Would you support a ban on handheld cell phones? A helmet requirement for motorcyclists? Why or why not?
\
First: The nanny state model is un-American. Laws, laws and more laws that intrude deeply into individual liberty are the wrong solution sought by people who want a zero-risk society. Zero risk does not exist. Every day, free Americans make their own choices about what to eat, where to drive, and how fast to go. That's the nature of a free society.
\
Motorcyclists who decide to assume more risk for themselves by riding without a helmet are entitled to assume that risk. If texting while driving is actually demonstrated to result in statistically significant undue harm to others, then I would consider some sort of ban, but I remain concerned about the potential for creating too much law enforcement intrusion into private lives.
\
GPS units and phones are handheld, too. Will every GPS user get pulled over, with more potential consequences to follow? Is that really the America we want to live in?
\
McNally:As a father, I was happy to see these new laws enacted. I am eager to see how their implementation and enforcement progresses over time. If these measures have dramatic life-saving results, as I believe they will, I would consider other safety measures.
\
As a lawyer, I have seen the devastating after-effects of head trauma, and as a father, I always insist that my children wear bike helmets before leaving the garage on their bikes. If a bill to reinstitute the mandate for motorcycle riders to wear helmets came before me, I would support it.
\
This bill would protect not only motorcyclists but the taxpayers who bear the cost of extensive rehabilitation associated with major head injuries. But new mandates would not be my priority in office. I continue to believe we need better enforcement of the laws already on the books, such as the speeding laws.
\
Right now, the state police have a very low complement of troopers. I would prefer that they concentrate on catching speeders, unsafe drivers and violent criminals. While I would consider expanding mandates in the name of safety, we must see how our new laws play out and do a better job of enforcing existing laws.
\
Seeds: I will support a ban on handheld cell phones. Statistics show a high percentage of accidents occur because drivers are inattentive because of the use of handheld cell devices.
\
I personally would not ride a motorcycle without a helmet, but I do not believe we need a helmet requirement.
\
Taylor: Current measures are adequate and laws are improving, but 10 hours of training and community service at a medical facility as part of the driving requirements will give real-life exposure to accidents and dangers of distractions while driving.
\
No ban on handheld cells phones are needed, but training that says ""pull over, phone and prevent an accident while saving a life"" would be more practical. We have rest areas along highways and scenic areas; maybe a phone pull-off area would address our driving needs now and in the future.
\
Helmets are for safety, but as a motorcyclist myself, the freedom to ride comes with a price. Again, a personal decision each for rider.
\
Teplitz: I agree with York Rep. Eugene DePasquale that distracted driving is a critical public safety issue, and I commend him for his efforts on this issue. We must ensure that drivers are traveling safely -- for their own benefit as well as for the benefit of others. The state should review driving safety rules on an ongoing basis as new technology emerges and be prepared to adjust accordingly. Therefore, I support the recently enacted ban on texting for all drivers. I also support proposals to prohibit driving while using a handheld cell phone.
\
Although I opposed the repeal of the state's longstanding mandatory motorcycle helmet law, I am pleased that young motorcycle riders are still required to wear helmets in Pennsylvania. I appreciate the concerns of some riders about the impact of helmets on vision, hearing and comfort. However, the data clearly show that helmets prevent injuries, save lives and reduce health care costs -- and, most significantly, that injuries and fatalities have increased since the repeal.
\
4. Residents have long complained about property taxes, though in recent years, Act 1 has succeeded in stemming the rapid increase in school property taxes. Does the state need property tax reform? Why or why not? And, if so, how would you approach the issue? Should property tax relief be restricted to homesteads (a homeowner's primary place of residence) or provided for all property owners? Why?
\
First: I want to eliminate all property taxes. Property taxes have every single Pennsylvania homeowner and landowner essentially renting their property from the government, a patently unfair situation that is completely at odds with our founding constitutional principles.
\
Property taxes are used as a bottomless well by an education system unwilling or unable to change its model to fit the times and society. Older homeowners on fixed incomes have lost their homes and all their equity over a relatively small amount of owed taxes.
\
Revenue presently gained from property taxes can be made up a variety of ways, and we need to have this discussion. Options include presently untaxed sources, such as legal and architectural services, expensive clothes, non-basic foods (e.g. excluding milk, bread, cheese), etc.
\
McNally: As I am knocking on doors campaigning, many people have told me about the high tax burden they face, often being forced to choose between paying their property tax or for their heat or medicines. This is a disgrace.
\
The current property tax system is antiquated, inequitable and unforgiving for those on limited and fixed incomes. Senior citizens who have lived in their homes all their lives but who are now on fixed incomes are hurt the most by the current system.
\
I look forward to working with Rep. Seth Grove and others to enact a meaningful, comprehensive, fair and flexible plan, allowing local governments to respond to local needs. Voters also have a strong distrust of government, and they fear that local tax reform is a clever disguise for a local tax increase. I understand that fear and will work to restore faith in the system through transparency and accountability.
\
Leading by example, I released my tax returns for the past five years and will post my Senate office's government spending for all taxpayers to view. By shifting the tax burden to those most able to pay, I hope taxpayers can feel less burdened by financial pressures.
\
Seeds: The state needs property tax reform, including the elimination of school property taxes. Property tax relief should be for all properties.
\
Property taxes should only be used to pay the costs associated with access to, use of and protection of a person's property.
\
Taylor: The state does need property tax reform. With our ever-changing economy and the recession, the Commonwealth has not kept up with these changes that impact our family incomes or the new technology or different types of educational learning processes. However, with the reform, there should not come an open season on all types of new taxation upon the citizens.
\
Property tax relief should be for all property owners. With looking at new funding priorities and casino revenue and lottery, we can find ample funds in the existing budget to deal with rising property taxes. We need new leadership to think out of the box, be creative and utilize all resources in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, for the citizens of Pennsylvania, first.
\
Teplitz: The Corbett administration's draconian cuts to state funding of public education have directly led to property tax increases at the local level. I believe the Commonwealth has a responsibility to provide every child with the opportunity for a quality public education. As state senator, I will work to improve the system of funding it.
\
We must explore how to reduce our reliance on property taxes and move toward other sources of revenue. However, the complete elimination of property taxes may not be realistic. While I am open-minded about property tax reform, any change must alleviate, not exacerbate, the funding inequities in public education and must receive the support of all stakeholders.
\
I have spent most of my career promoting fiscal responsibility and exposing the waste, fraud and abuse of public funds. I will use my experience to reduce the cost of government and direct the resulting savings to other areas in order to keep your taxes as low as possible. I will also continue to fight to ensure Pennsylvania homeowners receive the property tax relief they were promised when casino gambling was legalized in Pennsylvania.
\
5. State funding for education, and especially higher education, has declined under the Corbett administration. Do you agree or disagree with the approach the administration has taken toward education funding? Explain your answer. What changes would you recommend in terms of funding education?
\
First: I concur with the Corbett administration's approach to balancing a budget that had been out of control for the previous eight years. Someone had to be the adult in Harrisburg, and Tom Corbett took on that role.
\
Higher education has increased tuition every single year for decades, usually at rates far higher than the CPI or simple inflation. That is piggish. Higher education pays administrators outrageous sums of money (usually hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, each) far beyond the actual value of their contributions to Pennsylvania, and administrative overhead and bureaucracy are rampant at every single school. Start cutting there. Something must change.
\
The education model is broken and must be reformed to fit the budget realities that taxpayers face in their lives.
\
McNally: As a parent of three young children and an advocate for the long-term benefits of early education, I would welcome the opportunity to devote more money to education. However, reality invades.
\
Pennsylvania has a balanced budget amendment, preventing us from spending more than we take in and forcing state and school districts to make tough choices. We must give school districts freedom from some of the most onerous unfunded mandates. In fostering local control, we can better empower local school boards to listen to their citizenry.
\
Act 1 prevented school districts from raising taxes above a certain limit and helped to prevent costs from being passed along from the state onto local taxpayers. I believe the closed loopholes in Act 1 will bear fruit. I see merit in Gov. Corbett's ""block grant"" approach to funding, allowing school boards to have greater flexibility in how they spend the money they receive from the state, instead of it being restricted into very strict silos.
\
I support the consolidation of administrative resources, increasing school district purchasing power through bulk purchasing, and improvements to the prevailing wage, along with pension reform and tenure changes.
\
Seeds: I agree in theory, but we must eliminate the unfunded mandates put on schools. We must change and roll back our pension system, and its escalating costs. We must explore all avenues to improve educational levels in our schools.
\
Spending more and more money on the present system has not improved our test results. Funding should not include property taxes.
\
Taylor: State funding for education has declined under Gov. Corbett's administration. I disagree with the administration's approach toward educational funding. The most important issue is education, with employment.
\
The governor's assault on education has a negative influence and domino effect on the average person in the community. Students lack prepared teachers for the global marketplace, while teachers face wage restrictions and furloughs. Jobs follow quality education; educationally struggling communities will lose good citizens. There will be more crime, and larger tax-funded prisons will be the alternatives to those business-destitute and cash-strapped communities. People want opportunity, economically stable communities and good schools to educate their families.
\
These are the largest problems facing Pennsylvania, all tied into the economy, jobs and education. Education is our best investment as citizens; we return and contribute to the community's tax base.
\
Teplitz: I am outraged by the Corbett administration's approach to education and will vigorously oppose it as state senator. Every public school should have the resources needed to provide an opportunity for the best possible education, and those resources must be viewed as what they are -- investments in our collective future, not mere expenses to be tolerated.
\
As state senator, I will improve the system of funding public education so that it is equitable, stable, fiscally responsible, accountable, transparent and in the best interest of all stakeholders. At the basic education level, Pennsylvania must focus on targeted investments in proven reforms like early childhood education, smaller class sizes, tutoring, and before- and after-school programs.
\
At the post-secondary level, we must make higher education affordable for Pennsylvania students who attend Pennsylvania schools. I will promote a program modeled after the successful HOPE Scholarship Program in Georgia, which would pay tuition at state-owned universities for all students who graduate from high school with at least a 3.0 grade point average. Students choosing to attend other colleges and universities, community colleges or vocational-technical schools would also be eligible. This would stop the ""brain drain"" problem and help keep our young people here in Pennsylvania.
\
6. Why should voters cast a vote for you on Election Day? What qualities make you best suited for the position?
\
First: First of all, I am not a lawyer. Because of my diverse work and volunteer experience, I am the most qualified of the three candidates.
\
A Penn State University degree in government, with federal government service in Washington, D.C., state government in Harrisburg, and voluntarily serving on the Dauphin County Planning Commission and chairing the Harrisburg Tree Restoration Task Force have trained me in the ways of government, so I know what needs to change.
\
My extensive private sector experience as a national nonprofit conservation leader and as a small business owner taught me what it takes to make the economy run and what government should not do. I will not take a state car, per-diems, state pension, or state health care. I am an award-winning ""hook and bullet"" land conservationist, lifelong hunter and fisherman, NRA member, and my campaign platform has been God, guns and austerity, values that Central Pennsylvania voters best relate to.
\
McNally: Southcentral Pennsylvania has always been home for me. I was educated in our schools and played team sports in our parks. Today, my wife and I want our three young children to see their future here, just as we did.
\
But for all this region has to offer, the current path and reach of government is getting in the way of job creation and prosperity. During these trying economic times and when faith in government is at an all-time low, we need a fresh voice of reason and integrity that focuses on getting Pennsylvanians back to work and restoring honor to and confidence in government.
\
I am not a politician. I am a leader. I believe elected officials must take the ""service"" in public service to heart. Pennsylvania needs leaders with the courage to make job creation a priority, demand transparency and accountability from government and change the culture at the Capitol.
\
I have never run for or held public office, but I have spent my career fighting on behalf of families and small business. It is my pledge to take that experience and provide public service that is principled, policy-based and results-oriented in a way that taxpayers win.
\
Seeds: I am the only candidate within both parties that has proven experience serving the public in areas such as budgeting, planning, zoning, public safety and transportation. I have acquired vital people skills only learned through listening to the people who elected me.
\
I am against increased taxes and legislative pay increases. I am for term limits and cutting the growth and size of government. I will work full time and have no other job. I will work for the people, not the lobbyists and special interests.
\
Taylor: Voters should vote for me because I am like them: an ordinary citizen who wants education for my children, a nice community for the taxes I pay and a good-paying job to support our families.
\
I would be in the area where they live, meeting with them as part of my plan for open government. I would be their voice on issues that concern them and their families. Voter should choose me if they want a leader who will lead as I stand up for their interests.
\
Government is local, and it is about ""We the People."" People make government work, but those candidates they choose on Election Day to represent them. So, if they want a leader who will represent them, on April 24, vote Alvin Q. Taylor, 15th District - PA Senate, No. 1 ballot position.
\
Teplitz: I have spent most of my career working with Bob Casey and Jack Wagner to protect your hard-earned tax dollars and make government programs work better. I want to take that experience to the state Senate, so I can continue fighting for my friends and neighbors in Central Pennsylvania. Every day, I'll focus on creating jobs, strengthening our schools, keeping taxes as low as possible, and bringing fundamental reforms to state government.
\
On that last point, I am the only candidate who has fought for transparency, accountability and reform in all areas of government. As state senator, I will pursue a comprehensive reform agenda including: reducing the size of the Legislature and subjecting it to annual audits; instituting non-partisan redistricting; strengthening and enforcing open records and open meeting laws; and eliminating secret, no-bid public contracts. We need to hold another state constitutional convention in order to directly involve the general public in the process of bringing these and other reforms to state government.
\
Finally, I am humbled and honored by the endorsement of York County Commissioner Doug Hoke. As state senator, I will follow his example of bipartisan leadership and tireless service for families and taxpayers in York County.

529,"
Both candidates for the 12th Legislative District support responsible unconventional gas drilling, but split on the issue of whether a severance tax should be imposed on drilling companies.
\
""Right now, all business in Pennsylvania is overtaxed,"" said incumbent Republican Daryl Metcalfe, 51, of Cranberry, who has been a member of the House of Representatives serving the Butler County district since 1999. ""The majority of the people I talk to want to see our economy improve, not to tax business out of Pennsylvania.""
\
Democratic challenger Lisa Zucco, 45, of Cranberry said, ""We should be getting our fair share in this industry and this boon to our economy that we are not realizing as every other state around us is.""
\
The state has levied a per-well impact fee since 2012, generating hundreds of millions of dollars for municipalities and state government. A severance tax levies fees on natural gas production.
\
Marcellus shale drilling has become a contentious issue in Butler County and elsewhere. Environmental groups and residents have filed appeals against several drilling sites, saying the state is not doing enough to protect the environment or the health and safety of residents.
\
""I think the majority of our citizens want energy independence, want cheaper energy, want new jobs created, and want to see that done responsibly and safely,"" Metcalfe said. He pointed to Middlesex, where township officials said property owners in 75 percent of the township have some type of lease agreement with energy companies.
\
""They want the ability to utilize their property rights,"" Metcalfe said.
\
Zucco said, ""I think we need to take advantage of natural resources in a responsible, well regulated way,"" adding, ""We should not be drilling near schools and residential developments. How near is near is something that needs to be discussed.""
\
Over the past 10 years, Metcalfe either has run unopposed or beaten opponents handily, several times outpacing them by more than a 2-1 margin. except for the May 20 primary.
\
Then, Republican challenger Gordon Marburger, ousted from the ballot because he didn't properly file paperwork with the state's Ethics Committee, waged a write-in campaign. He garnered more than 2,700 votes, while Metcalfe received 3,271, the tightest results for Metcalfe in a decade.
\
The conservative Metcalfe is well-known as being at the forefront of controversial issues. He was outspoken in his support of voter identification at polls, and fought against same-sex marriage and the state's gas tax.
\
""I think the people that really see me as controversial are those who want to get their hands deeper in the pockets of the local taxpayers,"" Metcalfe said.
\
Zucco said, ""From the thousands of people I've talked to, we've got bigger things to worry about than what I'm hearing about from the Metcalfe campaign.""
\
She noted chronic heavy congestion on Route 228 through southern Butler County is one of the issues that should get attention.
\
""The things that affect people every day are the things we care about,"" Zucco said. ""Higher property taxes, educational resources, those are the real issues people care about.""

531,"The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is sponsoring an ad on behalf of Frank Lautenberg, the Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate.\Title: ""Foot,"" a 30-second commercial that began Friday night in Philadelphia and New York television markets.\Producer: Squier Knapp & Dunn\Script: Video of a steel drum and leaking chemicals. Announcer: ""Who should pay to clean toxic waste?"" ""Sen. Frank Lautenberg wrote the law forcing corporate polluters, not New Jersey taxpayers, to pay for toxic cleanups."" Shot of Lautenberg working behind a desk, then talking to people. Switch to a still photo of GOP opponent Douglas Forrester in front of leaking orange-color fluids, then newspaper articles. ""But Doug Forrester wants taxpayers to foot the bill for cleaning up Superfund toxic-waste sites. Forrester even called for raising the gas tax on commuters to pay. Call Doug Forrester. Tell him corporate polluters, not New Jersey taxpayers, should pay for toxic waste."" The phone number 609-890-4699 (Forrester's campaign headquarters) flashes on the screen.\Accuracy: Lautenberg revamped the original Superfund law and was a major champion of a ""polluter-pays"" tax, which until 1995 levied a tax on petroleum and chemical companies. He favors reauthorization of the tax. Forrester has argued that the Superfund contains too much wasteful spending. He opposes forcing companies to pay more for pollution measures and has said the government should find another funding source. Last month, Forrester told the Newark Star-Ledger's editorial board that it may be necessary to increase the gas tax to help pay for the cleanup of Superfund sites. But he later said his comments were taken out of context and said he would oppose any gas tax increase.\Analysis: In the latest commercial in a last-minute ad blitz, Democrats are steering voters' attention toward the issues that typically favor the party in New Jersey, in this case the environment. (Lautenberg also has the endorsement of the Sierra Club, which has been running similar radio commercials on his behalf.) Since the former senator has agreed to only one televised debate, these commercials have become his major means of communicating his views to the public during his short campaign.\ \ \ \Credit: By Elisa Ung"
532," Pennsylvania's senators are unhappy with the Senate's new transportation bill, saying it under-funds Pennsylvania highways.\ ""I'm going to do everything I can to kill the bill if that's what it takes,"" said Sen. Rick Santorum.\ The bill, S.1072, would provide $9.9 billion in highway funding over six years, a 19.5 percent increase over current levels.\ But Santorum and Arlen Specter said that amounts to a cut because it fails to keep up with inflation.\ In addition, Pennsylvania would see a sharp decline in its rate of return on federal gasoline tax, from $1.20 per every tax dollar in 2004 to 97 cents in 2009. In that year, 3 cents of every dollar collected in Pennsylvania would be funneled to other states.\ Santorum acknowledged that the 120 percent was a ""very generous"" return that was unlikely to be maintained after the retirement of Rep. Bud Shuster, R-Altoona. Shuster was chairman of the powerful House Transportation Committee in 1998, when the last highway bill was written.\ But Santorum said the new formula, unveiled this week, goes too far in the other direction and would penalize the state, which struggles to maintain a highway system used to ferry goods between the Northeast and Midwest.\ ""Why have a federal gas tax if you're not going to help states maintain roads that benefit [the region and the nation]?, Santorum asked.\ The two Republican senators protested the formula in a letter Wednesday to Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.\ The committee has adopted a $311 billion bill that would guarantee every state 95 percent of the gas tax they collect, up from 90.5 percent in 1998.\ The House is pursuing a $375 billion bill, HR 3550, that includes a boost in the gas tax from 18 cents to 23 cents a gallon. In that bill, Pennsylvania would receive $10.9 billion in highway funding, a 31 percent increase over current levels.\ The House and Senate are expected to consider the bills soon despite objections from the White House, which wants to keep spending down to $247 billion over six years.\ ***"
533,"HARRISBURG -- The state Senate, which faces a gaggle of important but unresolved issues, could be really busy this week.\Or not.\Senators plan to meet Tuesday through Thursday and then bolt, not to return until the new session starts in January. They won't meet during the three-week ""lame duck"" session after the Nov. 2 election, and the 2009-10 session closes Nov. 30.\The House is due to return Nov. 8, but it may not have a lot to do unless the Senate sends some bills over this week. And there are some notable subjects still pending:\* Putting a new tax on natural gas extracted from underground Marcellus Shale. This is looking more and more unlikely, but more could be known after Gov. Ed Rendell holds a special meeting with legislators today, the Columbus Day holiday.\* Expanding the Castle Doctrine, giving a homeowner more latitude in firing a weapon at an intruder. Signs indicate the Senate will agree with a House-passed bill.\* Easing the growing problem of overcrowded prisons. This looks good also, and the fact that its sponsor is a Republican, Sen. Stewart Greenleaf from Montgomery County, doesn't hurt.\* Banning motorists from texting or talking on handheld cell phones while behind the wheel. Virtually dead.\* Doing something to ease the rapidly approaching crisis with pensions for retired state workers and public school employees. Senators are optimistic that a compromise is close, at least for reducing costs of pensions for future employees.\* Providing funds to fix more ailing roads and bridges and keep public transit running. Doesn't seem possible this year.\* Creating an independent fiscal office, as some Republican senators want to do to offset the power of the governor's budget office. The outlook for the idea is negative.\The Senate, which Republicans control 30-20, is under pressure from Democrat Rendell to work out quickly compromise legislation creating a new severance tax on Marcellus Shale natural gas. Mr. Rendell noted that an Oct. 1 deadline -- established when the 2010-11 budget was passed -- already has been missed.\But it's not a good sign that Senate GOP leaders have said ""thanks but no thanks"" to Mr. Rendell's holiday meeting today. They argue that any deal worked out today could be further refined when the Senate returns to work Tuesday morning and then voted on by senators during their afternoon session.\Two weeks ago, the Democrat-controlled House approved a severance tax of 39 cents per every 1,000 cubic feet of natural gas extracted. Critics, including Senate GOP leaders, objected that that would be the highest such tax in the country and could hurt Pennsylvania's competitiveness as a gas-producing state.\Senate leaders are thinking of a lesser tax, along the lines of the one in Arkansas -- 1.5 percent of the value of the gas at the wellhead for the first five years, rising a bit after that.\Mr. Rendell wants the Legislature to return for additional days of session, if needed, to enact the shale gas tax, which could raise $100 million or more this fiscal year. But additional session days also seem unlikely, since legislators want to go home and campaign.\Severance-tax backers note that Pennsylvania is the only shale gas-producing state that doesn't have such a tax, and say the new revenue is needed to protect the environment from drilling-related damage, repair municipal roads from damage caused by heavy drilling equipment and balance the state budget.\On a second issue, the Senate will likely vote on a House-passed bill to expand the so-called ""Castle Doctrine,"" giving homeowners a greater ability to defend their lives and property against armed intruders.\Currently, a homeowner can fire at an intruder if the homeowner is standing within the actual house, such as the living or dining room. But if he or she is in the garage, or the front or backyard, or on a porch or patio, the property owner first has to ""retreat,"" moving away from the assailant, before using deadly force.\The bill, offered by Rep. Scott Perry, R-York, would allow the homeowner to ""stand his ground"" in these ancillary areas of a house, removing the need to retreat before using force for self-protection. The bill's chances in the Senate are good.\But the forecast is much dimmer for two so-called ""distracted driving"" bills, one pertaining to junior drivers (ages 16-17), the other to adults. The bills would make it a crime to use a hand-held cell phone, or to send text messages, while operating a vehicle.\One major snag is whether such an offense should be ""primary,"" meaning a police officer could pull a motorist over if the officer sees a hand-held cell device in use, or whether it should be ""secondary,"" meaning the officer would first have to stop a driver for something else -- such as speeding or running a red light -- before adding a charge of distracted driving. There doesn't seem to be enough time to resolve this conflict before session ends.\The American Civil Liberties Union doesn't always agree with actions taken by the Republican Senate, but it likes the Greenleaf bill to ease prison overcrowding. Inmates facing less serious and nonviolent charges, such as technical violations of parole, could serve their time at alternative places, such as halfway houses.\There is general agreement that something must be done to ease overcrowded conditions in the state's 27 prisons, where the population now tops 50,000. But making it easier for inmates to have parole always carries political risks, especially if they commit another crime while on parole."

Paul Anthony Jr. stood on a factory floor in Freeland in front of a plastic grinder that he bought when starting his recycling business.
\
""It was just me and another guy,"" Anthony said.
\
In five years since then, Polymer Group of America has grown to 28 employees. A year ago, the company moved from a building with 25,000 square feet in White Haven to the former Garland factory that has 155,000 square feet.
\
PGA mainly grinds water bottles - labels, tops and all - and sells the grounds to a company that separates paper from the plastic, which is resold to food and beverage companies.
\
By the middle of next year, Anthony wants to buy a machine that washes plastic from paper, which will let him hire 15 to 20 more workers.
\
Pennsylvania's Revenue Secretary Dan Meuser visited PGA on Friday to learn about the company and talk about the importance of manufacturing in Pennsylvania.
\
Meuser said manufacturing jobs on average pay higher wages than other sectors of the economy, and when a manufacturer like Anthony hires one worker, about five more jobs start elsewhere - ""drivers, suppliers, the hoagie store,"" Meuser said.
\
He said Gov. Tom Corbett has promoted manufacturing by reducing the capital stock and franchise tax and other taxes, supporting transportation measures that provide better roads for companies like PGA, which depends on 120 trucks a day, and streamlining regulations so businesses can obtain permits in fewer days.
\
Corbett also extended tax credits for research and development and creating jobs. He exempted small business from inheritance taxes, which might help PGA because Anthony's mother owns part of the company.
\
Rather than trying to win a spending contest on education, the governor has tried to match school training with the jobs available, Meuser said. The governor's energy plan says the low cost of natural gas and other Pennsylvania fuels keeps down costs for industries from plastics to cosmetics and agriculture to pharmaceuticals, provides new life to old refineries in southeastern Pennsylvania and offers opportunities, such as vehicles powered by natural gas, to improve the environment.
\
On Friday, Corbett visited a U.S. Steel plant in Clarion, where a $500 million modernization project began four years ago, while other members of his cabinet toured manufacturers elsewhere in the state.
\
If Corbett wins re-election next month, he would continue to improve the conditions for manufacturers, ""from good to great"" in the next four years, Meuser said.
\
The governor's challenger, Democrat Tom Wolf, bought and rescued his family company, which distributed kitchen cabinets. Now the company shares profits with employees and also sells its own line of cabinets that it designs and uses companies in Pennsylvania and elsewhere in the country to manufacture.
\
Wolf puts forth a ""Made in Pennsylvania"" platform that would offer grants so college researchers can implement ideas at small businesses, encourage schools to offer industry certification programs and foster vocational and technical training that he said Corbett underfunds by 8 percent.
\
Wolf's press secretary, Jeffrey Sheridan, said Pennsylvania dropped to 47th from ninth in creating jobs in the past four years. Sheridan said Wolf also would levy a production tax on natural gas firms, which would compare to taxes in other gas-producing states such as West Virginia, but yield more than the user fee that Corbett placed on the industry. With some of the gas tax proceeds, Wolf would restore the $1 billion that Corbett removed from the state education budget after federal stimulus money dried up.
\
In Freeland, PGA takes products that one industry regards as waste and converts them to materials that another firm can use, Anthony said. He started his firm as a broker in 2006 and bought the machine that grinds bottles in 2009.
\
In the bottle industry, any bottle that falls on the floor, has a crooked label or isn't filled completely must be discarded, creating an opportunity for him.
\
All but one of the bottling plants east of Harrisburg ship wasted bottles to PGA, and Anthony seeks a deal with that firm. Pre-form bottles, ""bottle before it becomes a bottle,"" Anthony said, can be sold to companies like EAM-Mosca, which makes plastic strapping from them in the Valmont Industrial Park.
\
PGA also grinds plastic milk crates into material that gets molded into planters for nurseries and deals with plastic rolls that become the underlayer for laminate floors. ""They put a nice pretty layer on top,"" Anthony said while pointing to some of the rolls on the factory floor.
\
Anthony's father, who is deceased, once walked the same floors as an employee at Garland, a company that made stoves in Freeland from 1974 until closing in 2010.
\
Garland employed as many as 200 workers, so PGA has helped but hasn't restored completely what Freeland's economy lost.
\
Towns often don't rebound in one swoop after a plant closes, Luzerne County Manager Robert Lawton said while joining the tour of the PGA building.
\
""It's not all home runs. You need a lot of singles,"" Lawton said.

"
535," Motorists may find the high price of gasoline painful this Memorial Day weekend, but it could eventually improve their quality of life.\ After 15 months of high gasoline prices, people say they are driving less, according to surveys. If prices remain high, people also will buy smaller, more fuel-efficient cars. Together, that should lead to fewer traffic jams and accidents, cleaner air and possibly a slowing of global warming.\ The impact of higher gasoline prices, which have risen 28 cents a gallon on average since late March, illustrates an often glossed- over tradeoff in the ongoing debate about energy policy.\ Low energy prices fuel economic growth and give more people the means to drive bigger cars and enjoy the comforts of central air conditioning. By encouraging power consumption, however, low prices also make it harder to breathe, shroud skylines in smog and tie people up in traffic jams -- all factors that may be as important to quality of life as the comforts of economic well-being.\ One answer to this conundrum: Raise fuel prices to a level that better balances economic growth with environmental costs. Gasoline prices in the United States overly favor the economic side of the equation, economists say.\ While some lawmakers want to suspend all or part of the 18.4 cents a gallon federal gasoline tax this summer to give drivers a break, many economists say the gas tax should be increased instead.\ ""Overall, the benefits of cleaner air and freer-flowing traffic will exceed the costs of having to pay more for energy,"" said Ian Parry of Resources for the Future, a Washington-based policy research institute focusing on the environment and transportation.\ From an economist's viewpoint, the tax on gasoline should reflect the added costs to society from consumption of the fuel, such as health costs and time lost in traffic jams.\ Based on recent studies, Parry estimates the environmental and congestion costs combined at 84 cents to $1.12 a gallon. A $1 tax would push the current U.S. price of regular gasoline up to $2.29 a gallon.\ Politically, any change in the gas tax -- up or down -- is unlikely. Vice President Dick Cheney, head of the White House energy task force, has ruled out suspending the gas tax, noting that the revenue is needed to maintain and expand roads. The prospects for raising the tax are so slim that it isn't even part of the energy policy debate.\ Market forces are expected to keep gasoline prices up for some time, though. The nationwide average price of regular unleaded has risen to $1.69 a gallon from about $1.18 in May 1999. Prices in some parts of the country are higher.\ As a result, 52 percent of Americans are driving less to save money, according to a poll released Thursday by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press. Also, 36 percent of the respondents said they are considering buying a car that gets better gas mileage.\ The nationwide survey of 1,202 adults was conducted May 15-20 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.\ A separate poll by The Associated Press found that 23 percent of Americans are cutting back on or canceling vacations because of the higher cost of gas. That survey, of 1,008 people May 16-20, had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.\ If energy prices rise high enough, they can help drive the economy into recession, as they did in 1974.\ The price of gasoline in the United States is still lower than in Europe, Canada and Japan, all of which have higher taxes. The British pay $4.26 for a gallon of gasoline, including $3.12 a gallon in taxes."
536,"
The self-styled ``guy nobody ever heard of from a town nobody's ever seen,'' Tom Ridge of Erie, put himself on the national map last night.
\
The governor's landslide came from a record of accomplishment, a war chest fattened to a fare-thee-well by big donors, and a campaign that pummeled feeble Democrat Ivan Itkin early and often.
\
Mr. Ridge's whopping win was based more on his first-term deeds than on any blueprint for the next four years. He cited promises kept from his detailed 1994 platform, but this time, with his popularity high, he wasn't so forthcoming about his goals.
\
Based on yesterday's mandate, he has plenty of leeway to do more than ``stay the course'' on corporate tax relief and the underfunding of education and other human needs.
\
He has the political capital to take risks to solve problems. Boldness certainly won't hurt his much-discussed national prospects. (Many of the GOP governors he competes with for attention have been far bolder.) Much more important, boldness is what Pennsylvania needs to make real progress on chronic issues such as education, taxes and land use.
\
Gov. Ridge did show first-term courage on the particularly tough sell of a gas-tax hike. That was part of a transportation deal gaining more stable funding for mass transit statewide. It sure didn't seem to hurt him at the polls.
\
On the crucial issue of improving education, Mr. Ridge must not content himself with charter-school experimentation and finger-wagging at the financially pressed school systems.
\
Sloganeering and timidity aren't going to help the tens of thousands of schoolchildren getting lousy educations. Initiatives such as smaller early-grade classes and all-day kindergarten deserve state support. And if the political cost of those proven strategies is limited experimentation with school vouchers, so be it.
\
Perhaps the governor's most immediate challenge will be the potential cutoff early next year of welfare benefits to tens of thousands of poor Pennsylvanians with low skills. Working with local government and private entities, the state must ensure that anyone making a sincere but thwarted effort to find work gets a 20-hour-a-week, government-arranged ``work opportunity'' to avoid losing a welfare check. Unfortunately, some of these slots will be little more than ``make-work,'' but the alternative - wholesale loss of cash benefits - is far worse.
\
These human needs are no less important than the transportation needs for which Mr. Ridge bravely raised the gas tax by 3.5 cents a gallon. In the campaign, though, Mr. Ridge pandered to antitax sentiment by calling for a supermajority vote in the legislature to raise taxes. That implied that tax-increase votes are easy, even though - as shown by the gas-tax vote - they're difficult.
\
The responsible course is a sweeping reform of the state's tax system, famed for its lack of progressivity and for punishing the working-class and senior homeowners. An expert panel has been quietly studying this. Perhaps their postelection recommendations can embolden Mr. Ridge to push a tax-code rewrite to the fore.
\
Another chronic problem - suburban sprawl and dwindling open space - has already gotten the blue-ribbon treatment in a solid report by the 21st Century Environment Commission. In a nutshell, too much power is clenched by individual municipalities who turn their neighbors and their county governments into helpless bystanders. If Mr. Ridge starts showing leadership here, despite his closeness to the property-rights movement, it could become a major part of his legacy.
\
Backed by a landslide and popular as all get-out, Mr. Ridge has the clout to try a broader, bolder agenda this time around.

537,"The Aug. 11 letter ""High Gas Tax Feeds a Broken System"" by Nathan A. Benefield, in response to the Aug. 4 article ""Why Is Pa.'s Gas Tax So High? We've Got a Lot of Roads,"" identifies three reasons. He is correct on two of those reasons; Pennsylvania gas taxes fund mass transit operations and pay for much of the state police budget, not just roads. Prevailing wages however, are not a contributing factor.\Prevailing wages do not increase the cost of publicly funded construction projects. In those states that have repealed prevailing wage laws, the promise of lower-cost public construction projects never materialized. Casually concluding that eliminating prevailing wage requirements will automatically reduce construction costs is an out-of-touch misconception of today's economic environment.\Every segment of the economy is competing desperately for qualified workers. Allowing contractors to lower construction workers' wages in order to gain an unfair advantage over the competition will cause a race to the bottom and exacerbate the shrinking workforce crisis resulting in costlier projects, substandard workmanship and delayed completions due to a shrinking number of skilled workers in construction. States throughout the country are reporting shortages in skilled construction labor. These shortages are especially acute in states where prevailing wage laws have been repealed.\Prevailing wages create a level playing field by establishing reasonable wages and benefits for workers building our state's infrastructure projects. Without prevailing wages, unscrupulous contractors will import cheap labor and eliminate good paying jobs for the citizens of Pennsylvania, creating an environment where no one wins: not the workers, not the local contractors and, most of all, the taxpayers of Pennsylvania.\Jack Ramage\Executive Director\Master Builders' Association of Western Pennsylvania Inc.\Green Tree\The letter was also signed by Richard J.

538,"
Hailed as a landmark victory for environmentalists, a plan to preserve one million acres of New Jersey farmland, fields and forest from development for the next decade was overwhelmingly passed by the Senate and the Assembly yesterday.
\
The plan, which calls for spending $198 million each year for the next 10 years, guarantees a stable source of funding to preserve more than half of the remaining open space and farmland in New Jersey at a rate of about 100,000 acres per year. The bill also provides money to maintain historic landmarks.
\
The proposal now will go before New Jersey voters on the Nov. 3 ballot.
\
Gov. Whitman, who outlined the need for preserving open space in her inaugural address in January, labeled yesterday's passage ``one of the most important and gratifying moments'' since she took office.
\
``This is a great day for all of us, for our children and for all future New Jerseyans,'' said Whitman, who needed to win legislative approval before Aug. 3 to meet a constitutional deadline to place the proposal on the November ballot. ``Future generations will look to the passage of this resolution as one of the most important and defining events in determining the quality of life in New Jersey for the next millennium.''
\
The open-space initiative is a mixture of borrowing $100 million per year at an estimated 7.5 percent and using $98 million per year from the state's general fund. The $98 million would come from existing sales tax revenues.
\
After 10 years, general revenue funds would pay a declining amount as the series of 10 20-year bonds is paid off, ending in the year 2029.
\
In addition, local and county governments would have to support the open-space project financially.
\
The total to be spent on actual preservation is about $1.5 billion over 10 years.
\
Key ingredients in the plan include:
\
* Saving 40 percent of New Jersey's land mass through a combination of the new program and past legislative initiatives, such as the Green Acres Bond Acts.
\
* Acquiring and developing land for recreation and conservation.
\
* Preserving farmland for agriculture.
\
* Historic preservation.
\
Assemblyman Leonard Lance (R., Flemington), who sponsored the Assembly version of the bill, estimated that about $6 million per year, or $60 million over 10 years, would be allocated toward historic preservation. The remaining money would be divided evenly between farmland and open-space preservation. He said the actual breakdown of the money would be outlined in legislation that would follow voter approval.
\
Environmentalists, some of whom have been pushing for long-range open-space preservation initiatives for almost two decades, rejoiced after the Assembly's 70-3 vote, which came after the Senate's unanimous 37-0 vote.
\
``Yes!'' said Michael Catania, co-chair of the Coalition to Preserve Natural Resources, which is composed of nearly three dozen advocacy and corporation groups, as he hugged several coalition members. ``We're overwhelmed by the vote by both houses. This is the result of a 16-year effort to secure a stable source of funding to save open space. Now the effort is well on its way.''
\
Maureen Ogden, a former seven-term assemblywoman who chaired the governor's council to study open space, said New Jersey voters would get a chance to decide on ``the most important piece of environmental legislation in the past decade.''
\
``This is a momentous achievement,'' said Ogden, who tried three times unsuccesfully to push through similar legislation while she was in the Assembly from 1982 to 1996. ``We've been on a long, rocky road. It's very gratifying to finally have this.''
\
Republicans needed bipartisan support on the open-space issue because it takes three-fifths of each house, or 48 votes in the Assembly and 24 in the Senate, to put a referendum on the ballot.
\
``We recognize more than ever that our quality of life depends on the sanctity of our environment and the existence of open spaces,'' said Senate President Donald T. DiFrancesco (R., Union) as he addressed the Senate before the vote. ``As the next century begins, we now understand the need for balance between development that threatens our natural resources and the availability of recreation and convervation land.''
\
The borrowing plan to preserve open spaces was approved by the Assembly's Appropriations Committee on Monday.
\
In 1996, Whitman assembled the Governor's Council on New Jersey Outdoors to study how much land needed to be preserved, how much it would cost, and who would pay for it. In February, the council released its report and recommended that one million acres be preserved over 10 years and suggested a dozen ways to pay for it.
\
Whitman initially proposed using a gasoline tax increase to buy undeveloped land. She recommended a 5-cents-a-gallon raise to increase spending for new mass transit and highway projects and an additional 2-cents-a-gallon increase to preserve one million acres of undeveloped land over the next decade.
\
She scaled back the plan to a 4-cents-a-gallon rise in the tax over three years after Republican legislative leaders deemed the original increase too high. On Tuesday, the governor suffered another setback after Assembly Democrats banded together to oppose the gas tax altogether.
\
Environmentalists said they worked the phones after the gas tax went down in flames, fearing that support would also dwindle for open-space preservation.
\
``We called up several Democrats, and they reassured us they were still on our corner,'' Catania said. ``We didn't want the gas tax issue to spill over into open space. To our relief, it didn't.''
\
Assembly Minority Leader Joseph Doria (D., Hudson), who led the party-line opposition to the governor's gasoline tax increase, said caucus members had concerns about maintaining property that the state would acquire under the plan and how to finance such maintainence.
\
``You can't just acquire land and not take care of it,'' Doria said. ``It's not a perfect bill, but those who were opposed to it originally were convinced of its merit in terms of quality of life for the future.''

539,"
In systemwide service cuts announced Friday, NJ Transit said it planned to eliminate six trains on its Philadelphia-Atlantic City line. That would be in addition to two trains cut in January.
\
This comes less than three months after NJ Transit announced it would spend $735,000 on a consultant to study ways to increase service on the Atlantic City line.
\
And it's about four months after NJ Transit broke ground on a $40 million station to connect the Atlantic City line to the River Line, which runs between Trenton and Camden.
\
Less service? More service?
\
Even as bus and train riders fume about possible 25 percent fare hikes and widespread reductions in service, NJ Transit says it is planning for growth.
\
New executive director James Weinstein said the agency needed to invest in projects that would allow it to rebound when the economy did. Money spent on capital projects such as construction and new equipment does not come out of the operating budget, which faces a $300 million deficit next year, he said. ""I need to make sure we keep building on the innovations and ideas of the people who came before me,"" Weinstein said in an interview. ""We need to keep moving the ball forward.""
\
But it's clear that NJ Transit riders will pay more. And for now, at least, they'll get less service.
\
Gov. Christie is struggling to address a $2.2 billion deficit in the state budget this year and as much as an $11 billion gap in the budget for the fiscal year that will start July 1.
\
""I think people are going to be very angry with us,"" Weinstein said.
\
He's right about that.
\
When riders at the Cherry Hill Mall bus stop heard Friday about the plan for fare hikes and service cuts, they tallied the cost in dollars and inconvenience.
\
""It's time to get a driver's license,"" said Kelly Moulton, a 32-year-old Pennsauken resident who works at the Penneys department store at the mall. ""I take the bus to and from home.""
\
Moulton said she thought she was ""saving money and helping the environment"" by taking public transportation. ""But maybe it would be cheaper to drive,"" she said as she sat in a shelter waiting for the No. 404 to Pennsauken.
\
Nearby, Justin Mateo, 19, of Maple Shade, calculated the impact of the proposed hikes while waiting for a bus to take him to his stock supervisor job at the Wal-Mart on Route 38 in Cherry Hill.
\
""It's going to make people budget money even more,"" he said. ""I don't like it.""
\
Frankie James, 54, of Camden, had just dropped his car off at the nearby Midas repair shop and was waiting for a bus home. ""You pay more and get less,"" said James, a truck driver. ""That's terrible.""
\
The increases will take effect May 1 if the NJ Transit board approves them. Public hearings on the proposals will be held this month at 11 sites statewide, and the changes could be altered as a result.
\
Much of the anger has been directed at Christie's unwillingness to spread the pain to motorists by increasing the fuel tax or highway tolls.
\
""Raising fees on transit riders while avoiding raising fees on car or truck drivers is an unbalanced and inequitable way to fund our transportation network,"" said Zoe Baldwin of the pro-transit Tri-State Transportation Campaign. ""Transit fares have increased 68 percent over the past decade, far outpacing the increases for drivers.""
\
The advocacy group calculated a bus-dependent family of three would pay $414 more annually with the fare increases. By comparison, a 10-cent-a-gallon increase in the gas tax, currently 14.5 cents, would cost a typical household $93 a year, the group said.
\
New Jersey's gas tax is the third-lowest in the nation, and many lawmakers, including some members of Christie's Republican Party, have urged the governor to raise a tax that hasn't been increased since 1988.
\
Christie has said higher gas taxes and increased tolls are not an option. ""I respectfully disagree with the governor,"" State Sen. Christopher Bateman (R., Somerset) said last week during confirmation hearings for Transportation Commissioner James Simpson.
\
""We need a stable source of funding, and most people can see a correlation between a user tax and the condition of our roads. . . . I hope you and the governor will take another look"" at a higher gas tax, Bateman said.
\
The fare increases and service cuts would likely reduce transit ridership, already down 4 percent from its 2008 peak, and push more commuters onto congested highways. A 25 percent fare increase could be expected to reduce ridership by about 2.5 percent, Weinstein said. ""Raising fares leads to a loss of ridership,"" said Jeff Tittel, director of the state Sierra Club. ""This downward spiral could dismantle one of the best transportation systems in the country.""
\
""Instead of hiking fares on working people in New Jersey,"" he said, ""they should take some money away from the ARC tunnel"" - a rail tunnel that NJ Transit plans to build under the Hudson River to New York City - ""or highway widenings and use that money to subsidize transit."" Weinstein said he hoped to have no further cuts so NJ Transit could turn its plans for growth into reality. ""I don't want to go through this excruciating process next year,"" he said.

540,"
Is America's love affair with the car over?
\
Or just less torrid?
\
Some key indicators - such as vehicle use, driver's license registration, and public-transit ridership - suggest that the 100-year-old Auto Age is waning.
\
Economics, urbanization, technology, and environmental concerns are changing the way Americans travel, and young people are leading the shift, transportation experts say.
\
Young people are getting driver's licenses later or not at all. They take the train or bus or bike to work, or telecommute. If they need a car, they can rent one by the hour.
\
""It's so much easier to get around the city without a car,"" said Jim Krider, 21, of Havertown. A junior at Temple, he didn't get his license until he was 20 and doesn't own a car.
\
""You don't have to pay for gas or insurance or the car,"" he said.
\
""I really never had a real need for it,"" said Marysia Pomorski, 24, a social worker from Haddonfield, who also waited until she was 20 to get a driver's license. When she attended Oberlin College in Ohio, she said, she ""biked everywhere"" and didn't miss having a car or a license.
\
Many of her classmates from urban areas were also without licenses, while students from the Midwest ""were always very surprised that I didn't have it, because they wouldn't have had a choice,"" she said.
\
Although some decline in vehicle use and ownership may be a result of the recession that began in 2008, several important indicators began to decline earlier and may not be reversed by an improving economy.
\
The declines before 2008 ""make me believe something else is going on,"" said Michael Sivak, a research professor at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute. ""Some of the trends are likely to be permanent.""
\
In a recent paper, ""Has Motorization in the U.S. Peaked?,"" Sivak noted that vehicles per person, per driver, and per household all peaked in 2006, before the recession began.
\
Sivak suggested that ""societal changes that influence the need for vehicles"" may be prompting the decline.
\
The vehicle miles traveled per person have dropped eight years in a row. They are now about 7.5 percent below their 2004 peak.
\
And the drop-off in driver's licenses began even earlier.
\
In 2010, 69.5 percent of 19-year-olds had a driver's license. That was down from 75.5 percent in 2008 and 87.3 percent in 1983.
\
Smaller declines in licenses have also occurred in all other age groups, except those over 70 and those between 25 and 29, Federal Highway Administration data show.
\
Meanwhile, public transportation use has been rising - in the Philadelphia region and around the nation.
\
SEPTA last week reported its highest-ever commuter-rail ridership, at 36 million passengers per year, up 50 percent in 15 years.
\
To cross the Delaware, fewer commuters are driving and more are taking the train: PATCO rail ridership reached an 11-year high last year, while vehicle traffic fell to an 11-year low on the four toll bridges operated by the Delaware River Port Authority.
\
Amtrak is on track this year to set another annual ridership record, its 10th in 11 years.
\
Buses, trains, subways, and trolleys carried 10.56 billion riders in the United States in 2012, the second-highest total since 1957, according to the American Public Transportation Association.
\
""There's a generational trend going on that's very real,"" said Art Guzzetti, vice president of policy at APTA. ""Baby boomers had a love affair with the car. Now times are different. Now young people find freedom in different ways, with the cellphone or texting. It's not all about a car.""
\
High gas prices and traffic congestion have also helped boost public-transit use, Guzzetti said.
\
APTA calculates Philadelphia-area residents could save $12,120 per year by taking public transit, based on a two-person household using one fewer car.
\
Sivak suggested four key factors in the shift from cars:
\
Economics: It's more difficult to afford the costs of buying, insuring, and maintaining a car.
\
The Internet: People can interact, shop, and be entertained without driving somewhere.
\
Urbanization: Young people and empty nesters are moving to cities where they don't have to own a car.
\
The environment: Young people are more environmentally conscious than their elders, interested in burning less gasoline.
\
The American Automobile Association, which was founded in 1902 at the dawn of the auto age, doesn't believe the car is in its twilight years.
\
""There may be a trend here, but it is clearly being overstated,"" said Jenny Robinson, spokeswoman for AAA Mid-Atlantic in Philadelphia.
\
""Consumers have been balancing economic uncertainty with family and/or personal transportation needs,"" she said. ""We don't believe this downward trend is the 'new normal,' rather an artifact of the poor economy over the last five to six years.""
\
Vehicle sales have rebounded since the recession, she said. After peaking at 17.8 million in 2000, sales of light-duty vehicles (cars, pickups, SUVs, and minivans) fell to 10.6 million in 2009 before recovering to 14.8 million in 2012.
\
Robinson noted that the number of licensed drivers has been increasing in Pennsylvania (faster than the population) and that the number of vehicles registered in Philadelphia has grown over the last seven years (more slowly than the population).
\
She also said: ""People have been forming families a bit later in life, but many eventually find their way to the suburbs, where they still need cars.""
\
Any shift in vehicle ownership and driving habits may require a change in the way Americans pay for their transportation.
\
Currently, most road and bridge construction and public-transit projects are funded by gasoline taxes. But as people drive less, vehicles become more fuel efficient, and inflation reduces the purchasing power of the taxes, gas-tax revenues are falling short.
\
In 2008, for the first time, the federal Highway Trust Fund did not collect enough to meet highway costs, and Congress took $8 billion from the general fund to keep it solvent.
\
The raids on the general fund have continued: Last year, Congress authorized an $18.8 billion transfer to the Highway Trust Fund, and by the end of next year, $54 billion will have been taken from the general fund to make up for the shortfall in federal gas-tax revenue.
\
States also are struggling to meet their transportation costs without significant gas-tax increases.
\
In Pennsylvania, legislators left Harrisburg this month without approving a new transportation-funding law, prompting warnings of bridge closures and transit cuts.

541,"
With public sentiment behind him and a deficit on the horizon, Gov. Wolf on Wednesday unveiled his plan to impose on natural gas drilling a 5 percent tax that he said could generate $1 billion for the state's public schools.
\
Bracing for pushback from the legislature, Wolf said lawmakers should follow the lead of pro-business states that have imposed drilling taxes amid the gas-industry boom.
\
""This is the best thing that could happen to the industry, because it's going to make all of us in Pennsylvania partners in the success of this industry,"" Wolf said at a news conference at a Chester County elementary school.
\
His announcement was the latest move in the budget-season chess match in the Capitol between the new Democratic governor and the Republicans who control the House and Senate.
\
It came a day after House Majority Leader Dave Reed (R., Indiana) said his members would pass and send to the Senate a bill to privatize State Stores by the end of the month - which they say would generate much-needed revenue. Meanwhile, Senate Republicans are pushing for a government pension system overhaul that would change the benefit structure.
\
Wolf has not supported either proposal, setting the stage for a clash as the commonwealth looks to close a projected $2.3 billion budget shortfall and revisit its seemingly annual debate about education funding.
\
""One of two things will happen: Everything will come to screeching deadlock, or it's Let's Make a Deal time,"" said G. Terry Madonna, a political analyst and pollster at Franklin and Marshall College.
\
Pennsylvania is the only major gas-producing state that does not impose a so-called severance tax.
\
Wolf announced the details at Caln Elementary School in Thorndale, the first stop on a statewide tour of public schools to showcase the plan that was a cornerstone of his campaign for governor. A similar stop is planned Thursday in Pottsville.
\
Under Wolf's proposal, called the Pennsylvania Education Reinvestment Act, the state would enact a 5 percent tax on the value of the gas extracted plus 4.7 cents for every thousand cubic feet of natural gas extraction. The governor's office said it is modeled on a tax on drillers in West Virginia.
\
Such a tax would replace the ""impact fee"" structure favored by Wolf's Republican predecessor, Tom Corbett. Those fees on drillers generated about $630 million since the act passed in 2012, most of it going to counties and municipalities where drilling occurs.
\
Senate Majority Leader Jake Corman (R., Centre) did not close the door on the proposal, but said Republicans wanted to address the pension crisis before looking at new revenue ideas - and also plan to take a closer look at the potential economic impact of the drilling tax.
\
""If it's a billion dollars, that would be an amazing tax, so, look, we'll hold hearings on all his proposals, including this one, to see what they actually achieve, to see whether it helps or hurts the economy of Pennsylvania,"" Corman said.
\
Reed said the proposed 4.7-cent fee for every 1,000 cubic feet of gas would bump the overall proposed tax rate from 5 percent to 7.5 percent, which would be one of the highest in the nation.
\
The administration disagreed, pointing to an Independent Fiscal Office report that it would be a 5.8 percent effective rate based on the West Virginia model.
\
In a memo to legislators, Wolf said Pennsylvania ranks 45th in the nation in the percentage of funding the state provides for public education. ""This is intolerable,"" his statement said.
\
While most of the money would boost the state share of funding to schools like Caln - part of a district that receives only 30 percent of its funding from the state - a percentage would go to the Department of Environmental Protection and developing alternative energy sources.
\
""We've been asked to do more while we receive less,"" said Cathy Taschner, superintendent of the Coatesville Area School District, which includes the Caln school.
\
The Pennsylvania State Education Association, the state's largest teachers' union, and environmental groups applauded the tax, saying drillers ought to pay their fair share, while antitax and industry groups called the proposal a job-killer.
\
The Marcellus Shale Coalition, which represents drilling companies and other businesses that have benefited from the boom, has warned that a severance tax could cripple the industry's growth as it faces falling gas prices.
\
""While we look forward to evaluating the policy details outlined by the governor today, it's clear that new energy taxes will discourage capital investment into the commonwealth and make Pennsylvania less competitive,"" said David Spigelmyer, the coalition's president.
\
PennFuture, a statewide environmental advocacy group, said the gas tax announcement - coming on the heels of his restoration of the moratorium on new gas leases on state lands - demonstrates Wolf's commitment to the environment.
\
""Pennsylvania has a history of extractive industries that have harmed the environment and left successive generations to pay for the damage,"" said John Norbeck, the group's acting president. ""Gov. Wolf's actions today clearly show that this pattern will come to a close.""

"
542," Saying President Bush's national energy strategy left him ""stunned"" and ""disappointed,"" Lt. Gov. Mark Singel yesterday proposed an alternative strategy that emphasizes conservation as a way to reduce U.S. dependence on Middle East oil.\ ""The president's energy proposal falls far short,"" said Singel, who is chairman of the Pennsylvania Energy Office.\ The strategy ""virtually ignores energy conservation and efficiency,"" while nearly providing ""a blank check to oil speculators and Detroit.""\ Singel backs a proposal, sponsored by Nevada Sen. Richard Bryan, requiring automobile manufacturers to increase new-car gas mileage from the current 27.5 mpg to 41 mpg by 2001.\ He also emphasized conservation measures that he said have worked in Pennsylvania -- such as developing coal as an alternative energy supply, and promoting recycling of newspapers and motor oil.\ Singel, a Democrat, is scheduled to describe his plan today in testimony before the U.S. House Committee on Science, Space and Technology.\ Committee member and Lehigh Valley Rep. Don Ritter reviewed a summary of Singel's plan yesterday and was unimpressed.\ ""Long on rhetoric, short on substance,"" said Ritter, R-15th District.\ ""There's very little here that even gets close to America's energy dependence problem,"" said Ritter. ""It's nice to do these, don't get me wrong,"" he said. ""But they don't have the quads.""\ ""Quads"" refers to quadrillion BTUs of energy -- the magnitude needed to put a dent in America's gluttonous oil consumption, quantities of it imported from the Middle East.\ The only way to generate that kind of quantity without crippling the economy, said Ritter, is Bush's approach -- increasing domestic production of mainstream fuel sources, such as oil and electricity.\ The Bush plan, unveiled Feb. 20, includes a proposal to ease the nuclear-reactor licensing process and to allow oil-drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, currently off limits.\ It argues that conservation efforts such as the 41-mpg requirement are improper government intervention in the marketplace.\ Bush's plan does have some conservation measures, Ritter said, such as financial incentives for the construction of energy- efficient homes. Those measures were neglected in most press descriptions of the plan, he said.\ Singel's proposal:\ *Calls for widespread use of tax incentives, to bolster utility- company conservation, mass transit and the development and use of alternative fuels, such as solar, wind, geothermal and other power sources.\ Singel said he does not support an increase in the gas tax to compel people to drive less.\ *Suggests increased government support for clean uses of coal -- an abundant Pennsylvania energy source.\ *Does not mention oil-drilling or nuclear energy.\ *Suggests voluntary agreements between governments and newspaper publishers to promote newspaper recycling. Such agreements have been effective in Pennsylvania, Singel said.\ Singel is considering a run next year for the U.S. Senate seat currently held by Arlen Specter. ""Maybe he's kicking off his Senate campaign,"" said Ritter of Singel's alternative energy strategy.\ Singel said U.S. Rep. John Murtha of Johnstown, D-12th District, has agreed to draft the alternative plan as a formal legislative proposal.\ Bush's energy plan is fundamentally flawed, Singel said, because it fails to recognize ""the fundamental link between energy production/ use and the environment.""\ ""Few ideas are as threatening to our national future as the belief that actions benefitting the environment will necessarily threaten the economy, and vice versa,"" Singel said.\ He also said it is ""hypocrisy"" for Bush to characterize conservation as "" `unacceptable government interference in the marketplace,' "" while Bush simultaneously calls for ""government ... incentives for traditional energy sources."""
543,"
Back in June, the Senate reversed four decades of a no-choice highway building policy by passing a five-year, $123-billion Surface Transportation Act that seemed headed to new, higher ground.
\
The bill stressed efficient transportation over mindless spending. It expanded mass transit, pedestrian, bicycle and congestion-management options. It said coherent land-use planning was important. It gave states and metropolitan areas new flexibility to control transportation spending in ways that make sense for their areas.
\
It all seemed to be too good to be true. And it turns out it was.
\
On the House side, powerful Public Works Committee members just couldn't be restrained from packing the nation's big new transportation bill, first of the post-Interstate era, with pork-barrel projects.
\
They invited other House members to join the feeding frenzy. Then they weighed the bill down with a 5-cent-a-gallon gas tax increase, chiefly to pay for their pet projects.
\
That prompted Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner to declare: ""We do not need to pluck another nickel from our pockets to pave America with pork."" A presidential veto was threatened, due to the new tax. Action was put off until Congress reassembles this month.
\
But even before the committee-approved House bill has reached the floor, there's fear of stalemate and talk of Congress passing instead a one-year reauthorization of current federal transportation spending. New York's Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D., N.Y.), chief architect of the more imaginative Senate measure, is dead set against that:
\
""There will be no short-term reauthorization . . . With the Interstate system finished, there is no absolute need for a federal highway program.""
\
The standoff could be resolved by the House agreeing to the measure the Senate passed, 91 to 7. But that means House members forsaking the 500-plus ''demonstration projects,"" total cost some $11 billion, which they stuffed into their bill.
\
The bill features $287 million in projects for the Pennsylvania district of Rep. Bud Shuster, second-ranking Republican on the House Public Works Committee. The chairman, New Jersey Democrat Robert Roe, would get $225 million to finish a Passaic County highway, plus $14.2 million to elevate 14 bridges.
\
The political payoff list rolls on and on - and House members have already flooded their districts with press releases hailing their great ""bring-home- the-bacon"" triumphs.
\
What's appalling is that in the interests of pork-barreling, the House would not only fleece the taxpayer with an added gas tax but downgrade drastically the Senate bill's new features of state and local decision-making, plus its special focus on urban areas and environmental issues.
\
""You get as much productivity out the Senate bill without a tax as you do out the House with a tax,"" notes David Burwell, president of the Rails-to- Trails Conservancy and a lead member of the activist Surface Transportation Policy Project.
\
The House bill does make a bow to increased state-local planning and provides billions more for mass transit than Bush originally proposed. But its five-year cost is $30.5 billion more than the Senate measure and it ends up providing $6 billion less for flexible funding to let metropolitan areas decide their own transit priorities.
\
The House version is profoundly more highway in its orientation - dedicating $40 billion over five years for a big new national highway system. The Senate agreed to only $7.9 billion for the new national highway system, and only to avoid a veto by President Bush, who's for big new roads.
\
What we're seeing is how incumbent-oriented congressional politics so easily makes common cause with special interests like the highway lobby, and so easily eclipses individual state and city needs, and the environment.
\
Some House members seem openly contemptuous of the idea that states should be given full discretion in deciding their own transportation priorities. ''It's baloney,"" says Rep. Shuster, to believe that ""state governments have been anointed from on high,"" that only they ""have the ability and purity to identify the real needs.""
\
Great, one can reply, but why should a single congressman like Shuster have the clout to bill national taxpayers for a quarter billion dollars worth of road projects in his district? Who says that's where the most need exists?
\
The American Road and Transportation Builders Association knew which side its bread was buttered on when it warned: ""If the Moynihan legislation could go through unchanged, half the ability of an individual member to influence approval of these kinds of projects would go out the window.""
\
The struggle is a metaphor for the nation's increasing distrust of a Congress that's forever passing programs, failing to monitor them well, flunking the budget-balancing test, and then trying to bribe the home folks with pork-barrel goodies.
\
State and local officials are no angels either. But they do seem to lack the overweening pride that comes with congressional semi-permanent incumbency with its constant accumulation of new national debt.
\
State and metropolitan officials are the ones we expect to make the fine- line, balancing judgments about which kinds of roads and transit facilities are most needed, which make the best use of scarce dollars, and which are friendliest to the environment.
\
It's high time members of Congress got out of the way, to let the state and local folks do their job.

544,"
Americans face dilemma because budgets are still at a crossroad.
\
When it comes to the budget, politicians in Harrisburg and Washington from both political parties agree on two things - their differences can not be more profound and the stakes in this year's elections can not be higher.
\
On the state and federal levels, the economic and budgetary debate revolves around two views of American life, prosperity and economic growth vs. fairness and distributive justice. As Michael J. Sandel wrote in the March 1996 issue of Atlantic Monthly magazine, ""We (Americans) are concerned with the overall level of economic output and debate how to promote economic growth while assuring broad access to the fruits of prosperity.""
\
On the Republican side, conservatives say lowering taxes, reducing government regulations, and cutting the role of government, particularly at the federal level, will increase the prosperity of the nation and all of its people, permitting everyone, including the poor, to pursue the American Dream.
\
This philosophy can clearly be seen in Gov. Tom Ridge's proposed 1997 budget, which calls for cuts in health care and welfare benefits for the poor in order to balance the state's budget and forestall an income tax increase. It is also evident in proposals by GOP members of Congress who wish to ""zero-out"" many social programs which help the poor in order to eliminate, in seven years, a federal budget deficit which hit nearly $164 billion last year.
\
On the Democratic side, political leaders say government is all about insuring that all people, including minorities and the economically disadvantaged, have a decent job, a good income, fair housing, good and affordable education, and a clean environment.
\
""The budget is still debatable when dealing with political priorities and the real differences are on what those priorities should be,"" U.S. Rep. Chaka Fattah said last week.
\
The differences have brought the federal budget to an impasse. Last fall, the congress, where Republicans control both houses for the first time in 40 years, failed to draft a budget that President Clinton, a democrats, would sign. the Republican plan called for deep cuts in education, job programs, mass transit, the environment and health care. Twice last fall, the government shut down because there was not a finalized budget before Oct. 1 when the 1996 Fiscal Year began. Without a budget agreement, the country lacked the authority to spend money to continue functioning.
\
In January, the president and Congress agreed on a plan to fund many programs at 75 percent of last year's level and the budget would be balanced in seven years. That has left the budget ""in a limbo stage, with a number of programs just limping along,"" Fattah said.
\
For example, last year Philadelphia had 8,000 summer jobs for young people. This year it will be 5,000. This domestic job corps program provided 1,600 jobs in Philadelphia last year. This year it will be only about 1,200 jobs.
\
However, those figures are better than nothing, Fattah said. The Republicans planned to eliminate both programs.
\
In March, Clinton called on Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, who has wrapped up the GOP presidential nomination, to sit down and work out a final budget agreement before the fall election. So far, there has been ""no sincere response from Republicans,"" Fattah said.
\
In part, Clinton was elected president in 1992 to improve the economy and insure its fairness, Fattah said. But Republicans trounced democrats in the 1994 Congressional elections because the public apparently wanted a different economic priority. As a result, neither party is likely to seriously tackle the 1996 budget in Congress until after the November election, which is more than one month after the 1997 Fiscal Year goes into effect.
\
Debating budget ideas from both sides ""may be a good way for American voters to test our sincerity. Which one do you trust?"" Dole said last month.
\
""We should enact a balanced budget. And we should do it now, not after the November election, not after the political season, not later, but now,"" Clinton said.
\
Congress ""may not be able to agree until after the voters speak,"" Fattah said. ""The November election should provide the clarity (for the nation economic priorities). A lot is at stake.""
\
In Pennsylvania, Ridge, Republican, has a situation in Harrisburg that Clinton can only dream of in Washington - his party controls both the upper and lower chambers in the General Assembly. The GOP holds a 29-20 edge in the Senate, with one vacancy, and a slim 102-101 majority in the House.
\
But it has not always translated into legislative success for the governor. Ridge's thin House majority means he must maintain party unity in order to ram proposals through the House. It is a balancing act in which Ridge sometimes has failed to maintain because, according to his chief of staff, Mark Holman, the governor can only count on 85 of the House's 102 Republicans on any given day.
\
Ridge last month proposed cutting 260-000 people from medical assistance rolls, saying the action was necessary to maintain a balanced budget. And in a controversial move for a Republican, he proposed a 6.5 cent a gallon increase in the gas tax to repair the state's infrastructure, which was damaged by heavy snowfalls and flooding earlier this year.
\
The medical assistance proposal made it through the Senate. But Democrats and special interest groups, from welfare advocates to health care lobbyists, pulled out all the stops to defeat the proposal in the house. When all the vote counting was done late into the night of March 25,24 House Republicans and all 101 House Democrats voted to bury the proposal.
\
And in an election year for members of the General Assembly, experts on both sides of the political aisle say Ridge doesn't come close to having the votes to pass the gas tax proposal.
\
Ridge's $16.1 billion budget faces other problems. Educators from urban and rural areas oppose his zero increase proposal for education. Philadelphia lawmakers are lobbying against the reduced SEPTA subsidy.
\
Voters in next week's primary elections will only be making preliminary decisions regarding who will be making the economic decisions for the state and nation next year. The final decision won't be made until November.
\
But as luck will have it, the economic and budgetary problems facing Americans today will still be there come next January.

"
545,"
The subject of today's sermon is Earth Day.
\
Wait! Don't touch that dial; I know what you're thinking: ""What's this guy talking about? Earth Day was a couple of weeks ago. We don't have to think about the environment again for another year.""
\
Precisely my point.
\
We set aside a day a year to speak piously of protecting the environment. Movie and rock stars who own three homes and six cars apiece shed public tears over the plight of the planet. Braying politicians who sacrifice entire forests to vacuous newsletters fall into toxic debate over who loves Nature best.
\
And nothing much gets done.
\
We pass a few half-measures, recycle a little paper and maybe get rid of some plastic cups, but basically it all comes down to this: When there is a choice to be made between making a dollar and making the world bright for future generations, we take the dollar.
\
Perhaps we should change the name to Hypocrisy Day and make George Bush its poster boy. Remember Bush during the 1988 campaign? He was going to be the ''environmental president."" He was going to ""invite high-level international leaders to a global conference to develop an action plan to address the global environmental problems like global warming."" He promised to adopt a ""no net loss of wetlands"" policy.
\
Well, last month we had the high-level environmental conference. Bush's message to it was that the problem needs more study. And the federal guidelines for preserving wetlands were weakened to satisfy the economic concerns of developers, local governments and oil companies.
\
To me, the environmental symbol of the Bush administration is Boston Harbor.
\
Surely we all recall the image of candidate Bush standing before the harbor as he berated the hapless Dukakis for failure to clean up that extravagantly polluted body of water. Then he got to be president - and cut off federal
\
funds for cleaning up that same harbor.
\
That he can get away with that as easily as he does is a condemnation of the American Press, as much as anything. During the '88 campaign, we spent more time writing and talking about whose dress Gary Hart had his hand under than we did trying to pin down Bush on his environmental promises.
\
It would not be difficult to be an environmental president. The problems we face are obvious, their solutions known. All that's wanted is political courage - a willingness to offend the interests that finance political campaigns. And that is exactly the sort of courage that both Bush and Congress lack.
\
An environmental president with guts (and there is no other kind) would propose a gas tax of not less than 50 cents a gallon at the pump. An environmental Congress would pass it.
\
There are disadvantages to such a tax - it is inflationary and regressive - but its countervailing advantages are overwhelming. It would raise enough
\
revenues to wipe out the deficit and allow a cut in our Social Security taxes as well. It would discourage the use of autos and, consequently, clean our air. It would impede global warming and help slow ozone depletion. It would reduce our dependency on foreign oil and make us less susceptible to economic blackmail. It would also lessen the need of drilling for oil in environmentally sensitive areas. We are going to pay an assessment sooner or later, you know; if not to the federal treasury, to the bank accounts of oil- producing countries. We might as well get some advantage from it.
\
But if you mention a 50-cent tax to the people over at the White House or at the Capitol, you get a reaction generally reserved for the mentally unhinged.
\
Tax gasoline, they say, and you would force the American people to change their lifestyle.
\
Damn straight. That's the idea. If we're serious about protecting the environment, we're going to have to change our lifestyle. We're going to have to dramatically reduce consumption; drive less, demand less packaging, give up cleaning with toxic materials, put up with weedier lawns, favor reusable rather than throw-away items, recycle things - in short, act as though there were going to be a 22nd century.
\
What we need is a president who takes the integrity of the environment seriously and is willing to lead us toward sanity. This we do not have. We have instead George Bush, who says his record on the environment is better than Ronald Reagan's. That's like bragging you're a nicer guy than Charlie Manson.
\
Actually, I'd be in favor of doing away with Earth Day altogether. It's bad enough being violated, you shouldn't have to listen to mood music while it's happening.

"
546," To many Democrats, Drew Lewis is remembered as the U.S. Secretary of Transportation who helped President Ronald Reagan break the air traffic controllers' strike.\ So what was the chairman and chief executive officer of Bethlehem- based Union Pacific Corp. doing this week in Little Rock, Ark., where the first Democrat elected president since 1976, Bill Clinton, held a two-day conference to discuss the America's fiscal future?\ ""As a partisan Republican ... I respect your tolerance and also have great respect for the clear ability you have to reach out,"" Lewis told Clinton.\ ""I wasn't going to say anything in this panel, but Drew has provoked me in a very positive way,"" Clinton responded.\ By inviting a diverse panel of experts, Clinton was showing an open mind for an 18-hour telecast.\ Interestingly, Lewis and Clinton found little to disagree about.\ In a segment carried on the C-SPAN and CNN networks on Tuesday, Lewis expanded on two issues: the need for a federal gasoline tax and support of Superfund Two -- with a reduction of red tape from the Environmental Protection Agency.\ ""The easiest way for you to impose a tax that helps the environment, the infrastructure and the deficit is the gasoline tax,"" said Lewis, who was restating his stand four years ago at an economic conference with President-elect George Bush.\ On the new Superfund, Lewis advised Clinton:\ ""I hope that somehow we'll see that some of the money gets to the purpose for which it was intended, not be consumed by paper shufflers and lawyers ... I think Superfund makes sense, but we wasted all of the money.""\ Clinton, breaking in on the panel that was being headed by Vice President-elect Al Gore, said that he welcomed Lewis' or anyone else's ideas on how to handle waste matter in a more responsible way.\ He asked people -- including the TV audience -- to write him with solutions to the the waste management problem.\ ""I am just appalled by the paralysis and the political divisions and the fact that the money is being blown,"" Clinton said.\ After listening to dozens of speakers on the economy, the former Arkansas governor on Tuesday promised to ""explore every idea and challenge"" to develop a recovery program aimed at creating jobs.\ Lewis was one of some 300 people who were asked to bring their ideas -- no matter how much they might vary from the Democrats'.\ He was the only representative from a Lehigh Valley company.\ To many Republicans, Lewis was one of the first bigwigs in the party to openly express concern about President Bush's standing with voters and his inability to ""articulate an economic vision for America"" in mid-1992.\ The Montgomery County resident, who once ran unsuccessfully for governor, heads Union Pacific, one of the nation's most successful transportation, energy, natural resources and environmental companies.\ The company's most prized possession is the Union Pacific Railroad, famous for linking the America's East and West coasts and for hiring Pinkerton detectives to track down train-robbers Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\ No company would be hit harder by a gas tax than his, Lewis said.\ But he remains in favor it it -- to reduce the federal deficit.\ ""We are the largest consumer of the fuel you are going to tax in the world,"" Lewis said. ""I think we burn 600 million gallons a year on the railroad and our trucking company, so we will be paying more tax than anybody else in the country."
547,"Swimming pools, fireworks and family vacations are all hallmarks of summer. If you move in transportation circles, you can count a Bethlehem crosswalk safety program among their number.\For about 15 years, the city has conducted driver education programs by having volunteers - usually city employees but sometimes people with the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation or community groups - try to cross the street at well-marked crosswalks in various locations around the city. The crossings are timed so the pedestrian is in the middle of the road when the car reaches the intersection. The law gives the right of way to pedestrians in these cases; drivers need to wait for pedestrians to pass in front of them before moving along.\But they frequently don't. Many drivers apparently don't know right of way laws. I suspect some just don't care. Too many speed on through, forcing the pedestrian to stop or sometimes even jump out of the way.\That's why a small team of Bethlehem police were on hand Tuesday when the volunteers from the city, PennDOT, the Coalition for Appropriate Transportation and Lehigh Valley Health Network tested the corner of 12th Avenue and Broad Street. If a driver failed to stop, police would pull the driver over. According to PennDOT spokesman Sean Brown, 21 drivers received warnings. Another three were issued citations. Some drivers avoided getting anything because police were tied up with other motorists who failed to yield.\A week earlier at a similar event, a guy leaned out his window and screamed ""You moron!"" because Brown dared to cross in front of him. When police pulled him over for failing to yield to a pedestrian, they discovered he had a suspended license and no registration.\""We're here to educate people. We're not trying to penalize people,"" Brown said.\The posted speed limit on Broad Street is 35 mph, but the wide road and frequent turn lanes make drivers feel comfortable going much faster. Things went predictably terrible. After about 50 minutes, 20 of the 37 drivers - 54% - failed to yield to a pedestrian who was already in the middle of the road.\Getting drivers to recognize the crosswalks along Broad has been a longtime struggle for Sherri Penchishen, whose job at the city health bureau has her wearing a lot of hats, including overseeing the city's Vision Zero program. But Penchishen said the program has seen some improvements. The overall rate of drivers stopping for pedestrians improved since the program started more than a decade ago, she said. Drivers have become so accustomed to stopping for pedestrians at some crosswalks - like the one in front of the Hotel Bethlehem - that they no longer test it.\The program drew mixed reactions. An employee at a local business shook his fist at Brown and shouted something about karma, calling the exercise entrapment. I was across the street and couldn't make out everything he said.\His opinion wasn't shared by everyone. Lisa Diefenderfer, who lives nearby, endorsed the effort, saying police need to enforce speeding and crosswalks more along Broad. Children frequently cross the road to and from Nitschmann Middle School, she said, and she fears for their safety. Her landlord works directly across the street from her, but she drives there because drivers don't respect the crosswalks.\""None of the cars will stop for anyone,"" she said. ""It's pathetic.""\Tuesday's event focused on educating drivers, but Penchishen emphasized that pedestrians need just as much education. Many students are taught to look both ways before crossing - though some seem to forget those lessons, causing a problem a few years back outside Liberty High School.\I tend to agree. On my way back to The Morning Call's Allentown office, I encountered two pedestrians who jaywalked in front of me at the same light on two different crosswalks. At intersections with crossing signals, pedestrians are only supposed to cross when they have the right of way. Crossing halfway and waiting for a break in traffic exposes them to more danger. I wound up slamming on the brakes when I had a green light, which could have led to an accident if there was anyone behind me.\Readers question VMT tax\I first wrote about a vehicle miles traveled tax as an alternative to the gas tax a year ago. With more efficient engines and electric vehicles becoming more common, gas taxes don't raise as much as they used to. This is a particular problem at the federal level, which hasn't raised the gas tax in almost 26 years despite the Highway Trust Fund going bankrupt in 2008. The last hike was so long ago that ""Cool Runnings"" was released into theaters the same day.\Some experts believe the best option would be to switch to a vehicle miles traveled tax, which essentially acts as a user fee. Instead of being taxed for how much gas they burn, drivers would be charged for the amount of miles they drive. The system strikes me as patently more fair, and I've been accepted into a study to test a GPS system that would attempt to track my travel and send me a pretend bill for the amount of miles I travel in Pennsylvania. This is only a test - there is no proposal to switch over to a system like this at this time.\But a few readers questioned the wisdom and feasibility of such a plan.\This tax - and removing fuel tax - would disincentivize vehicle efficiency, and the associated air pollution and gasoline consumption that come with low mpg vehicles. We can consider that CO2 released into the atmosphere is most closely tied to gallons of fuel burned. Incentivizing people to drive fewer miles would benefit air quality if MPG were equal, but it is not, and the range of vehicles out there spans 5-60 mpg, before even considering electric vehicles.\While hybrid and electric vehicles also contribute to road wear and tear, they don't weigh as much as large SUVs, dump trucks and 18-wheelers that consume more fuel. For example, would mopeds and some motorcycles that reach 80 mpg pay the same vehicle miles traveled tax? Would all classes of motor vehicles pay the same vehicle miles traveled tax?\If we're talking about cleaning our air and water, as well as road maintenance funding needs, but I don't see the direct benefit of this tax. I'd love to hear what else you can find out about the environmental and driver behavior side of this tax. - Scott Slingerland, director of the Lehigh Valley Coalition for Appropriate Transportation\Scott brings up some good points. I believe we should be pursuing cleaner technology - not only does it lessen our carbon footprint, but it's better for customers too. That said, the gas tax was established to maintain our roads, not to improve the environment. That's been a happy bonus.\A VMT tax would still act as a disincentive against unnecessary trips or scenic routes. And the rising cost of gasoline would still act as incentive for people to switch over to more fuel efficient vehicles.\The bigger fight, in my opinion, is on how aggressively we pursue fuel efficiency requirements as a nation. A lot of hoopla was made about President Donald Trump's rolling back rules set up by the Obama administration that would have required new vehicles meet a 46.7 mpg standard by 2026. The Trump administration is attempting to lower that to about 37 mpg as well as to dramatically lower the fine for companies that don't meet it. The auto industry said the Obama plan would have resulted in $1 billion in fines, drastically increased the cost of their vehicles and resulted in major job losses.\For me, the bigger issue is how auto makers can still produce vehicles with lousy gas mileage. Some luxury brands like BMW, Bentley and Rolls-Royce just pay million dollar fines. Other car makers like Ford, Toyota and Chrysler get around the fines by offering electric or hybrid vehicles but sell tons of gas guzzlers - the fines are based on the fleet average. In my opinion, new cars that can't hit 20 mpg in 2019 shouldn't be on the road. I have no apologies for any 2019 Lamborghini Aventador Roadster owners out there who are getting 11 mpg on a car that costs twice the average home in the Lehigh Valley.\As for differentiating the tax for different vehicles, I support that, too. A moped puts a lot less wear and tear on the road than a tractor-trailer, so it's only fair the big rig get charged more. For something like this to work, I suspect it would need to be based off the vehicle's axles. There's a solution to be found there.\Why not get the mileage when a vehicle is inspected? Seems like an easy way to get the info and - more importantly - Pennsylvania already has this info. - Jill Hurt, Bethlehem\On first blush, using a car's odometer seems like a much better way to track how much wear and tear a vehicle is putting on the roads than installing tracking devices into people's cars. It avoids the intrusive Big Brother aspect that understandably alienates a lot of motorists.\But things get tricky when you take borders into account. Say my odometer shows I drove 13,000 miles a year. PennDOT may want to charge me a fee based off that mileage, but some of those miles were logged driving to the beach in New Jersey, attending a wedding in Massachusetts or vacationing in Maine. Pennsylvania has no right to charge me for miles I drove in other states.\I originally thought the feds could probably get away with the odometer reading, but I've since had second thoughts. Anyone driving into Canada or Mexico would be charged for driving on roads outside the country. That's unlikely to be a problem for most drivers in our area, but it becomes an issue for drivers in border states and potentially for long-haul truckers.\Morning Call reporter Tom Shortell can be reached at 610-820-6168 or tshortell@mcall.com.\Caption: A driver stops as Sherri Penchishen of the Bethlehem Health Department crosses Broad Street on Tuesday.

548,"Due to newsroom front-end system production difficulties the entire text could not be electronically captured for the online archive. Please see microfilm or PDF for complete chart.\At first, Jill Anderson studied maps and traffic patterns to make her commute from Orefield to her job at Drew University in Madison, N.J., as quick and direct as possible.\But a 152-mile round trip adds up to a lot of money spent on gas, no matter how you map it.\So Anderson found another way to save -- she bought a Lincoln MKZ hybrid that gets about 45 miles a gallon on the highway.\""I like the hybrid because when I'm stuck in traffic jams, which are not uncommon, it switches over to electric, and when I'm sitting still, I'm not burning gas,"" Anderson said.\She's not burning tax dollars either.\Anderson's estimated $150 monthly savings includes between $12.50 and $20.50 less in fuel taxes.\Anderson is happy with that result.\""I think I pay enough in taxes,' she said.\But that revenue loss from Anderson's hybrid is no small bump in the road for the government. It's part of an expanding pothole that is going to cost Pennsylvania millions and the U.S. government billions in the next four to 12 years if gas taxes are not increased or calculated differently to account for new vehicle technology.\Since the 1950s, state and federal gas taxes have been the main source for maintaining and expanding the nation's aging roads, bridges, ports, airports and rails. That pot of money has the potential to dry up under the federal government's mandate that manufacturers increase the fuel economy of cars and light trucks by 40 percent to roughly 34 miles per gallon by 2016 and about 55 miles per gallon by 2025.\""By 2020, four years after the 40 percent manufacturer's mandate goes into effect, we figure a reduction, all things being equal, of $400 [million] to $500 million,"" said Barry Schoch, secretary of the state Department of Transportation. ""In essence, about eight-tenths of the gas tax revenue will disappear.""\The loss will be more for the U.S. Department of Transportation.\The Federal Highway Trust Fund, the main pot of money for the nation's highway system, is expected to lose 13 percent -- $57 billion -- between 2012 and 2022, according to the Congressional Budget Office. That drop will hit Pennsylvania, too, since most of the trust fund money goes back to the states.\""We've got a policy of let's conserve, and for good reasons -- it's better for the environment and it's better for the economy,"" Schoch said. ""But that translates into less revenue for us.""\If current driving and purchasing trends hold true, that loss will be even higher.\The number of vehicles running on alternative fuels like electricity, hydrogen and natural gas is still much smaller than those running on gas and diesel. But the number of cars and trucks operating on alternative fuels rose more than 55 percent to more than 9 million between 2003 and 2010, according to the most recent federal data.\At the same time, motorists are driving less than they did between the 1970s and the turn of the century. The number of miles traveled per driver started declining in 2005 and plummeted when the Great Recession hit in 2007, according to the Federal Highway Administration.\That adds up to less tax money for regular road and bridge maintenance.\Pennsylvania, which generates money from two fuel taxes of 12 cents and 31 cents per gallon, saw that revenue drop by 11 percent between 2006-2010, to $670 million.\The state's gas tax receipts are expected to rebound slightly this year but as of the end of March were running below expectations, according to the Pennsylvania Revenue Department.\Those tax dollars also do not go as far as they once did because the state's fuel taxes, which are not tied to inflation, have remained flat for 16 years.\That means the $712 million the state is expected to receive in gas and diesel taxes in 2013-14 equates to $318 million when adjusted for inflation and labor and construction costs that are higher now than in 1997.\The same goes for federal gas receipts.\""What's been happening over the past decade, the amount of money going into the account has begun to shrink and the amount of money going out increases because you have increased inflation costs due to construction materials,"" said Tony Dorsey, spokesman for the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.\Asking motorists for more\The federal gasoline tax was enacted in 1956 at 3 cents per gallon. Nearly three decades went by before Congress increased it in 1983. A decade later it went up again to about 18 cents per gallon.\There is no new money flowing into the system because the 2012 federal highway funding bill Congress and President Barack Obama passed did not raise gas taxes. Obama has said he will not support an increase because of the sluggish economy. The funding bill expires next year.\Fear of voter backlash has paralyzed state and federal lawmakers from increasing gas taxes or tying gas taxes to inflation.\""Anytime you are potentially asking the citizens of the commonwealth to potentially contribute more, it's a very significant matter,"" state Sen. Pat Browne, R-Lehigh said. ""That's something we in the Legislature take very seriously.""\""We have a bad habit in Pennsylvania and America of expecting public services but not paying for them,"" said state Rep. Mike Schlossberg, D-Lehigh, a member of the House Transportation Committee.\Meanwhile, the price to maintain the nation's highway system is getting higher.\By 2020, the country will need to spend $3.6 trillion to maintain roads, bridges, dams, levees and other infrastructure, according to a recent report by the American Society of Civil Engineers.\The report shows Pennsylvania needs $14.6 billion to repair many of the 9,910 structurally deficient or functionally obsolete bridges and 69,410 miles of poor or mediocre public roads. The report, which gave the state an overall infrastructure grade of C-, also identified nearly $2 billion in dam, levee and freight line repairs.\Gov. Tom Corbett, who inherited the backlog of repairs, has proposed spending more in next year's transportation budget, but nowhere near what the engineering society's report says is needed.\Corbett has proposed changing how the state taxes gasoline and diesel as a way to raise an additional $1.8 billion.\He wants to reduce the 12-cents-per-gallon liquid fuels tax by 2 cents over the next two years and increase the oil company franchise tax, which has been capped at 19 cents for gasoline and 26 cents for diesel since 1997.\Consumers don't pay those taxes directly. The taxes are charged to energy companies, which pass them on to consumers.\State Revenue Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Brassell said she has no way to track the percentage of gas tax passed to consumers because fuel prices vary across the state.\Schlossberg assumes the entire tax is passed on.\Schlossberg said he supports lifting the cap along with a plan in the Senate to increase license and registration fees to raise more money than Corbett has proposed.\""It's cheaper to buy a driver's license than it is a fishing license in this state,"" he said.\The state must increase transportation funding or else it will have to put more weight restrictions on bridges or close them completely, Schoch said. In the meantime, the federal government needs to come up with ways to generate more revenue for the entire nation, he said, and the easiest way for that to happen is to give states more leeway to add toll roads.\""Tolling would get [money from] electric vehicles, fuel-cell vehicles, gas or diesel, and it would be easy to set up,"" Schoch said.\That seems unlikely, however. In 2010, the federal government rejected Pennsylvania's plan to install tolls on Interstate 80, which would have generated an estimated $83 billion over 50 years.\The Oregon plan\Some states, however, are not waiting for the federal government to act.\This month, Virginia imposed a $100 fee on hybrid owners to make up for what they aren't paying in gas taxes.\Oregon, Washington, Nevada and Minnesota have tried to devise systems wherein motorists are taxed based on how many miles they drive, not by how much gas they use. Oregon considered charging 1.56 cents per mile of travel. But first it had to come up with a tracking technology acceptable to drivers. Initial feedback showed many worried the government was becoming like Big Brother.\But James Whitty, manager of the Oregon Department of Transportation's Innovative Partnerships and Alternative Funding Division, said he thinks his state has come up with a simple solution to get around that fear. It's based on giving consumers choice rather than dictating that they have to use a government-created mileage calculator.\Between November and February, Oregon's pilot program enlisted 93 motorists. They could choose to track mileage with a commercially available GPS unit, smartphone app or an odometer reader and were given five payment options.\Whitty said he is excited by the preliminary results of a survey that showed most participants had no difficulty installing or using the tracking systems, and they liked having the choices. The drivers found ""a road usage charging program is at least as equitable as a fuel tax.""\""It shows you can have technology from the marketplace, and you don't have to have a government-selected box,"" Whitty said. ""This thing could be done quickly and easily across the United States.""\With those results, the Oregon Legislature began debating in January whether to impose a new per-mile tax on fuel-efficient or electric cars that get at least 55 miles per gallon.\A month earlier, U.S. Rep Earl Blumenauer, D-Oregon, introduced a bill in Congress to set up a federal pilot program to see if a per-mile vehicle tax is feasible nationally. The bill had no co-sponsors. It died and he has not reintroduced it in the new Congress.\steve.esack@mcall.com\717-783-7305\Credit: Steve Esack Of The Morning Call\Credit: Steve Esack Of The Morning Call"

Editor: Some seven or eight years ago, at the onset of the rapid increase of partisan mayhem in government, I decided to rid myself of any culpability I may

have in causing this toxic infestation.
\
I ended my affiliation with my political party at the time. In completing the required voter registration application, I ticked the ""no affiliation"" box in response to the query, ""In which party do you wish to register?""
\
It also contained a caveat - inability to vote in primary elections for nonparty affiliation. Because I often did not vote in primaries - I consider them to be totally unnecessary and too costly - I didn't object. Primaries provide spawning opportunities for the above mentioned mayhem - no parties, no partisan mayhem.

\
The article lists 10 things you need in your winter wardrobe. I had to laugh; they listed ""long necklaces"" as one. Nowhere did they list ""long underwear."" Though not sexy, it keeps you warm. And don't forget the ""staple blouse,"" which can be worn nine months a year - except from December to February.
\
Nowhere did they list an insulated parka with a hood trimmed with real fur. OK, animal lovers, I love them, too, but there is no substitute for warmth around the face.
\
Another item was "" monogrammed handbags,"" perhaps to help identify you if you are found frozen from hypothermia.

No gas tax hike
\
Editor: I write in reference to Norbert Mayr's letter (""Roads to Ruin""), which was published on Sunday.
\
Obviously, Mr. Mayr is a left-wing, ultra-liberal, tax-and-spend Democrat, who has no problem continuing to hand over more and more of his - and my - hard-earned money without even attempting to hold the money-grabbers accountable for how they spend our tax dollars.
\
It seems as though he doesn't realize or fails to acknowledge the fact that Pennsylvania just put into effect two huge fuel-tax increases, along with increases for vehicle registrations and drivers licenses. All this was done with the intent of fixing roads and bridges.
\
The fact isn't lost on me that it was a Republican governor who increased these taxes.
\
The fact that the prices of gasoline, diesel and home heating oil are down significantly probably brings a collective sigh of relief from just about everyone who purchases said products. People are getting a break for a change.
\
But I can't imagine why Mr. Mayr believes this is the time to raise federal fuel
\
taxes.
\
In my 60 years of life, I have discerned a few things. The more we give, the more they squander and steal. Every time they raises gas taxes for ""roads and bridges,"" less of the money goes for such projects, thus requiring yet another increase.
\
I say, let the American people catch their breath for a while and maybe we can get our own personal finances in shape, albeit temporarily, before the money-grabbers come at us again with their hands open.

change the focus and the attention of the American people,"" said G. Terry Madonna, Ph.D., director of the poll and the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at F&M.
\
The poll interviewed 1,119 adult state residents, including 964 registered voters -- 483 Democrats, 353 Republicans, 102 independents/others and 26 who refused to give their party. The margin of error is plus or minus 2.9 percentage points for the 1,119 adults; plus or minus 3.2 points for the registered adults; plus or minus 4.5 points for registered Democrats; and plus or minus 5.2 points for registered Republicans.
\
In the Democratic race, the poll showed Mr. Specter ahead of Mr. Sestak 32 to 12 percent among registered voters with Joseph Vodvarka, who recently joined the race, with 0 percent.
\
In the Republican race, Mr. Toomey led Mrs. Luksik 30 to 4 percent. Against the Democrats, Mr. Toomey led Mr. Specter 33 to 29 percent and Mr. Sestak 27 to 19 percent. Large numbers of voters remain undecided.
\
Dr. Madonna and others said they expect health care's rise to the top to be temporary with jobs and the economy moving back to the top as the health care debate in Congress concludes.
\
""I think health care will be prominent, but I think the main issue will continue to be jobs,"" U.S. Sen. Bob Casey said.
\
In other findings, the poll showed:
\
-- Two-thirds of registered adults (67 percent) believe state legislators use their staff and tax money for their political campaigns. The poll asked the question as a trial of former House Democratic Whip Mike Veon and three others on such charges reached a climax last week. A Dauphin County jury convicted Mr. Veon and two of three co-defendants Monday while acquitting the other.
\
The poll said more registered adults (55 percent) had not heard anything about the corruption trials than had heard (44 percent). But of those who had heard something, almost six in 10 Pennsylvanians (57 percent) had followed the trials at least somewhat closely, and about the same number knew that Republicans and Democrats have been charged with corruption.
\
-- Distaste for most of Gov. Ed Rendell's plans to fund the state budget. Only a third (33 percent) of registered adults favor reducing the state sales tax from 6 to 4 percent, while extending it to tax many untaxed goods. More than half (54 percent) oppose the idea.
\
Almost half of residents (49 percent) oppose increasing taxes on companies that extract or sell natural gas. Only slightly more than a third (35 percent) favor the governor's proposed gas tax.
\
Almost half (49 percent) favor imposing tolls on Interstate 80 to raise money for highway and bridge improvements compared to more than four in ten (44 percent) who oppose the idea.
\
""People are really gun shy about taxes right now,"" Dr. Madonna said. ""We're in a recession ... People don't want any more money taken out of their pockets. Now, it may be that they don't understand the business of taxing companies that extract natural gas, but they do understand that it (the tax) would be passed along to them. I think this is a lethal environment to raise taxes, given the state of the economy.""
\
The one new tax heavily favored by residents is on the sale of smokeless tobacco and cigars, which are untaxed. Almost two-thirds (64 percent) favor the tax compared to a third (33 percent) who oppose it.
\
The races for governor are virtually unchanged, with the Democratic candidates bunched together and a wide gap on the Republican side. Two-thirds or more of voters in both races remain undecided.

551,"
The York Dispatch is asking candidates in contested elections for seats in the state Legislature a series of questions about key issues. Candidates are asked to respond in 125 words of less. Check back weekly for updates to this question and answer series.
\
Question 1:In 2010, electricity rate caps will come off for Pennsylvania's five largest power providers, including Met-Ed. Dramatic increases in electric bills are predicted once that happens. Lawmakers have proposed several alternatives for dealing with the situation. How do you think the state Legislature should react between now and then, if at all, and why?
\
Eugene DePasquale (D):The Legislature recently passed my legislation, the Alternative Energy Investment Act. This legislation will reduce our dependence on foreign energy and stabilize prices. However, more action is needed. The deregulation of utilities in the 90s will cause rate caps to expire in December 2010, resulting in significant rate increases. Four legislative actions must occur before then to hold down costs. One, utilities must be required to purchase energy from the lowest cost provider. Two, significant energy conservation measures in House Bill 2200 must be passed by the Senate. Three, consumers must be allowed to have meters that enable them to know the price of energy at a given period of time. Four, any rate cap expiration must be phased-in over a 3-5 year period.
\
Lon Emenheiser (R):Our lawmakers have damaged our electricity providers enough and should not cause anymore. The Legislature wrongly removed the power company's ability to function in the free market by capping prices. Taking this liberty from any company would stop them from adjusting to the markets or planning for future expansions. True deregulation will begin with lifting of the caps. Slightly higher prices ten years ago could have been rolled into added production and transmission of the electricity causing lowering future prices. Now the companies are playing catch up. Rates will drop quickly as soon as their consumers cut back on their usage. The free market will correct itself. If caps are such a good idea, the legislature should lower and cap all our taxes.
\
Question 2:State officials recently learned that the federal government has rejected the proposal to place tolls on Interstate 80. That eliminates a source of funding the government and state Legislature committed to road and bridge repairs under Act 44. Some are calling for resubmitting the toll proposal, while Gov. Ed Rendell is pushing to lease the Pennsylvania Turnpike. Increases in the gas tax, drivers license fees and vehicle registration fees are other possible sources of revenue. Which of those options would you support? Which do you oppose? How should the state address this issue and why?
\
DePasquale:Infrastructure funding is critical for safety and economic reasons. The funding gap needed for critical repairs is over $1 billion dollars a year. Also, the Bush Administration recently announced that they have bankrupted the Federal Highway Trust Fund, ensuring no federal assistance. Two good options exist and are preferable to leasing the Turnpike and raising the gas tax. One, use the existing Motor License Fund and convert the State Police to the general fund and two, fees from the Marcellus Shale. Both will provide significant infrastructure revenue while not negatively impacting our families. The rejection from the federal government of the I-80 toll proposal was very strong so it doesn't make sense to resubmit the application. No more time should be wasted on this approach.
\
Emenheiser:My opponent has been an avid supporter to toll I-80. What would you do if he supported tolling I-83? Tolling I-80 will hurt our economy, strain other roads, and is fundamentally unfair. The current budget should have been prioritized better. It has billions just in corporate welfare, and for stadiums and convention centers. This funding needs to be redirected for road and bridge repairs to ensure public safety first. The plan to lease the Turnpike has been thankfully killed by the state Senate for now. The governor is now considering increasing the gas tax. You and I do not want this. I've pledged to vote no to increase taxes, tolls, or fees while in this office. I challenge my opponent to match all my pledges.
\
Question 3:School property taxes continue to be an issue in Harrisburg, despite the tax relief offered through Act 1. Should more be done to alleviate the property tax burden? If so, what? Have the school district cost controls adopted by the Legislature as part of Act 1 -- voter approval of tax increases under certain circumstances -- been effective? Should more be done in that regard?
\
DePasquale:Times are tough for many families and it is getting tougher to pay the bills. This is why I believe strongly that more must be done to cut property taxes. This belief is why I was one of only 10 Democrats who voted to eliminate school property taxes. The relief offered by gaming is better than nothing and made an impact in the city. However, outside the city, it barely made a dent. Three things must be done. One, cut wasteful spending. My school construction bill, along with Senator's Waugh's school design bill, need to become law. Two, the state must increase its share of education funding. Three, the next vote to eliminate the school tax will need to focus on primary residences.
\
Emenheiser:I support and will fight for property tax elimination. Other plans that only cut or reduce property taxes will leave the door open for future property tax increases that will make matters worse. I support HB1275, The School Property Tax Elimination Act. Learn more at www.ptcc.us. My opponent spoke negatively about the elimination plan since 2006 and supported tax reduction plan ACT1 along with its failed referendum vote in the 2007 primary election. I don't support ACT1 or HB1600. Why would anyone co-sponsor HB1600 to cut property taxes just like ACT1 but would force the unwanted tax reduction plan without your vote? A few tax reducers flip-flopped recently and jumped on the ""band wagon"" to eliminate property taxes this year. It is an election year.
\
Question 4:Earlier this year, charges were filed against 12 individuals after an investigation into bonuses allegedly given to state employees for campaign work. Would you vote in favor of a measure prohibiting lawmakers from awarding bonuses to state employees? Pinpoint another reform measure you would support should you be elected and explain why you think it's among the most important change lawmakers could make.
\
DePasquale:Not only would I vote in favor of a ban on lawmaker awarded bonuses, state Rep. Rick Taylor and I authored legislation to do just that. This displays my commitment to change Harrisburg. I was the first legislator to post my expenses on-line. I led the fight for the new open records law. My proposal to ban private car leases for lawmakers was enacted and my expenses are one of the lowest in the entire Legislature. However, three key additional reforms are needed: campaign finance reform to reduce special interest influence; redistricting reform because politicians should not draw districts to protect incumbents and third-party ballot access to ensure competitive elections. I would support a constitutional convention to enact these reforms.
\
Emenheiser:Many other state employees allegedly illegally helped candidates to campaign, fundraise, and performed opposition research before the 2006 election. I'll vote in favor to stop bonuses. Reducing our most expensive, largest full-time and scandal-plagued General Assembly from 253 to 201 would save $67.6 million yearly. Having the remaining 161 in the House and 40 in the Senate accept term-limits and replace pensions with 401k could save millions more. Democracy will not suffer. California's 120 member legislature represents 36 million people costing $260 million compared to our larger legislature representing 13 million residents for $332 million annually. Shrink our government, grow our economy. Pennsylvania is heading for huge budget deficits next year so reducing our General Assembly size is the perfect reform to start balancing the budget.
\
Question 5:Two longtime state senators recently warned that the nation's economic turmoil could result in dire revenue shortfalls that might require a tax increase to rectify when state lawmakers adopt the 2009-10 budget next July. If cost cuts aren't enough to balance the budget, if those warnings turn out to be true and an increase in taxes/fees is necessary, what approach would be the fairest? What taxes/fees should the state look at and why?
\
DePasquale:While Pennsylvania's budget is better than surrounding states, the nation's recession is hitting us hard. The economic turmoil especially hurts middle class families as investment funds plunge, home values plummet and unemployment rises. The first priority is to get our economy moving by enacting policies to increase jobs. We must also crack down on wasteful spending. As a Legislator with one of the lowest expenses in Pennsylvania, I know how to make this happen. Pennsylvania recently made $300 million in additional cuts. If the deficit persists, the $750 million rainy day fund must be used before any tax increase is considered. If any revenue enhancement is needed beyond this, it must be tied to the service provided and ensure fair funding for York County.
\
Emenheiser:Raising taxes will hurt families, businesses and small employers causing job layoffs or loss of benefits like affordable health care. I pledge to vote against any new taxes, tolls, or fees while I hold this office. Legislative priorities are out of order and have cost us dearly. The budget has billions in revenue that redirected, could cover the deficit. By stopping corporate welfare and funding for stadiums and convention centers, we could save billions. Reducing the Legislature 50 members could save $70 million. Replacing legislative pensions with a 401k savings plan could save billions in the future. I again challenge my opponent to match my reform promises and pledges. Refuse your legislative pension, your unconstitutional COLA pay raise, and drive your own car. I will.
\
Question 6:Previous questions in this series have dealt with electricity caps, school property tax reform, transportation funding, government reform and potential budget shortfalls in 2009-10. Now we'd like you to identify another key issue to residents in your district, or another priority you'll take to Harrisburg. Please explain how you would address that issue?
\
DePasquale:My record of posting my expenses online, co-sponsoring the new open records law, voting to eliminate property taxes and passing alternative energy legislation to reduce our dependence on foreign oil display my commitment to keeping my campaign promises. Two issues I took on in addition to these I will keep working for if re-elected. The first is banning recalled toys from store shelves. To allow recalled toys on store shelves is unconscionable. Families should not have to worry about the safety of the toys they are buying. The second is banning text messaging while driving. This activity is a major distraction and leads to too many accidents. I will fight to end the practice and through that, improve road safety.
\
Emenheiser:Growing our economy is our priority. With the current climate of the U.S. economy, we need to lower individual and business taxes. We must improve the business climate for businesses and consumers. Enticing companies to come and stay in Pennsylvania is the key to economic growth. More employers equal more jobs and competitive wages for hard-working families, including benefits like affordable health care. Any future ""revenue enhancements"" will chase more employers out of Pennsylvania causing lower wages, layoffs, and loss of benefits like affordable health care. If any ""revenue enhancements"" are needed by our Legislature they need to cut government spending instead. ""Revenue enhancements"" are the fancy words used by Rep. DePasquale for raising your taxes, tolls, or fees in his response to the last question.
\
Question 7:What qualities and qualifications do you have that make you the candidate voters should support on Nov. 4?
\
DePasquale:As the first legislator to post expenses online, a leader in eliminating private car leases, receiving an A grade for low expenses and fighting for the new open records law, I have shown a willingness to reform Harrisburg. I have also proven effective legislatively. My legislation, the Alternative Energy Investment Act, is law. This legislation will help reduce our dependence on foreign oil, stimulate our economy and improve our environment.I also displayed a commitment towards bi-partisanship. The York delegation worked hard to change the school funding formula. While more is needed, we are seeing progress for the first time in 20 years. Reform, effectiveness and cooperation are the skills I offer the people of our region if they reward me with a second term.
\
Emenheiser:I am a working class candidate who lives like the average voter. I pay high taxes, gas prices and struggle to makes ends meet. I don't have luxuries like free cars, pensions and perks. My life experience and responsibilities as a taxpayer, York City resident and native-born Yorker makes me the better candidate. When I agreed to serve our country in the military, I pledged my honor, integrity and allegiance to fellow soldiers and America. It required true courage to pledge my life to serve. My dedication to this district is no less. Leadership is not earned through lifelong appointed positions, but requires the courage to stand up for what's right in the face of all that is wrong, including powerful politicians and their corruption.

552,"Jeffrey Cohan can be reached at jcohan@post-gazette.com or 412-263- 3573.\ In this year's U.S. Senate race, Constitution Party candidate Jim Clymer has been insisting that Republican incumbent Arlen Specter and Democratic challenger Joe Hoeffel are both liberals.\ ""There really is no significant difference between them on the major issues,"" Clymer said.\ But he is wrong.\ A thorough review of Specter's and Hoeffel's voting records and campaign rhetoric shows significant differences in the positions of the two major candidates.\ Pennsylvania voters will have a choice when they select a senator on Nov. 2, whether or not they consider a third-party candidate.\ To be sure, Specter and Hoeffel both lie to the left of the arch- conservative Clymer on the political spectrum.\ Specter and Hoeffel describe themselves as pro-choice, oppose privatization of Social Security, and oppose a proposed constitutional amendment banning gay marriage.\ But even on those issues, there are nuances separating Specter, a four-term senator, and Hoeffel, a three-term U.S. representative from Montgomery County.\ Abortion, Social Security, gay marriage\ On abortion, pro-choice groups have given Hoeffel perfect scores. But Specter has spurned those organizations over the last two years in voting for the partial-birth abortion ban and for the Unborn Victims of Violence Act, which classifies an attack on a pregnant woman as separate crimes against her and her fetus.\ On Social Security, Hoeffel has consistently opposed privatization, while Specter has reversed his position after stating during this spring's Republican primary that he supports allowing workers to divert a limited amount of funds into private investment accounts.\ And on gay marriage, Hoeffel has said, ""It is important that same- sex couples have equal protections under the law,"" while Specter has made a point of stating that he favors allowing states to put gay- marriage bans in their own constitutions, if they so wish.\ Much larger gaps separate Specter and Hoeffel on some issues, though.\ Especially on guns and taxes.\ Gun control\ Consistently, organizations advocating stricter gun-control laws have given Hoeffel perfect scores, while anti-gun-control groups, such as the National Rifle Association, have given the Democrat ""Fs"" or zeros.\ The NRA has endorsed Specter.\ In September, the gulf between the two candidates on gun control came into bold relief, when the Republican-controlled Congress allowed the assault-weapons ban to expire.\ Specter voted against extending the ban, calling it ineffective. Hoeffel, in contrast, has introduced a bill to reinstate the ban.\ Taxes\ The two candidates have contrasted just as sharply on tax and budgetary issues.\ Specter has boasted of voting for the entire package of President Bush's tax cuts. Hoeffel has voted against those tax cuts almost every time, arguing that they disproportionately benefit millionaires and bloat the deficit.\ The tax breaks have coincided with the addition of the more than 1.5 million jobs to the nation's economy over the past year, Specter has said.\ ""We know there has been [an economic] rebound,"" he said. ""I'm not attributing it to tax cuts, because I don't think you can prove it. But we have had the tax cuts and there has been a resurgence.""\ Hoeffel, a self-described ""deficit hawk,"" favors repealing tax cuts for those making more than $200,000 a year and leaving the cuts in place for everyone else.\ ""Rather than reckless tax cuts for millionaires, we need to balance the budget, pay down the national debt and strengthen the Social Security and Medicare trust funds,"" Hoeffel has stated.\ Hoeffel favors gradually raising the cap on Social Security payroll taxes to strengthen that trust fund. As it stands now, just the first $89,000 of an employee's salary is taxed, which the Democrat considers regressive.\ He also wants to see a 5-cent increase in the gas tax to better fund highway maintenance and mass transit.\ Specter opposes any increase in either the Social Security cap or the gas tax.\ The senator, responding to a Project Vote Smart questionnaire, did not include the economy or tax reform in a list of his top three legislative priorities, mentioning instead the war on terrorism, education and health care.\ Hoeffel, in comparison, put job growth first on his list and has put forward a 29-page economic plan, which is posted on his campaign Web site.\ Health care and education round out his list of legislative priorities, as they do Specter's.\ Health care\ The incumbent touts his role in exponentially increasing research funding for the National Institutes of Health. In one of his latest campaign commercials, actor Michael J. Fox praises the senator for championing medical research.\ In the commercial, Fox doesn't specifically mention stem-cell research, but as a Parkinson's Disease sufferer, he most likely approves of the senator's position on that issue.\ Parting company with pro-life activists, Specter last year publicly urged President Bush to increase the number of stem cell lines available to medical researchers.\ Hoeffel also favors expanding stem cell research.\ The two candidates have sparred, though, over other health-care issues.\ Hoeffel has accused Specter of doing nothing to expand access to medical care in a nation where more than 45 million people lack health insurance.\ Specter, in response, points out that he has introduced legislation to provide universal coverage. The centerpiece of his bill, which has never advanced in the Senate, is a provision allowing small businesses and individuals to purchase health insurance at group rates.\ Hoeffel supports Democratic presidential candidate John F. Kerry's health care plan, which entails allowing citizens to join the health insurance system for federal employees at a cost of hundreds of billions of dollars to the government.\ The two candidates no longer differ over the Medicare prescription drug bill, which passed last year with Specter voting for it and Hoeffel against it.\ Now, they agree on the changes that should be made to the much- maligned Medicare plan. They support reimportation of drugs, with caveats, and they support using the federal government's buying power to negotiate drug discounts with pharmaceutical companies.\ Education\ Specter and Hoeffel both voted for Bush's No Child Left Behind Act and both have supported increasing the size of Pell Grants to help students pay for college.\ They both oppose private-school vouchers and they both favor affirmative action in college admissions.\ They disagree on at least one education matter, though. Hoeffel favors giving states additional federal money to increase the number of teachers, while Specter does not.\ Iraq\ Specter, who has met personally over the years with Saddam Hussein and numerous other world leaders, and Hoeffel, the only Pennsylvania Democrat on the House International Relations Committee, share an intense interest in foreign policy matters.\ Both candidates voted for the resolution that authorized President Bush to invade Iraq.\ And now that the U.S.-led coalition is struggling to maintain security there, both congressmen want more help from America's allies.\ But despite these areas of agreement, Hoeffel has made Iraq an issue in the campaign.\ The Democrat has voiced regret over voting for the invasion resolution, accusing the president's national security adviser and Central Intelligence Agency director of lying to Congress about the presence of weapons of mass destruction.\ Specter has stated that the vote on the Iraq resolution ""cannot appropriately be judged by 20/20 hindsight."" But he also has stated that the invasion might never have been justified had the intelligence been better.\ Judicial confirmations\ Specter has taken heat from Clymer on the right and Hoeffel on the left over his posture toward judicial nominees.\ The issue has assumed importance in this race, because Specter would become chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee next year if he wins re-election next month.\ Curiously, Clymer has accused Specter of fighting against the confirmation of Bush's judicial nominees ""every step of the way,"" even though the senator has voted for the confirmation of every one of them.\ Hoeffel, on the other hand, has blasted Specter for supporting every nominee.\ Specter has maintained that ""the forces of moderation really need me in the Judiciary Committee in the chairman's position.""\ Should Specter lose to Hoeffel, the Judiciary Committee chairmanship would fall to Arizona's Jon Kyl, whom the National Journal rated as the most conservative member of the Senate two years ago.\ With turnover imminent on the Supreme Court, Specter has said he wants to see the president nominate a brilliant legal mind, someone of the caliber of Louis Brandeis or Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., esteemed justices from the first half of the 20th century.\ Environment\ With Iraq and the economy dominating the political debate this year, the Senate candidates have been saying little about the environment.\ But that doesn't mean their positions are alike.\ Hoeffel has consistently received high ratings from the Sierra Club and League of Conservation Voters.\ In June, he voted against the omnibus energy bill, legislation that would have done too little to encourage conservation or promote alternatives to fossil fuels, in the view of environmentalists.\ While the energy bill passed in the House, the Senate has not acted on it.\ Last year, Hoeffel voted against and Specter voted for Bush's forests initiative, a bill that some environmental groups have warned would lead to increased commercial logging in national forests.\ Specter in recent years has received low ratings from environmental groups.\ Last year, the senator voted against legislation that would have delayed the implementation of the Bush administration's new, controversial air-quality regulations for six months.\ The delay would have given the National Academy of Sciences time to study the public-health effects of the new regulations. Although six Republican senators voted for the delay, the legislation was narrowly defeated.\ Clymer\ As the Constitution Party's candidate, Clymer has presented himself as the only conservative in the race, emphasizing his staunch opposition to abortion.\ He favors a narrowing in the separation of church and state.\ ""Every law that is enacted has to have some religious underpinning to it,"" he said. ""Ours happens to be the Judeo- Christian religion.""\ Clymer has stated that he wants to eliminate the U.S. Department of Education. And his party's platform calls for the elimination of the Internal Revenue Service and Food and Drug Administration, as well.\ At a speech in State College last week, Clymer advocated tort reform, saying ""reasonable caps"" are needed in medical malpractice and product liability awards.\ Summers\ Libertarian candidate Betsy Summers participated in both of the Senate candidate debates but has otherwise run a virtually invisible campaign.\ She pledges to never vote for a tax increase and opposes the proposed constitutional ban on gay marriage, saying, ""Nobody should be treated as a second-class citizen."""
553,"Send your transportation questions, complaints and suggestions to Joe Grata c/o The Post-Gazette or e-mail him at jgrata@post-gazette.com. Include your address and phone number, please.\With the longer days and (sometimes) warmer temperatures of spring, road salt is probably the last thing on your mind today. Be cool. Read on.\Donald Gibbon of Point Breeze is upset about long-term damage and costs from the salt we've been dumping on our roads, bridges, parking lots and sidewalks every winter. April showers may not bring his May flowers, because old-fashioned spreaders used on city trucks spewed salt on his flower bed instead of on a snow-covered alley two months ago.\""For 70 years, the soil in that bed has been getting better and better ... and now it has a load of salt in it,"" he complained in a letter to city Public Works Director Guy Costa.\With the city salting the alley this year for the first time in Gibbon's memory, ""I had no choice but to force my dogs to walk through the sharp, stinging `minefield' of salt. They would hobble piteously, stopping to pick up a paw with salt embedded in it.""\Gibbon, a retired geologist and professor, is outraged at the multiple negative effects of winter de-icing salt -- the cost to buy and spread it, impact on the environment, accelerated deterioration of road pavement and bridges and corrosion to vehicles.\His gripe about personal incidents isn't as important as the principle, he said. ""Why are we putting so much salt on our streets? What is it costing us? It is cruel. It is wasteful. There has to be a better way.""\Gibbon suggested an investigative article. Because the Post- Gazette and other news media have examined the salt question many times over the years, he'll have to settle for me for now.\Ergo...\One grim reminder of long-term environmental consequences of road salt -- one you might relate to -- comes when I drive the original east-west section of the Pennsylvania Turnpike between Irwin and Carlisle, where many thousands of tons of road salt have been dumped over the past 50 years as part of a winter ""bare roads"" policy.\Next time, take notice of all the dead trees alongside the turnpike through the mountains, just below the highest elevations, where the most road salt is used. Tree experts blame it on wind- borne ""salt spray"" kicked up by traffic, along with salt-polluted water flushed from the road by rain, drained into the watershed and leached into the soil.\On the other hand, if the turnpike didn't salt the road, it would be extremely hazardous, if not impassable. The number and severity of accidents would swell. Emergency vehicles might be unable to respond. Commerce would be hampered. Motorists, and probably the media, would besiege politicians.\Consequently, the turnpike, state, county, local governments, the majority of drivers and even the motor vehicle manufacturing industry have come to accept salt as a necessary part of winter road and bridge maintenance, using about 10 million tons of it a year in the United States, according to the Salt Institute, representing road salt businesses.\Road salt also is plentiful, cost-effective and less detrimental to the environment than other materials and methods.\We could use all of today's newspaper to present differing views and to argue the pros and cons of road salt.\That's a debate I'm not eager to join, and a debate I couldn't win. But I can share some thoughts and information on the subject.\*Gibbon is on the money about costs. Statewide, PennDOT alone spent $120 million for ""winter services"" during the 1999-2000 winter. The figure was $20 million less than the department budgeted because we had a relatively mild winter, but it's still a lot of gas tax dollars.\*While PennDOT owns the most roads (40,000 miles), and the most heavily traveled roads, including interstates that are high priority for snow removal, it owns sophisticated equipment and uses high-tech methods for de-icing.\For example, salt is stockpiled in domed buildings. Sensors automatically determine the amount of salt to spread to minimize use. Anti-caking agents and pre-sprays ensure uniformity. Equipment that ""lays"" the salt on surfaces has replaced older, broadcast-type spreaders.\*Because of budget constraints, and often because of their size, Pittsburgh and municipalities can't afford such luxuries. However, even with older or outdated equipment, officials should have sensible road-salting policies.\*The worst salt abusers are usually private contractors who do what shopping mall, store and other commercial property owners pay them to do, which is whatever it takes to stay open for business. Salt sometimes is piled on so thick that you can shovel it off the parking lot.\If you want to learn more about how highway agencies spend more than $2 billion a year on winter maintenance, I suggest you contact the Salt Institute, 700 N. Fairfax St., Suite 600, Fairfax Plaza, Alexandria VA 22314, or its Web site at www.saltinstitute.org.\Even though it is industry supported, the Salt Institute is a nonprofit organization that's surprisingly objective and offers e- mail links to other resources.\If you feel I need to learn more about road salt, call my boss. I would be happy to attend the eighth World Salt Symposium in The Hague, Netherlands, May 7-11, despite the fact that I'm on a low- salt diet.\*\Plate du jour. I recently spotted the personalized Pennsylvania license plate FITT-1 on a Nissan Altima GXE at the Route 51-88 intersection in Overbrook. The overweight guy in another car was definitely an UNFITT-1."

Hoeffel favors giving states additional federal money to increase the number of teachers, while Specter does not.\ Iraq\ Specter, who has met personally over the years with Saddam Hussein and numerous other world leaders, and Hoeffel, the only Pennsylvania Democrat on the House International Relations Committee, share an intense interest in foreign policy matters.\ Both candidates voted for the resolution that authorized President Bush to invade Iraq.\ And now that the U.S.-led coalition is struggling to maintain security there, both congressmen want more help from America's allies.\ But despite these areas of agreement, Hoeffel has made Iraq an issue in the campaign.\ The Democrat has voiced regret over voting for the invasion resolution, accusing the president's national security adviser and Central Intelligence Agency director of lying to Congress about the presence of weapons of mass destruction.\ Specter has stated that the vote on the Iraq resolution ""cannot appropriately be judged by 20/20 hindsight."" But he also has stated that the invasion might never have been justified had the intelligence been better.\ Judicial confirmations\ Specter has taken heat from Clymer on the right and Hoeffel on the left over his posture toward judicial nominees.\ The issue has assumed importance in this race, because Specter would become chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee next year if he wins re-election next month.\ Curiously, Clymer has accused Specter of fighting against the confirmation of Bush's judicial nominees ""every step of the way,"" even though the senator has voted for the confirmation of every one of them.\ Hoeffel, on the other hand, has blasted Specter for supporting every nominee.\ Specter has maintained that ""the forces of moderation really need me in the Judiciary Committee in the chairman's position.""\ Should Specter lose to Hoeffel, the Judiciary Committee chairmanship would fall to Arizona's Jon Kyl, whom the National Journal rated as the most conservative member of the Senate two years ago.\ With turnover imminent on the Supreme Court, Specter has said he wants to see the president nominate a brilliant legal mind, someone of the caliber of Louis Brandeis or Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., esteemed justices from the first half of the 20th century.\ Environment\ With Iraq and the economy dominating the political debate this year, the Senate candidates have been saying little about the environment.\ But that doesn't mean their positions are alike.\ Hoeffel has consistently received high ratings from the Sierra Club and League of Conservation Voters.\ In June, he voted against the omnibus energy bill, legislation that would have done too little to encourage conservation or promote alternatives to fossil fuels, in the view of environmentalists.\ While the energy bill passed in the House, the Senate has not acted on it.\ Last year, Hoeffel voted against and Specter voted for Bush's forests initiative, a bill that some environmental groups have warned would lead to increased commercial logging in national forests.\ Specter in recent years has received low ratings from environmental groups.\ Last year, the senator voted against legislation that would have delayed the implementation of the Bush administration's new, controversial air-quality regulations for six months.\ The delay would have given the National Academy of Sciences time to study the public-health effects of the new regulations. Although six Republican senators voted for the delay, the legislation was narrowly defeated.\ Clymer\ As the Constitution Party's candidate, Clymer has presented himself as the only conservative in the race, emphasizing his staunch opposition to abortion.\ He favors a narrowing in the separation of church and state.\ ""Every law that is enacted has to have some religious underpinning to it,"" he said. ""Ours happens to be the Judeo- Christian religion.""\ Clymer has stated that he wants to eliminate the U.S. Department of Education. And his party's platform calls for the elimination of the Internal Revenue Service and Food and Drug Administration, as well.\ At a speech in State College last week, Clymer advocated tort reform, saying ""reasonable caps"" are needed in medical malpractice and product liability awards.\ Summers\ Libertarian candidate Betsy Summers participated in both of the Senate candidate debates but has otherwise run a virtually invisible campaign.\ She pledges to never vote for a tax increase and opposes the proposed constitutional ban on gay marriage, saying, ""Nobody should be treated as a second-class citizen."""
556," To the Editor:\ State Senate candidate Len Gruppo (18th District) has been running television ads trying to make the voters believe he will fight to protect the environment. Unfortunately, Gruppo's rhetoric doesn't match his voting history as a state representative. According to the League of Conservation Voters, Rep. Gruppo has only voted to protect the environment 35 percent of the time. This is just another example of a politician blowing smoke during an election campaign.\ We need a state senator who has a history of being independent- minded and fighting for us. Lisa Boscola, as a state representative, has voted nearly twice as often to protect the environment, according to the League of Conservation Voters. Rep. Boscola has delivered not only on the environment, but also in voting to reform the welfare system, against raising the gas tax, which Rep. Gruppo voted to raise, and against a legislative pay raise, which Rep. Gruppo also voted to raise. Therefore, I am voting for a candidate for the state Senate who runs on her record and has kept her promises, Rep. Lisa Boscola.\ MAE DERR\ PALMER TOWNSHIP"
557,"
Months of raging debate has thrust health care to the top among issues voters care about in the state's U.S. Senate race, according to a new Franklin & Marshall College poll co-sponsored by Times-Shamrock newspapers.
\
Health care topped the list with almost a third of registered voters (31 percent) listing it first, while economic concerns (24 percent) dropped to second. No other issue topped 3 percent.
\
In an F&M poll last month, economic concerns (30 percent) were tops and health care (21 percent) was second.
\
The leading contenders for the Democratic Senate nomination, U.S. Sen. Arlen Specter and Rep. Joe Sestak, D-7, Edgmont, favor the Democratic health care bill approved Sunday by the House. Former U.S. Rep. Pat Toomey and Johnstown housewife Peg Luksik oppose the bill.
\
The poll was conducted between March 15 and Sunday as House Democratic leaders worked furiously to round up enough votes to pass the bill.
\
""That does show you how a major national debate can change the focus and the attention of the American people,"" said G. Terry Madonna, Ph.D., director of the poll and the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at F&M.
\
The poll interviewed 1,119 adult state residents, including 964 registered voters -- 483 Democrats, 353 Republicans, 102 independents/others and 26 who refused to give their party. The margin of error is plus or minus 2.9 percentage points for the 1,119 adults; plus or minus 3.2 points for the registered adults; plus or minus 4.5 points for registered Democrats, and plus or minus 5.2 points for registered Republicans.
\
In the Democratic race, the poll showed Specter ahead of Sestak 32 percent to 12 percent among registered voters with Joseph Vodvarka, who recently joined the race, with 0 percent.
\
In the Republican race, Toomey led Luksik 30 percent to 4 percent.
\
Against the Democrats, Toomey led Specter 33 percent to 29 percent and Sestak 27 percent to 19 percent. Large numbers of voters remain undecided.
\
Madonna and others said they expect health care's rise to the top to be temporary, with jobs and the economy moving back to the top as the health care debate in Congress concludes.
\
""I think health care will be prominent, but I think the main issue will continue to be jobs,"" U.S. Sen. Bob Casey said.
\
In other findings, the poll showed:
\
-- Two-thirds of registered adults (67 percent) believe state legislators use their staff and tax money for their political campaigns.
\
The poll asked the question as a trial of former House Democratic whip Mike Veon and three others on such charges reached a climax last week. A Dauphin County jury convicted Veon and two of the three co-defendants Monday while acquitting the other.
\
The poll said more registered adults (55 percent) had not heard anything about the corruption trials than had heard (44 percent). But of those who had heard something, almost 6 in 10 Pennsylvanians (57 percent) had followed the trials at least somewhat closely, and about the same number knew that Republicans and Democrats have been charged with corruption.
\
-- Distaste for most of Gov. Ed Rendell's plans to fund the state budget.
\
Only a third (33 percent) of registered adults favor reducing the state sales tax from 6 percent to 4 percent while extending it to many now-untaxed goods. More than half (54 percent) oppose the idea.
\
Almost half of residents (49 percent) oppose increasing taxes on companies that extract or sell natural gas. Only slightly more than a third (35 percent) favor the governor's proposed gas tax.
\
Almost half (49 percent) favor imposing tolls on Interstate 80 to raise money for highway and bridge improvements compared to more than 4 in 10 (44 percent) who oppose the idea.
\
""People are really gun-shy about taxes,"" Madonna said. ""We're in a recession ... People don't want any more money taken out of their pockets. Now, it may be that they don't understand the business of taxing companies that extract natural gas, but they do understand that (the tax) would be passed along to them. I think this is a lethal environment to raise taxes, given the state of the economy.""
\
The one new tax heavily favored by residents is on the sale of smokeless tobacco and cigars, which are untaxed. Almost two-thirds (64 percent) favor the tax compared to a third (33 percent) who oppose it.
\
The races for governor are virtually unchanged, with the Democratic candidates bunched together and a wide gap on the Republican side. Two-thirds or more of voters in both races remain undecided.

"
558,"
Five Republicans and a lone Democrat are hoping to fill the state 92nd House District seat held by Rep. Scott Perry.
\
Running are Republicans Scott Derr, Daniel Johnson, Anthony Pugliese, Michael Regan and William Sieg, and Democrat Chuck Comrey.
\
Carroll Township resident Derr, 45, is an independent contractor with Comprehensive Financial Associates, a financial services firm.
\
Johnson, 33, of York Haven is general manager at the Holiday Inn in York.
\
Pugliese, 25, of Fairview Township, had served as director of legislative affairs for the Pennsylvania Department of Community & Economic Development.
\
Regan, 50, of Carroll Township resigned as the state's deputy inspector general.
\
Sieg, 28, of Newberry Township, recently resigned his position as special assistant to the secretary of the state Department of Transportation to run for the seat.
\
The Republican who wins that party's primary will face Comrey, 53, of Dillsburg in the November election. Comrey has been a firefighter in the Harrisburg Bureau of Fire since 1990.
\
The winner of the fall election will fill the seat Perry is leaving open to run for the 4th Congressional District.
\
The York Dispatch asked the candidates a series of questions. One appears below. For the complete Q&A, go to yorkdispatch.com.
\
1. What measures should the state Legislature take to improve Pennsylvania's economy and help create more jobs in the Commonwealth?
\
Comrey: No response.
\
Derr: First, make Pennsylvania a ""right to work"" state. This alone would make Pennsylvania more attractive to companies looking to expand, build or relocate. We have got to work to keep businesses from leaving the Commonwealth in search of a friendlier labor environment. Second, work to reduce the corporate tax rate to make us a competitive state. Having the second highest corporate tax rate in the nation, at 9.99%, companies look elsewhere when making investment decisions. We are truly the gateway to the East Coast and geographically we have an advantage when trying to attract companies to move to Pennsylvania. Make us more competitive as far as the labor market and then lower taxes and you have a win-win.
\
Johnson: Pennsylvania ranks near the bottom on economic performance and job growth. While we know government does not create jobs, it sure does prevent them through high taxes and heavy regulations. Business owners not only pay high property taxes they also pay our ridiculously high corporate tax of 10%, resulting in an economy on life support. How do we fix this? First, we need to eliminate property taxes, not just reduce them, and put that money back in the hands of Pennsylvanians to spend as they see fit. That improves the financial well being of every homeowner in PA and reduces a serious expense for businesses owners who can better spend that money to create jobs and grow. This also improves our state's economy, increases property values, and improves conditions to do business in Pennsylvania. Second, we should eliminate the corporate tax, not just reduce it by a half point each year for 6 years as others suggest. That's too slow. Eliminating it is a decisive action that leads to a positive reaction as we become business friendly. If we loosen the rope of these two killer taxes from around our necks, we can create jobs and fix PA's economy.
\
Pugliese: As a member of the senior leadership of the Department of Community and Economic Development we spoke to over 38,000 companies this past year, which has given me a thorough understanding of what makes Pennsylvania uncompetitive and unattractive to businesses. The following are certainly not all of Pennsylvania's issues, but a few measures that could be taken that would quickly spur job growth and economic activity would be to reduce the Corporate Net Income Tax to 6.99%. Pennsylvania's current CNIT of 9.99% is the second highest in the entire country, only behind Iowa. Furthermore Pennsylvania is one of the only states that not only has a CNIT which taxes earned income but also has a Capital Stock and Franchise tax, which taxes assets regardless of whether the company was profitable or not.
\
We need to reduce the CNIT to 6.99% by a half a percent per year and finally phase out the capital stock and franchise tax and proclaim loud and clear that Pennsylvania is open for business.
\
Pennsylvania was the first state in the nation to implement the Inheritance tax (death tax) and is now one of only eight that still levy's this tax. This death tax is killing our family farms and small businesses. I will introduce legislation to begin the phase out of this outdated and job killing tax.
\
Regan: I believe the number one problem facing Pennsylvania, as well as our federal government, is out-of-control spending. A recently released, nonpartisan, comprehensive analysis ranked Pennsylvania 50th for imposing the heaviest overall taxes on established businesses and 49th on newly created businesses. We can never compete for the good paying jobs our families and children need to remain here if this does not change. This will not change as long as our state government continues to spend billions of dollars more than we collect in revenue, which is what occurred under Governor Rendell. To fix this problem, I will use my experience as Deputy Inspector General to find and eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse in order to reduce wasteful spending. And it does exist. I will also fight for and vote for ""truly"" balanced budgets that do not increase taxes or rely on additional borrowing. As our State Representative, you can count on me to work with like-minded legislators to bring fiscal sanity to Harrisburg, ensure our tax dollars are being spent wisely, and make our Commonwealth more competitive in order to retain and attract the family-sustaining jobs we need.
\
Sieg: Creating jobs and growing our economy is the top job of state government. We need to create an environment that is conducive to private sector investment in our state and our community. The first thing we need to do is get the state's fiscal house in order. As someone who has worked both in the legislative and executive branch with a focus on cutting wasteful spending and ending waste, fraud, and abuse while increasing efficiencies, I will know on day one what we need to do in that regard. We also must focus on lowering taxes. I will support a bill in the legislature that closes the Delaware loophole that some corporations take advantage of to avoid paying taxes, and using that money to lower the corporate net income tax which is among the highest in the nation. We must work to put an end to over regulation and red tape that often slows down job creation and puts our employees at a disadvantage. We also must pass important legislation like Right to Work so we can protect workers and compete with every state.
\
2. The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation can point to a large backlog of road and bridge projects across the state. How dire are Pa.'s transportation needs? And how should it fund those backlogged projects?
\
Comrey: No response.
\
Derr: Transportation is a fundamental responsibility of the Commonwealth. Prioritization of funds and finding misuse of dollars is how we begin to fix our transportation problems. Pennsylvania spends more than $61,000 per highway mile. Is there a specific reason we have as many mile markers, roadside reflectors and so many signs? I think we may be able to live with less. I would also work toward eliminating prevailing wage so we immediately recognize a decrease in project cost. Pennsylvania taxpayers should not have to pay more for a project of the same quality, with the same labor because of prevailing wage rules. Last year Pennsylvania spent hundreds of millions of dollars in Corporate Welfare -- this is not a fundamental responsibility of government, transportation is and the Legislature needs to find better ways to spend those dollars to improve our bridges and roads so we are safe in our travels. Let's prioritize our dollars, eliminate prevailing wage and save millions of dollars while improving our roads and bridges. Lastly, a sale of PA Liquor stores may provide up to $2 billion for a one time sale and half of this money should be allocated towards our roads and bridges that need immediate attention. The other half should go directly to our unfunded pension liabilities.
\
Johnson: Everyone knows our roads are terrible. Repairs take forever, prevailing wage laws increase costs anywhere from 15 to 40 percent unnecessarily, millions are spent ""lobbying"" in Harrisburg and D.C., plus millions more spent on 'beautifying' the highways and building bike trails -- all the while leaving less money for what counts -- spending on roads and bridges. Yes, it's true and obvious to everyone that we have serious transportation problems -- however, I absolutely reject the notion that the only solution is to tax us even more, or borrow more because we will only get the same result -- bad roads, bad bridges and some politician telling us they need more money to fix it all. First we need to prioritize every single tax dollar and make sure its spent properly on the highways and bridges before we build bike trails and plant flowers. Isn't our safety more important right now? Second, eliminate prevailing wage and its costs and finally allow truly competitive construction project bids. Third, let's look into privatizing rest stops and the turnpike and using public-private partnerships on certain roads which reduce state expenses and wasted resources that can be better spent maintaining our infrastructure. We must demand better results.
\
Pugliese: Pennsylvania has significant bridge and road funding issues as well as a very limited ability to maintain - let alone expand - transit service. Over the past decade, study after study has concluded that Pennsylvania's ability to meet transportation system capacity and quality needs is constrained by federal, state and local transportation funding sources. We must maximize user fees and ensure their fair collection, I will work to protect the buying power and improve the effectiveness of current user fees. The commonwealth also must continue to aggressively work to ensure that Pennsylvania not only maintains its share of federal transportation revenues, but also maximizes all federal funding sources to support the long-range transportation program.
\
Recognizing that there is not an endless supply of investment capital, I will work with the General Assembly to pass legislation authorizing public-private partnerships and direct Penn DOT to identify potential applicable projects.
\
We should explore the feasibility of selling real public assets to support a transportation trust fund with investment returns enhancing the annual transportation program. The state must also evaluate what transportation needs can be better done by the private sector.
\
Regan: Without quality infrastructure, we cannot bring jobs to Pennsylvania. However, considering the difficult economic times we face, I do not believe we should be increasing gas taxes when people are already struggling to deal with high energy costs. Another important consideration: Transportation in our state receives taxpayer money to the tune of approximately $60,000 per highway mile, which is higher than 47 other states. I would support efforts already being considered in the House Transportation Committee to address the immediate highway, road, and bridge needs. The Infrastructure Future Fund Act would take every penny derived from selling the state liquor system to fund improvements to our roads and bridges. I would also support changing how Pennsylvania has funded road construction in the past to find more creative methods to improve our roads, including exploring private-public partnerships. I also believe we need to put the focus on the roadways and bridges we already have and postpone new construction proposals unless proven absolutely necessary. We must ensure PennDOT spends every dollar wisely because we can't solve our problems with increased user fees or taxes.
\
Sieg: Having spent the past year working in Governor Corbett's administration as a special assistant to the Secretary of Transportation, I know first hand the challenges Pennsylvania faces when it comes to our infrastructure. There is no doubt that we need to tackle the backlog of deficient bridges and roads here in Pennsylvania. Transportation and infrastructure is a basic function of government and it is one that we need to prioritize. I applaud Governor Corbett's TFAC commission which studied ways which to fund these projects. I do not agree with raising the gas tax with $4 a gallon gasoline. Our reliance on the gas tax as the major funding mechanism for transportation puts the state at a long term challenge due to more fuel efficient cars. We need to find efficiencies in state government and prioritize our spending. We also must explore the potential for public and private partnerships in education, which would allow us to partner with the private sector.
\
3. With a focus on highway safety, state government has adopted new rules for teen drivers and a texting ban for everyone in the past year. Are more measures along those lines needed? Would you support a ban on handheld cell phones? A helmet requirement for motorcyclists? Why or why not?
\
Comrey:No response.
\
Derr: We currently have laws that address careless and reckless driving. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration issued staggering facts that showed eating while driving was as or more distracting than using a hand-held cell phone. I don't think the answer is to establish new laws and close our restaurant drive-thru's. In so many instances we need to enforce the laws, not create new ones. I am not in favor of more laws and I would not support a ban on handheld cell phones. Wearing a helmet is the decision of the rider and any passenger on the motorcycle with the exception of a minor. We do not need government to be any more intrusive than it already is. We should have more freedoms and liberties, not less.
\
Johnson: Apparently personal responsibility has taken a long vacation for some drivers, however, the solution is not to create many more laws. If we aren't careful, advocates for ""more laws"" would ban listening to the radio or occasionally glancing down at the speedometer! Distracted driving in Pennsylvania is a crime and we should rigorously enforce that very broad law. Let's increase distracted driving penalties and fines which would be more effective than bans. Additionally, I do not support a ban on handheld phones because millions use cell phones responsibly and we would be punishing those who are responsible. When it comes to a motorcycle helmet law requirement, I would remind everyone that there IS a helmet requirement for every rider under the age of 21 and for those with less than 2 years riding experience. Although helmets may or may not help in an accident, many other things can go wrong that a helmet would not help in an accident. I support groups of responsible bike enthusiasts that are focused on motorcycle education and reducing accidents through motorcycle awareness and training programs such as A.B.A.T.E. of PA who do just that. More laws and bans aren't the solution.
\
Pugliese: At this point I believe the General Assembly and governor have passed the necessary regulations to protect the safety of Pennsylvanians while traveling. I would not support a ban on cell phones and would oppose a requirement forcing motorcyclists to wear a helmet. I believe that we must weigh the need to protect our citizens with not taking away Pennsylvanian's freedoms. I believe implementing a helmet law and banning cell phones would be taking a step too far and therefore I would oppose these measures and promote the need for personal responsibility.
\
Regan: I support the currently enacted laws in Pennsylvania, which provide stricter rules for teen drivers and ban texting while driving. The safety of our youngest and most inexperienced drivers is of critical importance, and the new laws are aimed at accomplishing this by placing limits on teen drivers as they learn and become more experienced. Also, studies have shown the deadly link between texting while driving and fatal accidents. I am a motorcyclist, and while I recognize the inherent dangers of motorcycling and choose to wear a helmet, I believe that, at age 21, motorcyclists should be able to make their own decisions in this regard.
\
Sieg: I would need to see specifics for the bills that you mention, but my feeling is that the state should take a limited approach to government and stick to core functions. Obviously public safety is one of those functions, however I do not believe that state government should focus on fiscal discipline, job creation, education, and transportation.
\
4. Residents have long complained about property taxes, though in recent years, Act 1 has succeeded in stemming the rapid increase in school property taxes. Does the state need property tax reform? Why or why not? And, if so, how would you approach the issue? Should property tax relief be restricted to homesteads (a homeowners' primary place of residence) or provided for all property owners? Why?
\
Comrey: No response.
\
Derr: It is difficult to determine if Act 1 has really provided any property tax relief to my family and my neighbors. If it had not been enacted it concerns me how much our taxes may have been increased. However, I can tell you that gambling dollars have not provided us the tax relief we were promised. Unfortunately, before the ink dried on that legislation, those dollars were pirated before it was signed by Governor Rendell. Those funds need to be ""re-designated"" for the purpose they were originally intended -- education. Property taxes don't need reformed, they need eliminated. Property tax is one of the most unfair taxes we have because it is based not on your ability to pay it, but on what you own. Ideally, to be in a situation where all property tax would be eliminated would be best, however the first place we need to make this a priority is for homesteads.
\
Johnson: First, Act 1 was NOT successful in holding back increased property taxes. It was supposed to save homeowners a few hundred dollars by taxing casinos. It did nothing to solve school funding problems, or increased school costs and hasn't stopped rising property taxes. YES we need property tax reform -- we also have to address costs and quality of education. 100 school districts will declare financial distress -- meaning the state will have to step in but property owners will have to foot the bill. I am the only candidate who advocates for a complete elimination of this tax; returning approximately $10 Billion to the people. Education is a fundamental responsibility of any state -- so why are property owners the ones who pay the bulk of the expense? That's not right. We fix that by eliminating property taxes and relying on our state sales tax -- which was originally enacted in the 1950s to pay for Education. It still is the ""PA Education Sales Tax."" This removes the burden off a select few and allows for more taxpayer control. Eliminating it creates 130,000 jobs, improves property values and ensures fixed income families won't lose their home if they can't pay their taxes.
\
Pugliese: I was proud to work on the recent legislation that limited local government's ability to increase taxes year after year. However, I do believe we must to more to protect our citizens, especially our seniors on fixed incomes from the rising school and property taxes. Recently two members of the general assembly have proposed legislation to eliminate property taxes, Rep. Cox and Rep. Seth Grove. At this time I believe Rep. Grove's legislation is the most responsible plan and would support his efforts if elected.
\
Regan: We must support dramatic reforms to protect taxpayers, focus funding on students, and ensure teachers have the tools they need to succeed in the classroom. You can trust I'll stand up to the politicians in Harrisburg and put these concerns first. There are various proposals currently being considered to reform property taxpayers. While we still need to see the details to have confidence these proposals can do what they say -- eliminate property taxes -- we can take the first step and protect senior citizens in danger of losing their homes due to escalating property taxes now. I would support a proposal to eliminate property taxes on those 65 years of age or older who meet specific income thresholds. The funding for this proposal would come from gaming proceeds set aside to pay for these costs. I would also fight to force the politicians to honor their promises to use gambling proceeds only for property tax relief - not their pet projects that only hurt taxpayers and waste our valuable tax dollars. The promise of property tax relief was the only reason most people supported gaming in the Commonwealth and must be fulfilled.
\
Sieg: Over the past few months I have knocked on thousands of doors, and property taxes are an issue that has been a topic a majority of the voters has brought up. I believe that we absolutely need property tax reform, and I am the one candidate who voters can count on to go fight for real reform. Of all the proposals out there I really like Seth Grove's approach to property tax reform. For the past several years, plans which mandated statewide tax increases (income or sales) have been defeated by wide margins in the Legislature. The challenge with these plans is that they lead to large tax increases and force the decisions on education funding away from local school districts and to state Bureaucrats. Representative Grove's approach is a county-by-county decision-making process that allows voters to vote on if they want to raise sales or income taxes to offset property taxes. One size fits all has not worked, and I think this approach which includes voters gives us our best chance at property tax elimination.
\
5. State funding for education, and especially higher education, has declined under the Corbett administration. Do you agree or disagree with the approach the administration has taken toward education funding? Explain your answer. What changes would you recommend in terms of funding education?
\
Comrey: No response.
\
Derr: The education funding issue shows how Pennsylvania is not competitive when it comes to attracting businesses to the Commonwealth. We have our graduates leaving the state for better opportunities elsewhere. If the state provides a competitive place to do business then these businesses will provide good paying jobs and we can retain a quality work force here. Right now, our schools and universities need to do more with less, and teachers, parents and students will need to work together to accomplish the goal of providing our kids with a quality education. Again, as I stated above immediate tax relief can be provided in the form of eliminating prevailing wage laws. It is the quickest way to reduce expenses on projects over $25,000 to our schools.
\
Johnson: Despite billions spent on Education, scores have stagnated, graduation rates aren't great and costs continue to climb --while we see our property taxes increase. With those results, does pouring more money in seem like the right solution to you? If this were a business -- would you invest in it? When it comes to funding -- let's eliminate the property tax and use our sales tax to fund schools. It relieves the burden on property owners while generating a revenue stream on consumption from goods and services, including out-of-state businesses and tourists visiting Pennsylvania. Costs need to be reduced as well. We need to address prevailing wage to ensure that construction / improvement projects will be at fair market bids while cutting needless debt and expenses. School choice will prevent families from being forced to send their child to a failing school just because of their ZIP code. The resulting competition will drive improvements between schools. Let's not handicap school boards either -- let's permit incentives for teachers who deliver results. Offer someone a bonus for meeting a goal and they will work to achieve it. Lets reward those hard working teachers who deliver and drive performance forward.
\
Pugliese: Education is approximately 1/3 of the total state budget. This means that to remain solvent, fulfill our legal obligation to balance a budget, and stay true to the commitment to taxpayers and not raise taxes, we must evaluate how we target our education dollars to ensure accountability and a high quality system that serves all of Pennsylvania's students in all levels of education (early childhood to higher education). In no way does ""evaluating"" the system imply less of a commitment to education. In fact, it implies that the state needs to be more accountable to taxpayers by educating our future workforce in a manner that is sustainable.
\
Regan: My wife and I chose to send our four children to local public schools. I understand and support the need for a quality education and supported the Legislature's past restoration of the block grant funding that was not included in the Governor's budget proposal. However, we do need to consider some facts. Pennsylvania's taxpayers spend $26 billion a year on public education. This amount is an increase of 50% over the last 15 years while student population has declined 10%. Like so many budget debates, the current battle over school funding always revolves around providing more dollars, without any thought put toward controlling expenses. The funding fight is important for the short-term stability of our schools, but we need to make important changes. I will support reforming the prevailing wage laws. I will support reforms to the state pension system that cost far more than the retirement plans of the private sector. I will also support changes to the school funding mechanism that has not changed since 1991 and that is based on formulas that just don't work anymore. These changes must maintain local control, protect taxpayers, and reduce our tax burden -- not add to it.
\
Sieg: Education funding is a fundamental function of state government and I believe that we need to make sure we adequately fund education. School districts found themselves in trouble when they over relied on stimulus money that they knew would go away. Governor Corbett has presented two budgets with record spending for education from a state contribution standpoint, but it seems many school districts are more interested in partisan politics than accepting the tough times that so many of our families face. I would fight to make sure we have a fair funding system that took into account population growth. I will also fight to make sure we spend what we need to, and I would have supported increasing the basic education subsidy like the legislature did last year.
\
6. Why should voters cast a vote for you on Election Day? What qualities make you best suited for the position?
\
Comrey: No response.
\
Derr: The coming years are not going to be easy. Our Commonwealth faces serious issues regarding our economy, infrastructure, education, and an underfunded pension obligation that is about to hit all of us in the pocket. We need a legislator who is willing to tell people the truth about where we stand economically, not just someone who has the desire, but someone who has the financial and business skills that understands these issues. I am the onlycandidate with 20 years of private sectorexperience. I am the onlycandidate who is a small business owner.As a small business owner I know what it takes to operate a budget, not just manage one. I am a Certified Financial Planner certificant, and I have a B.S. degree in Finance. This is not a career choice for me, but rather a decision based on my concern for our Commonwealth. I will not take a pension, a state car, or per diem, and think all the candidates should do the same and lead by example. You can't ask the taxpayer to make sacrifices and not make them yourself. As a Marine Veteran, I felt a calling to serve my country and look at this role in much the same wayJohnson: What kind of Pennsylvania do we want? More of the same politicians delivering below average results or someone with a new vision to get Pennsylvania off the bottom and back up where she belongs! I have no family ties to politicians or lobbyists and I haven't spent my life in government living off your tax dollars. Like you, I have been in the real world raising a family while forging a successful career of 19 years by turning around failed businesses using common sense solutions. To fix the problems in Harrisburg, we need proven experience turning around difficult situations if we want to turn the economy around and create jobs. As a recognized leader in Pennsylvania's 2nd largest industry, I know how to move us forward. I'm not interested in pensions, pay raises, perks or per diems. I'm not a career politician either. In fact I am the only candidate who supports term limits with 3-term limit on myself. I don't want to lower taxes, I want to ELIMINATE them and the burdens put on our backs. For my family and yours, I ask for the chance to do what I do best - turn things around and fix Pennsylvania.
\
Pugliese: I believe I am the best candidate to be your state representative because people are tired of candidates running for office making promises and then not living up to those promises. I have reduced my department's spending by over 35 percent. When I joined the department of Community and Economic Development we had 127 programs, within the first year as a senior leader of the department I helped reduce those 127 programs to 56. In regards to WAMS, I oversaw the elimination of all WAMS in Pennsylvania, saving taxpayers over $48 million. So while my opponents will make promises, I will show you what I have done because I do believe, like many of you, that actions speak louder than words. Furthermore, as the Director of Legislative Affairs for the Department of Community and Economic Development, if you were a Senator or Representative in Pennsylvania and had a business or economic development question, I was the individual you would have contacted. I helped advise the General Assembly on what the commonwealth needs to do in order to get the economy back on track and help Pennsylvania create more good family sustaining jobs.
\
Regan: Like many of my neighbors, I believe we need citizen representatives who have the courage to go to Harrisburg and change government -- not be changed by the politicians or trappings once there. I want to continue to serve and to use my leadership skills and experience balancing budgets and controlling costs to protect local taxpayers, reform state government, and create a positive environment for local job creators. I've stood up to dangerous criminals -- you can trust I'll stand up to the politicians in Harrisburg and put your concerns first again. And I can always be counted on to protect our strong Pro-Life, Pro-Family, and Pro-Second Amendment values.
\
Sieg:This district needs someone who will go to Harrisburg and fight for this community. I am the only candidate who has worked for both the legislative and executive branches of state government. I am also the only candidate who has worked on cutting state spending, including working with a commission that identified $450 million of wasteful spending.
\
In addition to any professional qualities, I think my perspective makes me the strongest candidate. As a husband and father of a young son with another baby on the way, I know what working families face every month. My wife Betsy and I are like every family here in this district. We stay on a budget, we work hard to provide for our family, and we are always trying to set a good example for our boy Will, and we will do the same for our newest arrival. Being the father of two, I think it is immoral the way government continues to saddle our future generations with more debt and less opportunity. As your State Representative, I'll fight for your family like I am fighting for my own.

Months of raging debate has thrust health care to the top among issues voters care about in the state's U.S. Senate race, according to a new Franklin & Marshall College poll co-sponsored by Times-Shamrock newspapers.
\
Health care topped the list with almost a third of registered voters (31 percent) listing it first, while economic concerns (24 percent) dropped to second. No other issue topped 3 percent.
\
In an F&M poll last month, economic concerns (30 percent) were tops and health care (21 percent) was second.
\
The leading contenders for the Democratic Senate nomination, U.S. Sen. Arlen Specter and Rep. Joe Sestak, D-7, Edgmont, favor the Democratic health care bill approved Sunday by the House. Former U.S. Rep. Pat Toomey, and Johnstown housewife Peg Luksik oppose the bill.
\
The poll was conducted between March 15 and Sunday as House Democratic leaders worked furiously to round up enough votes to pass the bill.
\
""That does show you how a major national debate can change the focus and the attention of the American people,"" said G. Terry Madonna, Ph.D., director of the poll and the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at F&M.
\
The poll interviewed 1,119 adult state residents, including 964 registered voters -- 483 Democrats, 353 Republicans, 102 independents/others and 26 who refused to give their party. The margin of error is plus or minus 2.9 percentage points for the 1,119 adults; plus or minus 3.2 points for the registered adults; plus or minus 4.5 points for registered Democrats; and plus or minus 5.2 points for registered Republicans.
\
In the Democratic race, the poll showed Mr. Specter ahead of Mr. Sestak 32 to 12 percent among registered voters with Joseph Vodvarka, who recently joined the race, with 0 percent.
\
In the Republican race, Mr. Toomey led Mrs. Luksik 30 to 4 percent.
\
Against the Democrats, Mr. Toomey led Mr. Specter 33 to 29 percent and Mr. Sestak 27 to 19 percent. Large numbers of voters remain undecided.
\
Dr. Madonna and others said they expect health care's rise to the top to be temporary with jobs and the economy moving back to the top as the health care debate in Congress concludes.
\
""I think health care will be prominent, but I think the main issue will continue to be jobs,"" U.S. Sen. Bob Casey said.
\
In other findings, the poll showed:
\
-- Two-thirds of registered adults (67 percent) believe state legislators use their staff and tax money for their political campaigns. The poll asked the question as a trial of former House Democratic Whip Mike Veon and three others on such charges reached a climax last week. A Dauphin County jury convicted Mr. Veon and two of three Monday while acquitting the other.
\
The poll said more registered adults (55 percent) had not heard anything about the corruption trials than had heard (44 percent). But of those who had heard something, almost six in 10 Pennsylvanians (57 percent) had followed the trials at least somewhat closely, and about the same number knew that Republicans and Democrats have been charged with corruption.
\
-- Distaste for most of Gov. Ed Rendell's plans to fund the state budget. Only a third (33 percent) of registered adults favor reducing the state sales tax from 6 to 4 percent, while extending it to tax many untaxed goods. More than half (54 percent) oppose the idea.
\
Almost half of residents (49 percent) oppose increasing taxes on companies that extract or sell natural gas. Only slightly more than a third (35 percent) favor the governor's proposed gas tax.
\
Almost half (49 percent) favor imposing tolls on Interstate 80 to raise money for highway and bridge improvements compared to more than four in ten (44 percent) who oppose the idea.
\
""People are really gun shy about taxes right,"" Dr. Madonna said. ""We're in a recession ... People don't want any more money taken out of their pockets. Now, it may be that they don't understand the business of taxing companies that extract natural gas, but they do understand that it (the tax) would be passed along to them. I think this is a lethal environment to raise taxes, given the state of the economy.""
\
The one new tax heavily favored by residents is on the sale of smokeless tobacco and cigars, which are untaxed. Almost two-thirds (64 percent) favor the tax compared to a third (33 percent) who oppose it.
\
The races for governor are virtually unchanged, with the Democratic candidates bunched together and a wide gap on the Republican side. Two-thirds or more of voters in both races remain undecided.

Oil's firm grip
\
Editor: Regarding the July 11 letter from the American Petroleum Institute:
\
It's nice to see someone from the oil industry finally mention jobs and security, albeit for a fleeting moment. But John Felmy's letter isn't really about the best interests of the American people; it's a plea in defense of Big Oil's stranglehold on our economy, environment and security.
\
The tax breaks and other cozy arrangements that Mr. Felmy talks about are exactly why we need to break our dependency on Big Oil for our energy needs and invest in clean and renewable sources. The American Petroleum Institute would prefer us to ignore the BP disaster and grovel like Rep. Joe Barton.
\
Unfortunately for Big Oil, we're smarter than that. A recent poll found that more than 60 percent of Americans want Congress to pass clean energy and climate legislation that will reduce pollution, strengthen our national security and create nearly 2 million new jobs, including 78,000 in Pennsylvania.
\
We're counting on Sen. Bob Casey to be a leader in breaking Big Oil's grip on the U.S. and establishing our clean energy future.

Rights evaporate
\
Editor: I'm interested in the legislation that is most generously called the Conservation Pooling Act, and which they prefer to call the Fair Pooling act.
\
It's detractors refer to it as the Forced Pooling Act.
\
It allows the gas drilling companies to drill under your property whether you want them to or not. They must pay the minimum royalties for that gas. That certainly sounds fair, doesn't it?
\
Even though you own the property and the mineral rights, the state will take away your mineral rights from you. It will not allow you to negotiate more favorable terms for those rights. Nor will it allow you to refuse to allow drilling under your property.
\
So the state can, in affect, take your rights away from you just as in eminent domain.
\
Of course eminent domain can only be used for the good of the people, while this deal can be used for the good of a profitable gas company.
\
You don't think the state should give for-profit-corporations the right to just take your mineral rights without your permission? Well, our elected officials who were elected to look out for our best interests will take care of us, right? I mean, just who bought their votes? You or the corporations?

Gas tax regressive
\
Editor: We are moving inexorably towards another new regressive tax. And once again The Times-Tribune will support it to the hilt.
\
Corporations do not pay taxes. They simply collect it from consumers through increased prices and pass it on to the government.
\
These taxes hurt the poor much more than the rich but are popular with politicians because they are invisible.
\
I imagine the severance/extraction tax is popular because ""Joe Six-pack"" thinks the money will come from the deep pockets of the gas companies or the soon-to-be-rich land owners. Sorry, Joe, if you use gas it will come from your pocket.
\
Many families are cutting expenses to the bone and don't need additional tax burdens. Maybe, just maybe, we should demand that our elected officials also cut expenses.
\
If they don't, vote 'em out.

Quiet pride
\
Editor: With so much discussed on the streets of Dunmore about the borough's financial troubles, I found it very heartwarming that a man who was walking his dog near Dunmore High School showed a different side of a Dunmorean.
\
As I sat in my car waiting for my daughter, I saw this man not only pick up trash that was close to the sidewalk, but also walk up onto the grass to clean up the area around the school. My son sat in the car with me and asked if I saw what the man was doing.
\
I told him to watch this man. He is the epitome of Dunmore pride.
\
I thanked this man for such a wonderful lesson for my children and for caring about our town. He humbly said that it was something for him to do on his walk.

Small guy crushed
\
Editor: Many Americans were taken aback when, after the recent BP oil spill hearings BP Chairman Carl Svenberg referred to people in the Gulf as the ""small people.
\
I guess that he meant to say people who get their hands dirty, are on the financial margin and don't pay capital gains tax.
\
But I think most Americans believe that we are in an era where the big money people, Wall Street bankers, Big Oil and their lobbyists, really do see the rest of us as the ""small people.""
\
Two same-day news stories, seemingly unrelated, make my point.
\
First, we are sending National Guardsmen to help quell illegal immigration on our southwestern borders. Intrinsic to this issue is rampant smuggling of drugs and people across these porous borders and the spillover of brutal drug wars into our border states.
\
While taxpayers - the small people - pay the enormous costs of trying to stem illegal immigration and drug smuggling we read that Wachovia Bank - now Wells Fargo - admitted its failure to monitor and report its involvement in a series of massive money laundering deals by Mexican drug cartels. Wachovia's admission came along with a ""deal"" with prosecutors of $160 million in fines and penalties. This is the largest violation of anti-money laundering laws in U.S. history.
\
Laundering in this instance facilitated drug smugglers buying four large jets used to move 22 tons of cocaine. This is an appalling crime against our country.
\
Wachovia bankers and the board - the Big People - don't pay fines nor are they prosecuted; the shareholders get tagged for the costs.
\
As Wachovia was in the process of a U.S. taxpayer- backed buyout deal and laundering drug money, it still managed an $8 million loan to the National Republican Congressional Committee while denying credit and loans to regular customers.
\
Wachovia got a bailout and a sweet deal while our Guardsmen and the ""small people"" carry the burden.
\
Does anyone care?

Inflated nostalgia
\
Editor: I like nothing more than a trip down memory lane with rose-tinted glasses, so I was delighted to see Dave Sevensky II's letter (July 11) harkening to the days of double-digit returns on CDs. What changes do we need, asked the writer, to make this happen again?
\
Well, higher interest rates all around. Those days of the early 1980s under President Reagan saw the 30-year fixed rate on mortgages rise to 15.8 percent (now 5.02 percent).
\
A payment on a $100,000 mortgage is $538.04 at the current rate. If those rates went up ""like they did during the Reagan years of the early 1980s"", that same mortgage would cost a new homeowner $1,328.64 a month. Instead of paying $93,696 extra in interest over the life of your loan, you'd pay $378,311 extra - over four times more.
\
This may be the kind of economic ""change"" some people want. I'm happy with the party that renowned economists such as Dan Ackman at Forbes and Roger Altman at the Wall Street Journal have proven are best for the economy when it comes to employment, returns on tangible capital and annual income growth. And it's not the party of Reagan. The Republicans would leave most of us with no change.

562,"See also ""Specter leads endorsement race"" and ""Yeakel returns to Hill isssue,"" by TIM REEVES, The Morning Call\ Bill Clinton and President Bush swapped Halloween wisecracks yesterday, then swiped at each other over the economy in a fast- paced last weekend of campaigning for the White House. Ross Perot said he could win an upset if supporters took five friends ""crazy or sane"" to vote with them.\ Bush was dogged by fresh disclosures about the arms-for-hostages scandal of the 1980s, even though Clinton steered clear of referring to it. ""Iran-Contra haunts you"" read a banner trailed by a small plane that circled a presidential rally in Wisconsin.\ Daily tracking polls from ABC and CNN-USA Today reported a three- point spread for Clinton, a statistical dead heat given the surveys' margin of error, with Perot a distant third. A CBS-New York Times poll gave Clinton more breathing room: an 8-point edge over Bush with Perot way behind.\ The pace was intense with only three days to run. Bush battled a cold; Clinton got an early start after reaching his hotel room after 2 a.m.\ Both men targeted states essential to their electoral strategy. Bush boarded the Spirit of America for several Wisconsin whistlestops, and supplemented his train tour with interviews with about two dozen reporters.\ Clinton began his day with pancakes in Georgia and was ending his campaigning with a televised town hall meeting in Milwaukee. In between lay Davenport, Iowa, numerous speeches and thousands of hands to shake.\ In Decatur, Ga., he noted Bush's earlier claim that the democratic ticketmates were crazy.\ ""I'll tell you what I think is crazy. Crazy is a president who says we ought to re-elect him with unemployment going up, incomes going down, poverty going up, one in ten Americans on food stamps, 100,000 people with no health insurance every month. Now that is crazy,"" Clinton said.\ Speaking to a crowd numbered in the thousands, he urged supporters to look beyond the charges and counter-charges of the long campaign.\ ""The truth is that most of the charges in this campaign don't amount to a hill of beans,"" he said. ""The real thing that matters is not our yesterdays but our tomorrows. And I ask you to think for a moment about our tomorrows.""\ The Arkansas governor also poked at Bush for asking Americans to trust him with the economy for four more years. ""That's like hiring Gen. Sherman for fire commissioner in Georgia.""\ Bush fought on with his message that the economy is improving, and is far better than Clinton makes it out to be.\ Under Clinton, he said, ""every day's going to be Halloween -- fright and terror ... He talks about government investing. The answer is not to have government investing by taking more of your taxes, the answer is for us to stimulate small business by tax relief, less regulation and less lawsuits that finish off a lot of these small businesses.""\ Bush continued his attack on Clinton's character, but it was his own truthfulness that was challenged by the disclosure of notes belonging to former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, who was indicted in Washington on Friday.\ The notes said then-Vice President Bush attended a Jan. 7, 1986, meeting where President Reagan and aides discussed a swap of arms for hostages with Iran. ""VP favored,"" the notes said, which seemed to contradict Bush's earlier assertion that he didn't know of an arms- for-hostage swap until months later.\ Bush, at a train stop in Oshkosh, dismissed the controversy as ""silly little charges"" he has responded to repeatedly -- the work of Democrats trying to stop a ""free fall in the polls.""\ Clinton did not mention the subject in his campaign speeches, and when reporters asked him about White House charges that politics were involved, he said simply, ""I thought it was in an indictment.""\ Aides said Clinton preferred to stress his call for economic change in the last 72 hours of his marathon quest for the White House.\ But vice presidential candidate Al Gore wasn't as reticent.\ ""I just think the main issue is the economy, but if the president wants to say that the main issue is trust, then the president had better be prepared to explain why he has told this story for six years that Caspar Weinberger's memo now shows is untrue,"" Gore told supporters in his home state of Tennessee.\ Vice President Dan Quayle countered in Illinois, where he accused Clinton of a ""huge coverup"" of his draft report.\ Perot spoke in Tampa, Fla., and then headed for Kansas City, Mo. Aides said he had purchased 3-1/2 hours of network time for today and tomorrow.\ In his speech in Tampa, Perot vowed to cut government red tape that he said was blocking important work on combatting AIDS.\ He uttered a prediction of victory.\ ""All these old boys that used to make a living taking polls are going to be looking for work selling peanuts or something,"" he said to cheers. He can win, he said, if ""my supporters can get five friends, crazy or sane"" to vote with them."

Imagine for a minute, just a minute, that someone running for president was able to actually tell the truth, the real truth, to the American people about what would be the best -- I mean really the best -- energy policy for the long-term economic health and security of our country. I realize this is a fantasy, but play along with me for a minute. What would this mythical, totally imaginary, truth-telling candidate say?
\
For starters, he or she would explain that there is no short-term fix for gasoline prices. Prices are what they are as a result of rising global oil demand from India, China and a rapidly growing Middle East on top of our own increasing consumption, a shortage of ""sweet"" crude that is used for the diesel fuel that Europe is highly dependent upon and our own neglect of effective energy policy for 30 years.
\
Cynical ideas, like the McCain-Clinton summertime gas-tax holiday, would only make the problem worse, and reckless initiatives like the Chrysler-Dodge-Jeep offer to subsidize gasoline for three years for people who buy its gas guzzlers are the moral equivalent of tobacco companies offering discounted cigarettes to teenagers.
\
I can't say it better than my friend Tim Shriver, the chairman of Special Olympics, did in a Memorial Day essay in The Washington Post: ""So Dodge wants to sell you a car you don't really want to buy, that is not fuel-efficient, will further damage our environment, and will further subsidize oil states, some of which are on the other side of the wars we're currently fighting ... The planet be damned, the troops be forgotten, the economy be ignored: Buy a Dodge.""
\
No, our mythical candidate would say the long-term answer is to go exactly the other way: Guarantee people a high price of gasoline -- forever. This candidate would note that $4-a-gallon gasoline is really starting to impact driving behavior and buying behavior -- in way that $3-a-gallon gas did not. The first time we got such a strong price signal, after the 1973 oil shock, we responded as a country by demanding and producing more fuel-efficient cars. But as soon as oil prices started falling in the late 1980s and early 1990s, we let Detroit get us readdicted to gas guzzlers, and the price steadily crept back up to where it is today.
\
We must not make that mistake again. Therefore, what our mythical candidate would be proposing, argues the energy economist Philip Verleger Jr., is a ""price floor"" for gasoline: $4 a gallon for regular unleaded, which is still half the going rate in Europe today. Washington would declare that it would never let the price fall below that level. If it does, it would increase the federal gasoline tax on a monthly basis to make up the difference between the pump price and the market price.
\
To ease the burden on the less well-off, ""anyone earning under $80,000 a year would be compensated with a reduction in the payroll taxes,"" said Verleger. Or, he suggested, the government could use the gasoline tax to buy back gas guzzlers from the public and ""crush them."" But the message going forward to every car buyer and carmaker would be this: The price of gasoline is never going back down. Therefore, if you buy a big gas guzzler today, you are locking yourself into perpetually high gasoline bills. You are buying a pig that will eat you out of house and home. At the same time, if you, a manufacturer, continue building fleets of non-hybrid gas guzzlers, you are condemning yourself, your employees and shareholders to oblivion.
\
What a cruel thing for a candidate to say? I disagree. Every decade we look back and say: ""If only we had done the right thing then, we would be in a different position today."" But no politician dared to do so. When gasoline was $2 a gallon, the government never would have imposed a $2 tax. Now that it is $4 a gallon, the government should at least keep it there, since it is really having the right effect.
\
I was visiting my local Toyota dealer in Bethesda, Md., last week to trade in one hybrid car for another. There is now a two-month wait to buy a Prius, which gets close to 50 miles per gallon. The dealer told me I was lucky. My hybrid was going up in value every day, so I didn't have to worry about waiting a while for my new car. But if it were not a hybrid, he said, he would deduct each day $200 from the trade-in price for every $1-a-barrel increase in the OPEC price of crude oil. When I saw the rows and rows of unsold SUV's parked in his lot, I understood why.
\
We need to make a structural shift in our energy economy. Ultimately, we need to move our entire fleet to plug-in electric cars. The only way to get from here to there is to start now with a price signal that will force the change.
\
Barack Obama had the courage to tell voters that the McCain-Clinton summer gas-giveaway plan was a fraud. Wouldn't it be amazing if he took the next step and put the right plan before the American people? Wouldn't that just be amazing?

HARRISBURG -- Gas drillers would have to provide more information about chemicals they use and improve casings to protect groundwater from contamination under rules state environmental regulators plan to vote on today.
\
The rules, which would take effect in December, would help people assess their risk level and respond appropriately if an accident occurs, said Charles Christen, director of the Center for Healthy Environments & Communities at the University of Pittsburgh.

""When you know what is going into the ground, you're able to track it, follow it, know the amount of contamination and determine whether it's a contamination of serious note or whether it's really not harmful at all to humans,"" said Christen, who spoke Monday at the Jewish Community Center in Squirrel Hill.

The rules would require companies to provide a descriptive list of chemical additives, the percentage of each and total volume of fluid. They would have to identify the water source and say how much of it had been recycled.
\
Members of the Marcellus Shale Coalition helped craft the disclosure rules and support them, industry trade group President Kathryn Klaber said. Companies are providing some of the information, she said.
\
Separately, Gov. Ed Rendell met in Harrisburg with key lawmakers and industry officials about options for a proposed natural gas tax. No agreement could be reached without participation of Senate Republicans, who declined to attend the meeting in the governor's office.
\
Rep. Bill Adolph, R-Delaware County, said Range Resources, Chesapeake Energy, Chief Oil & Gas and Southwestern Energy sent representatives to the meeting.
\
""We just discussed a range of options but nothing definite,"" Rendell said.
\
Industry executives declined comment after the meeting. So did Rep. Tim Solobay, D-Canonsburg, representing the House Democratic Caucus.
\
Time appears to be working against passage of a gas tax this year, said Klaber, who added she was not invited to the meeting. Rendell and Senate Republicans could meet today, but senators are scheduled to close the legislative session Thursday.
\
""At this point, it really is in the hands of our elected officials,"" Klaber said. ""Your guess is as good as mine, but the clock doesn't seem to be working to help make it happen this year.""
\
House Minority Leader Sam Smith, R-Punxsutawney, who voted against a recent House bill, said large gas companies generally do not oppose a tax but smaller, longtime Pennsylvania companies are concerned.
\
""Those are the big guys,"" he said, gesturing to the governor's office where industry officials were gathered, ""and they've always been in that position.""
\
The House bill proposed a levy of 39 cents per 1,000 cubic feet tied to the price of natural gas. At current gas prices, the tax would amount to about 10 percent.
\
Senate President Pro Tempore Joe Scarnati, R-Jefferson County, has said the Senate would consider an Arkansas-style tax structure with incentives for industry. That would amount to a 1.5 percent tax for several years before rising to 5 percent.
\
Senate leaders expressed concern about the constitutionality of the House-passed bill.
"
565,"
Gov. Ed Rendell said Friday there's ""no way"" he would sign a gas tax bill similar to one being talked about in the state Senate.
\
House members approved a plan that would add a 39-cent tax for every thousand cubic feet of natural gas extracted. Senators are talking about a 1.5 percent tax that ramps up to 5 percent after several years.
\
""There's no way we're going to give a give-away to the industry,"" said Rendell, who leaves office at the end of the year. ""There's no way we'll have five years at 1.5 percent. There's no way. Nobody does that.""
\
Gas industry officials split over whether lawmakers should approve a natural gas tax.
\
Drillers should pay something, but the House version is too high and ""onerous,"" said former Gov. Tom Ridge, a consultant for the Marcellus Shale Coalition, a Cecil-based trade association.
\
""You want to socialize the benefit of this transformative opportunity,"" Ridge said. ""Some of that obviously needs to be shared with the county governments and local governments.""
\
The Pennsylvania Independent Oil and Gas Association, which represents Marcellus and conventional industries, opposes any tax, said Lou D'Amico, president and executive director.
\
""Our biggest concern is that we are competing with every other shale play in the country for investment capital,"" D'Amico said.
\
The candidates for governor are divided on the issue, too.
\
Dan Onorato, the Allegheny County executive and Democrat, said he supports a tax lower than the House version but higher than the Senate's.
\
His Republican opponent, Tom Corbett, the state attorney general, opposes any tax on the gas industry but wants stricter regulations that would require companies to disclose chemicals they use, limit water use and increase fines for violators, an aide said.
\
Separately, the Marcellus Shale Coalition released a list of guiding principles yesterday for members to voluntarily create safe working areas, protect the environment and operate with transparency.
\
""We're in this collectively,"" said Kathryn Klaber, president of the coalition. ""It's not about bad or good. It's about making everything better.""

Three of the four ballot questions in New Jersey Tuesday should be easy ''yes"" votes for citizens interested in preserving open space, rebuilding infrastructure and creating fair congressional voting districts.
\
A ""yes"" vote on Ballot Question 1 would amend the state Constitution to create a permanent bipartisan commission to redraw congressional districts every 10 years. It would replace the old, slow system of partisan bickering followed by court suits.
\
Ballot Question 2 also deserves a ""yes"" vote. It would amend the Constitution to dedicate a greater share of the 10.5 cent-per-gallon gas tax (from 2.5 cents to 9 cents by 2001) to the transportation trust fund to pay for highways and mass transit. Now, much of those gas tax revenues can be siphoned off for other uses.
\
Voting ""yes"" on Question 4 would authorize sale of $350 million in bonds to protect open space for recreation and conservation, supporting soil and water conservation, and preserving historic sites.
\
Ballot Question 3 is a trickier call. It would amend the Constitution to bar the state from passing any laws or regulations that would create costs for local governments, unless the state pays those costs.
\
As a general rule, the state shouldn't pass mandates without figuring out how to pay for them. And every local official has a story about some stupid, wasteful state rule passed for some forgotten reason.
\
But requiring the state alone to pay up-front for every new idea is too restrictive, and could have doomed many progressive steps taken in the past to protect the environment, upgrade county courthouse justice and set high standards for public schools.
\
Vote ""no"" on Ballot Question 3.

"
567," The virtues of bold action are everywhere sung among the great teachers in history:\ ""Fortune favors the bold"" was Machiavelli's famous line. Even intranslation, Goethe's take is a touch more poetic: ""If you can dream a thing, begin it. For boldness has magic, power, and genius in it.""\ Such bold action is precisely what the people of this region must agree to take in order to stem the area's declining fortunes. Take it, and the area can ascend the heights. Omit the opportunity, and our fortunes will ebb away.\ So say five of the area's chief civic and economic leaders: Governor Tom Ridge; Barbara Bateman McNees, executive director of the Greater Pittsburgh Chamber of Commerce; Thomas H. O'Brien, PNC Bank Corp. Chairman and CEO; Paul H. O'Neill, Alcoa Chairman and CEO; and John R. Thorne, Carnegie Mellon Professor and Chairman of The Enterprise Corp. of Pittsburgh.\ Their remarks came during the two-hour long 1997 PG Benchmarks Roundtable Discussion, in which they reacted to this year's economic benchmarks and gave their own views on how to overcome regional obstacles.\ Their prescription for creating a vibrant, world-class Pittsburgh region calls for unprecedented movement on many fronts at once:\ Remove barriers from the path of bright, young entrepreneurs and create an environment that keeps the best and brightest young people here.\ Follow the motto E Pluribus Unum and work together as a region, developing a vision of excellence that makes this area one of the best in the world.\ Pass ComPAC 21, the plan that streamlines Allegheny County government and prepares the area's central county for effective leadership in a new era of domestic and international competition.\ And, finally, summon the will, forge ahead, and build the centerpiece projects of the Regional Renaissance Partnership: a new convention center, a new ballpark, improvements to Three Rivers Stadium, transportation and the Cultural District, and economic development throughout the region.\ These campaigns will flourish only with the support of the area's people, they concede. However, ComPAC 21 and the projects of the Regional Renaissance Partnership must cross a higher threshold: passage in public referendums.\ The most difficult part of the task may be in persuading regional voters, whose average age is among the highest in the nation, to support bold action in the form of improvements, investments and changes, which might have little benefit for themselves.\ Roundtable participants agreed it will take courageous leadership among people on many levels to sell the idea and a prophetic faith in the future among those older voters to plant this crop knowing they may not fully see its fruition.\ Question: Why is it that local firms often expand elsewhere and outside firms seldom expand here?\ ""The semiconductor industry is a prime example,"" said McNees. ""We don't have a site that's ready, either the facilities or the land, other than the brownfield sites that we've gone and reclaimed.\ ""The Allegheny Conference, through its investment fund, is going out to each county and helping them establish where to put up spec buildings that people can move into pretty quickly. But our basic land and building inventory is very weak. The highway infrastructure, the water, the sewer all these things need to be in place.\ ""You didn't even consider this area for a manufacturing facility did you?"" she asked, turning to O'Neill.\ ""No, but not because this isn't a good place to manufacture things,"" O'Neill replied. ""But it's not, for example, a good place to smelt aluminum because there's no low-cost energy. And it's not a good place to build a refinery because there's no bauxite here. And it's not a good place to build an extrusion plant, because the people who use extrusions in automobiles are in Detroit.\ ""So with a lot of these decisions, it's not a question of being free to locate where you want to. It's not realistic to think General Motors is going to build a new assembly plant here. There's nothing about this place that makes it right for that.""\ O'Neill, however, pointed to other industries, such as high tech manufacturing and services, which have much more flexibility in where to locate and suggested that regional development efforts focus on firms that could realistically locate here.\ ""I said this to the mayor and now I'll say it in the presence of the Governor I'll probably regret it, too. Intelligent business people don't go places because of subsidies. They do not go places because somebody pays them off. They all know that's a one-time event. Now if you're giving it away, they'll take it. And they'll stand in line to get it if they're going to make that decision anyway.\ ""But if we could demonstrate that the best public education in the world is provided in Pittsburgh, that would be a decisive issue. You may think these are big shot types making these location decisions, but a lot of these decisions are made at home by families on the basis of very human issues.\ ""If we could say `Your kid can get the best education here, and it's the safest place in the country,' we'd have a hell of a lot more people come here. But being in the top 20 or even top 10 percent is not decisive.\  ""Forgive me, but we're not ever going to win on weather, okay? We may occasionally win on great sports teams. But that's a vagary thing. It comes and it goes.\ ""That's why I talk about the need for a vision of excellence. We need to be more excellent than anyone else. Otherwise, we'll just be in the crowd.""\ Question: Could the region be doing more to help the area's major employers become more successful, or does that take care of itself?\ ""No, I don't think it just takes care of itself,"" said O'Brien. ""I look at the Cincinnati community, and what they do with Procter & Gamble is unbelievable.\ ""We've got 20,000 (PNC) people sitting out there. With probably 8,000 or 9,000, it's discretionary as to where they are. And if this community understood the issues and our business and had people who really did economic development, they could very well come and say, `Why don't you take those 2,800 jobs you have in Mt. Vernon, Illinois, and bring them here for back office mortgage processing?'\ ""None of that happens. And that's a lot easier sell than going out and trying to bring someone from the outside in.\ ""We're not going to win everything with Denver. A lot of people want to go there because they want to ski or love the mountains.\ ""But there are a lot of businesses and industries where we see good growth or where we have a heritage or a power base and then there are poor resources. The public and private communities ought to galvanize around those things. There ought to be no impediments, for example, to the technology-based things that Carnegie Mellon drives or the biotech that Pitt drives.\ ""We have got to leverage every strength we have that looks like it has a future. And we ought to have every barrier down and everything going full tilt.""\ The University of Pittsburgh has done a 180-degree turnaround, Thorne said, in its view of sponsoring commercial spinoffs.\ ""They used to stamp on anybody who wanted to start a new company. Now, they're embracing it like crazy.\ ""Between Pitt and CMU, we've got jillions of things in tissue engineering and high technology. But we're very short on seed money and short on support infrastructure. We've got several new venture funds in town. I think we have a lot of the tools in place, but we should have more focus on the knowledge and technology industries,"" Thorne said.\ ""If we have vibrant, high-paying growth in technologically-oriented companies in the next 10 or 20 years, I'm not concerned about new apartment buildings, movie theaters and restaurants. They'll just come out of the woodwork. If you've got the buying power, there's enough entrepreneurial energy in Pittsburgh or any other large city to build that stuff.""\ O'Brien mentioned financial services as another regional strength, with PNC, Mellon and Federated Investors headquartered here.\ ""We're lucky to have three huge companies here. Philadelphia has one. A lot of big cities have zero. But we keep getting harpooned by the legislators on a bunch of things. That's why we have our credit card operation in Delaware, because of public sector issues. And so does every other Pennsylvania bank. Those kinds of things are so contrary.""\ Most of the roundtable participants expressed frustration that area legislators were not more in line with what is perceived to be in the region's best economic interests.\ Question: Have the legislators had the issues adequately explained to them?\ ""In southwestern Pennsylvania, business has always been a bad word, and that is part of the problem,"" McNees said.\ ""Particularly big business,"" O'Brien said.\ ""Except when you want something that costs money,"" O'Neill added.\ The reality of politics in Harrisburg, Ridge said, is that ""When you try to regionalize, it's tough to do. Government is the last bastion of doing things the old way. I think we've moved a long way in two years, but we need local, county, and state government to truly understand the terms that are most often found in every speech that every politician gives: the public private partnership.\ ""The partnership is about understanding the needs of both and finding a common ground and moving a common agenda forward. A partnership is a gas tax. I wanted a couple of more cents a gallon because I wanted to build more roads! I mean we've got the largest damned road system in the whole Northeast.\ ""And if there had been more leadership, we could have gotten a couple more cents because everyone's looking for political cover. Maybe we'd have gotten a penny for the Mon Fayette expressway, rather than a half a penny. That enables you to borrow even more.\ ""We need to do a better job all of us. And we have to show people the human merit the value of these kinds of investments that we're trying to push them to make.\ ""One of the greatest obstacles is the way government views its relationship with the private sector. Business is bad. Profit is bad. And the connection between a family-sustaining job and the need for less government is yet to be made.\ ""We still have the 35th-lowest car registration fee in the country. Go buy a car in 35 other states, and you pay a couple hundred bucks a year. But on the gas tax, these legislators thought that I was asking them to take out every one of their teeth without novocain. My God! It's unbelievable!""\ The key to strengthening the public-private partnership may lie in disabusing western Pennsylvanians of the notion that power is wielded by a handful of titans who, if they really wanted to, could get together at the Duquesne Club and solve the region's problems before the ice in their Scotch melted.\ ""It's no longer realistic to think that a few companies even 10 Fortune 500 companies can carry a community,"" O'Neill said. ""We've passed from the era of family ownership of big enterprises to a position where we're all hired hands. I know we get paid a lot of money, and you keep reporting that for us. Thanks a lot.\ ""But when the Mellons and the Hunts and the founding families were there, they were able to do things with the company because they really owned the company. It's not like that any more.\ ""And I think we're beginning to get over this idea that the big companies, if only they weren't so damned cheap, would make this into a great community!"" O'Neill said, pounding the table. ""We need this partnership between public and private.""\ He pointed to Cleveland and its acceleration beyond Pittsburgh in the past 10 years. ""They're all generally going in the same direction. Not that they don't have dissidence and dissent, but the flow is in the same direction. We've still got too many stalemates in our community, where the negative forces offset the energy of people who are trying to do positive things.""\ Widespread change both in attitude and government structure is critical to preparing the area for the next century, O'Neill said, adding that until the current systems change, what comes out of them will remain the same.\ ""To me, ComPAC 21 is just a downpayment on what we really need to do. What we need to do is a hell of a lot broader than ComPAC 21. It does not begin to integrate this region in the way that it ought to be.\ ""I understand why (ComPAC 21 leader and Duquesne University President) John Murray has to say what he does that none of this is a threat to municipalities and God bless the volunteer fire departments. But that's lunacy!\ ""The notion that in modern times people ought to be exposed to the vagaries of volunteer fire departments? I just want to throw up when I read this stuff!""\ McNees stepped in to say she believes progress is being made. ""When I first started doing economic development in western Pennsylvania, people told me I was crazy, that you couldn't do it here. But now, people are truly coming together to remove obstacles. We are seven to 10 years behind other communities, and I think that's because of the tremendous dislocation with the steel industry. What happened here is something that happened to no other areas I'm aware of.""\ O'Neill disagreed, citing the move Indianapolis made to metropolitan government in the late 1960s: ""That was 30 years ago that we had a model of to govern ourselves. We have got to get on with this!""\ Question: Is part of the problem that the other counties in the metro area don't view themselves as part of the region? Have they not been brought into the action enough?\ ""When you go to these other communities, I mean, man they don't trust each other at all,"" O'Brien said. ""It's amazing.\ ""We spend so much time on the city and county that we haven't spent the time with the state legislative bodies to the extent we should have. We get more than half of our state legislative group in western Pennsylvania voting against the things that are going to spur development here.\ ""It's unbelievable. Some of that is our fault. We didn't give them enough of an in-depth sense of how things are. When I have dinner with some of these guys, which I do, and I start talking about `Hey we're going to be Buffalo pretty soon,' they say `Oh my God, you're right. We didn't think of it as an issue for us.""'\ The outer counties currently have what McNees called a ""hands-off attitude.\ ""I've worked in 12 of them, and their feeling is `We don't want Pittsburgh and Allegheny County doing anything for us. We're doing just fine. We have our own group. We do our own economic development. Why should we trust you?""'\ The first step to getting that regional cooperation may come when economic development agencies from at least nine counties in the region move their offices into the current Alcoa building.\ ""To be able to bring them together in the same building, and then to have the true line of communication and cooperation that has not existed should make a real difference,"" McNees said.\ Question: The group often mentioned developing a shared vision of excellence and a common identity of the region. How is such a vision crafted?\ ""It's not going to happen out of some sort of lightning strike,"" O'Neill said. ""It's going to take nurturing and a community leader base that's all trying to move in the same direction. If we can get 1,000 people in the former Alcoa building that have at least 85 percent of the right idea of what progress is, it could really make a huge, huge difference.\ ""It's really fascinating to see the kinds of things you run into when you're trying to do something like give this (Alcoa) building to the community.\ ""One county spent so much time getting their lawyers all together to figure out `Is it possible that we'll have a $20,000 liability for rent we can't afford to pay?'\ ""I finally said `I'll pay yours. I'm not going to let you defeat this because you can think of all the negative reasons and things that can go wrong.' It's like you don't want to get out of bed in the morning because you can think of so many awful things that can happen to you if you get up. We've got to overcome that.""\ McNees added: ""This isn't rocket science what they're doing in Cleveland and other places. It's very clear and concise. They all have an identity. They have a leadership role that everyone plays and they all work together to move in the same direction.""\ Question: Is this region too hard on itself and does it need to begin talking to itself and the world in a more positive voice?\ ""Good things are happening, but I think we need some symbols,"" O'Neill said. ""When Pittsburgh was named the Most Livable City, that caused people who hadn't been here to stop and wonder `How in the hell could that possibly be?'\ ""My hope is that the new Alcoa building will be one of those symbols. It is going to be so unique that people will come from all over the world to see this building on the river that's going to change the character of the river.\ ""We need some things so that when people think about Pittsburgh, they won't think of some hellhole. It's like the Governor said about coming through the tunnel.\ ""For those of us who live here and come through that tunnel all the time, it's still marvelous, especially at night. You come through and say, `My God, this is the most impressive entrance to a major city in the world!'\ ""We need more of those things that people will remember. They'll never remember the statistics. People don't care about all these facts. They care about the visual image. Great Place. Oughta go there. Like to see that.""\ O'Brien interjected: ""But you lose the Pirates ""\ O'Neill: ""That'd be an image.""\ O'Brien: ""And you can talk about whatever you want, and they're going to say, `That's the city that lost a major league baseball team. I don't care what I read. They no longer have what it takes.""'\ O'Neill: ""The area is really underpromoted. As someone who's travelled most of the airports in the world, I can tell you this is the best airport in the world. People are staggered by it.""\ Ridge: ""Imagine this: You've never been to Pennsylvania, and your first entre is to Pittsburgh. You come to that airport, and then you come through the tunnel and into Pittsburgh. As the Governor of Pennsylvania, I can't think of any better marketing tool than just that half hour. That experience it's an emotion.""\ In the wake of the Clinton administration's failed attempt to reform healthcare, O'Neill suggested grasping and creating another potent symbol by taking advantage of the changes going on in medicine.\ He said the region should ""go and make a major assault on the federal government"" to persuade officials to fund a huge study in Pittsburgh that would carefully measure how the cost pressures and related changes, such as HMOs and preferred providers, are affecting people's health and the quality of medical care.\ ""Maybe it makes good political music to say, `Well, we couldn't get the major reform, but for God's sake we're going to be better informed when the next reform movement comes. And Pittsburgh is the logical place to do it because there's a public private partnership of health and medical care delivery. It's a center of excellence. And yes, let's make Pittsburgh the laboratory for the country and how we can do it better.'\ ""We need more areas that we've carved out that have some relationship to where we are areas where we go forcefully and get something done that builds for the future.""\ The final question put to the group was whether they were concerned about the area's relatively older demographic profile. Given that older adults tend to have money and don't cause crime problems, the group as a whole was unconcerned, with the caveat that, over time, they would like the balance to shift back to the younger side.\ Ridge, however, pointed out that the area's age may prove to be the key hurdle in accomplishing the ambitious plans of building stadiums, changing governments and transforming the region.\ ""There is a political dimension of having a high concentration of seniors. As you move to change the political structure and environment and affect the kind of public change needed to advance the region, they are the demographic group that votes the most. And unless a very good public case is made for change, they are the demographic group that will most likely resist it.\ ""So it provides some stability. It may provide some wealth. But as you're trying to reconfigure the relationship between government and the private sector, it may pose one of the greatest challenges you have if you don't develop a breed of political leadership that is willing to spend some political capital and make the case with this constituency that while it doesn't affect their generation in a positive way, it affects their children and their grandchildren's generation in a very, very positive way.\ ""And there are not a lot of people in this town that I've been able to detect so far that are willing to go in and say that. So it's a challenge. It can be overcome.""\ For Thorne, the key to overcoming regional problems is the unrestrained flow and transfer of good ideas into good businesses. He asked that the group, in addition to backing major projects, also remember to support the educational system that builds the minds of future inventors and job creators.\ ""If we keep in mind that the wellspring of our future is going to come from our universities and our school systems, and if we focus on being the best, it's going to have a big payoff.\ ""If the universities from the president on down are supported in helping with this economic development, it'll be a big benefit.""\ For his last comment, O'Brien made a personal appeal to the Governor that this area needs his help in building the major capital projects of the Regional Renaissance Partnership.\ ""We've got a lot of good things going on in the infrastructure and the jobs picture,"" O'Brien said. ""But that's going to take some time.\ ""We've hung in and done very well given the shock and job losses 20 years ago. But this is an incredibly critical time. A lot of these quality of life institutions are going to slip away from us if we don't succeed in building the convention center and ballpark and cultural district. And then all the other things we're working on are going to be much harder to achieve.\ ""It's tremendously hard for you as the Governor, but it's extraordinarily important for the state. If the southwestern core of the state starts slipping into a static, no-growth area, it's going to have a very big impact on the state.\ ""And I don't know if you can satisfy every geographic entity because you're helping Pittsburgh. I think sometimes you have to prioritize. This is the time this community needs the help.\ ""If we weren't doing all the things we're doing public-private wise, then we wouldn't deserve the help. But we are doing it, and we're making a lot of progress. And I think you agree.\ ""The time, unfortunately, will run out on our quality of life institutions before the results of our current economic revitalization efforts come in. We need that help now, to bridge the gap. This jolt of investments will spawn huge private investment too, and this, along with the infrastructure stuff, will give us the momentum to carry on through.\ ""We're under way. But we aren't going to make it without that investment to the next level, where we aspire to go.""\ Ridge responded with the final comments of the session:\ ""We are a state of very parochial political subdivisions. You can probably trace it to William Penn's charter 300 years ago. One of the biggest challenges for the southwest region is to get the political players to understand that their role is not to keep the seat. Their role is to lead. There's just not enough leadership.\ ""It's 911 numbers. It's merging local police and fire departments. You have to get rid of the levels of government that everyone holds onto so fiercely, and begin to think of a broader sense of community.\ ""We need to get the people in Upper St. Clair worried about the quality of schools in inner city Pittsburgh. Most of 'em aren't. Because the child living in Upper St. Clair in that fancy, expensive, well-financed public school his or her path may cross with that kid in Pittsburgh. It can be a productive intersection, or it can be counterproductive.\ ""That sense of community used to be very much a part of Pittsburgh.""\ Credit: DOUGLAS HEUCK"
568,"
Somehow, someday, we're going to have to find a leader with the guts and the credibility to tell Americans the truth about energy: that our national dedication to cheap gasoline is leading us into a dead end.
\
Economists are rightly calling this the silly season. And, indeed, both parties' panicked reactions to the temporary rise in gas prices - selling a tiny part of the strategic reserve or repealing the gas tax - are nonsolutions to a nonproblem.
\
Our country has only two options. We can continue to have cheap gasoline - in which case we must accept high levels of use, rising oil imports and a persistent trade deficit, and growing difficulty in achieving cleaner air, a workable transportation system and greenhouse gas limits.
\
The other option is to use price - that is, energy taxes - to induce technological advances and reduce demand.
\
But automakers have been pushing growing numbers of light trucks - minivans, pickups and so-called sport utility vehicles - on which they make a larger profit. The marketing of these vehicles as the perfect solution for heading vertically up muddy mountainsides or outrunning rhinoceroses masks the fact that they deliver '70s-era fuel mileage.
\
And their growing role in the fleet - sports utility vans now account for 40 percent of new vehicle sales - is canceling out the large fuel-efficiency gains cars have made.
\
Higher speed limits make matters worse: fuel efficiency plummets between 55 m.p.h. and 75 m.p.h.
\
Don't be falsely comforted by the length of time since the last energy crisis. We can't have everything - cheap energy, ample supply, a safe environment and no intrusive regulation.
\
With 3 percent of world oil reserves, our underlying vulnerabilities have not changed. Nor, through more than 20 years, has our ability to think clearly about the price of gas.
\
Cutting the gas tax would be just plain dumb.

Washington's rejection of tolls on I-80 should compel Pennsylvania officials to swallow hard and raise the gasoline tax to pay for transportation needs.
\
Tolling I-80 was a sensible, fair plan to raise money needed annually for the state's roads, bridges, and 73 public-transit systems. The legislature approved this long-range fund in 2007, also raising turnpike tolls.
\
But the Federal Highway Administration now has rejected placing tolls on I-80 for the third time under two presidents, one Republican and one Democrat.
\
It's time for state officials to recognize a flaw in Act 44: It relied on someone else's approval.
\
In the budget year that starts July 1, the state would fall short by about $470 million for repairs to roads and bridges, and for improvements in mass transit. It would mean allowing 100 crumbling bridges or 300 miles of damaged highways to go without repairs. SEPTA alone would lose about $110 million intended for capital projects such as the ""smart-card"" fare system and station renovations.
\
The FHA's decision comes at a particularly bad time.
\
Gov. Rendell's proposed budget for next year anticipated a deficit of about $500 million. But tax collections in March lagged behind projections, and the shortfall by July 1 could approach $1 billion.
\
Add to that the loss of transportation funding, and the state's projected deficit may nearly triple in less than a week.
\
Republican legislators argue for cuts to balance the budget. Given the sluggish economy, trimming no doubt will need to be done again. But the backlog of transportation repairs can't be patched over with budget cuts.
\
Transportation funding is a public-safety issue as well. One reason for Act 44 was a study that found Pennsylvania should be spending $1.7 billion more per year on deteriorating roads, bridges, and transit systems.
\
Rendell is calling a special legislative session to address transportation funding. Among the options are raising the state gas tax, now at 31.1 cents per gallon, or imposing a gross-profits tax on oil companies.
\
A hike in the gas tax would fall on people who use the state's roads, including long-haul truckers and other out-of-state drivers. It would provide a reliable, annual source of money for upgrading the transportation network. And it would encourage less use of a fuel that harms the environment. A 7.6-cent-a-gallon increase would raise $472 million per year.
\
Rendell in 2007 proposed a separate tax on oil companies that would have raised more than $700 million per year.
\
It's a reasonable alternative, if there's no stomach to raise gas taxes. There's compelling evidence that big oil companies use loopholes to avoid paying their corporate income taxes in Pennsylvania.

With Washington deadlocked over funding for the nation's highways and transit systems, several transportation experts warned Thursday at a forum in Philadelphia that continued wrangling could jeopardize the nation's recovering economy.
\
""Even a catastrophe doesn't seem to bring it home,"" said Peter J. ""Jack"" Basso, chief operating officer of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials. He cited the 2007 collapse of an interstate highway bridge in Minneapolis, which he said brought only momentary attention to the state of America's transportation system.
\
Noting that partisan debates in Washington have blocked a long-term national transportation policy since 2009, Basso said, ""The process is sinking the ship.""
\
Basso was one of four transportation panelists at the National Constitution Center.
\
New Jersey Transportation Commissioner James Simpson said more transportation decisions should be made by states, with fewer federal restrictions on how money is spent. He defended Gov. Christie's controversial decision to cancel a multibillion-dollar rail-tunnel project between North Jersey and New York City as too expensive.
\
Joshua Schank, president of the Washington-based Eno Transportation Foundation, said ""money makes all the difference in the world"" and suggested the United States should rely less on the gasoline tax for its transportation funding.
\
Martin Wachs, a senior principal researcher at the RAND Corp. in California, lamented that despite the vitriol in Washington, ""the public doesn't seem to understand what is going on.""
\
The panel met as a House transportation committee was putting the final touches on a $260 billion, five-year transportation-funding bill that drew fire from both ends of the political spectrum.
\
Democrats complained that the Republican-controlled committee was shortchanging mass transit in favor of highways and gutting programs to protect the environment.
\
And the Club for Growth, a free-market, antitax group influential with tea party Republicans, told House members that it opposed the bill because it spends too much money and vowed to include the bill as a key vote in its congressional scorecard.
\
Also Thursday, the House Ways and Means Committee proposed a transportation-financing plan that would eliminate an agreement in place since the Reagan administration that divides gas-tax revenues between highway and transit programs.
\
Currently, 2.86 cents of the 18.4 cents-per-gallon federal gas tax goes to buses, subways, and commuter rail lines. Eliminating that dedicated source of funds and replacing it with a one-time transfer of funds, as the GOP plan proposes, would leave transit programs vulnerable in future budget fights as Congress looks to reduce overall spending.
\
Basso said that transportation funding used to be relatively nonideological, and that the current fight has created ""the most tension I've ever seen"" in his 48 years in the industry.
\
The panel was cosponsored by the University of Pennsylvania's Fels Institute of Government as the first in a series of public-issue discussions in honor of the institute's 75th anniversary.

571,"HARRISBURG - Pennsylvania may go broke Friday for the first time in its history.\The state won't have enough money to cover $860 million in scheduled payroll, bond and Medicaid bills, and neither Treasurer Joe Torsella nor Auditor General Eugene DePasquale is interested in authorizing another short-term loan as long as lawmakers are refusing to pay for the state's $32 billion budget.\Such loans are meant as a temporary fix when tax revenues run short; the fiscal officials said, but the state has been treating them like a bank account, and that jeopardizes investments.\""To our knowledge, this would be the first time the commonwealth would miss a payment as a consequence of insufficient funds in the general fund,"" Torsella and DePasquale wrote legislative leaders and Gov. Tom Wolf on Tuesday. ""Unfortunately, under the current circumstances and without the prospect of additional revenue intended to bring the commonwealth's expenditures and revenues into balance, we are disinclined to support additional lending to the general fund.""\Democrat Wolf has taken a back seat to budget talks for months, preferring to let the House and Senate Republican majorities fight it out. In July, the Senate passed bipartisan bills to raise utility and gas drilling taxes and borrow $1.2 billion from the state's tobacco legal settlement. But the House has declined to vote on the Senate's revenue bills.\If there's no Treasury bailout, Wolf may have to act more forcefully by freeing spending, which could lead to cuts.\Wolf's spokesman J.J. Abbott, declined Tuesday to discuss the governor's options, saying the onus is on the House to approve bills that pay for the budget.\""There needs to be a sense of urgency to act,"" Abbott said.\House Republicans see it differently as long as fresh revenues keep rolling into the state.\""It's a bogus deadline,"" said Steve Miskin, House GOP caucus spokesman.\The warning letter was sent on the same day House Speaker Mike Turzai, R-Allegheny, canceled session prior to a vote on a bill to take more than $2 billion from special funds geared toward transportation, farming, environment and other endeavors to cover the state's deficit in lieu of higher taxes and a big bond.\The bill has splintered the 121-member GOP caucus along geographic lines.\On one side are several dozen moderate Republicans from Philadelphia and its suburbs who oppose its siphoning of $507 million from mass transit, ports, rails and infrastructure accounts. Those are the same Republicans who voted with Democrats for a 2013 gas tax increase to create a pool of transportation money.\On the other side are 16 conservative lawmakers who have Turzai's support on what they call the ""Taxpayers' Budget."" Those Republicans live in suburban and rural communities in the Lehigh Valley and in central and western Pennsylvania. They didn't support the 2013 gas tax increase and are opposed to any tax increases to cover this year's budget. Their idea is apply money arguably not needed now to the new budget. \The House's 81-member Democratic caucus is on the sidelines, pitching various budget proposals, including a severance tax on natural gas drillers and an increase in the personal income tax.\Credit: By Steve Esack - Call Harrisburg Bureau"

Why are Congress' popularity ratings still in the cellar? Look no further than House Transportation Committee Chair James Oberstar's response to the Minneapolis tragedy: add 5 cents to the current 18.4-cent-per-gallon federal gasoline tax and dedicate the proceeds to repair bridge infrastructure.
\
The Minnesota Democrat's plan seems straightforward, except that Americans are coming to realize the government's fiscal infrastructure is deceptively constructed.
\
For example, nearly one-fifth of federal gasoline taxes motorists pay are steered toward mass transit and ""transportation enhancements"" like bike trails -- such diversions are even higher for state gas levies.
\
Touted as the solution to traffic jams, mass transit -- chiefly rail-oriented -- has usually flopped. According to federal data, even though inflation-adjusted funding for transit has doubled over the last 25 years, only about 2 percent of urban travel occurs on rail, bus or other non-automotive means -- a share that's barely budged except in dense downtowns. So much for alleviating crowded interstates.
\
Worse, American Enterprise Institute scholar Joel Schwartz calculates that every ton of ozone-damaging pollutants avoided because of rail costs $1 million. Simply optimizing automobile traffic signals to reduce wait times would be more effective. No wonder: Based on statistics compiled by the Center for the American Dream, rail construction projects tend to suffer five times more in cost overruns than highways.
\
And far from sticking it to Big Oil by combating the ""almighty automobile,"" most transit initiatives merely derail programs that could make a real difference, such as relatively cheap and consumer-responsive buses.
\
Still, taxpayers are on the hook for more than trolleys, trains and trails. Ironically, the total amount set aside in the 2005 package for earmarks, including many frivolous road and bridge ventures, is $24 billion, close to the $25 billion that the new gas tax will supposedly raise over the next three years.
\
Given all of the misdirected money swirling about Washington and state capitals, wouldn't it be wiser to shift this money toward priorities identified by structural engineers rather than self-interested politicians?
\
Some of the 2005 legislation's loot hasn't been spent yet, while other programs, such as subsidized ethanol car fuel and the FreedomCAR research project, can be revisited, too.
\
In addition, the gas tax is hardly an ideal mechanism for funding highways. But if policymakers are to continue portraying it that way, they should act the part.
\
Gasoline taxes should pay only for automobile-related infrastructure. And most highway spending decisions -- and taxes -- should be ""devolved"" to the states.
\
The American Society of Civil Engineers estimates that fixing our structurally deficient bridges will cost more than $9 billion annually for 20 years. Since governments will collect more than 400 times this amount in revenues for 2007, bridge repairs can and should be funded without a tax hike.
\
Politicians need only rearrange budgets to focus on basic maintenance and traffic alleviation. Their constituents, the economy and the environment -- not to mention their poll numbers -- will be better off.

573,"HARRISBURG -- Politicians don't usually tout new or higher taxes while running for office. But Democratic gubernatorial candidate Dan Onorato thinks his support for an extraction tax on Marcellus Shale gas will be a political plus in his race against Republican Tom Corbett.\Mr. Onorato told reporters here Wednesday that the Legislature should enact a severance tax on natural gas to pay for damage to state roads and bridges caused by heavy trucks and other equipment used by gas drillers and to restore the 28 percent budget cut that the state Environmental Protection Department has suffered in the last two years. \Mr. Onorato, Allegheny County executive, also wants to use the shale gas tax revenue to replenish the state's Growing Greener program, which preserves farms and undeveloped land and restores old industrial sites called brownfields.\Mr. Onorato noted that Mr. Corbett, the state attorney general, has said he opposes any new tax or tax increase. This means, Mr. Onorato said, that state and municipal governments will have to take money from their budgets to pay for the damage caused by drilling companies and to protect greenfields.\""Tom Corbett wants taxpayers to foot the bill for protecting the environment, while I want the drillers to pay for it,"" Mr. Onorato said. ""He has made clear that his single goal is to prevent the oil and gas companies that are making hundreds of millions of dollars a year drilling in Pennsylvania from paying their fair share.""\However, Mr. Onorato did pledge opposition to increases in the state sales tax, personal income tax and gasoline tax.\Mr. Onorato refused to divulge two key details about a Marcellus Shale severance tax -- the tax rate on the gas that's pumped out from deep underground and how much money he wants the tax to generate.\Gov. Ed Rendell has talked of putting a 5 percent tax on the value of the extracted gas, plus a levy of 4.7 cents per thousand cubic feet of gas, to generate about $100 million a year. \Other officials favor a tax only on the volume of gas produced, but at a rate high enough to produce about $200 million a year.\Mr. Rendell has called on the Legislature to enact a severance tax by Oct. 1, one that will produce $70 million this fiscal year and help close a $282 million budget hole. Mr. Onorato said he wouldn't use the severance tax money to balance the state budget.\He claimed Mr. Corbett's opposition to a shale gas tax may be rooted in the large financial support he's gotten from the industry since 2001. Mr. Onorato said that a citizens lobby called Common Cause disclosed in May that Mr. Corbett received $361,000 from energy companies while Mr. Onorato got $59,000.\Mr. Onorato's call for a shale tax is a change from what he said at a Democratic gubernatorial candidates' meeting in January, when he was undecided about the levy. \Corbett spokesman Kevin Harley said Mr. Onorato has changed his mind about the shale tax because of the views of ""his mentor, Ed Rendell.""\""Tom Corbett is opposed to raising new taxes. Lowering taxes increases job growth and expands the economy,"" Mr. Harley said."

These letters respond to last week's question, which asked whether readers would be willing to pay additional state or federal taxes to pay for bridge repairs.
\
Since anyone who drives can use any bridge, it's only fair to charge those who use the bridges, or to pay people not to use the bridges so the bridges don't fall down. Either raise the gas tax to pay for bridge repairs, charge tolls on bridges, or close them if they're not safe and there isn't money to pay for the repairs. Since gas taxes are too low to cover all repairs and maintenance, they should be raised.
\
With respect to Tom McCarey's comments that SEPTA should be made private so he doesn't have to pay for R5 riders, if SEPTA became private it would stop operating because it can't make money. There is no free market in transportation at all. If there were, all highways would be privately owned and charge tolls to allow them to make a profit and pay taxes, not use taxes.
\
Most highway advocates run from that truth because it would be so expensive that only the wealthy could afford to drive. Their arguments that transit should be privatized are an attempt to drive it out of existence. That way, there would be no alternative to highways. Then highway robbery would be unfettered.
\
Unless highways are privatized and pay taxes, SEPTA and other mass-transit agencies should be supported to minimize the net public cost of transportation and to minimize pollution and road congestion. I don't like providing SUV drivers with big highways that I never use any more than McCarey likes paying for R5 riders.

There is plenty of revenue to address our road-system requirements if our legislators have the political will:
\
Sell Pennsylvania's State Stores. Such a sale would have the added benefits of better selection, better service and lower prices.
\
Eliminate WAM (walking around money) for state legislators, estimated at $365 million in the next fiscal year.
\
Eliminate federal earmarks. Tens of billions of dollars are wasted annually on ego-enhancing pet projects.
\
Eliminate the union requirement for highway construction, which would reduce labor costs 30 to 40 percent.
\
Outsource highway maintenance to the private sector.
\
Eliminate the public funding of arenas and stadiums.
\
The fact is, billions of dollars for new infrastructure has and continues to be squandered by our elected officials.

\
Everybody is trying to find complex financial solutions, yet the answer seems to be so simple: All construction and repair funds for roads - and bridges are extensions of roads - should be paid by the people who use them (motorists and truckers).
\
The obvious way to collect according to use is a gas tax. We already have taxes on gas, so the question is whether the tax is being diverted to other purposes. If so, the practice should stop and the funds should be allocated to their intended use. Or, if the tax is insufficient, let's raise it to the proper level.
\
While we are at it, why don't we raise the tax on gas substantially - one full dollar, let's say - and use the proceeds to expand and subsidize mass transit? Our environment would be grateful, we might start digging out of our foreign debt, and we just might lick our dangerous dependence on foreign oil.

575,"
The road to Hell, the old adage goes, is paved with good intentions.
\
So is the road to economic ruin.
\
In the name of saving the environment and stemming global warming, a steady stream of disinformation has been fed into the public psyche. Aided and abetted by both radical environmentalists -- who view humanity as a cancer in the natural order rather than an intrinsic part of it -- and the political leftists who needed a new home once their Marxist utopia, the Soviet Union, collapsed, a new public policy has emerged, a policy that seems determined to undermine the republican principles upon which the United States was established.
\
The disinformation campaign has resulted in some unintended consequences, not the least of which has been a surprising public outcry over the growing economic disaster that is overtaking the country. Where politicians once decried the low cost of fuel, particularly gasoline, in the United States, pointing to the costs in Europe that were four and five times higher, they are now scrambling to find ways to decrease that cost. Where politicians once called for innovative new fuel sources like ethanol and other biofuels, they are now finding those heavily subsidized programs not only inadequate but having a decidedly adverse effect on food supplies.
\
The American public, it seems, is not about to quietly follow the lead of those who would impose a new totalitarianism.
\
It is becoming increasingly apparent that the entire ethanol program is becoming a fiasco. There is presently a mandate that the U.S. produce 36 billion gallons of biofuel by 2022, ostensibly to alleviate dependence on foreign oil. The problem is that biofuels, particularly ethanol, don't work. Ethanol is 20 percent less efficient than gasoline, and that one gallon of ethanol requires more than one gallon of conventional fuel to produce. The production of ethanol, subsidized to the tune of $1.05-$1.38 per gallon by the government, is also taking increasingly greater amounts of corn off the food market, thus giving lie to the promises that were made more than a decade ago.
\
In 1994, the U.S. Senate was involved in a debate that would have prevented the Environmental Protection Agency mandate of the use of ethanol in reformulated gasoline. Ultimately, the vote that would have stopped the mandate failed thanks to Vice President Al Gore, who broke the 50-50 tie with his vote in favor of the mandate.
\
Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.), in his support of the mandate, famously claimed, ""The price of corn flakes isn't going to go up by one penny.""
\
To some degree, Simon was right. The price of corn flakes hasn't gone up by one penny. It's gone up by dollars.
\
Since February 2006, the price of corn, wheat and soybeans has increased 240 percent. According to Department of Agriculture figures, grocery bills are up, on average, $70 a month from last year. For the present, those costs can be absorbed, albeit somewhat uncomfortably, by the U.S. economy, but the ripple effect of decreased food production is having a major effect elsewhere. It takes 450 pounds of corn to produce ethanol to fill the average gas tank of an American automobile. The same amount of corn can feed one person for an entire year. As more crop land is devoted to the production of corn for fuel, less will be available for food, thus constantly driving up the cost of everything associated with corn, ranging from cereal to meat products.
\
There is now an ongoing debate among the presidential candidates and others over whether or not to institute a federal ""gas-tax"" holiday for the summer driving season, and, if instituted, how to ""pay"" for it. By ending ethanol subsidies, the government would save millions. By beginning to drill for oil in the United States, whether in the Alaskan National Wildlife Refuge, in North Dakota, off the Gulf Coast, off the Pacific Coast or anywhere else it may be feasible to find, not only would the price of crude immediately begin to drop, so, too, would the necessity of importing foreign oil (now 60 percent, up from 40 percent in 1990) drop. At the same time, employment opportunities and economic growth would rise.
\
Despite what radical environmentalists claim, and despite the rhetoric of political leftists who pander to those environmentalists in attempting to establish a new Marxist regime, the reality that is constantly overlooked is that concerns about the environment -- maintaining clean air and clean water, protecting species or protecting forests -- can only be addressed in a society in which there is abundant freedom. When the needs for basic survival, sufficient food, sufficient shelter, sufficient safety, become a paramount concern, concerns about the environment cease to exist.

576," This is a tale of two tax cuts.\ One, a temporary rollback of Pennsylvania's gasoline tax by 12 cents per gallon, doesn't make sense.\ The other, a twice-a-year sales tax ""holiday"" to encourage the purchase of energy-efficient appliances, does.\ Lawmakers are now considering both proposals.\ Two Democratic lawmakers - Rep. Peter Daley of Washington County and State Sen. Allyson Schwartz of Philadelphia - claim the rollback would provide immediate, if temporary, relief from soaring gas prices.\ Both lawmakers say the high price of gasoline not only costs Pennsylvanians more to operate their vehicles, it inflates the cost of most consumer goods.\ The $2 per gallon price of gas today is up from $1.75 just a month ago and $1.45 at this time last year.\ ""High gas prices create a massive drag on our economy, slowing the recovery and stifling job creation,"" says Schwartz, who is running for Congress.\ Under the Daley/Schwartz proposals, the gasoline tax would go from 26 cents a gallon to 14 cents for as long as six months. If the gas price drops below $1.80, the tax would be restored.\ Gov. Ed Rendell shares the frustration of the two lawmakers, but opposes the short-term measure that could have long-term consequences - none of them good - for the state.\ Rendell doubts the rollback would achieve its intended purpose, and it would have the ancillary effect of cutting into revenue that ordinarily pays for state highway and bridge repair.\ ""It (rollback) doesn't guarantee that the price at the pump will go down one cent. The oil industry controls the price at the pump,"" Rendell asserts.\ We would add that simple conservation efforts - tune-up, proper tire pressure and alignment, minimum use of air conditioning, avoiding ""jack rabbit starts,"" among other steps - and comparing prices along routes you normally drive can save as much, if not more, than a rollback in the state's share of gas taxes.\ President Bush is hearing a similar plea on the federal level, and he, too, is resisting it.\ With demand and the Iraq war pushing oil and gasoline prices to record highs, some people, including Democrat John Kerry, are calling on the president to tap into the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\ Yet, the president, refusing to play politics, will use the reserves only as intended: to counter a ""severe energy supply interruption.""\ Availability of gasoline is not the problem today, price is. And OPEC's recent promise to increase production assures the continued availability of gas for U.S. consumers.\ Meanwhile, in Pennsylvania, a proposal to suspend the 6 percent state sales tax for consumers who purchase energy efficient appliances does what a gas-tax rollback does not: save valuable resources.\ Using-energy efficient appliances could save families up to 30 percent - as much as $400 - according to the governor.\ The sales-tax savings would apply on purchases of products such as clothes washers, dehumidifiers, dishwashers, refrigerators and room air conditioners.\ If approved by the Legislature, the ""Green Sales Tax Holidays"" will be the first full calendar weeks of May and December.\ The measure could cost the state $2.6 million in the first year in lost tax revenue. But, it's an investment in energy efficiency that will pay dividends for years to come.\ ""By using energy-efficient appliances, we do not need to generate as much energy at power plants, which reduces greenhouse gas emissions and improves our air quality. This initiative will help save the environment and save us all some cash,"" says Rendell.\ The Legislature should nix the idea of a rollback on the gas tax, and approve the more sensible sales tax holiday on environmentally friendly appliances."
577,"
The Democratic candidates in New Jersey's solidly Republican Ninth District are hoping that the tide is turning. In fact, a polluted ocean tide and the environment are the issues that could lead to a Democratic upset, the challengers say.
\
The Atlantic Ocean plays an important role in Ninth District politics. The district comprises 22 southern and western Ocean County municipalities, including the 18-mile-long Long Beach Island and other beach-side resort areas. The district also includes the Burlington County communities of New Hanover, North Hanover, Wrightstown and Bass River.
\
The district is one of the state's most sparsely populated but fastest growing, and has been forbidden territory for Democrats. There has not been a Democrat elected since this Ninth District was created in the redistricting before the 1981 election. Republican incumbents expect it to remain that way.
\
""I don't enter anything I can't win,"" said incumbent Republican Assemblyman John T. Hendrickson. ""I will win this election.""
\
But this year was one of the worst ever for Atlantic Ocean resorts, with everything from used syringes to dead dolphins washing up on vacation beaches.
\
For Democratic Senate candidate Joan M. Tredy and Assembly candidates Harry F. Schmoll Jr. and Judy Anderson, the environment could be the issue that dents the Republican armor.
\
""In the years past, everybody automatically assumed it was a shoo-in for the Republicans,"" Anderson said. ""We feel it could go either way this year.""
\
After a summer of shore pollution, Democrats have largely abandoned their strategy to pursue a three-pronged attack, which would have focused on environmental, health-care and crime issues. Instead, the environment has become the central issue.
\
Tredy, 46, a Waretown resident, left her management position with a Burlington County food company to head the Ocean County Preservation Council, a nonprofit environmental group that was formed to fight a planned $150 million Ocean County incinerator.
\
She said the incinerator would produce toxic ash that would be hard to dispose of. She said she preferred recycling and composting because those methods could handle all the waste slated for the incinerator. As senator, she said, she would push for a statewide study of incinerators, with an eye to phasing them out.
\
Anderson, 43, a Barnegat resident and a former registered nurse, said that in her current job as a real estate agent she has seen first-hand the effects that the ocean pollution has had on vacation rentals and resort business. She said she would like to see a special prosecutor appointed to crack down on ocean polluters.
\
Schmoll, 48, a Manahawkin resident, has proposed doing away with tolls on the Garden State Parkway, saying that they were unfair to Ocean County commuters. He said he would like to see Atlantic City casinos take up the
\
financial slack because they generate much of the parkway traffic. Schmoll is a Burlington County associate professor, former commmittee member and former municipal judge in Stafford. He also said he would like to see road improvements on congested Ocean County roads. He opposes Gov. Kean's 5-cent gas tax, saying that the money could be found elsewhere in the state budget.
\
But even with the discontent that the summer's pollution caused, the Democrats concede that they face an uphill battle.
\
Since 1981, incumbent Republican Sen. Leonard T. Connors Jr. and Assemblymen Hendrickson and Jeffrey W. Moran have never received less than 60 percent of the vote.
\
The Ninth District delegation members insist that they have been on top of the environmental issue, sponsoring bills ranging from stiffer penalities for ocean littering to a measure that would phase out sludge dumping in five years.
\
The Republicans said that even if residents were upset with pollution in the Atlantic Ocean, they were not likely to take it out on the incumbents.
\
""We have one of the best environmental records in the state,"" said Moran.
\
The Republicans also dismiss the Democrats as inexperienced newcomers, whose proposals will not fly in Trenton.
\
Moran, 40, a Beachwood resident who is an assistant principal for handicapped services in the Toms River school system, said that eliminating parkway tolls would make it impossible to pay for widening the busy roadway. Looking to the casinos for roadway money would simply take money away from senior citizens, who now receive the benefits of casino taxes, he said.
\
Hendrickson and Connors said they had served their constituents well.
\
Hendrickson, 63, a Eagleswood resident and the owner of a title-search company, is assistant majority leader of the Assembly.
\
Connors, 58, the mayor of Surf City, is a retired businessman who now works full time as a legislator. He said he was not declaring victory yet.
\
""I campaign every day,"" Connors said. ""I don't take anything for granted.""

Natural gas and polluted wastewater blasted out of a well in Northwestern Pennsylvania for 16 hours before being contained Friday in what officials say was the state's most alarming drilling-related accident in recent years.
\
No injuries were reported and no fire broke out, a grave risk with large amounts of airborne natural gas.
\
The well ruptured at 8 p.m. Thursday, sending a gas plume 75 feet into the air and wastewater cascading into the ground just as the gas contractor was preparing to begin production at the well, the officials said.
\
The accident happened as EOG Resources Inc. of Houston was preparing to start production at a deep well in the Marcellus Shale, the rich gas reserve underlying most of the state. The site is on private land at the edge of the Moshannon State Forest. The nearest house is more than a mile away.
\
State officials said they were still trying to determine exactly what happened, but said unexpectedly high gas pressure caused drilling crews to lose control of the well. They also said a safety device known as a blowout preventer had failed.
\
Workers at the site were evacuated, and contaminated wastewater, a by-product of the hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, process used to extract underground gas, was eventually contained, according to Department of Environment Protection officials.
\
""When we arrived . . . natural gas and 'frack' fluid was flowing off the well pad and heading toward tributaries to Little Laurel Run, and gas was shooting into the sky, creating a significant fire hazard,"" said DEP Secretary John Hanger, who promised an aggressive investigation.
\
The risk of fire prompted state officials to close roads and cut off electrical service to the area. State emergency officials were alerted and hazmat teams scrambled. The Federal Aviation Administration restricted airspace over the area for two hours.
\
Crews halted the leak at noon Friday, EOG officials said.
\
EOG spokeswoman Elizabeth Ivers said the company was conducting an internal investigation. ""Public safety and protection of the environment continue to be of utmost importance to our company,"" an EOG statement said.
\
EOG, one of the largest gas contractors in Pennsylvania, has leased 230,000 acres and has drilled 43 wells in the Marcellus Shale.
\
DEP officials said that when their investigation is complete, they may consider fining the company or suspending or revoking its drilling permit.
\
""The event at the well site could have been a catastrophic incident that endangered life and property,"" Hanger said. ""This was not a minor accident, but a serious incident that will be fully investigated by this agency with the appropriate and necessary actions taken quickly.""
\
Gas wells are equipped with blowout preventers, a series of valves to control unexpected surges in pressure during drilling. The failure of a blowout preventer was one of the causes of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.
\
""There was a blowout preventer"" at the Pennsylvania site, DEP spokesman Neil Weaver said Friday night in an e-mail. ""It failed. The reason for the failure is going to be part of the investigation.""
\
News of the accident comes at a time of heightened interest in the historic ""gas rush"" that Pennsylvania and other Marcellus Shale states are experiencing, thanks to new technology in tapping gas reserves. Environmentalists and some legislators said the accident evidenced the need for tougher regulations on deep-well drilling.
\
""Drilling in the shale is a whole different animal from shallow-well drilling,"" said Jan Jarrett, president of the environment group PennFuture. ""Things can go wrong.""
\
The accident-site location gave rise to concerns about fouling waterways. The well is near the headwaters of the west branch of the Susquehanna River, and any discharge could flow east into the Susquehanna or west into the Ohio River.
\
Jarrett, whose group wants a moratorium on further leasing of state lands to drillers, said deep gas wells are under higher pressure then traditional shallow gas wells and use enormous amounts of water in the drilling process. ""We are so early on with [Marcellus] Shale drilling, and already we're seeing all kinds of problems with wastewater and methane gas leaks,"" she said.
\
Central to deep-gas drilling is the hydraulic fracturing process, in which millions of gallons of water are blasted into rock formations to release the gas. Pollution issues arise from the wastewater that must be treated before it can be released into waterways.
\
There is debate about what toxins, if any, wastewater from fracking contains. Environmentalists say toxins such as arsenic, along with methane gas, oil, and metals may be released. Industry officials say they use a process to contain and dilute any potentially hazardous chemicals used in the drilling, and that any other contaminants, such as methane, occur naturally.
\
State regulators are in the process of approving tougher standards for gas drilling, including improved well-construction requirements, that could go into effect as early as this summer. Also, on Tuesday, a state Senate committee is to take up proposed drilling regulations, including wastewater-treatment standards.
\
State Rep. Camille ""Bud"" George, in whose Clearfield County district the accident happened, said it helped make the case for why the state needs a tax on gas extraction from deep wells - something Gov. Rendell wants as part of his proposed state budget.
\
""Giving the gas industry a free ride at the expense of Pennsylvania taxpayers, water resources, roads, and economy is a poor deal for everyone but the gas industry,"" said George, a Democrat.
\
Senate Republican leaders, who control the higher chamber and who last year felt it would be harmful to tax a burgeoning industry, said Thursday that they were willing to discuss a gas tax as part of the budget process.

Bus and train riders urged NJ Transit officials yesterday to scale back planned fare hikes and service cuts and to require motorists to share the pain through higher gas taxes.
\
In a public hearing at Camden City Hall - one of 12 being held around the state this week - transit users said the proposed 25 percent increase in fares fell on those who could least afford it.
\
""If you raise the fares too high, I don't know how I'll be able to keep my job,"" said Nancy Ingling, 49, of Lumberton. Speaking from her wheelchair, she said she pays about $26 a week to the agency's Access Link service to travel to her job as a bank customer-service phone representative in Mount Laurel. ""I live alone. This is the only transportation I have. Please keep people like me in mind.""
\
NJ Transit executive director James Weinstein said the NJ Transit board would consider riders' comments before making a final decision on the fare hikes and service cuts next month.
\
The changes, designed to help reduce a budget deficit of nearly $300 million, will take effect May 1 if approved by the board.
\
A 25 percent increase would push the two-zone bus fare from Camden to Cherry Hill from the current $1.90 to $2.40. A train ride from Hamilton, N.J., to New York would cost $15 instead of $12. Off-peak round-trip train discounts would be eliminated.
\
Tony DeSantis, president of the Delaware Valley Association of Rail Passengers, urged doubling the state's 10.5-cent-a-gallon gas tax. That would raise about $500 million.
\
""Both fuel taxes and transit fares are used to operate and maintain a transportation system in New Jersey,"" DeSantis said. ""All user fees - transit fares and motor-fuel taxes - should be raised at the same time.""
\
The gas tax was last raised in 1988; transit fares will have gone up 68 percent in 10 years with the proposed hikes, said Doug O'Malley, field director of Environment New Jersey.
\
O'Malley said every commuter who decides to drive to work instead of taking transit will add an average of 4,800 pounds of pollution to the air.
\
Molly Doughty of Camden was near tears as she told Weinstein, ""People like me, we're hurting. I may not be able to go to my job. I have to take the bus. The governor has a driver to drive him wherever he goes.""
\
Weinstein told the approximately 30 people at City Hall that ""these are difficult times for NJ Transit, and I know these are difficult times for our customers.""
\
He said the agency tried to design the service cuts ""in a way that doesn't leave anyone high and dry.""
\
Fred Madison, an NJ Transit train engineer, said proposed cuts on the Atlantic City Line, which operates between Atlantic City and Philadelphia, would severely hurt ridership because casino workers would no longer be able to use the train to get to and from work.
\
Six runs would be eliminated on the Atlantic City Line under the proposed service cuts.
\
Bus service would be reduced on about 50 routes, and 32 of 725 commuter train runs would be eliminated - at least two on each of the system's 11 lines.
\
What is now a $59 monthly bus pass would cost $74, and a monthly train pass that is currently $198 would be $248.
\
Camden Councilwoman Deborah Person-Polk said the fare hikes, coupled with state cuts in aid to schools and cities, would make life especially difficult for the working poor and students.
\
""Most of our residents use transit,"" she said. ""That's how they get to their jobs. That's how they get to school.""

580,"Ice-breaker games can range from creative to downright painful. Perhaps one of the most popular — and enjoyable — is the classic ""Two Truths and a Lie."" In it, participants share two truths and one lie about themselves, and others try to guess the false statement.\The game can make for a lot of laughs in an environment where, typically, little is at stake. Unfortunately, when it comes to messages from politicians, lies have far worse consequences.\For example, of the following three statements, which is false?\Pennsylvania's natural gas tax has generated $1.2 billion dollars in new revenue since 2011, including $173 million in 2016 alone.\The oil and natural gas industry provided 322,600 jobs in Pennsylvania in 2015, with income from the industry topping $22.9 billion.\Pennsylvania is the only major natural gas-producing state that doesn't ask drillers to pay their fair share.\If you listen to Gov. Wolf and his legislative allies on the issue, you would think they are playing ""Two Lies and a Truth,"" where the first two statements are false and the last is true. They seldom talk about the former and loudly argue the latter — in a very disingenuous game of misleading the voters.\The reality is that since 2011, Pennsylvania's natural gas tax — called an impact fee — has, indeed, generated more than $1 billion in tax revenue. This is above and beyond the hundreds of millions of dollars gas drillers pay in the same taxes paid by every other business in the commonwealth, such as income taxes and sales and use taxes.\State government's bottom line isn't the only beneficiary of the natural gas industry. Communities across Pennsylvania have seen infrastructure and other government services investments, thanks to the additional taxes drillers pay.\What's more, the natural gas industry provides more than four percent of the state's total jobs and more than five percent of the state's total income. And 2.7 million Pennsylvania homeowners rely on natural gas to heat their homes.\That's why it's disturbing, to say the least, when Gov. Wolf and Harrisburg politicians take aim at Pennsylvania's energy revolution with false claims that the state's gas drillers are somehow getting a pass or special treatment when it comes to paying taxes.\Far from it.\The truth is Pennsylvania gas drillers pay a greater diversity of taxes than many drillers elsewhere in the country. In fact, in addition to the impact fee, drillers in the commonwealth pay taxes that don't even exist in many of the other gas-producing states that Wolf and his special-interest allies seemingly idolize.\Texas and Wyoming, for example, have neither a corporate nor a personal income tax. Only four of the top ten gas-producing states have death taxes. Pennsylvania has all three, with our corporate income tax being the second-highest in the nation.\Additionally, California, also an energy-producing state, does not impose a severance tax on oil and natural gas production.\Gov. Wolf touts ""fairness"" as his reason for pushing yet another tax on gas drillers, but true ""fairness"" as compared with other states would mean cutting or eliminating corporate taxes and personal income taxes—a fact conveniently missing from the political rhetoric calling for additional natural gas taxes.\Of course, some claim that despite all the taxes drillers pay, they can afford more.\Matt Brewer of Hydroedge Solutions, a Washington County oil and gas service company, would disagree. Testifying at an August 15 legislative hearing last year, Brewer noted that while he planned to add dozens more workers to his current team of 85 and make up to $3 million in capital investments, Pennsylvania's unfriendly business climate may force him to move his business to Ohio where the business climate is more hospitable.\Similarly, Mark Caskey of Steel Nation, headquartered near Pittsburgh, testified at the same hearing that the tax and regulatory uncertainty in Pennsylvania had already forced him to cancel one project and delay others.\Beyond this, yet another tax on the industry would mean millions of Pennsylvania homeowners using natural gas would see higher home-heating bills. In this winter's record-breaking cold, such an increase would have been particularly acute.\If fairness is the goal, then it's time to be fair to the people of Pennsylvania who deserve to know the truth about our natural gas industry's contributions to the state—in jobs, services, and, yes, revenue.\Because unlike ice-breaking activities, when it comes to policies that impact workers, job creators, and millions of Pennsylvania homeowners, spreading lies is no game.\-Matthew Brouillette is president and CEO of Commonwealth Partners Chamber of Entrepreneurs"

House OKs $8B relief for highway trust fund
\
By Jim Abrams
\
ASSOCIATED PRESS
\
WASHINGTON -- Congress on Thursday sent President Bush an $8 billion rescue package for the federal highway trust fund. The infusion comes as the trust fund, which relies on declining revenues from the federal gas tax, verges on going broke, threatening road and bridge projects in every state.
\
The House passed the measure on a 376-29 vote Thursday, a day after the Senate overcame objections from conservative senators and passed it on a voice vote. The legislation transfers $8 billion from the Treasury's general fund to the highway fund, ensuring that ongoing construction projects won't be interrupted.
\
The White House had previously threatened to veto the measure, calling it ""both a gimmick and a dangerous precedent that shifts costs form users to taxpayers at large.""
\
But the administration shifted positions after Transportation Secretary Mary Peters last week revealed that the trust fund would run out of money this month, which would delay payments to states for infrastructure projects and threaten the jobs of hundreds of thousands of construction workers.
\
""We must act,"" said Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga. ""The trust fund is broke, out of money. Our state and local governments, drivers, construction workers and many others suffer when highway projects are delayed."" He and others pointed out that in 1998 the government moved $8 billion from the trust fund, then enjoying a large surplus, to the general fund for deficit reduction, and that this measure returned borrowed money.
\
It has long been anticipated that the 52-year-old trust fund would move into the red next year, a result of the reluctance of Congress to raise the gas tax, unchanged since 1993 despite inflation and soaring construction costs. The federal fuel tax is 18.4 cents a gallon, or 24.3 cents for diesel.
\
But the fund, which had a $10 billion surplus just three years ago, has had a rapid change in fiscal fortune as drivers, responding to higher gas prices, have curtailed their driving and switched to more fuel-efficient vehicles.
\
Peters on Wednesday commended the Senate for its swift action to address the immediate crisis but added in a statement that ""Congress must eliminate the billions in wasted spending, thousands of unneeded earmarks and hundreds of conflicting and contradictory special interest programs in order to make sure states don't face this situation again.""
\
Stephen E. Sandherr, chief executive director of the Associated General Contractors of America, expressed relief that Congress had finally acted. ""We knew this shortfall was coming and we have made this a priority for the last two years,"" he said. ""The money was set to run out, states were going to be left holding the bag and contractors would have been forced to lay people off.""
\
The few opponents of the bill blamed the current crisis on the 6,300 earmarks -- lawmakers' pet projects -- worth some $24 billion, included in the $286 billion highway bill Congress passed in 2005. That bill expires next year.
\
""Part of the reason we are having to steal money from the general fund,"" said Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., is ""we just went hog wild in 2005. We've got to stop this earmarking process.""
\
Democrats in turn thanked the White House and Republicans for letting the stalled bill move forward. ""I'm glad the Republicans came to their senses -- you can't play politics with 300,000 jobs when we're in a recession,"" said Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calf., chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works.
\
The American Road and Transportation Builders Association, using Transportation Department figures, said that without the fix federal highway aid to the states would drop from $35 billion in the fiscal year ending on Sept. 30 to $24 billion in the next fiscal year 2009. It estimated that 379,000 jobs would be lost without congressional action.
\
According to the estimate, California would lose 32,000 jobs, Texas almost 30,000, New York and Florida 20,000 each and Pennsylvania 19,000.
\
The House first passed the $8 billion relief bill in July, but Senate Republicans have thwarted several Democratic efforts to move the legislation in the Senate, demanding they first get votes on issues such as the proliferation of earmarks in highway spending bills.
\
""Much of this bill is not about roads and bridges,"" said Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C. ""It's numerous wasteful earmarks that I'm afraid could end up as part of this $8 billion.""
\
Because highway money is paid out over a number of years, postponement or delay in starting a project can have long-term ramifications. ""The urgency of this bill is very critical. We cannot delay it,"" said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash. Without the money, she said, next week federal reimbursements for state projects could drop to as little as 64 percent of promised funds.

Improve care for heroin detox
\
Editor: During a recent interview with a recovering heroin addict, I learned of a dangerous and almost cruel policy in place at the Lackawanna County Prison. In this incident, a young person had a 50-bag-per-day heroin habit, and was not given medicine to combat the withdrawal symptoms, save blood pressure medicine and anti-diuretics.
\
When people are committed to LCP to await the disposition of their case, they have merely been charged and held in jail in lieu of bail. These jail stays are not punishment; it is the legal system's way to ensure an appearance at court for those who are considered a flight risk. In other words, these people have not been found guilty of any crime.
\
Heroin use is rampant in Northeast Pennsylvania, and it's difficult to find a family that has not been affected. Addicts and anyone in the medical field know the horrible detoxification process that takes place when an addict goes cold turkey. Symptoms more severe than the worst flu, extreme cramping, vomiting and diarrhea are common, and even death can occur if detox takes place without medical supervision. LCP needs to vastly improve the way it cares for these people.
\
Correctional officers, nurses and other staff can only follow prison policy. They are powerless to assist prisoners if they are not given the adequate training and supplies to care for them. With heroin use becoming more prevalent every day, it is incumbent on the county prison board and county commissioners to address this issue.
\
Heroin addiction is a terrible disease, and addicts are human beings. They may have been driven to horrible acts by their addiction, but they are people nonetheless. One death at LCP from heroin detox is one death too many.

Merge for savings
\
Editor: I have several questions for the Pennsylvania Legislature. I have read with great interest of the proposed hike in the gasoline tax, diesel tax, registration fees, license fees - all for the sole purpose of fixing our deplorable roads and bridges. For decades, we have been labeled as the state with the worst roads in the country. Why? Where is the current 31.2-cents-per-gallon tax on gasoline going now?
\
Why are the roads and bridges in their current condition? Other states have far less tax on gas and they have far better roads. Go to Maryland, Delaware, New York, most any other state, and compare their road conditions to ours. Our highways have been a joke for decades. Ask any interstate truck driver.
\
Can you imagine the cost of goods and services when the tax on gasoline and diesel reaches the peak in five years? We will be honored with the highest gas tax in the nation.
\
One suggestion is to combine the Department of Transportation and the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission into one money-saving department.
\
Consolidation of these two departments has been talked about for years but never acted upon. In the meantime we are saddled with higher taxes.
\
I am asking the state Legislature to please give the taxpayers a break. We are not the endless supply of cash you think we are. We need your help, not higher taxes.

Another blow
\
Editor: Bring it on, Pennsylvania politicians. We just love it when we get a tax increase. And after your newest increase we will be number-one in state gasoline tax at only 59.2 cents a gallon.
\
California currently has the highest state gasoline tax at 53.2 cents per gallon. Pennsylvania's potential 28-cent increase is part of the $2.3 billion transportation bill.
\
And that's not all. We also get to pay twice as much for automobile registration and driver's license. And if you get a moving traffic violation you have the privilege of $100 added to the ticket.
\
It's such a privilege to pay and then pay some more. Why, pretty soon our politicians will be spending my whole paycheck and I won't have the problem of having to spend at all. What a country.

Shared concerns
\
Editor: Ensuring that our environment and wildlife are protected alongside responsible, tightly regulated shale development is a core commitment of our industry. Unfortunately, several key facts were not conveyed in an article (""Trout facing threat from gas, group says,"" Nov. 20) regarding this important issue.
\
First, a host of strong state regulations are in place to mitigate and manage erosion and sedimentation associated with shale development. In fact, shale producers are required to submit detailed erosion and sedimentation plans to the state DEP, which include construction-related activity as well as restoration efforts. County conservation districts also review these plans.
\
In addition, Pennsylvania's recently enacted a shale modernization law, Act 13, which dramatically expands setback requirements, further protecting our waterways and sources as well as wildlife. The bipartisan law also bolsters pad site containment requirements, aimed at ensuring that all fluids remain on site and do not directly contact the ground.
\
Yet our industry is taking these efforts to protect our wildlife and our environment further. We have published several recommended practices, or guidance documents, for operators to heighten erosion- and sedimentation-control efforts. We also have conducted seminars, in partnership with the state DEP, focused on erosion and sedimentation controls, permitting and best practices.
\
We live - and hunt and fish - here too, and understand that we can, and must, protect our environment and wildlife while safely producing clean-burning American natural gas.

583," Republican U.S. Rep. Lawrence Coughlin and his Democratic challenger, Bernard Tomkin, are both in their 60s.\ But when it comes to the elderly and some other issues, such as the deficit and health insurance, in the 13th congressional district, they have only a little more in common.\ Both agree that the elderly need help to pay for long-term care in nursing homes.\ But Coughlin, who is 61, did not back the last bill providing ""catastrophic"" coverage for long-term care because, he said, it would have cost senior citizens too much and only dealt with home care.\ Said Tomkin, who is 69: ""That vote showed he is insensitive to the problem. He was out of touch again.""\ One proposal to balance the federal budget included increases in Medicare premiums paid by the elderly.\ Coughlin said the increases were more than he wanted, but he voted for the budget package and believes some increase is needed to pay for rapidly expanding Medicare costs.\ Tomkin opposes any increases in Medicare premiums.\ ""I believe the elderly on fixed incomes and in a very difficult position to cope with inflation are the last people who should be targeted for budget cutting,"" Tomkin said.\ Said Coughlin: ""More elderly people are living better than ever before. That is the fastest growing part of the budget. But I'm sure there are additional things we need to do.""\ Here's how the two men, one a 22-year member of the House and the other a retired university instructor and high school vice principal, stand on other issues, such as taxes, gun control and health care.\ *Cutting the deficit and raising taxes:\ Coughlin said he favored the first budget plan put forward by the president and the leadership of both parties in Congress. That measure was defeated.\ He said he wants to create an ""incentive for growth"" by reducing the capital gains tax and opposes eliminating tax indexing for a year. Under indexing, a person's tax bracket is adjusted for inflation.\ ""Indexing is the single most important thing for our economic stability,"" Coughlin said.\ The plan he backed also reduced farm subsidies and some entitlement programs. Defense programs were cut more than any other projects, he added.\ Tomkin argued that the Pentagon budget should be cut considerably more by reducing the number of troops in Europe, the Pacific and Korea and scaling back some ""high-tech"" military hardware projects.\ Taxes should be raised on people earning more than $100,000, said Tomkin. Farm subsidies should be cut.\ But more funds should be put into education, job retraining and federal revenue sharing programs, which target money to cities, he said.\ He also argued that federal dollars should be put into an ""advanced technology program"" to promote research into new products and technologies by universities and foundations.\ *The voters' top priority:\ According to Tomkin, voters are concerned about ""drugs, schools, the environment, war and peace. They're very concerned about taxes.""\ Coughlin said the top priority is ""maintaining the quality of life we have in fast-growing suburban areas in terms of congestion, open space, pollution and education.""\ He supports a presidential proposal to devote part of a gas tax increase to improving highways and mass transit.\ *Day care:\ Both men favor increasing income tax credits given to families with children in day care.\ Tomkin also said the federal government should use tax concessions to encourage employers to set up child care centers near the workplace.\ Coughlin said he supported a bill to expand the Headstart program.\ *Abortion:\ A woman should have the right to choose an abortion, but federal funds should not be used to pay for abortions, Coughlin said.\ Tomkin is pro-choice.\ *National health insurance:\ A national health care program covering all Americans is needed and should involve the federal and state governments and, possibly, employers, Tomkin thinks. But it should be cost-effective, he said.\ Coughlin said the country has a health insurance program, Medicaid, that pays for medical care for people who cannot afford it.\ *Election reform:\ Congressmen should not be able to do mass mailings at taxpayer expense, Tomkin said.\ A ceiling should be placed on contributions from special interest groups, and major candidates should receive public funding for their campaigns.\ Free media time also should be given to candidates, he said.\ Coughlin favors ""severely restricting"" contributions from special interest groups and thinks the amount of money national political parties can spend on campaigns should be raised.\ *National energy policy:\ The government has been trying to develop alternative energy sources and decrease U.S. dependence on foreign oil, Coughlin said.\ But the American people have not been willing to pay for the higher cost of renewable energy sources, such as solar power, he added.\ Nuclear power should continue to be part of the energy mix. It is ""clean and relatively inexpensive,"" Coughlin said.\ Tomkin argued that no nuclear plants should be built until a safe way is found to dispose of radioactive waste.\ A major research effort should get under way to find economical alternative fuels, such as ethanol for cars, and use coal and natural gas more effectively, he said.\ *The environment:\ Both favor tightening environmental controls.\ Coughlin is a sponsor of the new Clean Air Act, which will place stronger controls on auto emissions.\ Tomkin said a balance should be struck between the needs of business and the need for a clean environment. But he would ""come down on the side of clean air and water.""\ *Gun control:\ Both favor a bill calling for a 7-day waiting period for handgun purchases.\ DISTRICT: 13TH Parts of Montgomery and Philadelphia counties.

584,"
With the Atlantic Ocean in the background, Gov. Corzine and other New Jersey Democrats yesterday decried a Republican effort to lift a federal moratorium on offshore oil and natural-gas drilling and called for a permanent ban.
\
The 127-mile-long Jersey Shore is one of the state's ""signature assets"" that drives $37 billion a year in tourism, Corzine said. That could be irreparably harmed if an accident or spill spoiled New Jersey beaches, he said.
\
""In many ways, it shapes our way of life, and we will fight any attempt to jeopardize it,"" said Corzine, who spoke on the boardwalk along with U.S. Sens. Frank Lautenberg and Robert Menendez and U.S. Rep. Frank Pallone. ""The Bush-McCain team would do well to remember that true leadership isn't about making easy choices; it's about making the right choices.
\
""This is a threat to an entire industry and to the ecology and environment of the Jersey Shore,"" the governor said. ""Drilling for oil and gas off the Jersey Shore is a bad idea.""
\
President Bush and other Republicans, including Sen. John McCain, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee, are calling on Congress to overturn a law that protects the environmentally sensitive Continental Shelf, which lies about 75 miles off the New Jersey coast. A 1982 congressional moratorium and presidential order prevents oil and gas drilling along the entire Atlantic coast until 2012.
\
The energy crisis of the 1970s prompted previous offshore oil and natural-gas exploration off the East Coast. A few pockets of natural gas were discovered in deep-water sites that apparently were commercially unfeasible at the time because of technological limitations.
\
Proponents of giving oil companies offshore drilling rights say the plan could yield at least 18 billion barrels of oil and 77 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
\
Opponents call that a drop in the bucket, saying that oil drilled in the mid-Atlantic likely would give the United States about a 30-day fuel supply, said Jeff Tittel, director of the New Jersey Sierra Club.
\
""Dick Cheney and Big Oil wrote the energy policy that has led the price of oil to double, and now they want to use it as a excuse to drill everywhere from Alaska to Belmar,"" Tittel said.
\
Others contend that offshore drilling wouldn't provide any relief from $4-a-gallon, or higher, gas prices until years from now, if ever. Oil companies hold similar leases on about 68 million acres of federal lands they have so far not explored.
\
""We recognize the pain that families are feeling at the pump, but experts say it could be 2018, 10 years from now, before we could even get the first drop of that oil, and it would 2030 before we could see the effect on gas prices,"" Menendez said. ""None of this does anything about gas prices today. What we need to do is to continue to create a realistic plan that makes us less dependent on oil instead of more dependent on it.""
\
The push by oil companies to open up the Continental Shelf, Menendez said, is an effort to gain control of yet more federal lands and increase individual company portfolios.
\
Lautenberg called the offshore drilling plan a ""gift to the oil companies"" that ultimately could jeopardize the state's economy and environment.
\
""It's a sham,"" Lautenberg said. ""Bush and McCain like to pretend their plan to drill for oil here is the cure for everything from the energy crisis to the common cold. But it's really a terrible idea that would do nothing to cut gas prices.""
\
McCain's campaign did not issue a statement about New Jersey's Democratic opposition to offshore drilling, but Assembly Minority Leader Alex DeCroce (R., Morris) called for Corzine to spend less time on presidential politics and more time dealing with the state's own issues.
\
DeCroce said Corzine has refused to rule out a gas tax increase and signed a budget that included an extension to the public utility tax, which had been slated to be phased out this year.
\
""Instead of criticizing candidates for federal office who are at least offering plausible, scientifically sound solutions to satisfy America's energy needs, Corzine should start leveling with the people of New Jersey about what he intends to do, or not do, about rising fuel costs,"" DeCroce told the Associated Press.
\
New Jersey officials said that, without a federal ban on offshore drilling, such activity in other states like Virginia or New York - which might favor it - ultimately could affect the environment here.
\
In 2006, Virginia began a push to overturn the moratorium after the U.S. Department of the Interior Mineral Management Service floated a five-year plan to offer a lease to a private oil company to drill offshore from Virginia.
\
The government's plan called for leasing a triangular-shaped area beyond a 25-mile coastal buffer off the Virginia coast, about 100 miles south of Cape May. The plan was that oil-drilling platforms could be built there. The MMS cited studies that there was enough natural gas in that area to heat 14 million homes for 15 years.
\
Last year, New York state considered granting a Manhattan-based energy company the right to build off its coast - and about 19 miles off New Jersey - a $1.8 billion 60-acre industrial island terminal for liquefied natural gas.

585,"HARRISBURG - After more than a month of secretive budget work, House Republicans unveiled a plan Tuesday to fill the state's $2.2 billion deficit without tax increases or going to a bank for a big bond.\But critics say the fiscally conservative GOP lawmakers' plan would hurt the people it is meant to protect by siphoning money from dozens of public projects.\The plan - which is a long way from becoming law and elicited misgivings from other Republicans and from Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf - would take:\* $507 million from mass transit, ports, rails and infrastructure accounts.\* $440.5 million from hazardous waste and industrial cleanups, and agriculture, environmental, conservation and recycling programs.\* $65 million from 911 improvements and volunteer fire companies.\* $26 million from health, substance abuse and job training endeavors.\The plan, which adds up to $2.4 billion, also would cut corporate tax credits to save $28.3 million, take $20 million from the Legislature's reserve accounts and raise $1 million annually by selling advertising on state-owned buildings.\""Since July 21 the focus and purpose of this team has been to stand in defense of the taxpayer,"" said Rep. Joe Emrick, R-Northampton, one of 16 lawmakers who unveiled the plan during a Capitol news conference.\Rep. Dan Moul, R-Adams, said many of the funds have been used in the past to offset budget shortfalls. Out of more than 200 special accounts held by the state Treasury, he said, the panel would take money from accounts that showed a three-year average of surpluses based on investments and lack of expenses.\Rep. Ryan Mackenzie, R-Lehigh, another panelist, said all the funds pay for important projects. But if there's extra money in them, it should go back to the taxpayers. For example, he said, the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources' Keystone Recreation, Park and Conservation Fund had $147.6 million in it as of June 30. So $100 million can be taken out.\""We looked at the funds and looked at the money that was available in their surpluses and savings accounts and checking accounts and what was legally and financially accessible,"" Mackenzie said.\Critics see danger in declaring the balance of any one fund on any given day a surplus available for spending elsewhere.\For instance, the lawmakers' plan to divert $40 million from the state's 911 improvement fund could hurt Allentown and Bethlehem. The state has ordered the cities to consolidate their emergency call centers with Lehigh and Northampton counties.\Bethlehem Mayor Robert Donchez said he was expecting state subsidies through his city's 2019 deadline to merge with Northampton County and didn't know the money could be lost.\Wolf spokesman J.J. Abbott said it's a possibility across the state.\""Raiding these funds will mean cuts to programs,"" he said. ""There is no way around it. Taking funds from 911 centers and volunteer firefighters means less funding to improve public safety response in local communities.""\The House GOP plan is the latest twist in the state's ongoing budget fight that threatens Pennsylvania's fiscal stability in the eyes of Wall Street. For months, credit rating firms have threatened to raise the state 'borrowing costs by downgrading its bond credit rating due to political instability, falling revenue and rising costs.\In February, Wolf proposed a $32.3 billion spending plan. The House responded in April with $31.8 billion. The Senate's nearly $32 billion was accepted by the House, but the chambers did not agree on how to pay for it.\After House Speaker Mike Turzai, R-Allegheny, couldn't get his caucus to agree to his funding plan, the Senate passed a bipartisan bill that would raise $611 million in new or higher utility taxes, add a natural gas severance tax and take a $1.2 billion bond from the state's tobacco settlement fund. Tuesday's plan countered the Senate's.\There's no guarantee the latest plan can pass the House GOP caucus due to political and geographical differences.\Most of the diverted $357 million in mass transit money likely would hit the state's largest bus and rail system, SEPTA. Its Philadelphia and its suburban coverage area is served by more than a dozen moderate Republican representatives, most of whom voted in 2013 for higher gas taxes to pay for transportation projects. The budget panel was stacked with suburban and rural lawmakers from the Lehigh Valley, and central and western Pennsylvania who voted against the gas tax bill known as Act 13.\""I don't accept it at all,"" said Rep. Scott Petri, R-Bucks. ""Keep in mind the authors did not generally vote for the gas tax and don't care about Philadelphia or its suburbs.""\Unease exists in the Senate, too, over the impact the transfers would have on transportation, agriculture and the environment while not addressing the state's long-term budget problems, said Jenn Kocher, spokeswoman for Senate Majority Leader Jake Corman, R-Centre.\The House returns to session on Sept. 11 and the Senate is back on Sept. 18.\steve.esack@mcall.com\Twitter @sesack\717-783-7309\Credit: By Steve Esack - Of The Morning Call - steve.esack@mcall.com;Twitter @sesack;717-783-7309"
586,"I CHATTED WITH Al Gore the day after he was ripped on ""South Park"" as an irksome worry-wart trying to frighten children with stories of impending doom.\I asked Gore, whose battle against global warming and its possible catastrophic affects is featured in the new film ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" if he'd seen the show, and if the implied criticism bugged him.\""I didn't see it, and if I had, I wouldn't admit that I'd seen it, and I certainly wouldn't admit that I laughed,"" he joked.\""Look, I've been in public life a long time. You learn to take your lumps,"" said Gore, who then pretended to cry, and wiped fake tears from his cheek.\And Gore knows how quickly the game can change - just a week later, he was a guest on ""Saturday Night Live,"" and was a big hit. Now people are flocking to ""Truth,"" which features Gore's slide show about global warming.\The movie is as much about Gore as it is about global warming, leading to speculation that it's really a campaign film for his as-yet-to-be announced presidential candidacy.\Gore reflexively denied he is (or will be) a candidate. He sure looks like one, though - he's shaved his beard, donned a tailored suit and power tie, and is on tour to promote his movie, companion book, TV network (Current TV) and environmental Web site.\There are those who look at this whistle stop tour, read between the lines of his book, and see a budding candidacy. I pestered him on several points, like why he'd recently hired Roy Neel, the guy who supervised Howard Dean's nearly successful insurgent candidacy.\""Roy has worked for me for 30 years, starting in 1977. He's an old friend from Tennessee, we were in Vietnam together, when I got to the point where I was launching a movie and a book and two major business ventures, I realized I had my hands full and I just called Roy and said, 'Help!' ""\On to the movie.\I asked why, if he's not a politician and merely a guy who wants to stop the world from burning carbon-based fuels, he does not use the film to call for a much higher gasoline tax. ""You'll have to find a lot more ways to ask that question before you get me me to admit we need a gas tax,"" Gore quipped.\So you ARE running!\""No, no, no,"" he insisted. ""Look, I think we can solve this [fuel consumption problem] in a way that protects the American citizen against devastating economic impact. It's quite true that higher prices for fossil fuels move the market in the right direction in the sense that it affects consumption, but it's not fair to people to have a sudden push off the edge over an economic cliff, and for some people, that's what [a gas tax] is. It's much better to develop a policy that moves people away from gasoline gradually,"" said Gore, who then launched into a discussion of ethanol.\Of course, even E-85 is blended with gasoline, and burns carbon. There is a technology that produces massive amounts of energy and burns no carbon - nuclear power. The movie doesn't mention it. Why?\""Projections about electricity demands become much more difficult when prices go up, as they are doing now, and as they will continue to do so. When that happens, utility managers have to place bets, and the nuclear option is the biggest and most expensive bet, and takes the longest time to develop. Instead of one big bet, utilities are making smaller bets on wind and renewables, and I think that's smart,"" he said.\I point out that in ""Truth"" (and the accompanying book) Gore repeatedly refers to global warming as a moral issue. This seems to reflect recent (successful) Democratic Party overtures to Christian fundamentalists, who've become more liberal on other political-moral issues, like hunger, poverty and health care. It looks like a political gambit.\""I cast it in a slightly different light. I think global warming and the environment REALLY ARE moral issues, and if you look back through American history, starting right here [in Philadelphia] the issues that capture the attention of the American people in a way that lead to big changes are the issues that are perceived as being above politics. Civil rights, for example, never got traction until Dr. King recast the issue as a moral and spiritual one, which it was all along. I see global warming as such an issue.""\I ask Gore why, if ""Truth"" is a documentary about global warming (and not a campaign film), there are no interviews with the scientists who study the phenomenon.\""Because it connects the dots in a way that doesn't happen when you just have talking heads and go from one scientist to another,"" he countered.\I want to ask Gore why he is so good at answering questions in a way that only makes me want to ask the question again, but he's already out the door, walking down the corridor of the hotel, shaking hands. *\ \ \Credit: By GARY THOMPSON"
587,"
Soon after President-elect Bill Clinton takes office in January, he will consider an increase in the federal gasoline tax, provided a way can be found to lighten its burden on working families.
\
He also is determined to propose a tough program to clamp down on soaring health-care costs and a loosening of bank regulations to make it easier for small businesses to borrow money to create jobs.
\
These insights into Clinton's early agenda emerged from the river of words that flowed for nearly 19 hours at the Little Rock economic conference.
\
No decisions were reached at the two-day conference. But Clinton, Vice President-elect Al Gore, members of their economic team and the carefully selected panel of academics and business and labor leaders provided pointers to what lies ahead.
\
An increase in the gasoline tax has been controversial since Paul E. Tsongas, one of Clinton's rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination, proposed a 50-cent gasoline tax increase over five years.
\
Clinton savaged Tsongas for the idea during the primaries, saying the tax would be unfair to lower-income Americans.
\
But now, two of his appointees, budget director-designate Leon E. Panetta and Alice Rivlin, Panetta's deputy, favor raising gasoline taxes to help reduce the deficit. Rivlin spoke out for it again this week in Little Rock.
\
Several participants in the Little Rock conference - including Harold Poling, chairman of Ford Motor Co., and economists James Tobin and Allen Sinai - also recommended a gasoline tax increase.
\
And Clinton singled out for special praise an elderly Californian, Edward Howden, who called in to the conference and volunteered that he was willing to accept a higher gasoline tax for the good of the nation.
\
""We need a gasoline tax,"" said Howden. ""I would like to see some provision made for low-income folks who have to have that gasoline, (but) I would have no objection to a gas tax on myself.""
\
In his concluding news conference, Clinton said there were ""a lot of good arguments made for the gas tax today."" But he insisted that he would consider it only if there was a way to offset its effect on lower-income Americans.
\
Gore has an idea about how to do that. In his recent book on the environment, Earth in the Balance, Gore suggested that a tax on carbon-based
\
fuels could be offset by a reduction in the Social Security payroll tax, which falls heaviest on Americans with lower than median family income.
\
COST CONTROL COMES FIRST
\
On health care, Clinton argued forcefully that costs must be brought under control before progress could be made on other goals, such as reducing the federal deficit or providing health insurance to the 35 million who do not have it.
\
""We've got six months to do something on health care,"" he said, thumping the table for emphasis. ""We are kidding each other . . . if we think that we can fiddle around with entitlements and all this other stuff and get control of this budget if you don't do something on health care.""
\
George Stephanopoulos, Clinton's transition spokesman, said that controlling costs would take precedence over providing access to health care for the uninsured.
\
""We have to lead with cost control,"" Stephanopoulos said. ""If we don't do cost control first, we can't get to the access.""
\
'MANAGED COMPETITION'
\
Although Clinton did not spell out a plan during the conference, he said during the fall campaign that a ""managed competition"" program would be a key part of his health plan.
\
Managed competition would involve creating a national board to keep health costs under control. Quasi-public purchasing groups would be set up to negotiate prices on behalf of employers and consumers with insurance companies, health maintenance organizations and health providers. The aim is to create stronger competition and lower costs.
\
Another oft-repeated theme at the economic conference was the need to relax banking laws and regulations to spark the sluggish economy.
\
Such recommendations came from titans of finance such as John Reed, head of New York's mighty Citibank, and small bankers, such as Mary Houghton, whose ShoreBank Corp. specializes in loans to inner-city businesses in Chicago.
\
STIMULUS FROM BANKS
\
Arkansas banker Bill Brandon, president of the American Banking Association, said an increase in bank loans of just 4 percent would provide an additional $86 billion in private capital to lend. That is a much bigger pot than the $20 billion to $60 billion in government stimulus that the economists in Little Rock proposed.
\
The President-elect jumped at the idea of more private lending.
\
""The (government) stimulus is peanuts compared to an increase in bank loans,"" he said.
\
Stephanopoulos said Clinton aides were considering both legislation and regulatory changes that would ease the rule changes put into effect since 1989
\
because of the collapse of the savings and loan industry.
\
Brandon insisted that the changes could be made without affecting the ''safety and soundness"" of the banks. But some authorities sounded a warning note.
\
Robert A. Eisenbeis, a professor of banking at the University of North Carolina, said Clinton should resist pressures to loosen bank regulations.
\
""It's really quite inappropriate to attempt to manipulate prudential standards to jump-start the economy,"" said Eisenbeis, a member of the Shadow
\
Financial Regulatory Committee, a group of private experts who monitor the safety of the banking system. ""That's a policy that would undermine the long- run health of the U.S. bank system and expose the taxpayer to another round of huge losses.""

Creative vision
\
As a junior at Haddonfield Memorial High School in the 1952, I volunteered in the Ground Observer Corps, spending Sunday mornings in the broadcast booth at the football stadium scanning the skies with binoculars for threatening low-flying aircraft. My supervisor was an avid science-fiction fan, and he brought in boxes full of science fiction to wile away our two-hour shift. The authors included Ray Bradbury, Phillip K. Dick, Kurt Vonnegut, and Isaac Asimov, who were forging a new genre based on the works of the classic writer H.G. Wells. I was hooked (Bradbury will continue to inspire, Sunday).
\
When it was time to do my senior thesis for English, I chose Bradbury. Imagine my shock when my choice was denied because he was not a classic writer. (Instead, I chose Winston Churchill because his birthday was the same as mine. I thought the paper I did was boring and I do not remember the grade.)
\
Time has given credence to Bradburys creative abilities, which envisioned exotic worlds where anything was possible, delving into the workings of the subconscious mind, addressing age-old conundrums such as how to live in peace with others not like us. If I were still in high school, the teacher might now allow me to write the thesis I wanted to write almost 60 years ago.

The inheritance
\
The Democratic Party, led by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, took control of Congress in January 2007. The Dow was at 12,621. The unemployment rate was 4.6 percent. There had been 52 straight months of job growth. By that time, President George W. Bush had asked Congress 17 times, starting in 2001, to restrain Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The deficit was the lowest in five years and it was the fourth straight year that deficit spending had declined.
\
Many factors contributed to the current economic mess, but lets dispense with the mantra that it was all inherited from Bush.

War on drugs
\
The reason the war on drugs is a failure is that the negative effects which have evolved for our protection are more easily washed away with chemicals than corrected by alteration in our thinking and behavior (Efforts to decriminalize marijuana growing, Monday). Except for emotional emergencies, psychotropic drugs can be counterproductive. Legalization in the name of personal freedom makes sense and will reduce criminal behavior and save us much money and aggravation -- profiteering by drug companies aside -- but we should not lose sight of the fact that anxiety, distress, anger, shame, depression, and the like are warning signals in our lives.

Tax delinquents
\
Mayor Nutter might consider collecting delinquent taxes before increasing taxes on productive small businesses, which, unlike Big Business, do not get subsidies and tax credits (Property-tax delinquents owe city, schools $515.4 million, Sunday). As the owner of Center City real estate, I wonder if the mayor and City Council are competent to do what is best for Philadelphia.

Warren ancestry
\
The Republican attacks on Elizabeth Warren regarding her Native American ancestry are unwarranted and misguided (Warrens shaky history, Sunday). There are two factors that should be noted.
\
The critics claim that Warren used her minority status to obtain positions at leading universities. This assertion reflects a wide misunderstanding. The goal of affirmative action in the hiring process is to ensure that the candidate pool is diverse, including qualified minority and nonminority candidates. As the pool is winnowed down, there is the expectation that the successful candidate will be the most qualified applicant, minority or not. Warren obviously is highly qualified for the positions she has held.
\
The second factor relates to how Warrens employing institutions have cited her as a minority faculty member. This is understandable. Universities are held responsible by both accrediting agencies and the government for adhering to affirmative action goals, and for reporting their success in hiring minority faculty members. How can U.S. Sen. Scott Brown (R., Mass.) criticize Warren for understandable actions by her university employers?

Natural gas
\
What am I missing? Why are we not doing more with natural gas (Answer is here: Natural gas, June 3). We have high unemployment, low-interest bond returns, high gasoline prices, and our required involvement in oil-rich parts of the world, which costs us militarily and financially, and helps those who not only dont like us but might be actively trying to harm us.
\
However, we have a boatload of readily available, really cheap natural gas. Why dont we form some private-public partnership company and get this thing moving? Raise money by selling equity and higher-yield bonds (backed by the U.S. government). Have the bonds paid for by a dedicated federal natural gas tax at the wellhead. Have the tax expire when the bonds are paid. Finance the creation of the natural-gas infrastructure (pipelines, distribution, and service stations). Finance the conversion of gas engines to natural gas (tax credits).
\
Lets see what we have: Natural gas pays for itself; reduces energy dependence (fewer wars and less terrorism); is better for the environment (not perfect, but better); creates jobs; and creates investment opportunities. Like I said, what am I missing?

589,"Relocate city hall to vacant Bon-Ton\ As we travel about the country, we find that most cities have the city hall located reasonably close to the heart of the downtown district. Lancaster, at one time, also had this philosophy. Currently the Bon-Ton building sits there idle, like a white elephant.\ Many ideas and suggestions have been advanced for its future use, and while many of them were commendable, why not give consideration to moving city hall and the police department into the Bon-Ton building? The citizenry would probably welcome the presence of a government facility at that location. It would add an air of vitality and charm to the whole area. Small shops and perhaps a restaurant could be worked into the scenario. This would bring some income to the city and also serve the public. With some creative cosmetics and landscaping, it would make an extremely attractive square, one the whole county would be proud of, for, after all, Lancaster is the county seat and hub.\ As we well know, the present city hall is overcrowded and has limited parking, while the police definitely need a better facility and a part of the Bon-Ton could be made to serve them well. We feel it would make the heart of downtown vibrant.\ While money is always a problem, there are creative financing plans available. Lease-purchase may be one of them; other plans also exist. They should be explored.\ It is essential that city hall become highly visible in the downtown district. The present city hall is very salable, since it is close to the courthouse. It would make a fine professional-arts building. Ditto for the police building. This whole concept should be taken under consideration.\Joseph P.

We did call ahead, and his office did know we were coming.\ Unfortunately, Gov. Tom Ridge would not come out to meet us, even though we were right in his office. I later learned that the governor was only in a scheduling meeting that could have been easily set aside for a few moments.\ Joe Pitts was the perfect host.

Since tourism has both potential positive and negative impacts on county residents, they should have the opportunity to provide input. In this country, I believe, the best plans, and those most likely to succeed, are prepared from the bottom up rather than from the top down.\ However, two statements in the article need correction. One of the first tasks in which we engaged was to establish standards for program participants, since our emphasis is on a quality visitor experience. Our definitions relating to authenticity of heritage sites, interpretations, services and events have been shared with organizations throughout Pennsylvania and have been sent by a representative of the National Trust for Historic Preservation to other states as well as to Heritage Canada. Secondly, one person quoted in the article, Don Billett, was improperly identified as a task force member and so does not speak for our group.\ Although I cannot represent the views of all members of the task force with their diverse interests, I know as an academic tourism specialist that tourism creates many challenges for a host community. Sustainable tourism is not simply dependent on effective marketing efforts that showcase alternatives to the Amish, but also on maintaining integrity and a quality environment and a high quality of life for residents. The record of mass tourism in the United States and throughout the world suggests that it has within itself the seeds of its own destruction. Effective planning, however, can help prevent degradation and decline. In such planning, it should be recognized that Lancaster County, both as a whole and in its parts, has a limited tourism-carrying capacity, beyond which serious problems appear. A quality experience for a lesser number of well-educated and curious visitors who want to explore the authentic cultural heritage of Lancaster County may therefore be preferable to attempts to reach new visitor highs.\Gary Hovinen\ Professor Millersville University"

George Bush has been getting some mixed messages lately. Reduce the budget deficit, he is told. But increase spending for education, health care, urban aid, land conservation, scientific research, drug programs and a long list of other concerns.
\
Former Presidents Gerald R. Ford and Jimmy Carter stopped by his office recently to recommend that the government spend $2 billion more annually on programs for children. Environmental leaders have urged the president-elect to increase the budget for the Environmental Protection Agency by 20 percent. Jesse Jackson has asked for special help for strapped farmers.
\
As he prepares to assume the presidency on Jan. 20, Bush is confronted with spending pressures that have been building like air in a balloon during the Reagan administration.
\
""The pent-up demands are much more than in recent years,"" said Richard Brandon, staff director of the Senate Budget Committee. ""We have substantially cut back on domestic programs over the last eight years.""
\
Bush himself recommended some of the spending increases during his presidential campaign, suggesting that his goal of a ""kinder, gentler nation"" would be enhanced by more federal money for child care, education and health care.
\
But that is just for starters:
\
* Dealing with the nation's insolvent savings and loans will cost at least $50 billion, according to the General Accounting Office.
\
* Building the space station will cost an estimated $28 billion and operating it will cost an estimated $1.4 billion annually.
\
* Cleaning up the government's aging nuclear weapons plants will cost an estimated $100 billion to $130 billion over a number of years.
\
* Providing long-term care for the elderly, to help pay for nursing home and other costs, could cost anywhere from $8 billion to more than $50 billion each year.
\
* Expanding Medicaid, the government's health program for the poor, to assist those without health insurance could cost $27 billion annually.
\
* Repairing the government's deteriorating public housing will cost about $20 billion, according to a Department of Housing and Urban Development estimate.
\
""There's the supercollider (atom smasher), which has been committed to, but not funded,"" Brandon said. ""There's a lot of pressure for rural economic development. Obviously, there's a lot of unfunded defense commitments, and we have to decide whether to cut back the commitments or fund them.""
\
Brandon, within the space of a few minutes, then proceeded to tick off many other possibilities, including more money for the Philippines, to keep U.S. military bases there; increased economic development aid for Central America, and additional funds to deal with homelessness.
\
A staff report of the House Budget Committee lists even more spending pressures: additional funding for the Census Bureau to conduct the 1990 census; overdue payments to the United Nations; job retraining expenses, and more money for AIDS research and treatment, among other things.
\
Budget analysts agree that there is no way Bush and Congress can satisfy all the spending demands. Even modest increases may be difficult to enact.
\
""Given the nervousness of the financial markets, you just cannot float proposals that appear to worsen the deficit,"" said Carol Cox, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan group.
\
As a result, Cox said, advocates of spending increases will propose offsetting the extra dollars with either spending cuts or tax increases. ""I don't think it's as impossible as some people believe,"" said Cox.
\
She suggested, for example, that additional spending for Head Start, a widely acclaimed educational program for poor children, could be financed by eliminating less-praised spending on vocational programs.
\
Ford and Carter, in their recent report to Bush on the problems facing the country, took somewhat the same approach. To finance additional spending for Head Start, prenatal care, childhood immunizations and other programs, they recommended tax increases for gasoline, cigarettes and liquor, as well as spending limitations in Social Security and Medicare.
\
And when environmental leaders conferred with Bush, they suggested nearly $17 billion in tax increases to finance the programs they described as ''necessary to ensure the livability of our planet."" The alternative, they said in a report called ""Blueprint for the Environment,"" is to ""stand by and watch the decline of the natural systems on which all life depends.""
\
But conflicts are inevitable. Ford and Carter would use gasoline tax increases to help finance children's programs. The environmental leaders would use the same tax for environmental programs. Others have suggested that gas tax increases be used to repair roads and bridges. And Bush vows not to raise the gas tax - or any other - at all.
\
Budget experts predict that any decisions on spending increases will have to await an agreement between Congress and Bush on reducing the budget deficit. The target, set by the Gramm-Rudman law, is $100 billion for the next fiscal year. The deficit last fiscal year was $155 billion.
\
Few are banking on a quick agreement, despite promises by both Bush and congressional leaders to address the deficit problem expeditiously.
\
More likely, budget analysts said, is that it will take a crisis to produce an accord. Two possibilities: an expiration of the government's borrowing authority in the summer, and the prospect of automatic spending cuts in the fall under the Gramm-Rudman law.
\
""The coincidence of those two things will likely compel action,"" said Cox.

591,"HARRISBURG -- Gov. Ed Rendell has carried out an executive order placing 1.5 million acres of state forest land off-limits for natural gas drilling, getting praise from environmental groups but sharp criticism from Senate Republican leader Joe Scarnati.\Brickbats were flying Tuesday between Democrat Rendell and Republican Scarnati over the moratorium order, which bans any more drilling pads from being located in state forests, other than on the 700,000 acres of forest land already designated for gas drilling by the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources.\Penn Future's leader Jan Jarrrett and Sierra Club Director Jeff Schmidt applauded the decision. \""More [drilling] leases would fragment the habitat and destroy the very essence of the forests, along with our valuable outdoor tourism industry that attracts hunters and anglers from across the nation,"" Ms. Jarrett said.\The leasing moratorium resulted in part from an ongoing feud between Democrats and Republicans over the failure to enact a severance tax on natural gas pumped from underground Marcellus Shale, much of which lies deep below state forests.\Mr. Rendell blamed the GOP-led Senate for ""failing to negotiate in good faith"" to enact a tax compromise. He said legislators had ""broken a promise to the people"" to enact such a tax this session, with much of the revenue to be used to protect the environment. The Legislature has now gone home, and the Senate says it won't be back after Tuesday's election.\Mr. Scarnati rejected the Rendell criticism, saying the Senate has always been willing to pass a reasonable extraction tax on shale gas. But he claimed the high tax rate that Mr. Rendell and House Democrats want will hurt the industry just as it begins to bring hundreds of new jobs to Pennsylvania.\""I understand he likes headlines, but in six days he won't get any more headlines,"" said Mr. Scarnati, who is also the lieutenant governor, referring to the fact that a new governor will be elected next Tuesday.\""This isn't Philadelphia -- he wasn't elected dictator or king,"" Mr. Scarnati said, adding that the Senate is ""an equal branch of government. We will take a look at the language of his directive and see if it's within his executive authority. If not, we may file suit.""\Mr. Rendell insisted he has the authority to impose the drilling moratorium in order to protect valuable state forests. ""If he wants to sue, let him sue, but he can't win,"" the governor said.\Mr. Rendell called on the two candidates for governor, Republican Tom Corbett and Democrat Dan Onorato, to continue the no-new-drilling moratorium once one of them takes office in January.\Onorato spokesman Brian Herman agreed, saying, ""Dan has long supported a moratorium on drilling leases in state forests because he believes that we should develop the industry and create jobs and that there is enough privately owned land to make that happen.""\But Corbett spokesman Kevin Harley flatly refused, saying, ""Mr. Corbett will rescind this order when he becomes governor. This is typical of Ed Rendell. A severance tax will be passed on to consumers through higher gas prices. He wants to increase citizens' energy bills when the state is already getting lease and royalty payments"" by leasing forest land to companies for drilling.\A group representing smaller gas producers, the Independent Oil and Gas Association, also assailed Mr. Rendell's move placing forests off-limits for drilling, claiming he had ""put political expediency above level-headed policymaking with this short-sighted moratorium. It ignores the real financial benefit being realized by the state from both lease and royalty payments.""\Mr. Rendell said he has already compromised on his original gas tax proposal, while the Senate has refused to budge. His original tax plan, based on a shale gas tax in West Virginia, would have raised $249 million in its first year, he said Tuesday.\By contrast, a plan passed by the Democratic House would have generated $304 million the first year, but he said a lower tax rate proposed by the Senate GOP would produce only $63 million the first year. He called that amount ""a giveaway to the gas industry.""\Mr. Rendell said that a new compromise plan, with an initial 3 percent tax on extracted gas, would generate $134 million in the first year, less of a burden on gas producers than his original plan. Senate Republicans said their plan, a 1.5 percent a year tax initially, later rising to 5 percent a year, would produce $100 million in revenue by the second or third years.\Besides issuing the moratorium, Mr. Rendell on Tuesday also called on the Senate to return to session Nov. 8 -- the same day the House plans to return -- to resume talks on a severance tax, so a deal can be worked out before the end of session Nov. 30.\""We are appalled that the Senate failed to pass a natural gas severance tax, a state forest protection bill or other Marcellus gas-related legislation before adjourning,"" said the Sierra Club's Mr. Schmidt.\And a new wrinkle was added to the Marcellus dispute, as five Republican senators -- all from the southeast, where enactment of a severance tax is popular with voters -- asked their leaders to resume four-caucus talks on a tax. They said they hope ""that a severance tax can be enacted before the end of the legislative session.""\But Mr. Scarnati said that for months the Senate has planned not to return for the three-week ""lame duck"" session in November. He said one of the legislative reforms put into place several years ago was to prevent senators who are lame ducks, meaning they are leaving office, from enacting new taxes. Mr. Rendell said that reform is a worthy goal but there should be some exceptions and action of a severance tax is one of them."
592,"WASHINGTON — The senators who spent months stitching together a nearly $1 trillion infrastructure package are now trying to sell it to the American people before a key vote expected this week that would push a long recognized national priority much closer to the finish line, after years of talk.\Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said Tuesday that the $65 billion for broadband means that some people in her state would get access to the internet for the first time. “The pandemic that we have endured for more than a year laid bare the disparities in access to high-speed internet,” Collins said.\Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, spoke of how the bill would lead to more rural and Native Alaskans having access to a sink to wash their hands in. The bill dedicates about $55 billion in new funding for water and wastewater systems. “We have to do right by our Native people,” she said.\Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., noted there is about $16 billion for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that would help fund projects designed to curb coastal erosion. “My state has lost as much land as is in the entire state of Delaware. But other states are losing land, too,” he said.\And Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., talked about how $110 billion in new funding for roads and bridges would mean access to markets for farms in Montana such as his own. “It is critically important we keep our aging bridges and roads and airports up to snuff,” Tester said.\The lawmakers, part of a group that they like to call the G-10, for gang of 10 — five Republican, five Democratic senators — are appealing to the wishes of many voters for not only better airports, roads and internet service, but also for some bipartisanship in Washington, without being directly asked to pay for those improvements through higher income taxes or user fees.\While it’s looking like the Senate will approve the bill during the coming week, supporters of the legislation will face an array of obstacles advancing the package, a major priority in President Joe Biden’s agenda. Interest groups on both sides of the political spectrum are taking aim at provisions they don’t like, potentially unraveling the agreement.\Some conservatives don’t like that the agreement moves the country further away from relying on user fees, such as the federal gas tax, to pay for highway and transit improvements. Others are wary that the bill sets a course for much more federal spending after the government already provided for nearly $5 trillion dedicated to COVID relief. This week, the Treasury Department warned Congress it was hitting the nation’s debt limit.\“Every single time we add an enormous sum to our national debt, there is bipartisanship behind it,” Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, said.\Environmental groups worry that the bill doesn’t do enough to address climate change.\“It is clear that the deal does not meet the moment on climate or justice,″ said Tiernan Sittenfeld, a senior vice president of the League of Conservation Voters.\The pressure from the left underpins House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s statement that there won’t be a House vote on the bipartisan infrastructure plan until the Senate also passes the $3.5 trillion Democratic bill that boosts spending on health, environment and social programs.\The Senate is plowing through efforts to amend the narrower infrastructure bill, which will require 60 votes to advance for passage. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is intent on passing the legislation as soon as possible so that the Senate can turn its attention to a budget blueprint that will set the stage for crafting and passing the larger $3.5 trillion package in the fall.\Formally called the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the proposal has clocked in at some 2,700 pages.\The Senate’s Republican leader, Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, has sided with those voting to allow debate to proceed, but he has not said how he will ultimately vote. He said Tuesday the bill has a chance to be a “bipartisan success story for the country,” but he is warning Democrats against trying to speed up the amendment process.\“Like a lot of us, I’m interested in what it looks like in the end,” McConnell said. “... The past two administrations tried to do it, were unable to. The American people need it. I think it’s one of those areas where there seems to be broad, bipartisan agreement.”\So far, the Senate has overwhelmingly approved three noncontroversial amendments, while rejecting two others. As the amendment process gets underway, senators are weighing how much to try to change the package and how hard to try, knowing it will be difficult to reach the 60-vote threshold to approve any substantial changes.\In addition to the $110 billion in new spending for roads and bridges and $55 billion for water and wastewater infrastructure, the bipartisan package is expected to provide, $39 billion for public transit and $66 billion for rail. There’s also to be billions for airports, ports, broadband internet and electric vehicle charging stations.\Paying for the package has been a challenge after senators rejected ideas to raise revenue from a new gas tax or other streams. Instead, it is being financed from funding sources that might not pass muster with deficit hawks, including repurposing some $205 billion in untapped COVID-19 relief aid, as well as unemployment assistance that was turned back by some states, and relying on projected future economic growth.\The bipartisan bill still faces a rough road in the House, where progressive lawmakers want a more robust package but may have to settle for this one to keep Biden’s infrastructure plans on track.\The outcome with the bipartisan effort will set the stage for the next debate over Biden’s much more ambitious $3.5 trillion package, a strictly partisan pursuit of far-reaching programs and services including child care and health care that touch almost every corner of American life. Republicans strongly oppose that bill, which would require a simple majority for passage. Final votes on that measure are not expected until fall.\———\Associated Press staff writer Matthew Daly contributed to this report."

Supports Moylan
\
Editor: In the 17th Congressional District race, two Catholics are running: incumbent Rep. Matthew Cartwright and challenger Dr. David Moylan.
\
Dr. Moylan is 100 percent pro-life and will fight for tougher abortion restrictions.
\
Cartwright claims to be pro-life but has a zero approval rating from the National Right to Life Committee and a 100 percent approval rating from Planned Parenthood Action Committee.
\
Planned Parenthood is the largest provider of abortions in the country. Cartwright also voted against the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which would ban abortions after 20 weeks. How could he have voted to not protect the preborn? He has failed on this matter. We need Dr. Moylan in Congress.

Editor: I read with interest a recent report card on legislators issued by three Pennsylvania environmental organizations - Clean Water Action, the Sierra Club and Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania.
\
Many area legislators scored low on the issues selected by the organizations. This is not a big surprise, as we have witnessed a headlong rush to exploit natural gas resources.
\
The environmental pitfalls of rapid gas development were largely dismissed by our Legislature and governor when they pushed through Act 13, which pre-empted local governments from enacting zoning restrictions on drilling and fracking. That section was overturned in 2013.
\
The folly of the pre-emption of local control was highlighted in November 2012 when a natural gas station in Wyoming County released 5 million cubic feet of gas, venting loudly into the atmosphere, frightening neighbors and frustrating emergency officials who said they were inadequately informed and proper procedures were not followed.
\
When state Rep. Karen Boback (R-117, Harveys Lake) scheduled a public meeting on the gas release, the facility's owners did not attend, as reported by The Times-Tribune.
\
Perhaps in view of her support for Act 13, she scored a 50 percent rating on the environmental groups' scorecard.
\
On Nov. 4, I will remember the scorecard. I support Laura Dickson, Ms. Boback's opponent, in the race for the 117th District. Mrs. Dickson is committed to protecting Pennsylvania's land, water and natural resources.

\
I see a lot of positive impacts the Affordable Care Act has had, even before your Republican counterpart, Gov. Tom Corbett, acquiesced and expanded Medicaid in Pennsylvania.

However, if you can back up your statement with hard, indisputable facts, this should get you lots of votes. I will vote for you if you can back up your disastrous assertion.

Gas tax advocate
\
Editor: I hope Gov. Tom Corbett would not allow an auctioneer from Texas to sell the most valuable furnishings in the governor's mansion, much of it in other states and countries, and pocket the proceeds, all for a fee of 1.9 percent.
\
But that is what Mr. Corbett and the Republican Legislature allow the gas drillers to do with the state's most valuable resource, Marcellus Shale gas. In 2013 the drillers withdrew gas with a market value of $11.8 billion in exchange for $223 million in impact fees, an effective tax rate of 1.9 percent.
\
But don't drilling companies pay a lot in corporate taxes? Not so. According to data reported in June by the Pennsylvania Budget and Policy Center, drilling companies use tax dodges to lower or avoid state and local taxes. Range Resources, the third-largest gas producer in the state, avoided any state income tax last year.
\
But would a 5 percent extraction tax, a top priority for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Tom Wolf, cause the drillers to flee the state as Mr. Corbett claims? A study by two Carnegie Mellon students found that a 5 percent tax would have little effect on driller profits.
\
Mr. Corbett and the Republican Legislature, awash in gas-producer campaign contributions, refuse to enact any extraction tax.

Editor: Election day is near and the candidates are making promises.
\
They may even intend to keep them but experience has shown me that this seldom happens. They always have to deal with the system.
\
I urge area voters to think about and read up on where the gubernatorial candidates stand because they both have some good ideas. However, Democrat Tom Wolf has run many ads declaring his intent to raise taxes, especially on the gas industry to support increased funding for education.
\
Nobody is against education, indeed it should be a priority for all. But, if you think that the gas industry will finance this you are mistaken. It is basic business economics that every person who consumes natural gas will pay this tax. The gas companies will not absorb it.
\
So, if you heat your home or water with gas, cook with gas, or consume products or services that use natural gas, you will pay this tax. If you live in an area of drilling activity, your community may lose its share of the current extraction tax, which helps to maintain roads and services used by the industry, their subcontractors, employees, and everything else that supports the business of gas extraction.

Wolf-Rendell ties
\
Editor: In response to a published comment about U.S. Rep. Tom Marino providing Dunmore businessman Louis DeNaples with a personal reference for his gaming license that was mentioned in the book ""The Quiet Don,"" the book also alleges former state Democratic Sens. Robert Mellow and Vince Fumo formulated the plan for gambling under the direction of then-Gov. Ed Rendell.
\
Records show DeNaples contributed heavily to Rendell's campaign.
\
When a Dauphin County grand jury looked into allegations that DeNaples allegedly lied about his ties to organized crime, his lawyers appealed to the state Supreme Court, which intervened and suspended the prosecution.
\
Tied into this was a reported investigation into Rendell and his administration related to the gambling license process.
\
Democratic gubernatorial candidate Tom Wolf was Rendell's secretary of revenue. If elected, will he funnel lucrative contracts to his former boss's Philadelphia law firm?

Since he is backed by unions, will we have state government run by unions like in the city of Scranton? Will a local landfill get its proposed expansion? To receive a yes answer to these questions vote for Wolf.

594,"The following CORRECTION/CLARIFICATION appeared on July 2, 2008:A story on the effect of fuel prices on the presidential campaign in Sunday's editions incorrectly identified John Zogby as a Republican pollster. He is independent.\Should Sen. Barack Obama be worried about voters like George Mowad?\Standing by a gas pump at a BP Station in Squirrel Hill earlier this week, Mr. Mowad squinted at the meter's numbers as they spun into the $40 zone -- with no end in sight -- and shook his head.\""I like [Sen.] John McCain, but I'm open to Obama,"" said the 52-year-old Forest Hills resident, a registered Republican. ""He seems charismatic -- a nice guy. I could see myself voting for him. But not if he doesn't do something about finding more oil, even if it means drilling off our coasts or in Alaska. Energy is the main issue for me.""\As the general election season approaches, independent voters like Mr. Mowad may present a real problem for Mr. Obama -- and an opportunity for his Republican opponent, Mr. McCain.\They may like the Democrat's message of change, but they also like affordable gasoline, and with Mr. McCain's call to end the 1981 moratorium on drilling off the U.S. coastline -- which Mr. Obama opposes -- pollsters and political strategists believe the GOP may have found a potent ""wedge"" issue for the fall campaign.\""Everywhere Sen. McCain travels, voters are telling him they are fed up with gas prices,"" noted Paul Lindsay, a spokesman for the Arizona senator's campaign. On Friday, crude prices reached another record high.\Mr. Obama's campaign did not return a request for comment, but other experts believe that if gas prices continue to soar, Mr. Obama needs to move aggressively with proposals that will provide relief at the pump or he'll lose crucial undecideds, independents and moderate Republicans in swing states like Pennsylvania.\Voters want it all\Beyond being a pocketbook issue, the offshore drilling debate gives the GOP a chance to sharpen the ideological and cultural differences between the candidates -- this time on the environment.\Republicans are ""asking voters who have heard for the past two decades that drilling presents an environmental danger to take a different view, now that they're faced with $4-plus gasoline, because economics trumps the environment,"" said Terry Madonna, director of the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Franklin and Marshall College in Lancaster.\Ultimately, the candidate who wins on this issue will be the one who can make the best case for ""a quality, sensible program that relies on increasing capacity while looking at alternatives. That's the kind of program that voters will buy into.""\""The voters want all of it,"" added Michael McKenna, a Washington, D.C.-based pollster who focuses on energy issues. ""They have yet to hear an idea they hate: they want conservation, they want to invest in renewables, they want offshore drilling where appropriate, they want liquefied coal if it's done in an environmentally safe way. They're telling us they want balance -- and if the Democrats don't hear that message, they will be in a tough spot.""\A recent survey by Republican pollster John Zogby found that 75 percent of undecided voters support offshore drilling; a Gallup Poll found independents favoring it by 56 percent to 43 percent. Overall public support for domestic exploration is probably even more than that, adds Republican strategist Kevin Madden.\""It's become an 80/20 issue almost overnight,"" he said, arguing that the continued resistance by Democrats to offshore drilling is ""lazy thinking on their part. Democrats are adhering to the gravitational pull of ideology, but voters aren't looking at it from that point.""\Opponents of offshore drilling insist it's all how polling questions are worded.\""These pollsters are making the assertion that drilling equals significantly lower gasoline prices, which just isn't the case, and even Republicans admit that,"" said Tony Massaro, political director for the League of Conservation Voters, who noted that Mr. Obama beat Mr. McCain by 19 points in a mid-June Gallup poll that asked who was better equipped to handle energy issues.\""The particulars of offshore drilling aren't hurting Obama,"" Mr. Massaro said. ""When it comes to overall energy policy, I don't think the voters are looking at things blindly. To some degree they're able to discern what is good policy and what isn't.""\He may have a point. Local voters of both political parties buttonholed at gas stations last week noted that offshore drilling would take years to have an impact and that the impact would be minimal, at best.\""It's a ludicrous idea, even if we eventually do see benefits,"" said Ella Gluckman, 23, of Point Breeze, who supports Mr. Obama and the Democratic party's emphasis on reducing consumption. ""Do I want to ruin our environment for six months worth of oil? No way.""\""It's not going to lower gas prices by much,"" added Bob Plocki, 48, of Harrison Township, ""and we'd have to wait 20 years for it. Both sides are dishing propaganda, but I think Obama had better start listening to the people and come up with solutions or he doesn't stand a chance.""\Sensing an opening, the McCain campaign last week hammered away with a message to beleaguered motorists: He feels your pain. Television ads tagged Mr. Obama as the ""Dr. No of Energy Security"" for nixing proposals to offshore drilling, a gas tax holiday, the electric car and ""clean, safe nuclear energy.""\Still, even as they seize the momentum, Republicans have at times stepped on their own message. On Monday, after pushing for offshore drilling, Mr. McCain acknowledged no immediate relief would be forthcoming -- rather, ""the fact that we are exploiting those reserves would have psychological impact that I think is beneficial.""\That, argues Mr. Massaro, undercuts the GOP's argument. ""Voters realize the energy issue isn't fought on one front. Drilling is a piece of it, but how one treats oil companies is a piece of it too,"" he said.\""Mr. McCain is pushing for $3.8 billion in new tax breaks for the oil industry and voters are going to pay attention to that,"" he said. ""And they will see that John McCain equals increased tax cuts for Big Oil.""\Nonsense, countered Mr. McKenna.\""I've conducted 14 focus groups on energy in the past three months and in none of them has anyone volunteered that the problem is speculation,"" he said.\It's not that Big Oil can't be an effective club for the Democrats at some point, he added, ""but right now the political ground isn't fertile for that sales pitch. Instead, we're hearing, 'Dude, if the Chinese think it's important to drill off Florida, why don't we?' ""\There are other obstacles ahead for Mr. McCain as he navigates this issue, Mr. McKenna said. The voters who are most agitated ""are in the middle and lower middle classes who are not totally sold on the Republican candidate. Plus McCain and Obama are pretty much on the same page about climate change, so he's somewhat restrained by that.""\""If [McCain] wakes up every morning and says, 'If I'm President, here's what I'm going to do about gas prices, and what is Sen. Obama going to do?' he'll make some headway.""\Still, he argues, it's unlikely that anything less than massive increases in gasoline prices will trigger widespread shifts in voter allegiances -- at least among those who have already decided whom they support.\""Gas is going to go up no matter whether we drill offshore or not,"" said Sarah Leimkuehler, 30, of the South Side, who was filling up her 1997 Oldsmobile's tank at a GetGo station in Homestead last week.\A McCain supporter, she declared that other issues matter more to her, ""like health insurance, given that I come from a family of small business owners.""\""There are things more important than driving a car,"" added Aubrey Garber, 25, who must commute every day from her apartment in the South Side to a Green Tree restaurant, where she works as a waitress. It costs her $50 every time she fills her tank.\""I just lost my health insurance and frankly I'm more concerned about that,"" said Ms. Garber, an Obama supporter.\Then she shrugged.\""If gas goes up to eight dollars a gallon by December, which is what some of my friends are telling me, I'll just have to find a job on the South Side."""

IS DAVID COHEN 'PORTLY'? THAT IS THE QUESTION
\
Rarely have I witnessed as quick and violent a reaction to one of your editorials as the reaction to the Dec. 22 editorial, ""David Cohen's magic touch."" Not with the general substance, but with your description of the mayor's chief of staff as a ""portly young man.""
\
I believe a clarification might be called for.
\
Arthur Makadon, Mr. Cohen's closest friend at his old law firm, says he has never seen the word portly used to described someone under 40 years old. (David Cohen is 37.)
\
Joe Torsella, Mr. Cohen's closest associate in the mayor's office, believes portly is more apt to describe an 18th-century figure in a white wig. In fact (to quote an ex-mayor) the dictionary says that portly - in its original definition - means having a dignified and stately port or demeanor.
\
This is where I - on behalf of scores of interested parties - am asking for a formal clarification by the Editorial Board. Did, indeed, The Inquirer mean to describe David Cohen as stout, heavy, chubby, obese, thickset, flabby, pudgy, rotund, beefy, lumpish, corpulent, large, substantial, fully figured, burly, tubby, endomorphic - or was it just plain fat? I don't think so.
\
While these words might very clearly describe another prominent figure in the mayor's office, I don't think they meant to describe David Cohen.
\
Was The Philadelphia Inquirer Editorial Board really drawing on the original meaning and trying to capture David Cohen's demeanor - ""the manner in which one carries oneself?"" Thousands wait for your response.

MISCARRIAGES OF JUSTICE
\
It is painfully obvious that innocent men do not need to be pardoned. Ergo, Caspar Weinberger is guilty, eminently so from his own meticulously kept notes. Ronald Reagan is also guilty, according to those self-same notes, of violating clear-cut laws of the United States.
\
I believe that the climate for these violations was carved in stone when Richard Nixon did not go to Leavenworth for some rather heavy-duty offenses against this country as well as besmirching the office of the presidency. Had he done some hard time, then Ronnie might have had second thoughts about his part in the sordid affairs that marked his terms in office. The same potential truism holds for the Bush administration.
\
This country of ours is supposed to have a level playing field when it comes to dispensing justice, but it is patently obvious that there exists a royal elite who operate above the law, with a good deal of impunity.
\
This sad state of affairs with our system of justice is mirrored, in a smaller way, with the present stink associated with the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. In both cases, the legal system needs someone carrying a big stick in order that justice will actually be more than a word in the dictionary.

I was shocked to see the name Rodney King in the recent Sunday Family/ Fashion section under the heading of what's out in 1992. Racism is a disease in our society. I liken your treatment of Rodney King's name to saying that AIDS or breast cancer are ""out"" of fashion.

IN PRAISE OF BILL LYON
\
I would like to thank The Inquirer for another year of the excellence that Bill Lyon brings to your sports department. His columns are always timely and informative but most important they are positive.
\
Recently he wrote an article about Antone Davis, the much-criticized offensive lineman of the Eagles, which was one of the nicest tributes to a struggling young football player I have ever read. It has to be a great morale-booster to Antone after several years of negative reviews by other sportswriters and fans.
\
This was just one of many similar columns by Mr. Lyon in which he has offered helpful thoughts and critiques in an industry that seems to thrive on the negative. It's refreshing to see quality, positive sportswriting, especially in Philadelphia, where there's been little to cheer about in sports for some years.

FOREIGN-POLICY ERRORS
\
With the naming of Warren Christopher as Secretary of State and Anthony Lake as National Security Adviser, President-elect Clinton has, in my opinion, made a serious mistake in foreign-policy direction.
\
As deputy secretary of state under Jimmy Carter, Mr. Christopher followed a human-rights policy that was a direct cause of the Iran debacle resulting in the infamous hostage crisis of 1979-1980. Instead of bringing improved human rights to the people of Iran, Mr. Carter brought the far more brutal repression of the Islamic fundamentalists.
\
Anthony Lake ""shares Christopher's interest in promoting human rights as a top international priority,"" according to The Inquirer's report on Dec. 23.
\
Contrary to Mr. Clinton's campaign promises, this is hardly a ""centrist Democratic"" foreign policy, but rather the same disastrous philosophy that changed for the worse the balance of power in the Middle East.

RESTRAINTS ON FUEL USE ARE ADVOCATED
\
With the threat of an energy crisis looming in the imminent future, the federal government needs to make changes now to protect our petroleum reserves. The most feasible way to do this would be to impose restraints on the purchase of fuel. Although raising the gas tax would not be a popular action, it is a very necessary one that we must take if we are to be able to meet our future demands of petroleum-based products.
\
As a teenage student (at the Germantown Friends School), I am very concerned about the world that my generation is going to inherit, and I hope that something can be done now to prevent great disasters from falling into our hands.
\
The projected expenditures for petroleum are astronomical. As near as 1995, we may be faced with a serious shortage of petroleum supplies. We need to do something now in order to prevent this from happening. The United States uses approximately one-third of all the petroleum used in the world. However, we only have about 12 percent of the world's petroleum in our reserves. The rest we are importing and becoming dependent on foreign supplies, which, as we saw in the Persian Gulf War, can cause problems.
\
Compared to the prices of gasoline in other countries, our price is very low. The average tax levied on a gallon of gas sold in Europe is eight times higher than it is in the United States. By raising the gas tax slightly, we would not do great damage to the world market. The higher price may, however, deter people from overusing their cars so much and improve the success of public transportation systems, which are environmentally more sound. This would be extremely beneficial and is exactly what the goal of such a tax raise would be.
\
The other thing that the federal government must do to impede the waste of petroleum is to force car manufacturers to improve the fuel-efficiency of their cars. Three-quarters of all fuel used in automobiles is wasted, and there is a great need for manufacturers to reduce the waste by making their cars more efficient. This option would be popular with consumers, who would not have to buy so much gas and would save money.
\
Unless something is done now to reduce the amount of petroleum products we use daily, in the near future we will find that the supplies cannot meet the demand. Our government needs to take the initiative and institute these tax raises and increase environment awareness. If we do so, we will improve the world for ourselves and future generations.

Staff Writer Ann Belser contributed to this report.\ The $2.7 billion northern end of the Mon-Fayette Expressway has become a major headache for just about everyone.\ ""Move forward or cancel it,"" Pennsylvania Turnpike Executive Joe Brimmeier now says about the budget-busting, 24-mile section, one arm of which leads to Pittsburgh and the other to Monroeville.\ Mr. Brimmeier cautioned in May that the turnpike had ""a problem"" with the toll road expansion and called on the state Legislature to decide whether to finish what it started more than two decades ago.\ The project was first undertaken to provide a modern route to Pittsburgh and to help revitalize distressed Mon Valley steel towns.\ Because the Legislature has not taken up the challenge he issued last summer, Mr. Brimmeier said, he's appealing to lawmakers once again.\ ""Do I think the project should go forward? Absolutely!"" Mr. Brimmeier said. ""But the Legislature has to tell us, it has to provide a funding source. I can't do that. We can't do that.""\ The matter has come to a head because consulting firms designing the limited-access highway are nearly at the point at which the turnpike can start acquiring the right-of-way.\ Lawmakers directed the turnpike to expand the highway system with toll roads in 1985, but they have never provided more than a fraction of the funding, leaving a gap that has mushroomed to $3.5 billion to finish the final 31 miles of the Mon-Fayette.\ Of that amount, $2.7 billion is required to construct the Y- shaped section north from where the road now ends on Route 51 in Jefferson Hills.\ ""At some point, we have to make the decision,"" Mr. Brimmeier said, to move forward or to end the prolonged controversy and indecision. ""I intend to ask [the turnpike commission] about where they want to go with this right after New Year's.""\ These are the options for the project's future, with little optimism and even less consensus about any one of them:\ * Raise the gasoline tax, vehicle registration fees, or both. A 4- cents-a-gallon gas tax increase would be necessary to generate enough money for just the 24-mile Allegheny section.\ * Sell or lease the expressway to a private investor, although there's doubt the toll road holds enough potential profit to fund the unfinished sections.\ * Spend up to 50 percent of PennDOT's federal highway money on the toll road. That's unlikely too, since it would mean canceling other road and bridge work that the state says is already underfunded by $900 million a year.\ * Scale back the project. The most expensive piece is the ""Y"" section that is aimed at bypassing congestion on the Parkway East and in the Squirrel Hill Tunnel.\ * Cancel the 24-mile northern section and direct $250 million still in the kitty to build a seven-mile missing link near Brownsville. That would complete the road from I-68 in West Virginia to Route 51 in southern Allegheny County.\ ""Those are all reasonable options,"" Pennsylvania Transportation Secretary Allen Biehler said. ""We need to do something.""\ He said the matter will have to be taken up first by the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission, of which he is a member, and then by Gov. Ed Rendell, state lawmakers, county officials and others with a stake in the project.\ How soon?\ ""I don't know,"" Mr. Biehler said. ""But it's a discussion that needs to take place.""\ Sen. Barry Stout, D-Bentleyville, minority chairman of the Senate Transportation Committee, said now is not the time to give up on the expressway. He's the main supporter, shepherding gas tax and vehicle fee increases through the General Assembly in the 1990s to use for toll road expansions.\ ""Those who want to surrender are forgetting about the future of southwestern Pennsylvania,"" he said. ""We didn't have a penny when we started, but we've raised $1.9 billion. Look at what we've done. Those who want to give up the ship are forgetting about the future of southwestern Pennsylvania.""\ Land acquisition troubles\ State Rep. Joe Markosek, D-Monroeville, who's in line to become chairman of the House Transportation Committee next week, is another supporter.\ ""There will be a lot of hard choices and no easy answers,"" he said. ""The Mon-Fayette Expressway is a huge project requiring an extraordinary amount of funding. Given the mood of the Legislature, that is going to be difficult to achieve.""\ If lawmakers choose postponement, Mr. Brimmeier said, the turnpike could return to the northern section later, after a funding mechanism is in place.\ The short-term outlook is not bright in any case.\ Two years after the federal government gave the Turnpike Commission approval to move forward -- and after more than $100 million had been spent on consultants -- the final engineering on the northern section is only 30 percent finished.\ Turnpike officials said talk of starting to buy and clear property is premature. Nevertheless, passions are being stirred.\ Pittsburgh City Council, county officials and opponents of the nation's biggest highway project since Boston's problem-plagued ""Big Dig"" are asking the turnpike to delay acquiring the right-of-way until it can guarantee that construction money will be available.\ ""My only salvation is if they can't find the money,"" said Beverly Koch, who has been told her family of four will have to relocate and her North Versailles home of more than 50 years will be bulldozed ""like a piece of trash, so people can get to Pittsburgh in a timelier manner. I am heartsick. We do not want to leave.""\ Braddock Mayor John Fetterman can't understand the wisdom of building a massive highway through the heart of a town where many residents can't afford a car. He said years of talking but not building already have brought blight and discouraged investment.\ ""Are we as a community asking too much of them to build it or kill it?"" he said. ""Everybody deserves closure, one way or another.""\ County Executive Dan Onorato agrees.\ ""The one thing we want to avoid is buying land and waiting 30 years to do the project,"" he said, adding that at the least, he would like to see a moratorium on right-of-way purchases until there's construction money.\ County Council President Rich Fitzgerald said that even though council is on record in support of the Mon-Fayette Expressway, its members, too, are concerned about the turnpike buying properties, dropping them from tax rolls and creating vacant land that will ""leave holes in the community.""\ County Council has a resolution requesting a moratorium on taking property for the roadway on its Tuesday agenda.\ The process already has slowed on its own.\ The turnpike has yet to advertise for the right-of-way acquisition firms and real estate experts it will need to go ahead.\ 1,600 properties in the way\ And there are other complications.\ No money has been set aside for utility relocation. The turnpike must deal with a significant number of railroads intersecting the highway route.\ Little progress has been made on final design for a new interchange, ramps and feeder roads on the Hays side of the Glenwood Bridge.\ Such issues are common when trying to build a limited-access highway through an urban environment, Turnpike Engineer Frank Kempf said.\ He said the difficult phases of final design are pretty much on schedule. Planners are poised, probably late next year, to move into the land-acquisition phase for three of the 13 pieces into which the 24-mile northern section of the expressway has been divided.\ The three sections are known as A, just north of Route 51 in Jefferson Hills, where the highway now ends; C, at Route 837 in Duquesne, where the expressway is to cross the Mon River; and K, from the Pittsburgh city line west to the Glenwood Bridge.\ ""On one side, we have people telling us to put the project on hold until there's money to build,"" Mr. Kempf said. ""On the other side, we have people who know they're in the alignment and who want us to buy their properties now.""\ In the Y-shaped alignment that branches off at the north side of the Mon River to Monroeville to the east and Pittsburgh to the west, about 1,600 properties in 15 municipalities lie in the right-of- way.\ In Turtle Creek, Braddock, Rankin and part of the city's Hazelwood section, about 30 percent of the properties are tax delinquent and many are abandoned, Mr. Kempf said. Much of the blight is already the fault of the Pennsylvania Turnpike, according to PennFuture, an organization dedicated to anti-sprawl and land- use planning.\ ""Twenty years of threats of the turnpike coming in and taking their homes has been the biggest disincentive for people not to improve their properties or invest in their communities,"" said PennFuture Outreach Coordinator Andrea Boykowycz.\ PennFuture has joined the list of officials and organizations calling for a right-of-way moratorium.\ Mr. Stout, on the other hand, favors proceeding with property acquisition and preserving the corridor. When money becomes available, he said, construction can be done in phases, as it has been from the start."

The York Dispatch is asking candidates in contested elections for seats in the state Legislature a series of questions about key issues. Candidates are asked to respond in 125 words of less. Check back weekly for updates to this question and answer series.
\
Question 1:In 2010, electricity rate caps will come off for Pennsylvania's five largest power providers, including Met-Ed. Dramatic increases in electric bills are predicted once that happens. Lawmakers have proposed several alternatives for dealing with the situation. How do you think the state Legislature should react between now and then, if at all, and why?
\
Neil Clifford (D):After I am sworn in as the representative for General Assembly for the 193rd District, which covers Hanover/ Penn Township in York County and upper Adams County, I would propose to freeze the energy prices! The corporate leaders would be well advised to take the initiative and take the lead by having their wages lowered. This could be similar to the request for pilots and other laborers who are told during contract negotiations to accept pay cuts or the jobs will be lost. Deregulation can work, it has hurt the airlines, but we cannot be forced or coerced to believe the utilities will fail without these price increases. Someone will come to forward to manage these utilities better, it all about inept leadership.
\
Will Tallman (R):While I believe in free market principles, our citizens and businesses cannot take a 30 to 60 percent increase next year. The whole idea of deregulation with its promised benefits to the consumer was flawed from the start as is most government programs that promise citizens relief. For example, Act 1 of 2007 was to provide substantial property tax relief and a voice in our local school budget but has failed on both accounts. In light of such shattered expectations, we should phase out the rate caps over a period of years. During this phase out, the PUC should be mandated to start serving the public side rather than just the utilities. Additionally, they must explore alternative fuels and generation sources to drive the costs lower.
\
Question 2:State officials recently learned that the federal government has rejected the proposal to place tolls on Interstate 80. That eliminates a source of funding the government and state Legislature committed to road and bridge repairs under Act 44. Some are calling for resubmitting the toll proposal, while Gov. Ed Rendell is pushing to lease the Pennsylvania Turnpike. Increases in the gas tax, drivers license fees and vehicle registration fees are other possible sources of revenue. Which of those options would you support? Which do you oppose? How should the state address this issue and why?
\
Clifford:I do not support increasing any of the listed ideas, no more gas tax for the public. No more increases on the public period. I would oppose any increase placed on the working people. I will recommend the CEO's need to cut their wages during this critical time in our nation's history. I would seek to have the corporations that are price gauging the public to freeze the energy rates. I especially do not support leasing the turnpike; leasing our property to foreigners has to be one of the dumbest ideas ever put forward. It is time for those that have, the elite to show their true colors and come to the aid of the people with fixed incomes and help the public.
\
Tallman:Why does the answer always have to be to raise taxes? The answer is to live within the budget. Additionally, we are working to solve the increased energy cost and Pennsylvanians cannot afford to give yet a greater percent of their income to the government for its redistribution. As people prosper, revenue will flow into the budget; the more prosperity, the more money flowing in. So the real question should be, ""How do we help people prosper?"" Prosperity is gained by paying less tax, not more. The answer is to reduce taxes and lure in higher paying jobs. The problem, of course, is that Pennsylvania very nearly is the most business-unfriendly state in America. That needs to change. Let's help business choose Pennsylvania!
\
Question 3:School property taxes continue to be an issue in Harrisburg, despite the tax relief offered through Act 1. Should more be done to alleviate the property tax burden? If so, what? Have the school district cost controls adopted by the Legislature as part of Act 1 -- voter approval of tax increases under certain circumstances -- been effective? Should more be done in that regard?
\
Clifford:To alleviate this unfair burden on property owners I propose a plan that would consist of an income tax for all workers in the state and a sales tax to be paid across the board by all people who buy products in our state. Relief will be in sight for property owners with this plan. The school district cost controls adopted by the Legislature as part of Act 1 does not work. There has been a way out for some districts, including Bermudian Springs, that have done this without voter approval of tax increases! Under some certain circumstances money has not been budgeted wisely or spent effectively. More must be done with regard to personal responsibility of all elected officials; including school board leaders.
\
Tallman:Despite Act 1 legislation to protect taxpayers, its exceptions have allowed Pennsylvania's 501 school districts to completely sidestep voter approval for budgets. Before Act 1 we had 1998's Act 50, 2001's Act 24, and 2004's Act 72. All were dismal failures. When will Harrisburg get it? No matter how you do the approximate $16 billion school funding from property tax, it will be opposed by whichever group upon which the new tax is levied. We need to bring school costs under control, tighten the exceptions to escaping a referendum, and freeze or eliminate property tax as a funding source. My plan brings all of the above into reality and provides real property tax relief. I also am willing to accept reasonable compromise on this issue.
\
Question 4:Earlier this year, charges were filed against 12 individuals after an investigation into bonuses allegedly given to state employees for campaign work. Would you vote in favor of a measure prohibiting lawmakers from awarding bonuses to state employees? Pinpoint another reform measure you would support should you be elected and explain why you think it's among the most important change lawmakers could make.
\
Clifford:Yes, I am in support of a measure prohibiting legislators from awarding bonuses to state employees. I would initiate a proposal to amend the Pennsylvania Constitution Article VIII, Section Ten, which could give authority to the auditor general to audit the spending of legislative branch. In addition Article II, Section Two should similarly be amended to ensure the executive power would be able to be watched in the same manner. The time has come to stop the corruption and politics as usual in our state and nation. The people are the government; it appears to me some people have forgotten that concept. No one is above the law of the land.
\
Tallman:First, to clarify, the Republican House Caucus stopped paying bonuses several years ago and the Democrats have not. I favor the Republican philosophy of eliminating bonuses. Another reform whose time has come is the establishment of term limits. Enacting term limits would do much toward eliminating the need for the abuse that Bonusgate has revealed. We need to return to the original concept of our founders of having a citizen legislative body rather than professional politicians. The problems we have identified flow from an appalling lack of integrity in those who hold elective office and in their office staff. The question: ""How do we select people of integrity?"" The answer may be to observe the things that an individual values in their personal life.
\
Question 5:Two longtime state senators recently warned that the nation's economic turmoil could result in dire revenue shortfalls that might require a tax increase to rectify when state lawmakers adopt the 2009-10 budget next July. If cost cuts aren't enough to balance the budget, if those warnings turn out to be true and an increase in taxes/fees is necessary, what approach would be the fairest? What taxes/fees should the state look at and why?
\
Clifford:I would propose a measure that would end state employees unlimited perks, mine included, if the voters should elect me on Nov. 4 to represent the 193rd District which covers Hanover and Penn Township in York County and upper rural Adams County. I stated before the people are the government. Currently I have a car. I see no need for a vehicle paid by the taxpayers! This would only be the beginning of larger ideas to cut cost incurred throughout the state in each legislative district. I would vote for a tax increase as a last resort. My office would attempt to cut cost from 5 percent of the current expenses being paid now for the offices and employees of my staff.
\
Tallman:Raising taxes in this tough economic environment is almost the worst scenario possible. Instead, we need to stimulate both personal and economic growth; increasing taxes, however, is counterproductive to both of these. We need to have bigger family budgets and smaller state budgets. Rather than raise taxes, we need to cut costs aggressively at the state level. This is the exactly the strategy we use in our personal finances when our own income drops. Additionally, we need to become proactive in doing all that we can to promote economic growth here in Pennsylvania. In order to have good jobs, our state must focus on becoming more business friendly, rather than driving business away.
\
Question 6:Previous questions in this series have dealt with electricity caps, school property tax reform, transportation funding, government reform and potential budget shortfalls in 2009-10. Now we'd like you to identify another key issue to residents in your district, or another priority you'll take to Harrisburg. Please explain how you would address that issue?
\
Clifford:I am currently researching the head levels required for the concept of hydro power generation; safety must be number one priority. I would like to review the state's plan to remove the dams along the Conewago Creek. The EPA and the players in power have neglected the culture of the creek people living near here. There is support locally to create electricity with this renewable energy source. In addition this would keep our area green and promote the outdoors and recreational activity for sportsman and others.Campaign finance and fund raising certainly became an issue in this campaign at all levels in our government. It is difficult to comprehend the magnitude of the money required to run for public office in our government.
\
Tallman:Jobs and the economy have moved to the front in recent weeks as voter concerns in the 193rd Legislative district, along with the rest of the country. It is the responsibility of Harrisburg to make Pennsylvania a job-friendly state. Currently, our overwhelming rules, regulations and taxes under the Rendell administration make it less attractive for businesses to grow or locate in Pennsylvania. We can make Pennsylvania job-friendly by changing the repressive nature of doing business here. We must reform the way we do taxes, reduce regulations to encourage growth, and enact a Taxpayer Bill of Rights. If we can accomplish these changes our children will not need to leave to find good jobs in other states where jobs and businesses are encouraged to grow.
\
Question 7:What qualities and qualifications do you have that make you the candidate voters should support on Nov. 4?
\
Clifford:I know the struggles that working class people in this district face. I will work at bipartisan solutions to difficult problems. Some of the qualities I offer are what remains important to me, to live as a social servant. The qualities I most revere in anyone, whether they are running for office or not, include courage, perseverance and tenacity, integrity and also one who is prudent when acting so that few mistakes happen. You are my first priority and I am like the voters of this district. I go to work every day. Like many, I work the third shift. My personal knowledge and experience of the peoples concerns for our local issues would be the reason to vote for me on Nov. 4.
\
Tallman:My broad knowledge base and diverse experiences will allow me to scale the learning curve very quickly in Harrisburg. These will help shield me from fine-sounding nonsense when issues arise. I have a record that shows I am willing to challenge my own party leadership when I believe they are not doing the right thing. While I work hard to build a consensus, I realize there are times when one must just take a stand against foolishness. I am both a fiscal conservative and social conservative and have been involved in these issues at both the local, state and national level. Talk is cheap, but I have a history of supporting and actively working on conservative issues, not just talking about them.

"
598,"
196th House District:
\
Seth Grove (R)
\
Elizabeth Roberts (R)
\
Our election page has more information about this race and the others that affect York County in 2014.
\
1. Two property tax reform bills were voted on last year in the House. House Bill 1189 from Rep. Seth Grove, R-Dover Township, gives each school district the choice to move from property tax to income and other taxes, passed the House and is awaiting approval from the Senate. House Bill 76, from Rep. Jim Cox, R-Berks County, would completely eliminate property taxes. However, the bill failed a vote in the House. Do you support either of these bills? Why or why not? If you don't support either of these bills, please explain your position on property tax reform.
\
Grove:HB 76 would not eliminate any school district's property taxes in York County. This is why, once again, a statewide mandated fix failed to get votes. It was also because the bill itself needed completely redrafted as it always does, because it has severe Constitutional violations and needed many corrections. The Department of Revenue pointed this out in their June 2013 analysis. During debate, even the prime sponsor said it wasn't correct and he didn't even read it.
\
After all the failed attempts at a statewide solution, I drafted and passed HB 1189 which has been endorsed by the School Business Officials - the people who manage school finances and 149 of my colleagues from geographically different districts and from both parties. This shows HB 1189 is a proven tool to lower property taxes without underfunding our schools. After all, every state with lower property taxes and every school district in Pennsylvania with lower property taxes use other tax methods. But unlike these other states and schools, HB 1189 only provides other tax structures to reduce school property taxes, not new spending. The goal of 1189 is to not only remove property taxes, but lower everyone's total tax liability.
\
Roberts:I do not support Representative Grove's HB 1189. Property tax menus have been tried in the past and failed to produce property tax relief. HB 1189, the Optional Property Tax Elimination Act, will do nothing to address the root problem of out of control and unsustainable education spending. No consideration is given for residential districts, economically blighted districts or districts with poor business climates, which will not have the necessary tax base to offset property taxes. I would support HB/SB 76 to eliminate school property taxes. Eliminating school property taxes will restore property rights, increase the value of homes, and encourage ownership and investment in PA. Additionally, it will level off education spending.
\
Unlike HB 1189, HB/SB 76, The Property Tax Independence Act, has been thoroughly vetted by the Anderson Economic Group and the Independent Fiscal office, subjected to two hearings in the house and one in the Senate, and 83 taxpayer organizations across the state support it.
\
2. Natural gas production from the state's Marcellus Shale formation has been a boon to gas companies who say the influx has kept prices low for consumers. In 2012, Pennsylvania enacted an impact fee on wells drilled into the shale. But analysts and groups such as the Pennsylvania Budget and Policy Center estimate the impact fee generates less revenue than a severance tax. Should natural gas drillers pay a severance tax? Or is the impact fee sufficient? Why or why not?
\
Grove:Unfortunately the Budget and Policy and Policy Center always fail to report all the taxes natural gas drillers pay: impact fee, corporate income tax, personal income tax, sales and use tax, unemployment taxes, permit fees, gas tax, vehicle registration fees, etc. The Act 13 impact fee brings in $200 million dollars to cover the costs of the impact of drilling at the local level and for state government. Natural gas is the only industry which has an impact fee or has been targeted by those who oppose drilling for a severance tax. All told, those who support or have introduced a severance tax have spent the revenue 10 times over and ultimately want to end drilling, which means no revenue, less jobs, and importing more foreign oil.
\
Pennsylvania natural gas development has reinvigorated our economy, has sustained our budget the past few years, and provided family sustaining jobs to Pennsylvanians. Let's responsibly harness this new economic boom and turn Pennsylvania into an economic powerhouse. Act 13 also put in place important environmental safeguards to protect the environment and ensure we have a safe and consistent environmental protection policies statewide.
\
Roberts:I do not support a severance tax, and I do not agree with the impact fee as it currently stands. Rather than have the impact fees go to the PA Utility Commission for redistribution, the fees should go directly to those municipalities that are impacted by the drilling, and should be allocated to repair any damages done.
\
According to the PA Public Utility Commission website, ""A significant portion of the funds (impact fees) collected will be distributed directly to local governments to cover the local impacts of drilling. Also, several state agencies will receive funding to be used for a variety of other purposes."" Only about half of the money collected ends up being used to cover the impact of drilling, which I thought was the purpose of the impact fee. The drilling companies already provide an exorbitant amount of revenue to the state via a myriad of licensure and permit fees, property taxes, corporate taxes, fines, etc. The severance tax and current impact fees only feed the ravenous beast, our General Assembly, in Harrisburg. We should do all we can to encourage industry in Pennsylvania, not run it off to greener pastures.
\
3. Last year, the state Legislature approved a $2.3 billion transportation bill paid for by increased motorist fines, fees, and a gas tax that made its way down to drivers in the state. Did you support the approved funding plan? Why or why not? If you did not support the funding plan, how would you have funded the necessary infrastructure repairs in Pennsylvania?
\
Grove:This was not an easy vote for me. With every vote, I take into consideration the impact on you, the taxpayer. As the issue was discussed and after going out and viewing and hearing from you about the state of our roads and bridges, I saw a need to assure that no citizen would be endangered while traveling our roads.
\
Gas prices at the pump are based off crude oil prices and what local gas stations set their prices as, not taxes. Gas prices today are the same prices as they were a year ago, because crude oil prices fluctuate. Thanks to our Constitution, all funding in the Motor Licensing Fund goes directly to roads and bridges.
\
I know the residents of the 196th district will be excited about:
\
* Prevailing Wage threshold increase to $100,000
\
* 32 bridges fixed
\
* 12 major resurfacing projects
\
* I-83 to 6 lanes
\
* A new roundabout at Green Valley Road, Route 616, and Route 214
\
* Passing zones on Route 30
\
* Adaptive signalization on Route 74 and Route 30
\
Ultimately, I voted yes to provide more capacity to York County roads, so you don't have to sit in traffic, create more private sector jobs, and rebuild our failing infrastructure.
\
Roberts:I did not support the plan:
\
* $40 million in discretionary spending???
\
* Previously, federal money that should have been allocated for repair of roads and bridges was diverted to subsidize Philadelphia's mass transit. Now many of our roads and bridges are in deplorable condition and so is Philadelphia's mass transit. This bill gives Philadelphia and Pittsburgh $500 million more to subsidize mass transit, but patrons will not see an increase in fares. Why do we trust the legislature to get this right?
\
* 130 new tax, fee and fine increases. We should be eliminating taxes, fees and fines, not imposing more of them.
\
* Prevailing wage increases the cost of publicly funded construction projects by 20-30 percent. Get rid of the prevailing wage, then the allocated $6 billion plus should be plenty to remedy our infrastructure problems.
\
* Due to the shortsighted, ill-conceived policies of our General Assembly, PA taxpayers face $47 billion in unfunded pension liabilities. Putting taxpayers on the hook for another $2.3 billion with the pension crisis looming is criminal.
\
* PA taxpayers can't afford it!
\
4. In January, a bill was introduced by state senators Daylin Leach and Mike Folmer that would allow the use of medical marijuana in Pennsylvania. The bill was subsequently the subject of a Senate committee hearing on the issue. Should Pennsylvania legalize medical and/or recreational marijuana? Why or why not?
\
Grove:I do not support legalization of recreational marijuana. Cannabinoid, what parents of epileptic children are requesting, is not marijuana.
\
Unfortunately the bill proposed for ""medical marijuana"" creates a new system outside our healthcare system. I cannot support the expansion of state government by a new ""commission."" I cannot support patients picking up medicine at a ""dispensary"" instead of a pharmacy. The California model has been a failure plagued with fraud. We do not need it here in Pennsylvania.
\
I, however, do support Congressman Scott Perry and his approach:
\
* Limited to Cannabinoid in a form which cannot be inhaled
\
* Operate within the healthcare system
\
* Allow FDA testing
\
* Remove criminal barriers for parents and children
\
Once the federal government removes criminal barriers, by legislation rather than non-enforcement, then states can follow.
\
Roberts:Medical marijuana should be legalized. Many people suffer from various illnesses or their children suffer pain or seizures which medical marijuana could possibly relieve. I literally can't think of a single reason why we would deprive a mother of the ability to provide relief to an ailing child, or allow any of our fellow citizens to needlessly suffer. At the very least, we should decriminalize recreational marijuana. We have created an entire criminal class of people that have never violated anyone's constitutional rights. Furthermore, Pennsylvania's rapidly increasing spending on corrections is unsustainable, and no data exists to support that laws prohibiting the use of marijuana have increased public safety, or even curbed its use. It is not the government's job to protect us from ourselves.
\
5. What would be your other priorities if elected, and why should voters support you?
\
Grove:For 3 terms I have represented you with integrity, honesty, and hard work. I have always stuck by my principles of small-limited government, fiscal responsibility, and common sense. I have tried to live up to your expectations as a public servant and tackle the tough problems which have plagued our great Commonwealth for generations. Through bipartisanship I have spearheaded the enactment of 9 laws and 6 resolutions.
\
I plan to bring prosperity back to Pennsylvania by investing in you, the taxpayer. We need to continue to reduce taxes to grow our economy. We have eliminated the death tax on family farms and businesses, eliminated the discriminatory Corporate Loans Tax, and on the verge of eliminating the Capital Stock and Franchise Tax. These tax policy decisions have strengthened our economy. We need to continue to cut taxes on our working families and make Pennsylvania a job-creator friendly state.
\
I will continue to maneuver our ballooning government for ways to reduce costs for the taxpayer. My principles are basic yet sustaining. I believe we must protect life, wrangle unfunded mandates, allow seniors to age in place, strengthen our public schools while providing viable choices for students, and fight corruption at every step. I am a proven leader, not only willing to fight special interests in Harrisburg, but beat them.
\
Roberts:My priorities would be to eliminate school property taxes, eliminate those things that incentivize a career in politics to include pensions and per diems, eliminate prevailing wage, rid ourselves of the Common Core/PA Core Standards, and make Pennsylvania a Right to Work state. I would also like our legislature reduced to part time which will put an end to the seemingly endless amount of frivolous legislation coming out of Harrisburg. I would like to wipe clean the antiquated and beyond comprehension school funding formula and see money follow students to a school of their parents' choice, and see competition drive success in our schools, rather than tried, failed and tried again state and federal mandates.
\
Voters should support me because I do not seek a career in politics, and I will never cast a vote for the purpose of advancing my own career. I truly believe in limited government, and will only vote in favor of the people, never to empower the government.

"
599,"
The York Dispatch is asking candidates in contested elections for seats in the state Legislature a series of questions about key issues. Candidates are asked to respond in 125 words of less. Check back weekly for updates to this question and answer series.
\
Question 1:In 2010, electricity rate caps will come off for Pennsylvania's five largest power providers, including Met-Ed. Dramatic increases in electric bills are predicted once that happens. Lawmakers have proposed several alternatives for dealing with the situation. How do you think the state Legislature should react between now and then, if at all, and why?
\
Stan Saylor (R):My legislation proposes the following things: 1. Requires that the Public Utility Commission ensure that programs are in place to assist low-income customers in managing electricity price increases. 2. Requires that all electric distribution companies must implement customer education programs informing customers about available energy efficiency and demand side response programs and what they can do to reduce energy consumption. 3. Requires continued compliance with the Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards Act. 4. Requires that electric companies cannot raise rates more than once a year. 5. Does not allow the increase in any year to exceed 15% of the overall rate in effect for that customer class on the last day of the prior year.
\
Deb Tillman (D):The state Legislature needs to encourage green energy so consumers can reduce their electric costs, and offer economic incentives for solar, wind, and alternative fuels. Optional smart meters would reduce labor costs and help consumers save money. The increase in electric rates must be done over a period of five years, and electric companies should not be allowed to recover the cost of bad investments or to cover the costs of nuclear power plants. Electric companies should be required to have long-term contracts purchasing at the lowest possible cost. The Public Utility Commission has to make sure that companies don't manipulate the market to charge higher rates. If a state power-purchasing agency was created, then energy generation could possibly be purchased for less.

Question 2:State officials recently learned that the federal government has rejected the proposal to place tolls on Interstate 80. That eliminates a source of funding the government and state Legislature committed to road and bridge repairs under Act 44. Some are calling for resubmitting the toll proposal, while Gov. Ed Rendell is pushing to lease the Pennsylvania Turnpike. Increases in the gas tax, drivers license fees and vehicle registration fees are other possible sources of revenue. Which of those options would you support? Which do you oppose? How should the state address this issue and why?
\
Saylor:I would eliminate the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission and turn its operation over to the Department of Transportation. I would toll I-80, I-95, and I-79 with the money raised on these highways used to maintain those highways only and freeing up money now used to maintain those highways to be used on other highways. I would remove the funding of the Pennsylvania State Police from the highway fund and put their funding in the General Fund. This will free up $500 million to be invested in our highways and bridges. We need to look to the future and look at eliminating the gas tax and replacing it with either higher registration and driver licence fees or some other form of taxation to fund our highways.
\
Tillman:The Federal government should reconsider placing tolls on Interstate 80, which is mostly used by long-distance interstate truckers, not commuters. Tolls would improve the surrounding community and create jobs. The price of gas is costly enough. Instead the major oil companies doing business in Pennsylvania need to pay higher taxes on their gross profits since only a small amount is taxed now. The cost to register vehicles should be based on gross vehicle weight, and be more expensive for heavier vehicles since they cause more wear and tear on roads and bridges. Pennsylvania and every state must encourage public transportation; trains should be used for transporting, replacing some of the trucks, especially since more small cars will be sharing the roads.
\
Question 3:School property taxes continue to be an issue in Harrisburg, despite the tax relief offered through Act 1. Should more be done to alleviate the property tax burden? If so, what? Have the school district cost controls adopted by the Legislature as part of Act 1 -- voter approval of tax increases under certain circumstances -- been effective? Should more be done in that regard?
\
Saylor:Eliminating property taxes needs to be our top priority, not just reducing them. We should utilize sales taxes or personal income taxes to do so. I would even support legislation that would be a combination of both sales and income taxes. Over the next two years, we need to evaluate the successes and/or shortcomings of the spending controls to see what else needs to been done to control spending. Part of the increases in property taxes is the increasing population growth that has caused the construction of new school building and renovations of existing buildings to handle the increase in new students along with the transportation costs. We must continue the work Rep. Mackereth and Rep. Miller did in changing the funding formula.
\
Tillman:Much more needs to be done to lower property taxes. Personal earned income tax is the fairest way to tax individuals because the tax would be based on a person's wealth and ability to pay. Just a 0.1% increase in income tax could add $327 million in revenues. Over a half-billion dollars could be saved statewide if teachers' health insurance was purchased from the same provider since health care drives the cost of school taxes. If Act 1 is to be effective, voters need to pay attention, attend school board meetings, and read the minutes from the meetings. School boards should not be allowed to raise property taxes every year by the inflation rate, because not everyone's pay keeps up with inflation.
\
Question 4:Earlier this year, charges were filed against 12 individuals after an investigation into bonuses allegedly given to state employees for campaign work. Would you vote in favor of a measure prohibiting lawmakers from awarding bonuses to state employees? Pinpoint another reform measure you would support should you be elected and explain why you think it's among the most important change lawmakers could make.
\
Saylor:Yes, I would oppose awarding bonuses to state employees in the future. We have banned future bonuses for employees on the House Republican payroll. In addition, I would open the expenses of the entire legislature for public review, at the same time protecting documents that would pertain to constituent records. Constituents come to their state representative with numerous concerns and problems. These sometime are about crimes; that they believe have been committed and/or personal family problems. The legislative process must continue to be open to public scrutiny.
\
Tillman:Yes, absolutely! Taxpayer dollars should never be used for campaigns and that should include incumbents sending informational flyers about what they've done while in office during an election year. Incumbents have an enormous advantage fundraising, there are no campaign finance spending caps, and they have the ability to hold public town hall meetings. Also, there should be term limits of 12 years for the House and Senate. There are many reforms to make, but one of the most important is the time frame to amend bills before being passed. A bill is reviewed on three separate, consecutive days, but there are no rules on amendments. The process should be slowed down so the public and press have a chance to review it before being passed.
\
Question 5:Two longtime state senators recently warned that the nation's economic turmoil could result in dire revenue shortfalls that might require a tax increase to rectify when state lawmakers adopt the 2009-10 budget next July. If cost cuts aren't enough to balance the budget, if those warnings turn out to be true and an increase in taxes/fees is necessary, what approach would be the fairest? What taxes/fees should the state look at and why?
\
Saylor:First, we need to review the current state budget for fiscal year 2008-09 for measures that can be eliminated or cut to lessen the budget deficit for next year. We then need to start working on next fiscal year's budget (2009-10) for programs that need to be eliminated and others that need to be cut. We will need to look at the governor's and Legislature's budgets as well for cost-cutting measures and elimination of certain programs. We have $700 million in our rainy day for such economic times. After all of this, then we can see if we need to raise fees and or taxes. We can lessen the choice of raising taxes by acting now.
\
Tillman:The fairest way would be to raise taxes that are not planned to increase that much in the next five years and on non-essentials. Out of all the corporation taxes, the public utility realty taxes is taxed the least and shows the lowest increase by 2013. Consumption taxes such as the cigarette tax actually decrease, but should be increased, and malt beverage taxes could be raised if needed to help balance the budget. Luxury taxes would only affect those that can afford to pay more, and since most luxuries are not necessary, one could choose not to buy the item. Fines, penalties, and interest on taxes could be increased; instead, the amount stays the same for the next five years.
\
Question 6:Previous questions in this series have dealt with electricity caps, school property tax reform, transportation funding, government reform and potential budget shortfalls in 2009-10. Now we'd like you to identify another key issue to residents in your district, or another priority you'll take to Harrisburg. Please explain how you would address that issue?
\
Saylor:I believe crime is an important issue in this election. We need to track sex offenders, particularly the most heinous sex offenders. With today's technologies, we can use GPS to track these offenders. Simply putting an ankle bracelet on them will make our communities safer from these criminals. We need to look at our parole system as well. It should take more than two votes on the Parole Board to grant parole. It should require a majority of the votes of the board to grant a prisoner parole. Violent offenders should not be granted early parole. We need to require as part of sentencing that criminals are expected to get at least an 8th-grade education or a GED before being eligble for parole.
\
Tillman:An issue that affects our health, food supply, animals, and ecosystem is the dumping of sewage sludge on farmland. The Agriculture, Community, and Rural Environment (ACRE) law allows the Pennsylvania Office of the Attorney General to sue municipalities that try to prevent normal agricultural operations. Sludge is treated sewage that can contain heavy metals (lead, mercury, uranium, . . .), bacteria, viruses (polio and hepatitis which can survive in the soil for months), parasitic worms (can survive for years), PCBs that can remain for decades, and many other harmful contaminants. Certainly using farmland to spread sludge should not be considered a customary farming practice. The Pennsylvania Constitution needs revision; municipalities must be allowed to enact ordinances that protect their citizens without the being sued.
\
Question 7:What qualities and qualifications do you have that make you the candidate voters should support on Nov. 4?
\
Saylor:Experience is a major asset that I bring as the state Legislator for the 94th District. I am proud to have been a small businessman prior to my election to the House. I have been involved in many community organizations prior to my election and since. Having served on the Windsor Township Recreation Board, in the Red Lions Club, and as a member of the Hopewell Fish and Game Club as well as many others has allowed me to gather knowledge on many issues and interact with many individuals on a variety of issues. My seniority as a committee chairman will allow me to have a greater voice in Harrisburg on behalf of York County.
\
Tillman:I have the qualities that any candidate should have - the ability to understand that there is more than one side of an issue - to look at both and come up with the best plan of action. Knowing that to get anything accomplished one must be willing to be objective because issues affect everyone and to work well with others regardless of their political party. I have always taken the initiative to solve problems, or fix situations that needed to be changed. Having the ability to lead cannot be taught or learned, it is something that a person either has or doesn't. I am familiar with business, taxes, school districts, insurance, banks, and financing, legal issues, and have the same concerns as others that have children.

600," Taking care of the environment has paid off for Towamensing Township.\ The community Tuesday received $9,191 from the Carbon County Conservation District for improving Forest Street in a way that protects the environment.\ The money paid almost half the cost of the $19,296 project, which was finished in September, said Conservation District Manager Jim Clauser.\ The township paid the remaining $10,105.\ The grant was provided through the state's Dirt and Gravel Road Pollution Prevention program.\ The program, begun in 1997 by Gov. Tom Ridge, ""offers local municipalities special funding to repair, manage and maintain dirt and gravel roads in environmentally safe ways,"" Clauser said.\ ""We do not pay for asphalt or tar and chip,"" he added.\ Conservation districts administer the $4 million program, which is funded through the state gas tax. The state has about 25,000 miles of dirt and gravel roads.\ Towamensing used its portion to improve about 750 feet of Forest Street and plans to improve an additional 800 feet, Clauser said.\ The project work included installing underground drainage, stabilizing 900 square feet of road ditch with grass, stabilizing 3,000 square feet of eroded road bank with grass and mulch and resurfacing a 726-foot-long, 18-foot-wide stretch of road with a compacted-stone mixture.\ The district has received grant applications from Lower Towamensing and Mahoning townships for similar projects, Clauser said.\ The money is available for public roads only, he said.\ ""It's not intended for private development roads,"" he said.\ Reporter Chris Parker\ 610-379-3224\ chris.parker@mcall.com"

Apology for slavery won't solve the problem Abe Krieger (letter, June 26):
\
I agree an apology for slavery won't do much to further anyone's cause because Lord knows racism will still flourish.
\
Affirmative action was created to help all minorities, not just African-Americans, and many women of all races have benefited from it, just as many non-African-Americans have benefited from the failed social programs of the past 30 years.
\
All groups have some bad people. It's wrong to judge someone based simply on their ancestry. Just as I'm sure you feel angry when Louis Farrakhan speaks against your people, I was extremely angered by your letter against my people.
\
Jerry Foglia (letter, June 26):
\
Whether or not you apologize won't affect me one way or the other, but how dare you imply that the Civil War was our fault! If it wasn't for your ancestors enslaving our ancestors, there would have been no need for the Civil War.

\
Abe Krieger and Jerry Foglia: I, too, am not a fan of people who whine. As a successful 35-year-old African-American male living in the suburbs, I am extremely pleased with the things God has blessed my family and me with and can't say I have much to whine about. But in your letters (June 26), who is whining?
\
Like both of you, I am also against an apology from the president for slavery. In fact, it would be quite an insult at this point. The only way to move forward is to leave the past in the past.
\
We're all a product of our environment. The challenge is coming out of our sheltered environments to see the light of day from the perspective of all people. For many minorities, however, coming out of those environments is much easier than getting into others. The plight of African-Americans cannot compare to that of any other minority. As pointed out by Karyn Smith (letter, July 2), imagine being made to eat in separate restaurants, use different bathrooms, go to separate schools, live in separate neighborhoods, etc. Thank God my parents and grandparents survived.
\
Segregation, housing discrimination, job discrimination and pure hate have made the road difficult, but certainly not impossible. In fact, I find the latest roadblock for blacks is blacks themselves - the ones who blame their history for their lack of motivation, making it harder for those who try hard to focus on getting ahead.
\
We are all to blame for the state of hate in this country. No other country in the world carries around so much hate for something as ridiculous as skin color.

Abe Krieger (letter, June 26) says blacks are the only race in this country that never made significant progress.
\
He says his parents spent time in a Nazi camp and came over to America with tattoos on their arms. My forefathers were hanged, burned, raped and mutilated here in America from the 1500s until the late 1960s. We African-Americans were kidnaped and brought here from Africa because the lazy white man didn't want to do the labor himself.
\
The next time you say we blacks are the only race who never made significant progress, think about all the free labor we did. We black people built this country and the white man took all the credit.

African-Americans don't need President Clinton to apologize to them for slavery. African-Americans need President Clinton to treat African-Americans the same way the United States treated Jewish and Asian people.
\
For the Jewish people, the good old U.S.A. is still hunting down Nazis and putting them behind bars or out of this country. The Asian people received a billion or so dollars for the concentration camps Japanese-Americans were put into in World War II.
\
Wake up, African-Americans, you're just as good as the few and better than the most. How do I know? Your true history said so.

Opinion on frocks gets dressing-down Donald Van Deusen's elegy on women in summer dresses (Guest Opinion, July 2) was quite . . . charming. I am fervently hoping it was a joke.
\
I'm sure he intended it to be flattering, but it was a lot like being told, ``You'd be so pretty if you smiled.'' Women in business don't dress to amuse or have wardrobes that ``take up several rooms.'' We have work to do and dress accordingly.
\
I would, however, like to see Mr. Van Deusen in chiffon. I wonder if he has good legs.

AN EXPENSIVE BITE The manager of the piercing shop on South Street (article, July 10) must be naive or ignorant when he states that the risk is ``zero to zero.''
\
I will gladly show him the gold tooth I own due to my former tongue piercing. I happily wore a tongue piercing for several years. I loved it until about two years ago when, while chewing my food, I bit down on the quarter-inch-diameter stainless-steel ball at the end of the jewelry and CRACK, the second molar from the rear of my upper right jaw shattered into at least six or seven pieces. Since it was a Saturday afternoon and no dentist would see me until Monday, I had to bear with the excruciating pain of a shattered molar for two days.
\
After five dentist visits, a root canal and $750 (after insurance), I am now the proud owner of a genuine gold tooth.

RESIDENTS DESERVE CREDIT Re the article, ``Where the armor pays off'': The real story is the Philadelphia More Beautiful Committee initiated the idea, organized the people and assisted with the necessary material to carry out the major community cleanup, which consisted of cleaning, painting, planting of flowers and other beautification projects.
\
The block captains and residents received this idea with open arms, spread the news, motivated other residents and made the cleanup a success by giving 100 percent of themselves.
\
Residents are keeping properties graffiti-free, waiting for abandoned houses to be cleaned and sealed as promised, and organizing other major cleanups with the assistance of the Philadelphia More Beautiful Committee.

This is the real story.

Higher gas tax, license fee driving motorists mad I just filled out my license application and sent in the new higher fee of $36.
\
I was so mad I called my state rep, but he was at a fund-raising golf outing for re-election.
\
So I ask the governor if he will rescind the gasoline tax and new license fee as soon as the promised roadwork is completed.
\
I see the work has already begun on Route 309 as promised. Do you think it will be a safer road? I don't. All the people who slowed down for those infamous potholes, look out! 309 will become the autobahn of Pennsylvania.
\
Why couldn't the governor give us riverboat gambling or sell our controversial state stores by some sort of lottery? Instead, he just raised taxes.
\
If the governor was out of work, I'll bet my last bridge token he and his wife could sit at their kitchen table and come up with a really good budget for their household, cutting a few corners here and there. Then why can't he do the same for our state and not have to raise our taxes?

Bambi has wrecked a few trails, too Had Ron Avery (article, July 9) done some research on trail damage along the Wissahickon, he would have come across the findings of the landscape-architecture firm hired to investigate the damage, which concluded that the greatest deterioration of the Wissahickon Valley is caused by overpopulation of deer and storm water runoff.
\
Statements such as ``They can destroy hiking trails'' and ``damage caused by the heavy, deep-tread bike tires'' promote equestrian-hiker-biker conflict. How about the damage caused by the weighted hoof? I mention this not to point fingers at other trail users but to point out that everyone who has ever stepped foot, hoof or knobby tire on the Wissahickon trails has contributed to trail depletion in one way or another.
\
Trail work, such as installation of water bars (which help control damage from storm runoff), benefits everyone and is not simply done, as Avery would like one to believe, to repair sections of trail ``destroyed'' by mountain bikes.
\
I would suggest that Avery visit the Wissahickon upper trails himself because it is apparent he has not. Then, maybe, he will see how ludicrous some of the statements he has made are.
\
When discussing the upper trails, why was it necessary to mention a cyclist killed by a car when motor vehicles are not permitted on the trails? This could not have taken place on the upper trails and is therefore irrelevant to the issue of trail access.

602,"A longtime educator is challenging a decorated military veteran for the District 33 seat in Pennsylvania's Senate.\Democrat Rich Sterner is up against the incumbent, Republican Douglas Mastriano. The winner will serve a four-year term, through 2024.\Mastriano won the seat in a special election in May 2019, following the retirement of former Sen. Richard Alloway. The district covers all of Adams County, roughly the eastern half of Franklin County, and small parts of Cumberland and York counties.\We sent the same questions to both candidates. Here are their responses:\Age: 65\Background (education/career/volunteerism): Education, 25 years\Town of residence: East Berlin, Adams County\Why are you the right candidate for the PA-33 state Senate seat?\I will represent everyone in Senate District 33 with leadership, integrity, compassion, and honor. I will work to solve problems, not point fingers. There is too much partisan bickering in Harrisburg and we need to change that. I will look to the furthest point down the road in search of long term solutions. One of my favorite quotes is ""seek to understand, then seek to be understood.""\Do you think Pennsylvania is on the right path forward; why, or how do you think we can turn things around?\The COVID-19 pandemic has set Pennsylvania back, and legislators are not working together to solve our problems. We need to immediately address the pandemic and get Pennsylvanians working, doing so within the recommended guidelines of experts. We must fix the systems the pandemic highlighted that are not working, the Workers' Compensation Insurance system and Health Care that is not job dependent, that provides efficient and effective coverage, lowers prescription costs, and covers pre-existing conditions; and provide broadband access to our rural areas.\Name your two top issues and discuss what you want to do about them.\Well I actually have three top issues: (1) COVID-19 work to influence the federal government and the states to solve problems collectively; be a leader in finding help for our local communities, improve systems such as unemployment insurance and broadband access for rural areas, and provide consistent, transparent messaging to my constituents; (2) provide health care that is not job dependent but available to all, coverage that is effective and efficient, lower prescription costs, and cover pre-existing conditions; and (3) create a world-class K-12 education ensuring fair and equitable funding, including property tax reform, while maintaining a high standard of local control. Fund charter schools and cyber charter schools by need, not for profit, and hold them accountable. Eliminate standardized testing and create an evaluation system based on graduation data rates and student performance beyond graduation. Provide training in high school and beyond for jobs necessary in our local industries, businesses, and farms.\Has COVID-19 been handled well in PA? Moving forward, what role should the pandemic play in our everyday lives?\We must work on navigating threats, social and cultural influences on behavior, science communication, moral decision-making, leadership, and stress and coping. Historically, infectious diseases have been responsible for the greatest human death tolls. We should consider the creation of ethical guidelines for governments, health-care systems, and clinicians to be used in planning for and responding to a pandemic.\Discuss your opinion on systemic racism.\Systemic reform is needed; it's not just police brutality, racism in police departments, reform in prisons. We need Systemic Change. It must begin in Washington, DC, and continue through to Harrisburg and our local governments. We need Restorative Justice.\Is there anything else you want voters to know?\I want voters to know I will always tell the truth, be transparent, and represent all Pennsylvanians to the best of my ability.\Age: 55\Background (education/career/volunteerism):\Doug Mastriano is a combat veteran and the son of a career US Navy man. He is an Eagle Scout and worked as a paperboy, janitor, security guard, short-order cook, pizza delivery person and dishwasher. Doug was commissioned in the U.S. Army in 1986 and began his military service on the Iron Curtain with the 2nd Cavalry Regiment in West Germany. While serving along the East German and Czechoslovakian borders, he witnessed the end of the Cold War and deployed to Iraq for Operation Desert Storm (1991). His regiment led the attack against Saddam's elite forces. He served in Washington, DC, the 3rd Infantry Division and US Army Europe. After 9/11, Mastriano was the lead planner for the operation to invade Iraq via Turkey. He served four years with NATO and deployed three times to Afghanistan. Mastriano was the director of the Joint Intelligence Center in Afghanistan, leading 80 people from 18 nations. On his own initiative, Doug led seven relief operations to help Afghan orphans. He completed his career as a Professor of the U.S. Army War College (PAWC), Carlisle, PA, and taught at the Master Degree level the next generation of senior leaders, Strategic Studies.\Mastriano is a Doctor of History (PhD) and has four master's degrees: Strategy, Strategic Intelligence, Military Operations, and Airpower. He earned a BA from Eastern University in St. Davids, Pennsylvania and was the alumnus of the year in 2009. He led the search to locate where America's greatest WW I hero, Alvin York, received the Medal of Honor and led the construction of a three mile trail, with two monuments and nine markers in the Argonne, France. He published 30 articles on strategy and historic topics and authored the book Alvin York: A New Biography of the Hero of the Argonne which received four awards. His new book, Thunder in the Argonne is the first to tell the complete story of America's largest battle, the 1918 Meuse-Argonne Campaign.\Academic Background\1986, Bachelor of Art, History, Eastern University, St. Davids, Pennsylvania\1992, Masters Strategic Intelligence, Joint Intelligence College, Washington, DC\2001, Masters Airpower Theory, Air University, Maxwell AFB, AL\2002, Masters Military Operational Art and Science, Air University, Maxwell AFB, AL\2010, Masters Strategic Studies, US Army War College, Carlisle, Pennsylvania\2013, Ph.D. University of New Brunswick, Canada (Doctor of History)\Key Military Assignments\1986, Commissioned as an officer in the United States Army\1988-1990, 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment (2ACR) on the Iron Curtain\1990-199, 2ACR for Operations Desert Shield/Storm in Iraq\1992-1995, Assignments in Washington, DC\1998-2000, 3rd Infantry Division (Rock of the Marne)\2002-2005, US Army Europe\2005-2009, NATO (Deployments to Afghanistan 2006, 2007, 2008)\2009-2010, U.S. Army War College, Carlisle, Pennsylvania.\2012-2017, Professor Army War College (PAWC), Carlisle, Pennsylvania\Retired as Colonel in the United States Army\Town of residence: Fayetteville, PA\Why are you the right candidate for the PA-33 state Senate seat?\My life has been about serving our country and our people. I served 30 years active duty in the United States Army, retiring in late 2017. As I concluded my time in the Army, I reflected on the deployments, the years away from home, and the sacrifices my family and I had made and it gave me pause. My heart was broken that after 30 years of service, the Pennsylvania I would be handing off to my son was less prosperous, less secure and less free than when I received it from my father. Crippling taxes are driving retirees out of their homes, the precious lives of the unborn are eliminated, while free speech is under attack by Orwellian-like ideologies that are taking over our public institutions.\I could not stand aside while radical ideologues and greedy bureaucrats run our state into the ground. Too much is at stake and I will not stand aside as bureaucrats create regulations that crush our families, farmers and businesses, or while Harrisburg thinks of new ways to take more of your hard earned money.\Do you think Pennsylvania is on the right path forward; why, or how do you think we can turn things around?\Pennsylvania ranks in the top 10 in tax burden among all states, according to the Commonwealth Foundation, and there have been five tax hikes in the past 11 years.\This is unacceptable, and that's why I am in Harrisburg, fighting on your behalf.\Enough is enough.\We have also heard that the Governor would like to levy a tax on boroughs and townships that lack a municipal police force.\This taxation would supposedly underwrite the cost of providing State Police service to those municipalities.\In reality, the ""police impact fee"" wouldn't come anywhere close to covering that cost and would nearly bankrupt many small municipalities, who simply cannot afford this ill-thought proposal.\This appetite to tax and spend in Harrisburg to continuously tax us needs to stop.\Everyone remembers Act 89 of 2013, which was sold to taxpayers as the panacea that would fix our state's crumbling roads and bridges.\Seven years later, our infrastructure is still in deplorable condition and our state's gas tax remains one of the nation's highest. And what about how Gov Rendell's administration promised us that gambling would all but elminate property taxes?\Pennsylvania's stature as a top ten state in tax burden is an embarrassment. It is time to get the Harrisburg bureaucracy off our backs and out of our wallets.\Name your two top issues and discuss what you want to do about them.\Our basic freedoms are under assault by Gov Wolf. Never before has a governor in our commonwealth wielded so much power over our lives. There is no issue more important than this.\Benjamin Franklin was asked in 1787, ""what do we have Mr. Franklin, a Republic or a king?"" He responded, ""A Republic, if you can keep it.""\Ronald Reagan warned us in 1961, ""Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We didn't pass it to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the same, or one day we will spend our sunset years telling our children and our children's children what it was once like in the United States where men were free.""\If we are a free people, then let us live and walk as free people.\Now it's is our turn to keep the Republic. How do you plan to reduce the spread of coronavirus in Pennsylvania and prevent future outbreaks?\Gov. Tom Wolf unilaterally issued edicts that shut down thousands of businesses, putting millions out of work. The question will be, was Wolf's cure worse than the disease? I believe the answer will be yes.\The Philadelphia Inquirer on March 27 did an expose showing how Governor Wolf's family legacy cabinet was still in operation, claiming they had a waiver to stay operational. This, while all other kitchen and cabinet manufacturers across the state were ordered by the Governor's office to shut down last week.\If this was not a conflict of financial interest, then nothing is. Imagine having the powers of Thanos to knock out all of your competition with a stroke of a pen, as the Governor so effectively managed to do with little notice from the press. Indeed, prudent measures must be taken. But, for the Governor to order the shutdown of businesses that pose little risk to public safety is irresponsible.\Unfortunately, his cure is worse than the virus.\Has COVID-19 been handled well in PA? Moving forward, what role should the pandemic play in our everyday lives?\A restaurant from Ohio recently awarded PA Governor Tom Wolf with its ""employee of the month award."" The recognition was tongue-in-cheek, but the honor was very deserving.\After all, Pennsylvanians residing near the Ohio border have been flocking to the Buckeye State to enjoy restaurants, as well as food and beverage establishments, that are either shuttered here or operating at limited capacity. It all began March 19, when Wolf issued his proclamation declaring only those businesses that he deemed ""essential"" could remain open.\Chaos and confusion followed.\Meanwhile, large box stores and supermarkets were allowed to operate at full capacity. If we can observe social distancing, sanitation and other state and federally recognized health and safety practices at Wal-Mart and Home Depot, why can't we do the same for small businesses?\Governor Wolf and Secretary Levine tell us of the immediate danger that we face and in addition to personal measures that we must take to ameliorate the impact of the disease, that all medical professions are needed in this hour of need.\Indeed, we do need all medical personal on deck for this battle. To preserve our valuable medical professionals and to have them at the ready, the Governor and his Secretary of Health have unilaterally ordered the end of all elective surgeries until the end of the COVID-19 crisis.\Unless it's life-saving, your hip surgery, leg surgery, knee, oral surgery and everything else is on hold until the crisis passes.\But, of course, his one notable exception is abortion.\This could be overlooked as the Governor and his Health Secretary preach, in their science-defying explanation, that abortion does not kill a human, but that it is an elective procedure.\If that is the case, then why not postpone it as he did all other procedures?\Regardless of where you stand on the issue, it is unconscionable that he will allow this, and subject thousands of health care professionals to COVID-19 for what he says is an elective procedure. This is the problem with politicians, the hypocrisy and Orwellian new-speak,.\Discuss your opinion on systemic racism.\Sadly, systemic racism is most evident where Democrat politicians have held power for decades. Although claiming to be champions of civil rights, their failed policies have exacerbated a social and economic environment where ""we the people"" cannot prosper. For example, the last Republican mayor of Philadelphia was Barney Samuel, who left office in 1952. It is time to reconsider the election rhetoric and seek real ways to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to enjoy the opportunity and freedom in our constitutional republic\Is there anything else you want voters to know?\No more taxes!!! The working people of our state can't afford to have yet another tax upon our backs as Gov Wolf dithers on how to pay for his failed policies. No matter who is taxed, in the end, it is ""we the people"" who pay for the failed policies of our governor. Pennsylvania is already one of the most heavily taxed states in the nation, and yet another tax is not going to fix failed policies. Remember when we were told that a massive gas tax would fix our roads and bridges? Does anyone honestly believe that yet another tax hike will be used for what it supposed to be used for? How about Gov Rendell's administration telling us in 2004 that legalized gambling would eliminate property taxes? Sixteen years later, the crushing burden of property taxes results in 10,000 homes a year being seized from mostly our beautiful elderly population. Instead of enjoying the golden years of retirement, they can't keep up with an ever increasing tax for their homes that they had long paid for. With an already massive budget of expenditures annually, it's time to reduce the size of our already bloated state government and become better stewards of the people's money. As Ronald Reagan rightly said, It's time to get the government off of our backs and out of our wallets. This is our time... to walk as free people."

HARRISBURG -- Gov. Ed Rendell told lawmakers Tuesday it would be disastrous for the Legislature to do nothing about funding improvements to highways and bridges beyond this year.
\
""It would cripple our transportation network, making us less competitive, diminish the quality of life of our citizens and imperil public safety,"" Rendell said in an address to a joint session of the General Assembly. His remarks opened the special session he called to address transportation funding.
\
""It's going to be very difficult to do anything at all in this political environment and in this economic environment"" by the end of 2010, said House Transportation Chairman Joe Markosek, D-Monroeville. Rendell leaves office in January.
\
The federal government's decision last month to deny Pennsylvania's plan to toll Interstate 80 created a $472 million hole in next year's transportation budget. The longer-term problem Rendell wants the Legislature to address is the $3.5 billion needed annually to maintain state and local highway and bridge systems.
\
Port Authority of Allegheny County, which provides bus and light-rail service to 220,000 daily riders, faces a projected $52 million shortfall in its fiscal 2010-11 operating budget, which begins July 1. That's about 15 percent of its total budget.
\
Without a statewide resolution, the authority said it faces the possibility of cutting service and increasing fares.
\
""We must act now,"" Port Authority CEO Steve Bland said. ""This isn't just about buses and T service in Pittsburgh. It's ensuring there is enough money each year to maintain bridges, pave roads and support public transportation statewide.""
\
Bland was one of about two dozen funding advocates who stood by Rendell at a news conference after his speech.
\
Rendell said he would accept a solution to the I-80 funding gap but would prefer a longer-lasting transportation funding plan. He proposed a range of solutions, from borrowing $1 billion to fill the gap for two years, to raising the gas tax and again trying to lease the Pennsylvania Turnpike to a private company. But Rendell said he's not wedded to any solution.
\
In arguing for action, Rendell turned the talk toward one of his potential successors, stating that ""one of the major candidates for governor has taken the no-tax pledge."" He was referring to Republican Attorney General Tom Corbett of Shaler, who signed the pledge with Americans for Tax Reform.
\
""This is the time to get this done,"" Rendell said. ""We can't wait four years"" until 2014, the year of the next governor's race, he said.
\
Pennsylvania's general fund budget deficit is $1 billion, and Rendell acknowledged earlier this week that will make it harder to solve the transportation challenges.
\
""It really doesn't matter who the next governor is, there will be so many problems,"" Markosek said. But it's his job to try to reach a solution this year, he said.
\
""I think the key issue is reliability and predictability,"" Bland said during a brief interview. ""I think every day we wait is a day too long.""
\
The authority supported passage of Act 44 in 2007 because the law promised a reliable stream of money for five decades. Act 44 funding levels fell short of those recommended in the 2006 State Transportation Funding and Reform Commission report.

Until the moment the jury returned those guilty verdicts in Little Rock last Tuesday and thus ensured that Whitewater will stay as a trap door under the feet of the president and first lady through November, the Republicans appeared almost hypnotized by Bill Clinton's masterly equivocations and inhuman smoothness.
\
Is it possible, these Republicans have been asking, to get to the right of Bill Clinton? Paul Gigot, the Wall Street Journal columnist, lamented last Friday that after starting to compose a list of all the conservative ideas Clinton had embraced, he'd barely been able to keep up with the president's rightward lunge on the gas tax, on a law to inform neighborhoods about convicted sex offenders, on tax credits for adoption, against judges who are ``soft on crime,'' against gay marriages.
\
Gigot's list was far from complete. He didn't even mention Clinton's recent ringing endorsement of Gov. Tommy Thompson's vicious welfare ``reform'' in Wisconsin. About the only policy Bob Dole had left to blast Clinton with was Star Wars, and here, too, the president attacked Dole's scheme as profligate and offered a thriftier version.
\
So complete has been the president's transition into a Republican candidate that Gigot didn't even make the traditional charge that still, despite it all, Bill is a closet liberal, yearning for the moment when he can tear off his disguise.
\
Meanwhile, as if sensing that it was time to throw a bouquet to the long-suffering liberals, recently said he is prepared to do battle with Dole over ``the fundamental questions about the role of government.'' This from the man who told cheering Republicans in Congress last January that ``the era of big government is over.''
\
Other exercises in fence-mending with liberals have also been taking place. A five-bell alarm went off in the White House in mid-May when the Los Angeles-based Voice of the Environment (VOTE), run by Lewis Siler, took out a series of tough newspaper advertisements denouncing the administration's policies and stating baldly, ``President Clinton, you have done more to harm the environment and weaken environmental regulations in four years than Presidents Bush and Reagan in their 12 years.'' The ad urged support for Ralph Nader, now aiming to be on the ballot in over 20 states, including California, which is crucial to Clinton.
\
Within hours of the ad's appearance, Vice President Al Gore was on the phone to Hollywood liberals, apologizing for Clinton's salvage rider, which unleashed chain saws in ancient forests, and pledging to use ``every power in my hands to minimize the damage.'' Meanwhile, Gore's former top aide, Katie McGinty, was dispatched to Los Angeles to pour soothing words into the ever-receptive ears of the liberal celebrities, bring them and their campaign contributions to heel, and nip Nader defections in the bud.
\
In the midst of all this bobbing, weaving and masterly equivocation has come the decision of the Little Rock jury to convict Clinton's former business associates, James and Susan McDougal, along with his successor as governor, Jim Guy Tucker. The sensational news made me think of Rene Clair's great film Plein Soleil. Alain Delon has gotten away with murder, and in the last scene, his yacht is dry-docked for cleaning. As it's winched up the jetty, up also comes the body of the man he killed, snagged all those weeks on the anchor chain.
\
Clinton can bob and weave, outflank Bob Dole on the right, dupe the liberals. But he also has an anchor chain down in the murk and grime of that phase of his and his wife's operations in Arkansas known in shorthand as ``Whitewater.'' The press had mostly been saying it was all too complicated for a juror to understand. But those Little Rock jurors didn't seem to have too many problems getting to the gist of the matter, and they - the home crowd - cannot have been too impressed with Clinton's video-testimony. We'll have Whitewater, Travelgate and Fostergate with us through November. Like the war record and the comic opera of ``commander-in-chief immunity,'' Whitewater is an issue on which even Clinton, the supreme maneuverer, can't outflank Bob Dole.

Seizing a chance to portray himself as the populist in the governor's race, Democrat Dan Onorato has been pounding away at GOP rival Tom Corbett in recent days on whether to tax the extraction of natural gas from Pennsylvania's Marcellus Shale.
\
In contrast to Corbett, Onorato favors creating such a tax and using its revenue exclusively for environmental purposes.
\
Onorato said Thursday at City Hall that Corbett was in the pocket of the gas industry and would prefer to have taxpayers pick up the tab for environmental damage caused by drilling than to have drillers themselves pay the cost.
\
Corbett has said that if elected governor Nov. 2, he will oppose all new taxes. He said that funding to protect the environment could be found by transferring money from other areas of state government. He said new taxes would only cause drillers to scale back their Pennsylvania operations, costing jobs.
\
""Tom Corbett thinks the taxpayers should foot the bill to clean up and protect the environment. I think the drillers should pay for it,"" Onorato said while accepting an endorsement from Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania.
\
""I am running for governor of Pennsylvania to represent the taxpayers,"" he said. ""Tom Corbett is just representing the gas drillers.""
\
Kevin Harley, campaign spokesman for Corbett, replied by saying Onorato's whole approach to governing was to ""tax, tax, tax.""
\
The issue of a shale tax has been bubbling in Harrisburg. As part of the agreement approving the state budget in July, legislators said they would take up by October a shale-tax proposal, including what its rate would be and how its revenue would be disbursed.
\
Under an agreement between Gov. Rendell and Senate Republicans, the two parties have pledged to enact a gas tax by October.
\
Rendell said Wednesday that he had begun to think the deal would fall through. He reiterated that Thursday in Harrisburg.
\
""I've been here for almost eight years. I've learned not to be confident about anything,"" he told reporters.
\
But he said a deal was possible if lawmakers sent him a serious proposal.
\
""Of course, it's doable,"" he said. ""The Lord created the Earth in seven days. We have how many more days? We've got 21.""
\
Just as Corbett disagrees with some in his party by opposing any tax, Onorato emphasized that he had not committed himself to the Rendell approach on its use and size.
\
Onorato said that, unlike Rendell, he would not allocate any of the revenue to help balance the budget. He said the money would go into environmental causes, including greater funding for the Department of Environmental Protection.
\
Rendell also wants to impose a severance tax, charging drillers 5 percent on the sale of extracted gas, plus 4.7 cents for every 1,000 cubic feet of gas produced.
\
Onorato said that, as governor, he expected to negotiate a tax rate with legislators.
\
In another campaign issue, Onorato on Thursday disputed the stance of the state Attorney General's Office that it has no authority to investigate allegations of election fraud resulting from an internal struggle this spring in the Philadelphia GOP.
\
Onorato had said Wednesday that Corbett, as attorney general, was playing favorites in deciding which election-fraud cases to look at and which to ignore. He said again Thursday that Corbett had ""plenty of authority"" to look at the Philadelphia case.
\
But Nils Frederiksen, a spokesman for the Attorney General's Office, reiterated that Corbett would have jurisdiction only if Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams referred the case to his office.
\
Williams' spokeswoman said he was looking into the allegations and had not asked Corbett's office to get involved.

608,"Gas prices grabbed the spotlight in Bucks County's congressional race Tuesday, with Democratic U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy and Republican challenger Tom Manion offering starkly different approaches to reducing the country's dependence on foreign oil and to driving down fuel costs.\In what is likely to be a common theme during their election battle, Murphy and Manion both took to gas stations to pitch their solutions -- Manion, at an Upper Makefield Shell station, pushed for an end to the moratorium on offshore drilling, while Murphy, at an independent gas station near his Bristol Township home, advocated a plan to force drilling on the millions of acres of unexplored land already under lease by oil companies.\""We know that the areas that have been denied by Congress are oil-rich areas already, and that is the opportunity we have here -- clearly an opportunity we have to lower the prices,"" Manion said.\But to appeal to environmentally conscious Bucks County voters, who voted 2-1 last November to spend $87 million to preserve open space, Manion was careful to refer to using more environmentally friendly drilling technologies.\""I think the environment is very, very important for Bucks County, and I couldn't be a bigger supporter,"" Manion said. ""But I think we have a real opportunity in this day and age in ways where we can still watch the environment ...""\Murphy, in an interview, said he opposes lifting the moratorium, which has been in effect since 1981 and prohibits most offshore oil exploration.\""I don't want us drilling off the Jersey Shore or the Florida coast or the California coast,"" said Murphy, who supported a measure earlier this year to provide $20 billion in tax incentives for renewable energy development and investment. ""I think that is irresponsible.""\The differing views mirror the partisan debate in Washington, where Republicans and Democrats battled without resolution in June over whether to open the country's shoreline and other areas -- including the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska -- to exploration.\Democrats, including Murphy, countered GOP efforts to ease the offshore drilling ban by pointing to the 68 million acres under lease by oil companies that has yet to be explored. They pushed legislation to force oil companies to ""use it or lose it."" ""These are pieces of land that the oil companies asked [for],"" Murphy said.\The oil industry says that it is unrealistic to suggest that all the land under lease could be drilled at once considering the years it takes to study the leased land and receive permits to begin drilling. ""It is a very complicated process that was purposely obscured during this debate,"" said Lee Fuller, vice president of government relations for the Independent Petroleum Association of America.\Any new drilling would have little immediate impact on the price of gas, which averages $4-plus nationwide. Both candidates said they support temporarily lifting the 18-cent federal gasoline tax. Murphy also said he favors allowing small businesses to deduct their fuel expenses.\Manion, who favors opening ANWR to drilling, said simply opening new areas to drilling would lower costs somewhat by increasing future supplies and reducing speculation.\Manion's proposal also includes incentives and tax credits to speed the development of other energy sources such as nuclear, solar and geothermal, and fast-tracking refinery capacity expansions.\""I don't think alternative energies are going to be here anytime soon in a big way,"" Manion said, ""so, for me, it has to be a multi-tiered approach.""\Tuesday's dueling events were a first in the campaign, which is expected to be one of the more heated in the country. Murphy, a freshman who eked out his victory two years ago, is Congress' only Iraq war veteran, having served as a U.S. Army captain. He opposes the war.\Manion, a retired Marine colonel and pharmaceutical company executive, favors keeping troops in Iraq for the time being. His son, Travis, was killed in Iraq last year.\jdrobnyk@tribune.com\202-824-8216\SPLIT OVER SAVINGS\In the face of ever-rising gasoline prices, U.S. Rep.

If location is the key to selling real estate, then transportation - read: the Exton Bypass and the widening of Route 202 - seems to be the key to getting elected to one of the Pennsylvania General Assembly seats on the election block in Chester County.
\
In the four contested General Assembly races - the 155th, 156th and 157th State House Districts and the 19th State Senate District - every candidate has cited transportation as one of the main issues facing the rapidly growing region. All vowed to work hard to see that Chester County gets its fair share of highway projects financed by PennDOT.
\
Positions in the transportation debate, however, differ depending on whether the incumbent or the challenger is talking.
\
Incumbents, regardless of party affiliation, have said that major road projects have not been started because of stiff competition for PennDOT
\
dollars from elsewhere in Pennsylvania.
\
Challengers, however, have cited the lack of progress as a reason for voters to believe they are not being well-served by the officeholders.
\
How great an impact the traffic issue will have will be known on Nov. 8, when voters go to the polls.
\
According to county Voter Services director Linda Cummings, there were 111,892 Republicans and 46,473 Democrats registered in Chester County by the Oct. 17 registration deadline, giving the GOP an overwhelming 2.4-to-1 edge. The remainder of the 175,424 total voters registered included Independents, Consumer Party members and others, including Communists and Libertarians.
\
Cummings said more than 5,600 people visited the office on the last day for registration. ""We were busy, busy, busy,"" she said last week. ""Now it's just a matter of getting all the paper work done.""

\
In the 19th State Senate District, Earl M. Baker, the GOP candidate, faces Democrat Thomas A. Doherty Jr. Baker, 48, of Malvern, is a former Chester County commissioner and current Republican state chairman. Doherty, 39, also of Malvern, is the owner of Tad's Pet Shops Inc. and a longtime activist in the Democratic Party. Sen. John Stauffer is not seeking re-election.
\
Baker, who is considered the overwhelming favorite in the race, three weeks ago erected a sign outside his campaign office that reads ""Earl M. Baker, State Senator, 19th District."" About a week later, he attached a cardboard sign with the word ""FOR"" atop the first one. Baker said that he was ''cautiously optimistic,"" and that if he was elected, his campaign headquarters would become his district office.
\
""I'm just being realistic,"" Baker said. ""If I think I can buy something and use it after the election, then why not.""
\
Doherty, however, called the tactic arrogant. ""It is a very expensive and permanent sign,"" Doherty said, ""and it is indicative of his contempt for the rights of the voters. I am vying for this position, as is Mr. Baker.""
\
Doherty also hammered away at Baker's proposal to make the Exton Bypass a toll road.
\
""Earl Baker was a county commissioner for 12 years,"" Doherty said. ""For eight of those years, he had a favorable administration in Harrisburg. He is a prominent figure in the Republican Party statewide. Yet he couldn't get money for one of the most important highway projects in the region.""
\
Baker said PennDOT simply did not have the money for major road projects. ''What Mr. Doherty is suggesting is a free lunch,"" Baker said, ""and there is no such thing as a free lunch.""

\
In the 155th State House District, GOP candidate Barry Pignoli is trying to unseat eight-term Democrat Samuel W. Morris. Pignoli, 40, of Downingtown, is a marketing executive with Shared Medical Systems. Morris, 70, of North Coventry Township, is a full-time legislator, a farmer and a semi-retired lawyer.
\
Pignoli, who garnered 42 percent of the vote in his run against Morris in 1986, said he had overcome the hurdle of low name recognition and expected the Republican voter-registration edge in the northern Chester County district to
\
put him over the top.
\
He cited transportation and effective community planning measures as two key issues. ""In 1986, I knocked on over 8,000 doors, and this time around I've done 6,000,"" Pignoli said. ""I told the voters I would be back, and I have kept that promise.""
\
Along with transportation, Morris said the environment was an important issue. ""I think the folks around the district are anxious to keep the countryside clean and green and are hoping the farmers will stay,"" he said.
\
*
\
In the 156th State House District, Democrat Albert B. Grafstrom 3d is facing six-term incumbent Republican Elinor Z. Taylor. Grafstrom, 26, of West Whiteland, is the administrator of Cardiac DataCorp Inc. Taylor, 67, lives in West Chester.
\
Grafstrom has pledged that if he is elected, ""the Route 30 Bypass will be well on its way toward completion at the end of my first term, or I won't seek re-election."" He said the bypass could be built without increasing taxes or making it a toll road. ""The money is there,"" Grafstrom said.
\
Taylor, who was challenged by Grafstrom to make the same promise, said, ''For someone to promise something they can't deliver, that's not my style."" Taylor said she did not oppose the idea of a toll road. She also cited child care as an important issue.
\
Grafstrom, who said he had greeted voters at their homes and at town meetings, church meetings and club events, said regional planning must be addressed.
\
*
\
In the 157th State House District, GOP incumbent Peter R. Vroon will try to retain his seat against a challenge from Democrat John Shniper. Vroon, 71, a seven-term incumbent, lives in Valley Forge. Shniper, 41, a lawyer, lives in Phoenixville.
\
Shniper, who challenged Vroon unsuccessfully in a 1982 race that cost him nearly $14,000, said he would spend less than $1,000 this time around. ""I think you have to be realistic about where you are running and what your chances are,"" he said. ""I am basically in an advocacy situation, giving an important group an opportunity to vote and open the debate for dialogue on issues.""
\
As for issues, Vroon cited transportation and reform of auto insurance, local taxes and medical malpractice as areas needing attention. He said PennDOT needed to be restructured to alleviate the political pressures that the department faced when choosing highway projects.
\
Shniper said a 2-cent-a-gallon gas tax would go a long way toward building the Exton Bypass and many other highway projects around the state. Further, he said, more work needed to be done to clean the environment and improve public education. ""I am running because the local leadership here tends to be somewhat gutless on these issues,"" Shniper said.

The following candidates, all Republicans, face no opposition: 36th Senate Distict, Noah Wenger; 167th State House District, Robert J. Flick; 13th State House District, Arthur Hershey; 158th State House District, Joseph R. Pitts.

ABORTION VS. ABUSE?
\
Like many ""pro-choice"" people, Mari Pacitti (letter Dec. 31) seems to think abortion is a solution to the terrible problem of child abuse.
\
I was born to a mother with serious emotional problems, and a cold and distant father. My siblings and I were physically and mentally abused.
\
It took years of therapy, tears and prayers to turn my life around. Today I am happily married to a wonderful man and have a sweet little daughter, a good job, friends and a nice home, things I thought would never have been possible in those dark and lonely years. I am thankful for the many compassionate people who helped me on the path to wholeness, and even for my mother, for giving me the chance to experience life in all its beauty, wonder and yes, sorrow. Many of us us survived child abuse, and I have yet to hear one of us say,""Gee, I wish I would have been aborted!""
\
Abortion will not ""solve"" the problem of child abuse. Since abortion's
\
legalization in 1973, child abuse has skyrocketed, a fact that abortion proponents cannot dismiss by saying that the increase is due to ""better reporting.""

ADAMO AND ISRAEL
\
In his Dec. 15 column on the Persian Gulf crisis, Msgr. S.J. Adamo once again demonstrated ethnic hatred and incitement. Adamo's tirades against the Jews have appeared on numerous occasion, and now he's blaming Saddam Hussein's aggression on - guess who - Israel.
\
The fact is that Saddam's crimes against his own people include bloodbaths of political enemies, murder of his government officials, and chemical warfare against his Kurdish population.
\
Neighboring Arab states fear his ruthless quest for power, and the decimation of Kuwait has proven the legitimacy of those concerns.
\
In his eagerness to implicate Israel, Adamo blanked out the true nature of Saddam's horrifying regime.

You constantly preach against prejudice, but you allow columnists who are virtual bigots full privilege of using your newspaper to expel their verbal poison. I too believe in freedom of press, but like everything else, it can and should have its limits.
\
The worst offense of abusing this blessed freedom comes from the least suspected source, Msgr. S.J. Adamo, a Catholic priest, the last person in the world to incite hatred. His constant tirades against anyone or or anything associated with the Jewish faith are unforgivable.
\
This so-called ""Man of God"" who would be up the creek without the words of a Jewish Man (Jesus) has the gall to crucify his people in his column. I realize, as an editor, you have to allow everyone to express their thoughts freely, but it seems futile to continue your editorials and columns against bigotry and allow a columnist to spew his hatred in spite of all the letters
\
from readers condemning him.
\
It hurts to have your ethnic group constantly pushed as scapegoats. They've taken enough hell without deserving it through the centuries and deserve to live in peace. They've taken it from Jesse Jackson long enough, please don't

WAR AND GENDER
\
Your Jan. 16 page one photo of the City Hall peace rally shows screaming female faces with much epiglottal exposure. Nauseating!
\
The Persian Gulf ""gender gap"" of opinion - far more women than men oppose war - is less logical and more hormonal in nature. With their genetic ''nurturing essence,"" women are biologically handicapped when judging the merits of war. Let's leave fighting and war in general to the proven, preeminent male gender.
\
Nowadays, thanks to the aborted philosophy of feminist ""thinkers,"" America has a lost generation of 40-ish working mothers with no husbands. Ironically, middle-aged bachelors inherited the sweet ride - multiple cars, condos, girlfriends, etc.
\
I hope the new generation of girls confine themselves to exercise videos and other beauty enhancing modalities in order to attract husbands and please them in bed. Women should cook, manage the house, and raise healthy children with strong family values, rather then snatching jobs away from working men.

UNTIMELY DEATHS
\
Although not really an obituary reader, I noticed the death of two adults in their early 20s.
\
A nice looking man with a child, a young lady with sisters and brothers - left behind to wonder why anyone so young has to pass on.
\
The circumstances of their death is not known to me, but in these times one seems to sense that violence or drugs or both may have been the cause.
\
With the millions and billions of dollars wasted on defense, bank bailouts, congressional and vice presidential pay raises, it makes me sick that not more is done to curb drug trafficking.

NO HIGHER GAS TAX
\
A large increase in the gasoline tax your Jan. 22 editorial called for would cripple an already limping economy. People would buy fewer new cars
\
because they wouldn't be able to afford the gas. A shaky U.S. auto industry would close plants, and laid-off workers would be placed on an overtaxed welfare system.
\
The insurance industry would suffer because fewer new cars means fewer
\
dollars in their coffers. The banks would feel the pinch; car loans are their bread and butter. Let us not forget the travel industry - a lot of people would spend their vacations sitting on the front porch watching the cars rust.
\
One out of six jobs in this country is connected to the auto. You have tried to make your readers feel guilty for paying lower prices for gasoline than many other countries. Paying lower prices is an American birthright.
\
Last, but not least - such a tax would never clear a House Committee
\
because the Oil Industry would never allow it.

Let me run an idea by you.
\
This idea would give your boss a very good reason to:
\
Offer you flexible work hours or a four-day workweek. Let you work from home sometimes. Provide day care and other helpful services, such as a dry cleaner and convenience store, on site.
\
Give those of you who commute on mass transit a lift from the bus or train stop to the office, and provide a ride home in an emergency or when you work late.
\
And improve the food in the cafeteria.
\
Starting to like this idea, eh?
\
Well, most of you can forget it. It was out there last year, hungry for friends, but now it's dead - or at best on life support.
\
It's a case study in the dangers of letting an idea's enemies define it. And it's become a test of how much the talk about curbing pollution through cooperation, not regulation, is sincere - and how much it's a smoke screen behind which businesses can return merrily to their old, heck-with-the- environment ways.
\
It's called the Employer Trip Reduction Program, and if you've heard about it before, the description probably didn't sound anything like the workers' bonanza portrayed above.
\
More than likely, you were told that it was a beats-all example of dumb-as- a-post government meddling with your personal freedom and God's own free market. You were warned those darn fools in Washington want to yank you out of your new Camry and plop you onto some smelly bus to get to work.
\
Actually, Employer Trip Reduction was a bit of both: a useful prod toward sensible changes, and a bureaucratic attempt to knock off a gnat with an elephant gun.
\
Our story begins in the distant past, 1990, when, incredible as it now seems, a Republican president signed an ambitious update of the Clean Air Act passed by a Democratic Congress. Under the law, when an area's air quality got bad enough, a set of remedies - including trip reduction - kicked in. And Philadelphia's air was bad enough.
\
So, many local employers were told to find ways to reduce the number of cars coming into their parking lots during morning rush hour. Employers couldn't force employees to do anything, but if they didn't meet government goals, they faced fines. And if a state didn't meet its air-quality target - ouch. No more highway money from Uncle Sam.
\
Business reacted predictably. With one hand, the slow one, it set about complying. With the other, it waved in the lobbyists and lawyers to rouse public outrage and get the rule overturned.
\
It wasn't tough to get the hoi polloi whipped up. Just tell them government was messing with their God-given right to rev their cylinders whenever and wherever they darn well pleased.
\
Some corporate chieftains even objected that they deeply resented being forced to ask employees to alter their lifestyles. (This would have been more moving if they'd also vowed never to make people work unwanted overtime, nor to punish them for political activism or dating co-workers.)
\
Leading the assault on Employer Trip Reduction in this region was a business group, the Penjerdel Council.
\
Give Penjerdel's president, Collin McNeil, five minutes and he'll make a persuasive case against trip reduction (he's had a lot of practice).
\
""It's bad policy based on bad law,"" he says. ""They misdiagnosed the region."" Penjerdel maintains that the data and the science behind the finding of a serious ozone problem were faulty. And for all ""the pain and heartache"" companies would have to endure to comply, polluting emissions would be reduced by a measly 2 percent.
\
Elizabeth Thompson, a senior policy analyst at the Clean Air Council, one of the last, forlorn supporters of trip reduction, concedes its emissions benefit pales next to the payoff from another Clean Air ""mandate"" - emissions inspections.
\
In fact, judged solely on how elegantly it achieved its desired effect, trip reduction might qualify for a Letterman list of the ""Top 10 Reasons Why Government Should Go Sit in a Corner and Shut Up.""
\
But, as Thompson stresses, trip reduction is the only piece of the act that got at a root pollution problem - the ever-rising number of miles people drive, in ever-thicker congestion. And its value could have gone beyond air quality to quality of life, by pushing parties to do things that ought to be done, but weren't going to get done without a shove.
\
It could have spurred employers to take steps - from flexible work weeks to offering decent food so workers needn't drive five miles to lunch - that a few sharp companies already are coming to view as a wise investment in productivity and morale.
\
It could have encouraged use of mass transit and, by rewarding companies and individuals for locating near transit lines, might have helped slow the outward thrust of sprawl. It could have trained people to think of car trips as a resource to be husbanded, not an inexhaustible entitlement.
\
It ""could have"" done all that. But probably won't now. Between the rubber and the road has come one Newt Gingrich, with his flinty-eyed legion of regulation haters.
\
And suddenly the Environmental Protection Agency, that sneering bully of Republican campaign rhetoric, has become the 98-pound weakling. Instead of rattling the sabers the Clean Air Act forged, EPA is now weakly shaking pompons on the sidelines.
\
Will it fine companies that don't comply? Take highway money away from states? ""How could you think we'd do such mean things?"" was the gist of mollifying letters EPA officials wrote to members of Congress in affected areas. All EPA wants now, apparently, is for business to give it the ol'
\
college try. And states, not EPA, will judge whether they have.
\
Since the governors of Pennsylvania and New Jersey have zero patience for ''save-the-environment"" hoohah, this begins to look like just another dead federal mandate.
\
Penjerdel frets that, as long as trip reduction lurks in the fine print of federal law, it could still emerge vampire-like from the coffin, perhaps through a tree-huggers' lawsuit. To drive a stake through its heart, U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum (R, Pa.), has introduced a bill to eliminate the rule from the Clean Air Act.
\
But some optimists, like one Peter Quinn, think trip reduction, the idea, might just live on. Quinn is executive director of the Greater Valley Forge Transportation Management Association, which means he's spent a lot of time guiding suburban corporations through the intricacies of trip reduction.
\
""Maybe we'll see the intrinsic value of the idea more clearly once the upholstery, that feeling of mandate, comes off,"" he says. ""I recognize in the business leaders I work with a psychological freedom, a sense of monkey off the back. . . . But it'll be hard to counter the perceptual damage done by imposing this from the get go.""
\
A big part of the problem, Quinn believes, was having EPA, the bane of business, push this idea as a clean-air measure, instead of having, say, PennDot run it as an attack on traffic congestion.
\
Another, says Karol Rose, a partner at Kwasha Lipton, a New Jersey benefits consultant, was that the government made the same mistake some businesses did when introducing the program to workers: stressing mandate and punishment, rather than incentives and opportunity, and bungling the job of education and guidance.
\
Still, Quinn believes, ""quality, heads-up"" companies won't abandon useful approaches that trip reduction goaded them to explore.
\
Merck, Sharp & Dohme, which faced a huge challenge reducing traffic into its West Point complex in a classic sprawl-and-congestion part of Montgomery County, is an encouraging example.
\
Merck isn't punting on trip reduction, says trip coordinator Richelle Skisuski, because it sees how big a problem congestion is locally, and how well employees embraced some ideas. Merck is going ahead with ""4/40""
\
concentrated work weeks, telecommuting and car pooling incentives. One example: A driver who agrees to pick up co-workers at the one train station near West Point gets preferred parking, no small perk at the huge complex. An unpopular idea to be dropped: making workers pay to park.
\
But for every Merck, there'll be other firms, just as large, that will distribute brochures on car pooling and call it a day.
\
Meanwhile, the ever-growing horde of tailpipes will keep spewing.
\
Yes, the trip reduction program was a clumsy way to push a good idea. For businesses, just as for workers, a system of incentives to rethink habits would have been better received and more effective than threatened punishments that were too severe to be used.
\
Penjerdel's McNeil says businesses do support cleaner air and less congested roads, because of their health benefits and usefulness in marketing the region. They just didn't want the burden of achieving those goals to be squarely on them.
\
""We've got to modify behavior,"" he says, ""but the only way to do that is market-based.""
\
Ahhh, the beloved market. And how could the market effectively whittle down the mountain of miles driven? With a gas tax high enough to affect driving decisions, McNeil speculates. Say, oh, 50 cents a gallon.
\
Does government meddling in worker-boss relations still look so bad to you?

613,"
Promises, promises.
\
When Republican Tom Ridge ran for governor in 1994, he put together a 200-plus-page manual of positions and pledges - some fuzzy, some specific - on issues ranging from agriculture exports to welfare cuts.
\
Ridge also made promises in other forums. He said he would veto any attempt to increase the salaries of lawmakers, for instance, yet in 1995 he reneged and signed a pay-raise bill.
\
Thanks to Republican majorities in the House and Senate, however, Ridge has been able to push a Republican agenda that has reduced the size of government, slashed business taxes and welfare rolls, and made life tougher for criminals.
\
Here is a look at what's happened with 50 Ridge campaign promises:
\
GOVERNMENT REFORM 1. Abolish ``walking around money'' or WAMs - grants for everything from firefighting equipment to high school bands. These were awarded by legislative leaders to their allies in the legislature.
\
Ridge got rid of WAMs but replaced them with a Community Revitalization Program he controls. The money often serves the same purpose - to reward helpful legislators, but the process is less secretive.
\
2. Cut $2 billion in ``wasteful government spending'' over four years.
\
Ridge didn't cut $2 billion outright from the budget. He argues, though, that he saved taxpayers $2 billion by cutting the average annual rate of government growth from 5.5 percent over the previous decade to 2.5 percent.
\
3. Slice 10 percent from the Governor's Office budget.
\
When Ridge took office, the appropriation was $7.46 million. The next year it fell to $6.72 million, a drop of 9 percent. Spending has since risen to $7.2 million.
\
4. Provide a tax-amnesty program to allow delinquent taxpayers to make good on their debts, with interest, but without having to pay penalties.
\
A one-time program collected $93 million.
\
5. Establish an ``initiative and referendum'' process that would allow citizens to vote on controversial issues, with the outcome binding.
\
Ridge has never pushed this issue.
\
6. Reform the local tax structure to give school districts and local governments more flexibility.
\
Ridge supported a bipartisan measure approved by voters last November that amended the Pennsylvania Constitution and opened the way for legislation allowing municipalities and school districts to slash taxes on residential property. Local governments then could impose new wage and sales taxes to offset lost revenues.
\
7. Sell the state liquor stores to private businesses.
\
Ridge has been unable to win legislative support for the idea.
\
8. Cut government ``red tape'' by restructuring the entire state regulatory process.
\
Ridge streamlined the regulatory process through an executive order.
\
9. Make state government more accountable by strengthening lobbying laws to provide for more disclosure.
\
Ridge says he will sign disclosure legislation approved last week.
\
10. Modernize the public records law.
\
Ridge has allotted $435,000 to begin computerizing campaign-finance records for elected state officials.
\
11. Cut business taxes to increase jobs.
\
Tax cuts under Ridge have saved taxpayers more than $2.6 billion. Most of the savings benefited business. State Department of Labor and Industry numbers show jobs have increased in the state by 234,000 since Ridge took office.
\
EDUCATION 12. Allow parents to choose schools for their children - public, private or religious.
\
Ridge pushed a school voucher plan twice, but was unable to win enough votes in the legislature. It's still on the agenda.
\
13. Create publicly funded charter schools that would promote innovation.
\
Ridge signed charter school legislation in 1997, and more than 30 are now operating across the state.
\
14. Replace outcomes-based education (OBE), a system of measuring student performance, with more stringent academic standards.
\
Opponents said OBE, instituted in 1993, was a government intrusion into parental decisions about teaching values. Ridge gave districts the option of getting rid of OBE. He also proposed new academic standards for math and language that were adopted this year.
\
15. Penalize striking teachers one day's pay for each day they remain on strike.
\
No action.
\
16. Make schools safer by establishing alternative schools for troubled children.
\
Ridge has budgeted money for alternative schools within schools, although critics say he has not provided enough money.
\
17. Impose a moratorium on new state education mandates.
\
Experts say Ridge has been sensitive about imposing new requirements on schools.
\
18. Require schools to conduct a survey of school violence and institute a process of reporting violent incidents to the state.
\
Both were done.
\
CRIME 19. Sign death warrants to schedule executions.
\
Ridge has signed 121 warrants and won passage of a law requiring governors to sign warrants within 30 days. Two men were put to death in 1995, Ridge's first year in office. They were the first executions in Pennsylvania in 33 years.
\
20. Strengthen state rape and domestic violence laws, create a victims' advocate office and permit use of battered-spouse syndrome as a defense in criminal proceedings.
\
Ridge successfully pushed for tougher rape and domestic violence laws and created the victims' advocate office. The battered-spouse syndrome has not been made a statutory defense.
\
21. Overhaul the juvenile justice system by, among other things, requiring violent juvenile offenders to serve longer sentences and increasing penalties for juveniles who possess weapons.
\
Those changes and others were made during a special legislative session on crime that Ridge called the day after being sworn in.
\
22. Pass a ``three strikes and you're out'' law.
\
``Three strikes'' legislation that Ridge has signed requires a mandatory minimum of 25 years in prison for a third conviction on one of 10 serious felonies.
\
23. Eliminate the Parole Board's power to release violent criminals before their sentences are completed and replace that power with sentencing judges.
\
He did not eliminate that power. However, after a 1995 incident involving Robert ``Mudman'' Simon, who killed a New Jersey police officer after the Pennsylvania Parole Board released him, Ridge replaced the board chairman and prevailed upon the board to adopt more stringent reviews of releases.
\
24. Sentence first-time juvenile offenders to boot camps.
\
No legislation has been enacted, but for years judges have had the option to send juveniles to boot camps.
\
25. Privatize juvenile detention centers.
\
Judges have the option of sending juveniles to private centers, but state centers have not been privatized.
\
26. Make prisoners part of work gangs.
\
Prisoners have been enlisted for various projects, such as shoveling snow during blizzards.
\
27. Prohibit minors from possessing firearms except for legitimate sports activities, make the sale of guns to minors a felony carrying a 10-year mandatory sentence, and prevent people with serious juvenile records from buying guns until they are 30 if they remain crime-free since their juvenile offenses.
\
All approved, but the law concerning the sale of guns to minors increased the maximum from five to seven years, rather than imposing a 10-year mandatory sentence.
\
28. Establish a zero-tolerance policy for weapons in schools.
\
Done.
\
29. Amend the state Constitution to permit judges to deny bail to suspects deemed public safety risks.
\
On the ballot next month.
\
WELFARE 30. Eliminate general-assistance benefits to so-called able-bodied men and women.
\
Done.
\
31. Require young welfare recipients and their children to stay in school to receive benefits.
\
Also done.
\
32. Limit benefits to two years, then require recipients to work, and impose a 90-day residency requirement.
\
Benefits were limited to two years and a work requirement was imposed. However, a federal appeals court has ruled that the law Ridge signed denying full cash benefits to families that had lived in the state less than one year is unconstitutional.
\
33. Increase the age threshold from 45 to 55 years to receive medical assistance.
\
Ridge signed legislation in 1996 that requires people 21 to 58 who have no children to get a job and work 100 hours a month to receive medical assistance. Those people - as well as recipients 59 and older and the so-called chronically needy, including victims of abuse and the disabled - also were required to pay $150 a year for certain health-care services.
\
34. Provide incentives to the private sector to hire and train welfare recipients.
\
The state has provided tax incentives to businesses and provides some medical coverage and child care for recipients.
\
35. Make out-of-wedlock fathers take responsibility for their children.
\
This has been done through the aggressive attachment of wages, but critics complain that nothing has been done to help fathers secure work.
\
ENVIRONMENT 36. Replace the Department of Environmental Resources, which Ridge called a ``job-crushing, community-harassing regulatory nightmare,'' with a Department of Environmental Protection and Department of Conservation and Natural Resources.
\
This was done by legislation and has elevated the status of state parks and forests.
\
37. Promote the use of cleaned-up contaminated industrial sites.
\
Legislation to do this was approved in 1995 and the state's efforts have been recognized nationally.
\
38. Create a 21st Century Environmental Commission to identify future problems.
\
The commission recently said sprawling development and general land-use patterns were its biggest environment-related concerns.
\
39. Require deadlines for permit application approvals.
\
Deadlines have always been imposed, but Ridge instituted a money-back guarantee program for missed deadlines. It has been used just once, for a mining application.
\
40. Create an Office of Pollution Prevention.
\
Done.
\
41. End the policy of making state regulations more stringent than federal requirements.
\
Done.
\
BUSINESS 42. Reform the workers' compensation system.
\
Much to the delight of employers and the dismay of unions, the legislature approved changes to workers' compensation that state officials said have saved the state $1.8 billion.
\
43. Increase Pennsylvania exports by $5 billion and create 100,000 new export-related jobs.
\
Exports have increased either $4.3 billion or $5.14 billion, depending on the accounting method used. As for jobs, there also is no clear answer. Under the counting method used when Ridge ran for governor, federal officials said $1 billion in exports equaled 19,000 jobs. That figure is now 13,000 jobs for each $1 billion.
\
44. Lead trade delegations to promote Pennsylvania products and services.
\
Ridge and/or an entourage of state officials, business leaders and academics have visited 14 countries.
\
45. Increase funding and make agricultural exports a higher priority.
\
Agricultural exports rose 7 percent from 1995 though 1997. During the last three years of the previous administration, agricultural exports increased 16 percent.
\
TRANSPORTATION 46. Improve roads by increasing the number of construction projects.
\
Just in Philadelphia, 80 miles of highway have been resurfaced since 1995 at a cost of $18 million, and 45 projects were completed at a cost of $137 million. A gas-tax increase in 1997 will provide an added $404 million annually for road and bridge projects.
\
47. Develop regional transportation corridors that will link all modes of transportation.
\
Some progress, such as $2.6 million a year to keep train service on the Philadelphia-to-Harrisburg passenger rail corridor.
\
48. Convert state-owned vehicle fleet to low-emission and alternative fuel vehicles.
\
Not done.
\
49. Streamline, decentralize and privatize Pennsylvania Department of Transportation services.
\
The Ridge administration has hired 100 private businesses that are linked online with PennDot bureaus to provide instantaneous services such as auto registration and driver's license renewal. In addition, mail registration renewals have speeded up from 3.7 days in 1995-96 to 2.3 days in 1997-98, according to PennDot.
\
50. Shorten the length of work zones on highways.
\
No specific initiative.

"
614," Once upon a time, 28-year-old Republican unknown Melissa Hart saved state Senate Republicans from dreaded minority status when she won a Senate seat they had all but written off, preserving GOP control by one vote.\ Flash forward to 10 years later.\ It's deja vu for the hard-charging, conservative lawyer from Bradford Woods, except that this time, the stakes are just maybe a wee bit higher: As the GOP candidate for the congressional 4th District, Hart may hold the fate of the U.S. House of Representatives in her hands, which the Republicans control by six votes. Her particular race, in fact, has been described by national Republicans as the most important in the country.\ Once again, Hart may find herself riding in on a white horse to save her party.\ ""That would be ironic, wouldn't it?"" Hart noted cheerfully as she loped along a street in Penn Township one gloriously sunny Saturday to knock on doors, undeterred either by the street's steep grade or the fact that this particular neighborhood of modest, sixties-era ranch style homes is predominantly Democrat. Only slightly winded, she bounded across a manicured green lawn when a homeowner invited her to give him some literature. (""Otherwise, I stay on the sidewalks. They don't like it if we step on the grass."")\ ""I know who you are,"" said the would-be voter while her little dog yapped at Hart's ankles. ""I see you on TV.""\ ""I hope you watch only the happy stuff,"" Hart responded in a soft- spoken, almost guileless voice. ""My opponent is running these nasty terrible ads against me.""\ She is being a bit disingenuous. While she has eschewed personal attacks against her opponent, Terry Van Horne, the National Republican Congressional Committee is matching the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in negative television advertising.\ In fact, Hart is not one to shy away from confrontation. Initially, her confident, almost impatient manner was off-putting to Republican Party elders in the state Legislature, who expected the freshman senator to shush up even though she'd saved their collective hides. And while after much lobbying she eventually landed the chairmanship of the Senate Finance Committee, she was never able to crack the all-male Republican leadership.\ And that, she says today, is one of the reasons she decided to run for Congress.\ But not the only reason.\ In Melissa Hart's world view, in fact, people are either in politics for ""the right reasons or the wrong reasons."" Hers is a conservative idealism that sees political power not as an end in itself but as a means to protect people from government's ill effects, while enabling those who can't help themselves to benefit. She says she stands up for traditional western values and a free marketplace.\ While she parts company with fellow conservative and good friend U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum on the issue of Social Security -- she opposes private accounts that would allow investing Social Security funds in the stock market -- she is firmly with the Republican right wing on most economic and social issues: anti-abortion, anti-gun control, anti-tax increases (even Gov. Tom Ridge's gas tax increase to fund road construction), pro-business and pro-economic development.\ And while Hart insists she's not anti-environment, citing her support of an initiative to preserve open space and the state's park system, the Conservation League of Pennsylvania rated her legislative record as ""zero.""\ Childhood\ Hart's childhood in McCandless could best be described as more ""Leave It To Beaver"" than ""Wonder Years,"" where respect for authority, not rebellion, was the order of the day. Her mom, Albina Simone Hart, stayed at home while her dad, Donald P. Hart, a research chemist, traveled frequently, often overseas, in his role as a manager in PPG Industries Inc.'s automotive coatings division. A son of coal miners, Don Hart was raised in a union Democrat household near South Fayette. But as the party drifted farther leftward during the 1960s and 1970s, he became a Republican.\ Loving but strict, Don Hart was a fervent believer in hard work and discipline, a message he transmitted to all his kids; when his daughter was in eighth grade, she penned an essay titled ""Why Ronald Reagan is a Patriot,"" because, she felt, ""He was really good at articulating the American dream.""\ It wasn't all work and no play. Hart loved participating behind the scenes in school dramatic productions, although as a child her clear, confident voice often got her tapped for a role onstage as narrator. She loved to call radio talk show hosts -- Jim Jeffries, Roy Fox, John Cigna. ""I remember she called me up one day in eighth grade and said, listen to me on the radio tonight,"" recalled Tracy Mueller, a childhood friend. ""And there she was, talking about how much she loved Sean Connery in `The Man Who Would Be King.' ""\ It was her father's unexpected death from a heart attack at 49 -- ""We went to school one morning and came back and he was gone,"" Hart said quietly -- that seems to have been the defining moment in her family's life. It is the first thing Hart's mother mentions when talking about her children.\ ""My daughter took it very hard,"" Albina Hart said. ""She was kind of withdrawn for a while. But I have responsible kids. They had to be, after their dad died."" Albina Hart, as feisty and gregarious as her daughter, was able to keep the family house but had to go back to work as a secretary in PPG's research library. It wasn't necessarily an easy job -- ""You try and work for Ph.Ds sometimes.""\ All three Hart kids worked their way through high school and college -- there were stints at McDonald's, and, later, through family connections, at PPG Industries, where Melissa spent summers in a flame-retardant uniform pumping solvents out of 55-gallon drums and delivering them to research labs.\ At Washington and Jefferson College, she majored in German and business and joined the Young Republicans, a group that would later be credited for helping her win her first Senate race. At law school, where she was in the middle of her class academically, she worked part time clerking for a law firm -- ""I'd come to school every day in a suit"" -- but realized early that she wouldn't be happy trying to climb the ladder at a big-name law firm.\ ""It's the corporate stiffness of the environment, I guess,"" she said. ""I like to be a little bit of a maverick. Reed Smith wouldn't be a good place for me.""\ Three years after graduating from the University of Pittsburgh Law School, she had figured out what would be a good place for her -- the Pennsylvania Senate. A steep increase in property taxes, and a sense that taxes were too high, had stirred voter discontent in the relatively affluent community of McCandless, and convinced her the time was right to challenge Democrat John Regoli, whose district included the North Hills but whose base was in Westmoreland County.\ ""Most people are motivated in some way by money. Often, the first thing people talk about when you ask them is their taxes. I've always been interested in civics and issues, but I never thought of running for office until a point in my life when I realized the money being taken from us wasn't being spent in an effective way.""\ She credits her win to a strong grass-roots effort. She went door to door; Regoli didn't. But no one knew the young lawyer from McCandless, and when she won, even her family was shocked.\ ""I had driven in from Ohio to console Melissa,"" said her brother, Terry Hart. ""I was floored. We all were.""\ Despite her greenhorn status, Hart plunged right in. She didn't hesitate to rock the boat her first year when she questioned the reconfirmation of state Secretary of Education Donald Carroll, whom she criticized for representing the ""status quo.""\ Carroll's reconfirmation had been pretty much considered a done deal, but Hart's refusal to go along and her ability to get 18 votes against him unnerved the Republican leadership.\ ""Melissa's aggressive, and I guess people aren't comfortable with that. When you're a freshman, you're expected to spend a certain amount of time paying your dues,"" said her Republican colleague, Sen. Mary Jo White of Clarion County.\ ""But when she came in here, remember, she didn't owe anybody anything and she had this great sense of independence. I think that when you're here for a while, though, you learn that the best way to do things is not always on the Senate floor.\ ""She's more willing to sit down and talk to you beforehand and ask, is there some way I can change this bill so you would like it better? She's matured tremendously.""\ Still, it was only due to the intervention of then-Sen. Mike Fisher (now the state attorney general), Hart says, that she was able to obtain the chairmanship of the Senate Finance Committee, a position she coveted because of her intense interest in tax reform. Leaders, anxious to protect her seat by keeping her away from controversy, had wanted her to take the safer spot as head of Aging and Youth; but ""Fisher spoke up for me and said, `She can handle it. She understands her district.' ""\ As the Finance Committee chairwoman, reducing taxes was her central goal, but her record has been mixed. She played a key role in reducing the state inheritance tax, but is the first to say she's dissatisfied with Act 50, the result of a years-long wrangle over tax reform in the 1990s.\ The law allows communities to reduce property taxes by implementing an earned income tax, although only three have done so. But the law falls short of what Hart wanted -- a broader menu of options for communities to choose from, most notably, reliance on a personal income tax, ""because if I'm a rich woman and making a lot of money on investment income, I would pay tax on that. If I wasn't, I'd pay a much lower tax. That's fairer.""\ She has been willing to work with moderates on some issues, as well. One of her first big legislative initiatives was a package of bills in 1991 to combat domestic violence, an issue that did not enjoy the same conservative support it does today. She also supported the Regional Renaissance Initiative, which voters soundly defeated, and then voted for public funding of stadiums.\ Her conservative allies seem to have forgiven her.\ ""Everybody's entitled to one mistake,"" said Sean Duffy, her former chief of staff and now director of the Commonwealth Foundation, a conservative think tank that strongly opposed both measures.\ Moving on\ Despite winning a third term in 1998, Hart barely lost a Republican leadership spot to Senate newcomer and longtime House member Jeffrey Piccola.\ It made the option of running for Ronald Klink's congressional seat more attractive.\ ""I can tell you honestly that I probably wouldn't be running for Congress now if that hadn't happened,"" Hart said. ""So there's a silver lining in all of this. I don't walk in lockstep, and some people like things the way they are. It's a comfort level thing, I guess. There are a lot of guys in the Senate and he'd been in the House a long time,"" she adds, her voice trailing off in still palpable disappointment.\ While her strong personality might have hindered her in Harrisburg, it may help her as a congressional candidate. Republicans hope that her youthful image and conservative voting record will project well in a predominantly blue-collar district that may have a 2-1 Democratic registration edge but is far less liberal than the national party on such issues as abortion and gun control.\ The district has never elected a woman or a Republican, but the former characteristic, at least, doesn't seem to be working against Hart, who is single and lives alone.\ ""She's really sharp and young, and she's done a good job,"" said one longtime Democratic voter, Debbie Roche, 45, of Ross, who was attending a woman's ""expo"" sponsored by Hart at the Community College of Allegheny County's North Campus.\ Convincing enough Democrats of that is Hart's challenge in the weeks ahead as the campaign intensifies and the potshots between the two candidates increase. But as she walked around the Skyview neighborhood of Penn Township that recent Saturday, Hart received a warm reception from many people.\ ""Anybody but Van Horne!"" one called out after her.\ But at several homes, Hart's campaign literature was accepted with not even so much as a thank you. At one house, a lawn sign for Ron Klink, the Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate, suggested that Republicans might not be welcome.\ ""Hey, let's go for it,"" Hart said, striding up to the house. The owner was friendly, and, it turned out, knew Hart's brother.\ ""We sold our old house to him,"" she told Hart. ""Get out!"" the candidate responded gleefully.\ ""Yeah, and Ron Klink used to live up there,"" the would-be voter added, pointing up over the hill. It was a small world, they agreed. But when Hart tried to make her pitch, she was politely cut off.\ ""We've seen you on TV,"" the homeowner said, flashing Hart a big smile. ""But we're going to vote Democratic."""
615,"
How many people, Chris Daggett wants to know, feel well represented by Republicans or Democrats in Trenton?
\
In a Bordentown crowd of a couple of dozen people, a few hands go up.
\
How many feel either party is addressing the issues facing the state? Even fewer hands.
\
Daggett says he, too, no longer believes either party will tackle the state's problems, which is why he is running for governor as an independent.
\
Daggett is new to the political game, but after a few months on the campaign trail, his pitch and delivery are growing more practiced and smooth. Trim and neatly groomed, Daggett, 59, looks the part of a candidate and engages the crowd on this warm August night with the ease of a college professor.
\
The Bernards Township resident talks about his background - growing up in New Jersey, his doctorate in education, his years leading the state Department of Environmental Protection and the local region of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, his work in brownfields remediation, volunteering for nonprofits.
\
He also offers some alarming numbers New Jersey's elected officials rarely talk about: the more than $30 billion unfunded liability in government employees' pensions. The $60 billion to $70 billion in unfunded health-care liabilities. A state budget shortfall next year of between $4 billion and $10 billion, in a budget of $29 billion.
\
Other candidates talk about how they would solve the state's fiscal problems by cutting expenses. But do the math, Daggett says, and you would need to cut at least 80,000 state workers to close the budget gap. The state doesn't even have that many employees, which means some people would have to be fired twice.
\
The audience laughs.
\
Soon Daggett opens up the floor to questions. A woman stands up and asks what many voters are asking: As an independent candidate facing narrow odds, what, exactly, is his strategy to win? Can he win?
\
Daggett's objectives
\
Conventional wisdom is that Daggett doesn't have a chance - even though he is the first independent in state history to raise enough money to qualify for public matching funds, and in time to earn a seat at the two official debates. He has also won the endorsement of the state's largest newspaper, the Newark Star-Ledger.
\
Daggett contemplated races in 2001 and 2005, only to be talked out of running by various friends, who thought he couldn't win.
\
This time, he is not listening to them.
\
In Democratic Gov. Corzine, Daggett sees a surprisingly unpopular incumbent. In Republican Christopher J. Christie, he sees a one-issue candidate with no state government experience, whose lead has withered under the barrage of Corzine's negative ads.
\
Neither, Daggett contends, has laid out a clear plan about how he would govern New Jersey.
\
Add to that a debilitated economy, generous public-financing laws, and a public fed up with partisan bickering, and Daggett believes the job is within his grasp.
\
So yes, he tells the woman, he can win this. His first strategy: Get one more vote than the next guy. In a winner-take-all election, just 34 percent could win the race.
\
Daggett has momentum on his side, but still lags considerably behind the two front-runners. According to a Rutgers-Eagleton Poll released yesterday, 39 percent of likely voters support Corzine to Christie's 36 percent and Daggett's 20 percent, with a margin of error of 4.1 percentage points. It was Daggett's best showing in a major public opinion poll.
\
Daggett's underdog status is reflected in his fund-raising as well, although it, too, is on the upswing; as of Oct. 7, Corzine had raised $16.8 million to Christie's $9.6 million and Daggett's $890,000. Christie and Daggett, who are receiving public funds, are limited to spending $11 million. Daggett estimates his net worth at $1.5 million - more than most state residents, but not enough to do much good in an election.
\
To voters who are won over, Daggett is refreshing - charming, even. His quirky first television ad, featuring Corzine and Christie impersonators, is the work of political consultant Bill Hillsman, whose spots helped Paul Wellstone and Jesse Ventura win.
\
But to others, Daggett's belief that he can win is just proof he's politically naive.
\
Daggett pitches himself as an alternative to politics as usual, and throughout his campaign he has offered one jaw-dropping idea after another.
\
He proposes banning tenure for teachers, who make up one of the state's most politically powerful unions. He admits that to fix the state's transportation network, he may need to raise the gas tax. He wants to cut property taxes by expanding the sales tax. He has told state employee union leaders they need to cut costs along with everybody else.
\
A longtime Republican - he keeps two framed photos of himself with then-Vice President George H.W. Bush in his living room and persuaded his wife, a Democratic National Committee worker in college, to vote for Ronald Reagan - Daggett leans left on social issues such as abortion, stem-cell research, and gay marriage. He says that he changed his party registration earlier this year from Republican to unaffiliated, but that he has long felt unhappy with the Republican Party. He didn't even bother, he says, to seek party leaders' endorsement.
\
""I got to the point that I was disillusioned. I just think that they've demonstrated the same inability to . . . step up.""
\
Both parties, he says, are too stuck in ideology and too focused on special interests.
\
If elected, Daggett says he would find the best people to solve the state's problems, regardless of party affiliation.
\
Political beginnings
\
Daggett was introduced to politics in 1976, when he was home for the holidays from graduate school and a friend asked if he would like to join a political campaign.
\
By semester's end, he had finished his dissertation and moved back to New Jersey to work on Raymond Bateman's gubernatorial campaign, which was ultimately unsuccessful.
\
Four years later, Daggett worked on the campaign of Thomas H. Kean. When Kean was elected governor in 1981, he named Daggett his deputy chief of staff, overseeing education and the environment.
\
After a shake-up at the federal Environmental Protection Agency, Daggett was appointed administrator for the region covering New Jersey, New York, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.
\
Daggett dived into his new job. Fearing he didn't know enough about the environmental issues, he worked 16-hour days to catch up.
\
""I just buried myself in the place,"" Daggett says, ""and just learned it.""
\
Daggett said he read every document at the EPA and DEP he was asked to sign, thousands of pages in all.
\
""Those are the kinds of expectations he has of himself,"" said Daggett's wife, Bea.
\
At the EPA, Daggett's first big decision was a whopper. For more than a decade, developers had tried to push forward a multibillion-dollar project known as Westway. The project involved filling in about 250 acres of the Hudson River to build a highway along the west side of Manhattan. On top would sit commercial and residential development and parks.
\
Elected officials from Manhattan to the White House supported the plan, along with businesses and labor unions, but Daggett did his best to ignore the politics swirling around him.
\
""I was so focused on trying to do what was the right thing,"" Daggett says. ""It just wasn't on my radar screen.""
\
Daggett realized the project could irreparably harm the striped bass population, which meant it should not be built. The law was clear and he was going to follow it.
\
At one point, a top EPA administrator in Washington wrote a memo saying it didn't appear that Daggett had ""gotten the message"" that he was expected to back down.
\
On Jan. 21, 1985, Daggett signed a letter recommending that Westway not be allowed. Out of courtesy, he faxed the letter to Alfonse D'Amato, then the senior senator from New York and a major proponent of the project.
\
Five minutes later, Daggett's office phone rang.
\
""Let's just say he wasn't happy,"" Daggett recalls. The 34-year-old was polite, but unruffled.
\
""After yelling at me for some time with a lot of four-letter words mixed in, I just told him I disagreed with him and I hung up.""
\
The phone call wasn't the end of the Westway saga, but eventually Daggett's decision was upheld.
\
""We were vindicated in our actions and I felt like I got a good lesson again in doing what I believed was right,"" Daggett says.
\
Marcy Benstock, one of the leading environmental advocates who fought the Westway project, said Daggett ""deserves enormous credit for refusing to back down,"" saying that his actions ""helped save a national habitat of extraordinary national importance.""
\
Daggett later left the EPA to join Kean's cabinet as DEP commissioner, where he tackled issues such as ocean pollution and toxic waste.
\
Saul Cooperman, who served as Kean's education commissioner, calls Daggett's integrity ""unimpeachable.""
\
""This is the only time in my life I've ever supported a candidate,"" says Cooperman, 75.
\
Daggett's work at the EPA and DEP have been widely praised by environmentalists, including the Sierra Club, which endorsed him this year in the gubernatorial race.
\
Today, Daggett owns a firm that acquires and redevelops contaminated properties. He also works as an environmental consultant at J.M. Sorge, of Somerville.
\
Daggett calls the environment ""an integral part of our daily lives and our existence."" Clean water and clean air are crucial to public health, he adds, and important to a region's economic viability.
\
But Daggett has environmental critics, too. Joe Morris, an organizer for Interfaith Community Organization, which has worked to try to clean up chromium-contaminated sites in Hudson County, said he was disappointed that Daggett had not done more to try to force a polluter to clean up a property Daggett had purchased with some partners.
\
""We're very disappointed that as a property owner he's missed his . . . opportunity to drive a cleanup of this critical site in Jersey City,"" Morris said.
\
Daggett said he would like to see the property cleaned up quickly so he can redevelop it, but that he cannot force the polluters into action. ""The leverage we have is the court of public opinion, where we shout, scream, push, cajole, plead, do all the other things to get them to meet the timetables, but we don't have any actual leverage.""
\
At the debate
\
At the first televised debate, on Oct. 1, Daggett was sandwiched between Corzine, to the viewers' left, and Christie, to the right. Daggett appeared nervous at first but quickly found his footing.
\
Corzine and Christie appeared at turns angry and defensive during the 90-minute debate. Daggett, poised and articulate, delivered a performance worthy of a political veteran. And unlike his opponents, he looked like he was having fun.
\
At one point, the moderator asked if Daggett was really in the race to win.
\
Yes, he said. ""I believe people are willing to hear the truth finally about what's going on in New Jersey and looking for someone who will give them a responsible set of alternatives for how we're going to deal with the issues facing us.""
\
""I think people will gravitate toward me, and they are.""
\
Christie and Corzine both followed up by complimenting their opponent.
\
""Sounds like both these two guys,"" Daggett deadpanned, ""might vote for me.""

616,"
As a Republican governor, Thomas H. Kean has never been at home in New Jersey's Democratic-controlled legislature. Nevertheless, in accordance with the state constitution, he will enter the General Assembly chamber Tuesday to deliver his annual message to a joint session of the legislature.
\
In keeping with tradition, the governor will examine the health of the state and will no doubt issue an upbeat diagnosis - something along the lines of ""the state of the state is good.""
\
In comparison with the condition of other Rust Belt states, that assessment is basically true. New Jersey's economy is in pretty good shape, and unemployment is low. The state budget surplus already is about a half- billion dollars and growing, because of a recent upsurge in the economy and an increase in revenues from the sales and state income taxes, which were boosted in 1982 to cope with the effects of the recession.
\
ANOTHER ISSUE
\
None of this will be a great revelation to Kean's audience or to the residents of New Jersey, who can watch the speech live at 2 p.m. or rebroadcast at 10 p.m. on the New Jersey Public Network. Whatever Kean says, the minds of the members of the Senate and General Assembly will probably
\
drift to another issue: the status of Kean's political ambitions and the 1985 gubernatorial race.
\
Some legislators, particularly Democrats, will interpret the governor's speech as the opening move of his gubernatorial campaign, even though the Essex County politician has yet to announce whether he will seek a second term.
\
Barring major complications, Democrats as well as observers in Kean's party are dead sure he'll run. ""He's going to run. All the inside signs tell,"" said Raymond Bateman, a powerful lobbyist, former Republican state senator and one-time gubernatorial candidate.
\
STRONG INDICATIONS
\
Indeed, circumstantial evidence that Kean will seek a second term is strong. Shortly before Christmas, the governor attended a statewide building- trades luncheon at which union leaders representing 125,000 workers urged him to seek a second term. The event offered evidence for one of the two prerequisites Kean says he has for a decision to run for re-election: The electorate must urge him to seek renomination and the advice of his family, friends and close associates must be in favor of his running again.
\
The statehouse grapevine has been sagging under the weight of speculation about when Kean will announce his campaign and who will run it - not whether he will run, which is by now taken as a given.
\
Kean's speech, which he can use to set the tone of his campaign, will not be the Democratic Party's favorite way to start the New Year. Even though the election is 10 months away, the prevailing political climate - that is, the economy and public perception - appears to favor Kean.
\
""It's a race that would be very difficult for the Democrats to win at the present moment, and it might even be difficult for Kean to lose, given his track record,"" said Alan Rosenthal, a professor of politics at Rutgers University. ""But politics is a very unpredictable business.""
\
Public and private polls show that the 49-year-old chief executive is very popular with most of New Jersey's 7.3 million residents. A WCAU-TV exit poll taken the day of the presidential election found that 77 percent of those surveyed thought Kean was doing an excellent or good job as governor.
\
The poll - of 1,209 voters at 15 polling places with the 609 telephone area code - found that 24 percent of the respondents thought Kean was doing an excellent job and 53 percent rated his performance as good. He was given an unfavorable rating from 23 percent, with 19 percent finding his performance ''not very good"" and 4 percent calling it ""poor.""
\
Regardless of party affiliation or their rating of his performance, people describe Kean as sincere, likable and friendly. Kean's predecessor, Democrat Brendan T. Byrne, received grudging respect for his accomplishments during his two terms, but many voters disliked his personality.
\
Kean spends a lot of time with the people who voted or could vote for him - on the road, attending ribbon-cuttings, giving speeches, signing proclamations and holding town meetings. ""If you could see his schedule, it's horrendous,"" said state Republican Party Chairman Frank Holman.
\
Holman, who said it would be an oversight to dismiss the political significance of Kean's personality or the good will created by his efforts to promote the state, also gave the governor credit for making compromises with the Democratic-controlled legislature. Holman said it was ""a testimony to the governor that he has been able to get as much as he's (gotten) with an alien legislature.""
\
With Kean at the top of the Republican ticket, Holman said, the party has a good shot at using Kean's coattails to take control of the General Assembly, where all 80 seats will be up for grabs this year.
\
Still, Kean's supporters are not sitting back and counting solely on his popularity, good will or anything else to keep the governor in office for four more years. ""Politics is extremely volatile,"" said Assemblyman Richard Zimmer (R., Hunterdon), counsel to the Friends of Governor Tom Kean, a campaign fund-raising committee. ""But right now, things look so promising.""
\
Kean is considered a moderate Republican, not a dyed-in-the-wool Reaganaut, Zimmer said, and that perception has made people see him as somewhat independent. When the U.S. Department of the Interior proposed oil drilling off the state's coast, for instance, Kean sued the Reagan administration to protect the state's fishing industry and the environment. ''The public gives him credit for a good working relationship with the President, but recognizing who pays his salary,"" Zimmer said.
\
Although the scope of Kean's personal popularity is easy enough to measure, the reasons behind it are harder to identify. ""Kean has a very positive but soft image,"" said Cliff Zukin, a Rutgers professor and director of the statewide Eagleton/Star-Ledger Poll. ""By that, I mean people don't know very much about him.""
\
Nevertheless, Zukin said, ""people didn't like Brendan Byrne. Even if the public doesn't know Tom Kean, we know we like him better than Byrne.""
\
There appears to be no such consensus among observers on his record as an executive. Academics, in particular, give him credit for a smattering of substantial, but not grand, accomplishments.
\
These include relieving prison overcrowding by moving to build 5,000 prison cells, phasing out the corporate net worth tax, creating urban enterprise zones that offer incentives for new businesses to settle in the state's most economically depressed cities and successfully backing a referendum that allows the state to dedicate a share of gas-tax revenue annually to upgrade the state's transportation system.
\
Also cited are Kean's winning of voter approval for a multimillion-dollar high-technology bond issue, convening of a commission that reformed the deficit-ridden unemployment insurance fund, implementation of a program to combat drunken driving, overhaul of public education testing and teacher requirements and initiation of a program to send government managers back to
\
college classrooms to improve their skills.
\
Rosenthal, the Rutgers politics professor who studies political trends in New Jersey, said that, by contrast, Kean's predecessor initiated such sweeping programs as casino gambling, the Pinelands Preservation Act, the state income tax and creation of the Department of Public Advocate. ""Byrne, for all of what would seem to be pettiness, had vision,"" Rosenthal said.
\
The Kean administration, Rosenthal said, ""is certainly competent. It does move forward. But I don't think you have . . . dramatic initiatives. Maybe in a sense, (it's) more administrative, more managerial.""
\
That is exactly the way Kean see his administration: managerial. ""The fact that we've been able to bring management efficiency to state government, I'm very proud of,"" Kean said in an interview last week. ""Some of the things are little noticed."" Those seldom-noticed programs include the project to send managers to Rutgers for courses to improve their skills and the computerization of state agencies.
\
Kean said his accomplishments are quantifiable, not hazy. ""We can dramatically show you 5,000 new prison beds created at the end of four years so that criminals are in prison rather than running around in the streets or let go by judges,"" he said.
\
Kean predicted that by the end of 1985, the state's multimillion dollar unemployment-compensation-fund debt would be paid in full to the federal government. The repayment would result in a reduction in the amount employers and workers contribute to the fund. Kean said, ""That's the kind of thing that would not come to somebody's mind, and yet it's rather dramatic.""
\
The governor said people may not remember too many specifics about a governor's impact on the state. ""You have an overall record, people get a feeling about that,"" he said.
\
Kean cited his most important accomplishments as the enactment of the Transportation Trust Fund, a four-year $3.3 billion program to improve highways and mass transit; a reduction in prison overcrowding; reforms in public education, and increased emphasis on environmental protection and economic development. The last point, he said, is a continuing priority.
\
""The general orientation that I have as far as the use of money is going to stay exactly the same . . .,"" Kean said. ""Those priorities are jobs . . ., and to me that's a large category that includes educating people, which includes preserving an environment people want to live in when they come to New Jersey. ""
\
Kean said that when he took office, it was not only the recession, but New Jersey's inability to compete for jobs with other Northeastern states, that made the state's economy sluggish. ""Our per-capita income in the state was not rising as fast as the rest of the country's,"" Kean said. ""Our job creation was behind the Northeast and the rest of the country.""
\
Now, Kean said, both the job and personal income pictures are improving.
\
The major issues Kean has chosen to concentrate on - improving the transportation system, the public school system and higher education, and economic development - are important but not controversial enough to expose him to much political risk or transform major interest groups into political enemies.
\
""The governor has come across as a sincere, concerned and thoughtful leader,"" said Richard Roper, who heads the Council on New Jersey Affairs at Princeton. ""He tends to focus his attention on those issues where it's not really that risky to push forward.""
\
For instance, Roper said, Kean has not addressed the Mount Laurel court decisions, which require growing communities to zone for housing for low- and moderate-income residents. The decisions are a topic ""the governor approaches cautiously"" and ""avoids getting out front on,"" Roper said.
\
Kean said he supported legislation to put planning power in the hands of elected officials. The legislation, which Kean predicted would be adopted this year, would create a planning council to determine where housing is needed in the state and to supervise efforts of growing communities to determine their share of low- and moderate-income housing.
\
The governor said he supported the concept of the Mount Laurel I decision, which struck down zoning ordinances that excluded low- and moderate-income people from many suburban areas.
\
But he said he did not agree with a provision of the Mount Laurel II decision, which allows a builder to sue a town for the right to construct low- or moderate-priced housing. Under the provision, a developer who wins a suit can stretch zoning density limits, using profits from market-priced units to subsidize the low-cost housing.
\
Kean said that would encourage the development of more housing than towns would need and would lead to a scale of development that would be ''environmentally unsound."" The provision, he said, would not result in a sizable increase in housing within the reach of low- and moderate-income people.
\
Where Republicans see caution and deliberation in the Kean administration, Democrats say they see vacillation and weakness. But no matter what they say, many Democrats wonder whether their gubernatorial candidate will be able to penetrate Kean's popularity and turn the campaign toward issues the party wants to raise.
\
""Issues don't seem to be in,"" said Steve Moses, a Bergen County lawyer and a leading supporter of Walter F. Mondale last year. ""People seem to be
\
satisfied to stand still.""
\
At the moment, the only declared Democratic candidate for governor is Stephen Wiley, a lawyer and former state senator from Morris County.
\
The five other Democrats said to be seriously considering a run are South Jersey congressman James J. Florio, who lost the 1981 gubernatorial race to Kean by 1,797 votes, or less than one-twelfth of 1 percent of the vote; state Sen. John F. Russo of Ocean County; Robert J. Del Tufo, a Morris County lawyer who was a U.S. attorney for New Jersey and a member of the State Commission of Investigation; Newark Mayor Kenneth A. Gibson of Essex County, and Essex County Executive Peter Shapiro.
\
Democratic Party Chairman James Maloney said whoever wins the party nomination in the June 4 gubernatorial primary will have to establish an identity with the voters before hammering away at issues. The Democratic gubernatorial challenger ""who first establishes a credibility and comfort factor with the public can get to the issues,"" Maloney said.
\
Observers of all stripes - politicians in both parties and academics - say the only obvious Achilles heel for Kean could be the economy. If a recession occurs, a sharp decline in the economy could hurt Kean's standing or lead voters to re-examine their evaluation of him. So far, economists who advise the state government see slow growth but no recession.
\
""If the economy falls out of bed, it not only hurts our New Jersey fiscal situation, it will make people feel less fondly of the Republican Party,"" said Zimmer, counsel to the Kean fund-raising committee.
\
A downturn, even if Reagan remains popular, could have an adverse effect on Kean, Zimmer said. ""We're at the mercy of a lot of circumstances you can't control. That's the way it always is in politics.""

"
617,"FOR THE RECORD - (Published Friday, April 17, 1992) \Rosse should have been included.\ Here was the problem: What games could the children play during an afternoon Earth Day program the Lehigh Valley Greens were helping organize for April 25 in Allentown's Lehigh Parkway?\ The other events -- videos about community-organizing successes; poetry readings and storytelling; Arabic flute music; a Cherokee purification ceremony -- were already arranged for the program at the Lenni Lenape Museum along Fish Hatchery Road. But what to do especially for the children?\ The Lehigh Valley Greens' informal steering committee, meeting in a third-floor room at the Gafran Gallery in Bethlehem, pondered the question.\ Arati Shah-Yukich suggested a game of tag in which the children would form a chain. The first child tags someone, then the two hold hands and search for a third. The game continues until all the children are part of the chain.\ ""It's a great game, especially with lots of children and a large playground,"" Shah-Yukich said. ""The children realize they can only run as fast as the slowest child.""\ The game emphasizes issues of cooperation, consensus and community, which are some of the interconnected ideals of the Green movement itself.\ The other six members of the steering committee expressed their approval.\ Someone else suggested borrowing a large ball, about the size of a weather balloon, from the Allentown Parks Department. The ball's outside surface has drawings suggesting the different lands of the Earth.\ A related suggestion was offered: the children could play a game with the ball, perhaps soccer.\ But Alan Streater, a steering committee member who is also a physics professor at Lehigh University, had a problem with groups of children kicking around a large ball-shaped Earth.\ ""Isn't that what we're doing already, kicking around the Earth?"" Streater asked.\ The others laughed quietly or nodded. Bad idea, they said.\ The meeting moved on to other business: did the local Greens group want to plant trees around the Bethlehem recycling center on Illicks Mill Road? The consensus was yes.\ The group agreed to apply to the America the Beautiful Urban Forestry Program for a $5,000 grant, the maximum amount, and perhaps enlist the help of area school students, who would be paid for helping plant the trees.\ ""We'd better get moving on this,"" steering committee member and local environmental activist Joris Rosse added. ""The planting season is upon us.""\ Everyone agreed. Decision-making by consensus, one of the hallmarks of the Green movement, seemed to be working.\ Things have not always run as smoothly for the local group, which formed in March 1991, largely in response to the United States' involvement in the Persian Gulf War. There are about 60 paid members of the Lehigh Valley Greens, and another 60 who have expressed interest but have not yet paid the $5 membership fee, the local Greens say.\ The informal steering committee is a diverse bunch; indeed, most everything about the Green movement is informal and anti- bureaucratic.\ Greta Browne, a psychotherapist, led the meeting. Rosse, who is also president of SAVE, a local environmental group that this month successfully challenged a state permit for Keystone Cement Co., Bath, to burn two types of toxic waste, sat on a couch next to Browne.\ Seated in a circle of chairs were the other members: Shah-Yukich, a Harvard University-trained radiologist who left the profession to work with environmental groups; Streater, an avid bicyclist with interests in alternative transportation; Guy Gray, an anti-war activist and member of Lepoco, an area peace group; Jean Pearson, a poet, writer and environmental activist; Bob Gumlock, a German teacher with the Easton Area School District, and John Koch, a former Morning Call reporter who has taught writing courses at area community colleges.\ The Green movement first received international attention when the party won 5.6 percent of the vote in the former West Germany's national election in 1983. Because the party received more than 5 percent of the national vote, it was allotted a proportional share of seats (27 out of 498) in the national parliament, or Bundestag.\ The Green success in West Germany also served as a spark for the U.S. Green movement. U.S. Greens met in St. Paul, Minn., in 1984 and adopted the so-called ""four pillars"" of the Green movement in West Germany: ecological wisdom, social responsibility, nonviolence and grass-roots democracy.\ The U.S. Greens added six other points: community economics, respect for diversity, post-patriarchal values, decentralization, global responsibility and future focus/sustainability. Together, the 10 are referred to by U.S. Greens as the ""key values.""\ Although the ""Green"" name has become synonymous with environmental concerns, U.S. Greens say they are more than an environmental party. Decentralization and democracy are also part of the Green program.\ Both in Germany and in the United States, Greens believe a return of economic and political power to the community would boost democracy and help save the environment.\ The U.S. Greens spent most of the 1980s forming a national organization and, at the same time, wrestling with an idea: should they be a movement or should they become a third force, a political party?\ The debate among the 385 local Green groups affiliated with the national Green organization continues, and some believe the U.S. Greens are at an important juncture.\ The movement/political party issue emerged when the U.S. Greens held a national meeting in Elkins, W. Va., in 1991, the movement's fourth such convention. One result of the meeting was that the national Greens agreed to call themselves Greens/Green Party U.S.A., a name that, by design, includes references to both movement and politics.\ Across the United States, three dozen Greens hold elected office on the municipal or county level, according to Howard Hawkins, who is one of seven members on the Greens/Green Party U.S.A. coordinating committee.\ Greens/Green Party U.S.A. has ballot status in Alaska and California.\ The movement/party issue also came up during what was the first statewide Green convention, which was held Jan. 25 at Rosse's house, a barn converted into a home along Mill Road near Hellertown.\ At the meeting, several -- but, as it turns out, not all -- state Green groups affiliated with the national organization sent representatives. (Some state Green organizations are not formally associated with the national organization.)\ The main issue was whether the state Greens should form a political party. A second question, related to the first, was whether the state Greens should support Lee Richards, a 39-year-old cabinetmaker and Green activist from Columbia Crossroads, Bradford County, who had announced his intention six months earlier to run against U.S. Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa.\ The debate lasted the entire day. When it became clear that no consensus could be reached, the Green chapter representatives voted. The result was 41-19 in favor of a party and Richards' candidacy -- just one vote more than the required two-thirds majority.\ But the debate at Rosse's house was nothing like the firestorm that followed the endorsement announcement.\ ""What I was hearing back was discord, not from one or two people, but what was going on was that Green groups, getting together for a regular meeting, were not able to function,"" Richards said recently from his home. ""Some people were upset to the point of shouting matches. People were feeling excluded from the process.""\ ""It was really a confusing mess,"" Richards added, his voice betraying some frustration. ""When I started thinking about the campaign, I identified a whole list of goals my campaign would accomplish. One of them was to unify the Greens of the state, give them all some sort of common goal. When I found out about all the uproar and discord, it was obvious that my campaign was having an opposite effect.""\ Sixteen days after the Richards endorsement, he withdrew from the campaign, which, to date, represents the highest elected position in the United States a Green has sought.\ To some, the Richards situation is one example of the split among Greens.\ The so-called movement faction of the party wants to concentrate on grass-roots, issue-oriented projects. This faction believes that a political party will emerge from local movement activities.\ By contrast, the party faction wants to advance Green ideals in the political arena by running Green candidates for office.\ John C. Rensenbrink, a political-science professor and researcher at Bowdoin College, Maine, who wrote ""The Greens and the Politics of Transformation,"" (R.& E. Miles; $14.95; 306 pp.), first noticed the split during a national convention of Greens he attended in Eugene, Ore., in 1989. Rensenbrink is an active member of the Merrymeeting Greens of Maine, one of several Green organizations in the state.\ ""There is a part of the (Green) movement that is opposed to party formation,"" Rensenbrink said in an interview. ""They are trying to prevent it, whereas the people interested in party politics were not seeking to stop the movement people. This is where the problem is. There seems to be a dogmatism on the part of the nonparty people.""\ Said the Lehigh Valley Greens' Streater: ""The movement people are more cynical in that they can't see the system supporting a change.""\ Streater sees the need for both politics and movement in the Greens.\ Rensenbrink proposed that the Greens/Green Party U.S.A. form a separate political party at the 1991 Elkins meeting, but was challenged, in part, by other factions in the Greens.\ But Hawkins, the national Green spokesman, believes talk of a division among Greens is ""overblown,"" and says the political party must come from within the movement. A separate political wing, the kind Rensenbrink was suggesting, would produce political candidates who are not accountable to the membership, Hawkins contended.\ In some ways, this debate reflects a situation that happened in the Green movement in the now-unified Germany, which saw its representation in the unified Bundestag drop to 8 seats from 48, in part because of infighting among the Greens.\ ""I think many of us feel that they lost their roots,"" Hawkins said of the German Greens. ""They started out as an alternative to the Social Democratic Party, which gave lip service to programs for the people and the environment, but then cut deals with the conservative parties. They started out opposing the old system and ended up running it.""\ The U.S. Green movement appears to be avoiding some of the pitfalls of the European Greens. People who hold national positions resign after two or three years, allowing someone else to take their places. Jim Richmond, who resigned last month as coordinator of the U.S. Greens' information clearinghouse (P.O. Box 30208, Kansas City, Mo. 64112), said, ""We have a principle of rotating leadership. No one makes a career out of being a leader or being on staff.""\ Still, problems can arise. The politics/movement debate among the local Greens grew so intense that one of the local group's founders, Howard Davidson, withdrew as a leader of the group.\ ""I thought that we needed a voice in the electoral area, somebody who could speak for all these (movement-oriented) groups in the electoral process,"" Davidson said recently. Many activist groups have non-profit tax status which prevents them from engaging in electoral politics.\ ""But we couldn't go forward,"" Davidson said. ""There seemed to be endless political debate, which I actually got bored with. I thought we needed to do something positive, to get moving."" Davidson wants to continue working with the local Greens, but doesn't want to get involved in the group's policy debates or internal politics.\ At the group's regular monthly meeting April 1, they pondered another question: Should the local Greens support candidates in the upcoming primary election?\ The question was a delicate one, so much so that a reporter attending the meeting was asked to leave so the members could freely debate the question.\ After what several participants said was a heated debate, the local Greens decided to endorse Democrat Jerry Brown for President. They also agreed to look into the possibility of supporting Lynn Yeakel, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate seat held by Specter.\ The endorsement is unusual in that neither the national Greens nor, significantly, the active, generally well-organized California Greens, with more than 100,000 registered voters, are supporting Brown, a former California governor.\ ""I think it is a bad idea,"" says Hawkins when told of the local Greens' endorsement of Brown. ""I think we need an alternative to the Democratic and Republican parties. We need a party of the people. Jerry Brown is just one guy with an 800 number. And given his history, he's switched on a lot of issues. ... You can always find a lesser evil. Mussolini was probably a lesser evil than Hitler.""\ Among local Greens, there is debate about Brown. Davidson, for one, supports Brown but questioned his proposed 13 percent flat-tax plan. Streater believes Brown's tax plan would eliminate the gas tax, which Streater sees as a useful tool.\ Others support Brown. ""Listening to Brown, I get a sense that he is addressing the issues in the same way we are,"" says Browne, who wore a ""Brown For President"" button on her sweater at the monthly meeting.\ ""It's a gamble,"" Rosse says of the Brown endorsement. ""Will we lose our purity or our depth of ecological commitment? But there is also a feeling that (Greens) are moving too slowly. Time is running out to save the liveability of the planet."""

This is a transcript of Arizona Sen. John's McCain's interview Tuesday (July 8, 2008) with Trib editors and reporters.
\
McCain: ... we've been talking about the economy a lot. And I am convinced, and by the way we have five Nobel Laureates and 200, 300 economists who think that we have a viable proposal that has to do with job creation, that has to do with keeping taxes low, with health -- affordable and available health care, and to making sure that our economy can recover in a robust fashion. Spending in my view is the major contributor to a lot of the economic difficulties we have today. We have allowed spending to get completely out of control. The size of spending has increased by some 40 percent, the greatest increase in ""discretionary spending."" The greatest increase in size of government since the Great Society. And we therefore ran up deficits and even though revenue increased as a result of tax cuts, it had no -- could not keep up with the spending increases. The symbolic aspect of this of course and very important aspect of it is the corruption of out of control spending. I noticed there is a poll today that showed the approval rating for the first time ever in single digits, approval rating of Congress. I have not met the 9 percent lately that approve of Congress, so we are gridlocked, we are -- the housing bill up before the United States Senate, with the housing problem that we have today, which by the way I have some problems with that housing bill, but it's better than doing nothing, and the home ownership bill.
\
... two things Congress never misses, that's a pay raise and recesses, no matter what the situation is. So I'll be glad to talk to you about the economy and the economy and the economy, and home ownership and lower taxes and if you want somebody to raise taxes, I'm not your guy. I'm not your candidate. And I believe that raising taxes at this particular time in history could do very great damage.
\
Finally, I'd just like to say a word about -- I'll just stop there with saying we've got to restrain spending, we've got to restrain the growth of government, we have to keep taxes low and we can restore this economy and we can have a strong economy again. And a lot of it has to do with green technologies and achieving oil independence. We are watching probably the greatest transfer of wealth perhaps in history from the United States of America to the Middle East and other oil producing countries, $(400) or $500 billion. That has a dramatic and significant impact on our economy, on our foreign debts, on the whole -- everything that affects Americans. Lowest-income Americans are suffering the worst as a result of an increase in the cost of a barrel of oil because they drive the oldest cars and they usually have to drive the furthest. So it's a national security issue, it's an environmental issue, and it's an economic issue. And we have to be on the path to independence of imported oil, and I'll be glad to talk with you about how we do that with green technologies, with automobiles that will go 100 or 200 miles on a battery, on flex fuels, on hydrogen, on all of the innovation and technology that American can be motivated to move forward on. And it has to be a national mission that we have to embark on. With that I'd like to answer or any questions or comments you have.
\
Trib: How do we change the culture of energy dependence? How do we get people to buy into all these things that they are -- you know, it's a total culture change to talk about hydrogen, to talk about electric cars, to talk about all those things. How do you do it?
\
McCain: Well, a change to a large degree is taking place right now, people have stopped buying SUVs, people have stopped doing a lot of the things that consume energy. We are seeing this in places as diverse as Las Vegas where Americans decide they can't afford a plane ticket to go there. Most -- a lot of experts thought the economy of Las Vegas was immune to any economic ups and downs -- now, we are seeing that. We are seeing it at Disney World, we are seeing it across America in consumer spending. When you are paying $4 I was in Santa Barbara, California, and they are paying $5 for a gallon of gas, and you don't take that extra trip to the store, you don't buy the extra whatever it is, and it is affecting us. And it is affecting Americans' behavior. And we saw some of this in the '70s during the oil embargo. Some of us around here remember those days. And we are certainly seeing it in the marketplace as far as the sale of high energy consumption products. I think ... the culture is being changed by the impact in the pocketbook, but second of all we have to call Americans to the mission. It's ... something that Americans will respond to. When Jack Kennedy said we would go to the moon, we did it in less time than he predicted. And so ... I'm confident that unfortunately the economic circumstances are dictating it, but also Americans I think are ready, especially from the national security side.
\
Trib: Senator, you talked a lot about clean coal and using coal, and the other day Sen. Reid made a comment that coal was dirty and made us sick, and I wonder if you think you see that kind of attitude prevalent within the Senate, or what kind of comment do you have with something like that?
\
McCain: Well, there's no doubt that coal is a large emitter of what we don't like. But the fact is that we are developing clean coal technology, and America sits on the world's largest supply of coal, larger than Saudi Arabia's supply of oil. And so it's a matter of developing the technology. The technology is being developed. It's the cost of the technology and as every barrel of oil gets more and more expensive, then that gap narrows. Plus the advances, dramatic advances that are being made in clean coal technology. And that's why ... I've said we'll spend $2 billion a year on research and development from the federal government for pure research and development to spur the progress of clean coal technology. But look, I see this all the time: 'We can't go nuclear power because we can't store it and we can't reprocess it. We can't do coal because it's dirty.' We can't do this because there's a mindset in Washington, D.C. that we can't do anything. Well, we can. We can do these things. And we've ... overcome greater obstacles in the past. But that rhetoric ... is directly related to the 9 percent approval rating. Don't you think Americans would like to hear, 'Hey, we're sitting on the world's largest supply of energy in coal reserves and we are going to develop the technology that will ... make it clean and Americans will be able to have their energy needs supplied, which will increase by 20 percent in the next 10 years, I believe. ... But the demand for energy is going to increase dramatically in the future and we're going to have to supply it.
\
Trib: Senator, in an effort to curtail our dependence on oil, how much of a commitment will your administration make to mass transit and high speed rail?
\
McCain: Well, I will obviously commit to doing whatever is necessary to spur that, but I'd also like to point out to you, Brad, that one of the reasons why we haven't done more is because a lot of Americans don't want to use it. Now again, we are seeing a dramatic increase in the use of mass transit because of ... the reasons we just discussed. There's another aspect of this, too, very quickly, and that is that it has to do with passenger per mile. In other words, maglev and other new technologies have reduced that cost per passenger per mile. But I also have got to look you in the eye and tell you that there are Amtrak routes that will never be viable, OK? And we have a lot of work to do on the infrastructure, the tunnels, etc. But to subsidize a route that goes from Miami to Los Angeles is at 200 and some dollars per passenger, that's not what we want to do. That's not the answer. In my hometown of Phoenix, right now we are constructing mass transit. I believe that you will see in many cities and interconnecting cities, particularly in high population areas, you will see mass transit become a reality. They are talking about Dallas-Fort Worth to Houston. They are talking about all across the West Coast, you know, which once upon a time there was more of that. But also East Coast and connecting many of your hubs and all that. So all I can say is that I will commit to it, but a lot of it is going to have to be dictated by again the demand for that kind of transportation.
\
Trib: Senator, how are you going to fix Social Security? What's your plan? We've heard over and over the system is headed toward ...
\
McCain: Yeah, it is, it's broken and we ...
\
Trib: What specifically can you do?
\
McCain: I think you have to do two things. One, do a better job than has been done in the past of convincing people that it's broken. I think you can do that with one chart that shows how much money is going out and how much is coming in, and when there's more going out than coming in and when there's no money left. And so you have to get that sense of urgency to the American people. And the second thing, you've got to say, 'Look, everything is on the table, let's sit down at the table.' That's what Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill did in 1983. They sat down, they put everything on the table. A lot of people didn't like the solution they came up with, but when the liberal Democrat from Massachusetts and the conservative president from California said this is the fix for Social Security, it went through. So you've got to put everything on the table. And for me to stand here and say we've got to have this, this and this, all that does is set things up for a confrontation. What I'm saying is I'll sit down at a table with Harry Reid, Nancy Pelosi, John Boehner and Mitch McConnell, and we'll sit down and we'll work it out, and we'll walk out and I'll give them all the credit. I'll give them all the credit because we've got to fix it. But first -- so that's my plan for fixing it.
\
Trib: Well, if private retirement accounts are part of the mix, we saw the opposition to that already in 2005. So could that still be part of the mix?
\
McCain: Everything has got to be on the table. And let me just say again, I believe that young people ought to be able to invest money in accounts with their names on it. And that means young people voluntarily. Now it got all hung up the last time with all kinds of allegations and that became the focus of the debate, rather than the crisis that Social Security is in. So I'm saying everything is on the table. I favor the ability of young Americans to put money into, on a voluntary basis, into an account with their name on it. That's what I favor. Other people favor different things. You've got to sit down at the table and you've got to hammer it out.
\
Trib: Do you favor raising the cap?
\
McCain: Pardon me?
\
Trib: Do you favor raising the cap?
\
McCain: No, and I think by doing so, as Sen. Obama wants to do, you are obviously putting a very, very big increased tax on ... middle income Americans who filing jointly and in other ways will be paying a very big increase.
\
Trib: Senator, do Americans have a constitutional right to privacy?
\
McCain: Sure. Sure they do.
\
Trib: Does that -- how does that factor in, do you think, with your U.S. Supreme Court choices, and say Roe v. Wade?
\
McCain: I believe the most fundamental statement ever made that guides my life is that all of us are created equal and endowed (with) certain inalienable rights, among these are life ... liberty and the pursuit of happiness. And I believe that life applies to the unborn as well as the born. And I believe that's a fundamental pillar of my belief and what I think America is all about, so I will continue to advocate for the rights of the unborn.
\
Trib: But the decision Roe v. Wade was based on this right to privacy, it's ...
\
McCain: I didn't agree with Roe v. Wade. I didn't agree with the latest decision concerning the banning of the death penalty for a person who rapes a child. ... It's what the Supreme Court has decided, but I don't agree with them.
\
Trib: Senator, do platforms matter anymore? And if the party adopts a platform that comes out against the guest worker program, would you abide by that platform?
\
McCain: I can't get into hypotheticals as to what, you know, they would do or not do, but ... certainly I believe in a party platform. And I believe that the majority of Republicans believe that a guest worker program that has ... tamper-proof biometric documents and an ... electronic employer verification system, I think ... that a lot of Republicans would agree with such a proposal as long as it's comprehensive, that we secure our borders and we have a temporary worker program and address the issue of the 12 million people who are here illegally. I think healthy disagreement ... within a party is good ... as long we share common principles and values.
\
Trib: Would you feel bound by the platform if some of these revisions directly ...
\
McCain: I respect the platform of the party. I may not agree with every single aspect of it, ... but those discussions and deliberations within the party should be well known, well ventilated and well discussed. But obviously I run on the principles and philosophies underlying my party platform, whether I will agree with every crossed ""t"" or dotted ""i"" or not is something. But again, I think some disagreement in our party is healthy. We don't have to agree on everything. In fact, things are pretty boring as they are if we agreed on every single thing... . But I certainly support the values and principles of the party of Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan.
\
Trib: Senator, on the transportation issue again, more than half of the funding for Pennsylvania's transportation law that's in effect right now comes from tolling Interstate 80, but it needs FHA approval. Separately, the governor of Pennsylvania, Ed Rendell, wants to privatize the Pennsylvania Turnpike. How would your administration handle tolling of interstates and would you encourage or discourage privatizing major roads like the turnpike?
\
McCain: I'm a federalist, and the -- the essence of federalism is the state -- first the individual and then the states are responsible, and then finally the federal government has the authority to make these kinds of decisions. I will respect what the governor, the Legislature and the people of Pennsylvania decide. I will respect that. And if I had my way, you would take the majority of the gas tax money and keep it in the state of Pennsylvania so that the Legislature, the governor, the mayors, the city councils, the county supervisors, the state and local governments could decide to do with that money, rather than send it to Washington, wash it through the Appropriations Committee, spend $233 million on a bridge to an island in Alaska with 50 people on it, and all the other boondoggle pork barrel projects that have given Washington a bad name. ... Then listen, Duke Cunningham had a list of projects and a list of money he got for those projects. He's now residing in federal prison. So don't think that this earmarking, the worst example of which is probably in the highway bills and the transportation bills, isn't a corrupting influence. And by the way, my State of Arizona, ... we get back 86 cents for every dollar we send to Washington. That's not right, that's not right. The State of Alaska gets what $10, or I've forgotten now, something really, you know, beyond. Most people don't believe it when you tell them. So I guess my point is I think those decisions as to what to do with the transportation system should reside within the states, and of course it has to be coordinated with the federal government because we've got a national highways system. But I'd like to see most of those decisions handled by the governors, the legislatures, the mayors, the city councils and the county people. By the way, I'm sorry to bore you with this, the congressman from Alaska, this is just fact. They earmarked some money for a county in Florida, I'm pretty sure it was Orange County, Florida. The county supervisor said we don't want to spend it on that project, it has some environmental concerns. And then the congressman said you'd better spend it on that or you won't get any more money. ... I go back to the 9 percent and I go back to the standing of the Republican Party. You can't do those kinds of things.
\
Trib: Senator, I just spent the last several months in Pakistan and Afghanistan with the U.S. troops along the border. I heard repeatedly, I was told there are hundreds if not thousands of insurgents coming across that border and attacking the U.S., Afghan and NATO troops. How would you respond to that? What is your solution to that problem?
\
McCain: It's interesting you mention that. I met the NATO ambassador from Pakistan to the United States this morning, a very interesting person who also spent time in prison himself for his political stance. The situation in Afghanistan is very, very tough today, and it will remain tough for quite a period of time. And one of the major areas of concern is generated by what goes on in Pakistan. Afghanistan, of course, Karzai is not effective as we want him to be. There's corruption, there's a number of issues concerning Afghanistan. But in Pakistan, as we know, Faustian bargains have been entered into with groups along the Pakistan, Afghan border, Waziristan, etc. And it has now become a safe haven for Taliban and others. So this is going to be a very difficult situation, and I don't have to tell you again, because you have been there most recently, the instance of violence attacks, etc., continue to go up, particularly in those areas. I think there's a whole lot of things that need to be done. We can talk about the NATO command structure, the relationships between the different militaries and we can talk about a number of things, but a lot of it is going to depend on our relationship with Pakistan. And they haven't sorted that out yet, as you know. What's going to happen with Musharraf, the reappointment of the judges... . And as much as I respect the country of Pakistan, a lot of times the parties are identified with individuals rather than anything else. I'm insulting your intelligence by reminding you of all these things. I think it's going to require a lot of diplomacy, it's going to require a lot of hard work, it's going to require a lot of ideological work and it's going to require a lot of economic diplomatic intelligence and others, including human intelligence. So I guess my answer to you is the reports you are getting are correct, and we're going to have to try as well as we can to work as closely as we can (with) the Pakistani government. We have to not only appeal to their better angels of their nature, but we also have to appeal to them to recognize that their national security interests over time are at stake here. If the Taliban succeeds in Afghanistan, sooner or later it's going to have a significant -- a greater influence on the situation in Pakistan as well. I think, you know, sometimes things happen in history that change the whole course of history. I think the assassination of Benazir Bhutto was a tragic event not only from a personal standpoint but it threw everything into a -- a tumultuous situation which they still haven't sorted out, as you well know. And I'm sorry that's a long answer, but I didn't cover nearly all of the challenge we face in the Afghan, Pakistan situation. And I wonder, given the time you spent there, whether you disagree with that assessment, just out of curiosity.
\
Trib: Some have talked also about setting up, like, coordination between Afghanistan and Pakistan, having direct links between villages, you know things like that, along the border especially between the U.S., Afghanistan and Pakistan.
\
McCain: I think so, since the Taliban and others do not respect borders. I think if there is some good news, I think that there is a glimmer of improving relationship between Karzai and the Pakistanis. There was a personal animosity between Musharraf and Karzai, as you know, that also complicated it a bit. It's very, very tough.
\
Trib: Senator, with Iraqi leaders now calling for a timetable for U.S. troop withdrawals ...
\
McCain: Actually the Iraqis are not. The Iraqis widely reported as short a time ago as a couple of weeks ago that there would be no status of forces agreement, and Maliki would say that, and it got headlines, and of course it turned out not to be true. I met recently with the ... foreign minister and the president, both of them share my views completely. Americans will withdraw. It will be dictated by events on the ground, by the success that we've made and that success has been significant. but it's still fragile. ... Al-Qaida and other Shiite militias, other former Bathists, those elements have been knocked back on their heels (but) they are not defeated. So ... despite what you may see or hear, the facts are that this will be dictated, and since we are succeeding we will be able to withdraw and it will be dictated by the facts on the ground. And they still agree that if you set an artificial date for withdrawal, the way that Sen. Obama wanted to do, then we will have a resurgence of the fighting and the various factions within Iraq, Iranian influence will increase and we still risk a wider war. The benefits of success are reduced Iranian influence, a functioning, not great, but functioning Iraqi government and military, and a stable U.S. ally in the region. The security arrangements will be worked out between two sovereign countries. So as I say, I just met with the president of Iraq and with the foreign minister and both of them, and I know that (Gen.) Petraeus and (Ambassador) Crocker are saying the same things, and Maliki will too. So let me point out to you again, Sen. Obama said the surge would not work, he opposed the surge, up until very recently he said that it completely failed. Now maybe that's because he hadn't been there in 900 days, maybe that's because he never asked for a single sit-down meeting with Gen. Petraeus. Never asked for one, nor received one. But Sen. Obama is now going to Iraq as he has announced and I'll be very interested in seeing what he has to say ... upon his return.
\
Trib: Senator, in the past you've labeled Iran an aggressive and radical foe of the U.S. and our regional allies. You had just mentioned Iran, but what would you do to limit their influence?
\
McCain: I would join with other nations and they are showing a strong willingness to do so, particular President Sarkozy and also Prime Minister Brown as well as Chancellor Merkel to impose meaningful, impactful sanctions on the Iranians, diplomatic, trade, economic and others. The Iranians despite their oil wells have a very weak economy, showing again tha, that governments matter. So I and the president had conversations with Sarkozy and our other European allies and I'm sure it will be a subject at the G-8 meetings. Now, we all know that Russia and China, particularly Russia, has blocked significant measures to be taken. And that's why I think we have to have this kind of league of democracies, as I called it, that can act in concert and not only address this issue but others like Darfur and many others that are unfortunately challenges to everything we stand for and believe in. So I think we can do that, but I also have to tell you at the end of the day none of us, none of us can allow a second Holocaust. None of us. And it's unfortunate that the president of Iran continues to voice his nation's stated policy as quote ""wiping Israel off the map,"" or calling Israel a quote stinking corpse or those other things. So but I think there's a lot of measures we can take in concert with other countries that I think can beneficially affect Iranian behavior.
\
Trib: Senator, about Medicare, I know that there's a lot of concern too about the possibility that the program may go bankrupt within the next decade or so. I know that you've talked about perhaps balancing the budget and making some steps and arrangements and that sort of thing, and I wonder if those cuts are to be made at the expense of Medicare. And I also wonder if there is a Medicare, is there a future for Medicare in your presidency?
\
McCain: Yes. No, there will not be cuts. Yes, there will be Medicare in the future. It's obviously a safety net that we have an obligation as a government to our society. The problem with Medicare is the health care costs, the skyrocketing costs of health care, which then is reflected by increases in Medicare costs and every other health care cost in America. So we have to get health care under control as far as the costs are concerned. We have the highest-quality health care in the world in the United States of America. The problem is affordability and availability, and that's why we are going to have to try to keep government out of running health care in America, and we are going to have to make various reforms. Social Security, as we talked about at the beginning of our conversation, is a major, major challenge. It pales in comparison to Medicare as far as unfunded liability is concerned. I believe this is right, that David Walker, the former head of the Government Accountability Office, said the unfunded liability, i.e. debt of Social Security, is $6 trillion. I believe he also said that Medicare was around $40 trillion. It's a huge difference. Medicare is the elephant in the room and we are going to have to reform it.
\
Trib: I'm based in Cairo, Egypt, and there's a lot of anti-American sentiment in the region. I travel a lot around the region. What would you do to improve it? Or do you think it needs improving?
\
McCain: There are many things that I could do, but I think you know from where you are based that probably major -- one of the major -- let me say the major issue in many respects in that part of the world is the Israeli-Palestinian issue. And unfortunately from time to time people who are dictators of countries use the Israeli-Palestinian issue as a way to divert from the real problems with governing and the lack of progress in many areas. I would get personally engaged in the process. I would find the best qualified people I know to be permanently there. I would make sure that everybody knows that we expect an outcome and that people in the region expect an outcome, and that we will achieve a successful resolution of these very difficult issues. They may have to be done step by step, and it may have to be one thing after another. As you know, President Clinton tried at Camp David to have an all-encompassing settlement, and by the way I respect very much President Clinton's effort and his knowledge of this issue. He knows it in detail. But that didn't succeed. So we may have to do it one step at a time. And among many other issues, by the way being from the west I have to throw in as you know water, water. Water is going to be as precious as oil someday. Not only in the Middle East. So that's just one of the issues that's going to have to be resolved. But with the highest priority, I would be personally engaged and I would have the smartest and most respected people I know engaged in the process. And I do believe it affects the entire region.
\
Trib: What was the purpose of your recent trip to Colombia and did you accomplish what you hoped to accomplish?
\
McCain: Well, I'm happy to tell you that I orchestrated the rescue of those hostages. I thought it was important, I believe they are a valuable ally. They are very important in the hard struggle against the drug issue. I think that a free trade agreement that the speaker has pulled off the table is very important to send a signal in the hemisphere. I think that we are engaged in a common struggle against the drug cartels and that's one of the reasons why I went to Mexico as well. And I'm happy to tell you I think we've got a president in Mexico in the case of Calderon who really is committed. And I don't have to tell you the terrible things that are happening in border towns. I mean the unspeakable cruelty as these cartels try to do everything they can to maintain their control. And this Merida initiative that was just concluded with Mexico I think is maybe a signal change in our relationship and our combined efforts, and they've got a huge corruption problem, let's face it. Drugs corrupt, money corrupts, but I do believe that the Colombian government coming from nearly a failed state to where it is today is pretty remarkable progress and I wanted to show my appreciation. But also the challenge that continues to lie ahead of us. As far as Mexico, I think it's obvious, our nearest neighbor. I come from a border state, I think Canada and Mexico relations are very important with the United States and so I thought it was appropriate to do so.
\
Trib: But was it meant to highlight your expertise in foreign affairs?
\
McCain: No. I think it was meant to convey to them my understanding and my commitment to working together with them, conveyed to the American people that I am aware, appreciate, understand and am committed to the close relations between our two nearest neighbors to also show the American people that I am ready to serve. And I hope that I'll be able to do that in the days and weeks, the 119 days, who is counting, remaining between now and ...
\
Trib: Senator, two quick questions. Back to Iran for a second, Ahmadinejad today challenged you to a debate. Is that something you can put on your schedule?
\
McCain: Do you think that Sen. Obama will join us? I've been challenging him to town hall meetings.
\
Trib: I just wondered if that was going to be part of your schedule.
\
McCain: Well, you know, the problem with sitting down with someone like Ahmadinejad is you then give that individual legitimacy. Now when Nixon went to China, it was after every ""t"" was crossed and every ""I"" was dotted. Whenever we have sat down with leaders there is a predetermined outcome. If you sat down with Ahmadinejad today, all he would do is go through a rant, which would be anti-Israeli, anti-American, etc. And that would then somehow in his view anyway enhance his role in the world -- on the world stage. Now if Ahmadinejad said at the end of this meeting, this debate we are having I'm then going to declare that we will respect the right of the state of Israel to exist, I'll sit down with him tomorrow. OK? But there's a huge difference there. And there's not -- and by the way we have communications. Ambassador Crocker in Baghdad has met with the Iranian ambassador, there's plenty of ways to communicate nowadays, my dear friends. But you've got to be careful, legitimacy you give people who state that their policy is the extermination of one of their neighbors. You see what I mean? So yes, I only have one precondition to sit down with Ahmadinejad and that is at the end of the meeting he will say my country will recognize and take no steps to harm the state of Israel, which is a freely democratic, freely elected government and nation. And I'll respect its right to exist, and I'll negotiate with them. That's when I do that. But that's interesting, I didn't know he had -- he had issued that challenge.
\
Trib: It is out there for you. The other question is when you ran for president in 2000, although the Internet was around because it was invented by then, but YouTube, 24 hours news cycle, every word is parsed that you said was not part of the culture (of) running forpPresident. What is that like for you know? I mean everything that you say, everything that Obama says, your surrogates say ...
\
McCain: I don't know how much the American people pay attention to all that. But I do know that for someone like me who believes in access to media and free flowing conversations and you know a lot of -- because I think it's important for people to understand the whole philosophy that I have, and you can't do it in sound bites, and you can't do it in speeches. But I will say something occasionally that maybe I misspeak or is taken out of context and I'm not complaining, don't get me wrong, I am not complaining. For me to complain is just well, I mean it's just self-serving for one, and it doesn't do any good, number two. So I think sometimes it may be a bit harmful to me, or you know maybe give ammunition to -- but having said all that, every town hall meeting I go to they don't ask what Charlie Black said, or what somebody else said, you know what they are talking about? They are talking about keeping their jobs, keeping their homes, the price of a gallon of gas, that's what is on their minds. Not this -- all this process stuff about you know who said and what said, and what adviser said this or that. But I'll tell you again, they are as upset and as concerned in all the years that I have been in elected office and they want to know not what some adviser said or what misspeak I may have said, something the Lexington project or the project Lexington or whatever it might be, but what they want to know is why is it that every time I got to the gas station I have to pay more? I'm on fixed income, why is it that I have, I can't get health insurance for my aunt who has a chronic disease? Why is it? I mean, that's what is on their minds and that's why I do the town hall meetings. And by the way, could I just mention also, I asked Sen. Obama to engage in these town hall meetings. He has refused to do so. I admire and respect Sen. Obama, but I still think one of the most effective ways to communicate with the American people. I spoke to LULAC today, he's speaking to LULAC today. Why didn't just the both of us stand up on the stage and have the people in the audience stand up and say how are you going to fix the border? How are you going to -- you know, and that way they would have an opportunity and some of this stuff that you are talking about would be avoided, because there we are. And so I'll continue to hope that he will do it. Yes?
\
Trib: You mentioned gridlock earlier. There is a chance that you could inherit a more Democratic Congress than there is right now. How ...
\
McCain: I would never contemplate such a thing.
\
Trib: Well, there is a possibility. How are you going to balance these ...
\
McCain: I know these people very well. I've worked with them for years. I've reached across the aisle to my favorite Democrat, Joe Lieberman, Russ Feingold, Ted Kennedy, I know these people and I've worked with them. Bryron Dorgan on the Indian Affairs Committee, Carl Levin on the Arms Services Committee. I know how to work with them. I know how to sit down with them and get things done. And that's been my practice and that's -- as long as there are 60 votes required in the Senate that's what you have to do. I mean there's no choice. So it makes for a lot of collegiality that otherwise wouldn't exist. So I know how to work with them, and I know how to say look, come on now, we all know Social Security is broken. Now here is what -- let's put everything on the table and when we walk out of here, Harry, and Speaker Pelosi, and all the others, I'll give you all the credit. I'll give you all the credit, and maybe we'll see a little tick up in that 9 percent approval rating of Congress. Politicians crave approval. That's -- you know that's what we do. And not all of us are motivated by the most patriotic reasons, I will freely admit. But we do crave approval and we seek it, because that's our job to get things done. And right now there's nothing done, so therefore the ratings are down and there's a very strong feeling in America. So I know how to sit down with them, and I think, believe it or not, the time is really ripe for it, to be able to walk out with them and stand there, wherever it is. I'll go up to the Hill and stand there with them and say we've got a fix for Social Security, my friends. All you young people that are working today that never received benefits from your taxes are going to get them, you are going to get the benefits. Maybe there's going to be some changes, but at least you are going to get them.
\
Trib: Senator, what's your fix for the price of oil? You've advocated the gasoline, the gasoline tax moratorium, but gasoline just tracks the price of oil. In your view,what's causing the price of oil, because there's been a lot of debate, well how would you fix that?
\
McCain: There's always speculators, by the way, and they will take advantage. They are not my favorite group of Americans, but the fact is that the fundamental issue is that there are growing economies, particularly India and China, but other countries, Brazil, others, although Brazil has done a good job in their energy independence effort, but that are growing demands on a finite resource, and that's oil. And the Russian oil minister not long ago predicted it would be as high as $200 a barrel. I understand it's gone down today, but so we've got to,in my view, do offshore drilling if the states agree. If the states agree, we should drill offshore. Now in Florida, Gov. Crist just said they ought to do it. In California ..., Gov. Schwarzenegger said no. So it should be up to the states, but the federal government shouldn't be saying it. So we should do the offshore oil exploration that's very necessary, and then as I started out in the beginning of our conversation, wind, solar, tide, nuclear, hybrid cars, hydrogen, batteries, it's going to have to be 1,000 flowers bloom. I met two guys from California not too long ago that have an electric car. The good news is it's an electric car, the bad news is it costs $100,000. Their next generation is going to be $60,000. And right now we've got GM placing all their bets on the Volt. Now the technology isn't quite there yet but they've placed their bets on that and I am convinced, and by the way you know on the gas tax holiday if I could just say -- I met a guy not long ago that owns two trucks. He told me that he's probably going to go out of business. And he might not have to go out of business quite so quickly and he may not at all if he was relieved of the 25 1/2-cent tax that he pays on a gallon of diesel. Now it's easy for someone who resides in Georgetown and is driven to work in a limousine to say that, but I just wanted to give them a little break. I didn't claim it was the answer. I didn't claim that it was the solution to our energy problems. But I did claim that they needed a little bit of a break. So, and the thing about the offshore drilling if I could just mention it again, or exploration again, is that the futures markets are based on predictions. And I believe that if we said, we're really going to go after our oil and gas reserves, it would not be a long-term solution but it would have a temporary and sometime beneficial effect on the price of a barrel of oil. So I guess in summary, I know America can do it. I know America can do it. And by the way on that business of the electric car, how much did a cell phone cost when it first was brand new? A thousand bucks. Now they're giving them away. The same thing can happen with a battery-powered automobile in my view. Go ahead.
\
Trib: Do you think that the current administration has made a mistake by not doing more to strengthen the dollar? Because that's another thing that people point to as far as the ...
\
Trib: I'd like to strengthen the dollar. I think it's important we strengthen the dollar. I think it's important we talk it up. But I also can tell you that we are in a spiral when we transfer $400 (billion) or $500 (billion), how many hundreds of billions of dollars overseas to purchase foreign oil. And we enlarge the debt, we weaken our economy, the dollar weakens and then the price of a barrel of oil goes up. This is s spiral, my friends. And you don't have to be -- have a Ph.D. It's this huge transfer of wealth. It's historic in the view of many people. This historic transfer of hundreds of billions of dollars to countries that don't like us very much and some of it ends up in the hands of terrorist organizations. So I have to tell you that I want the dollar strengthened. It's very important that we strengthen it. It's having all kinds of unpredicted as well as predicted impacts of a weakened dollar. But I think the best measure we can take to strengthen the dollar is to declare our independence, our mission to independence on foreign oil. Yes, sir.
\
Trib: I take it then that it's not -- you're not in favor of having the ownership of U.S. companies continue to transfer overseas then because of the low dollar ...
\
McCain: I believe that the reason why a lot of companies and businesses move overseas is because of the corporate tax, which is 35 percent, the second highest in the world. Right now, Ireland, which still has a strong economy and one of the economic miracles of the last decade or 20 years, they have 11 percent business tax, corporate tax. We have 35, which is the second highest in the world, the highest being Japan. How are you going, I mean you're the head of the business and you've got a choice of locating in Ireland or the United States of America. And you've got ""X"" amount of dollars that you're going to hire people and do all the things you can do. Clearly, I think the corporate tax or the business tax is a real big factor.
\
Trib: If the mortgage crisis and the credit crisis continues into a McCain administration, would you be, look for a Resolution Trust Corporation-type of bailout or anything like that?
\
McCain: I'd be open to anything that seems reasonable in order to get us a floor on the value of homes in America today. I'd like to give you a little straight talk. We've got to get that floor so that we can start having an improving economy. But I also ...
\
Trib: When do you think we'll get that?
\
McCain: What's that?
\
Trib: When do you think we'll get that?
\
McCain: If I knew that, I would be a very, very wealthy man. Some time in the future. I think the important thing is that we passed this legislation even though I did not like some parts of it. If I'd have had my way and still if I have my way, we would put that responsibility in the hands of the homeowner. That the homeowner can go down and get a 30-year FHA-guaranteed loan at the new value of the house and then after appreciation, if that homeowner sells 10 per -- ah, one-third, one-third, one-third of the profits go to the federal government and the lender and the homeowner. Because I worry with this proposal that's being passed by the Senate that the lender will use that as a way to get rid of their most risky loans. But it's still - the government has to act and intervene. And I talk to people all the time about this, whether Wall Street or whether they're homeowners, no matter who they are. And it's obvious that we need to take this action. That's why I believe that we need to do, to pass the legislation pending before Congress even though I have problems with it. And we may have to take additional measures. Because our economy is in serious trouble today and Americans are hurting.
\
Trib: Are we in a recession now in your opinion?
\
McCain: Of course, I believe that we're in a recession, but the important thing, you know, people sit around the kitchen table at night saying how are we going to make the mortgage payment? They're not saying, hey, you think we're in a recession? Or just, this is an economic dip, you know, what do you think we're - they're saying how are we going to make our payment this month? How are we going to stay in our home? So and so just lost his job. So that really is -- and I don't mean to be disrespectful of your question, I apologize if I was. But I think, yeah, I'd say we're, certainly in the minds of millions and millions of Americans, we are in a quote recession.
\
Trib: Could you just clarify something for me Senator? One of the first things you said was that more taxes would do a lot of damage to the country. But if I read your health insurance proposal correctly, it would do away with the employer tax exemptions, which I believe that by definition would mean that all of us would have to pay taxes on health benefits.
\
McCain: Well if the employer wants to maintain that relationship they can, but then we also would have the individual receive a $5,000 refundable tax credit.
\
Trib: But we would still be taxed on our health benefits, correct?
\
McCain: You would receive a $5,000 -- if you chose to have the employer-provided benefits you could maintain that. If you choose to, you can have a $5,000 refundable tax credit so that you go across state lines and get whatever insurance of your choice, and right now you can't do that and you need to be able to go across state lines. It's a whole package of proposals that I'd be glad to send you the details of it.
\
Trib: Is it time to take our troops out of Germany and Korea and use them for other things ... placing them in Iraq and Afghanistan?
\
McCain: No, I don't think so. I think we've cut way, way back on our troop presence in Europe. As you know, troops from Germany are going to Iraq and Afghanistan. They're being deployed from there as well. I have every belief that China will emerge as a superpower in a peaceful way, at least, I certainly have that expectation. But I think most of our allies in Asia would tell you that an American military presence in the region is a stabilizing factor. So no, I wouldn't do that at this time.
\
Trib: There are a lot of people in this state, going back to what you said about jobs and the corporate tax, who blame free trade agreements like NAFTA and CAFTA. Pennsylvania and Ohio, it's a huge issue, played prominently in the Democratic primary here. What do you say to those voters -- about free trade agreements?
\
McCain: Well, I'll try to assure them that, one, I would not allow products into this country that would be detrimental to health. I would make sure that we use the WTO or other provisions of agreements to make sure that they are not taking advantage of us, engaging in unfair practices and I would also try to make sure that they understand the lessons of history, Mr. Smoot and Mr. Holly Tariffs Act and others measures taken in 1930 sent this nation from a recession into the deepest Depression in modern time. I would also try to point out the jobs that have been created and most importantly I would point out that we will implement, institute and implement retraining and education programs for workers so that they can be part of this information technology revolution, which is worldwide and global. And there are good jobs in green technologies and our mission to become energy independent will create hundreds, millions of jobs. Just in the nuclear power, building 45 nuclear power plans alone will be 700,000 jobs. So I will assure them that we will provide them with the education and training programs that are necessary, including those for the displaced worker and I will even subsidize the salary of a highly paid worker who has to take a lower-paid job while they're undergoing re-education and training programs. I will assure them of all of those things. And, again, it's a matter of principle, my friend. It's a matter of principle. It would be easy from time to time in my political career to embrace positions which may be popular at the time whether it be the surge in Iraq, when everybody was against it and I said we need additional troops, even though that was the most unpopular thing you could do at the time. Or whether it be -- lead on immigration reform, which I knew was not popular with the Republican base at that time. And I know from history that free trade -- or excuse me, that isolationism and protectionism have incredibly detrimental and damaging effects both short-term and long-term. There are many that belief that protectionism and isolationism was a major contributor to World War II. I won't go that far. But I will allege that certainly it sent us from a recession into a depression. I'm not going to do that to the American people. So I have to tell them, I do what I believe is right and if that means - it's like raising taxes. Sen. Obama wants to raise taxes. You want to raise taxes, I'm not your guy.
\
Trib: How long are we going to stay in Iraq? I mean is it going to be like Japan or South Korea?
\
McCain: I think that's between our two countries, but I think the facts on the ground are that we are succeeding, and we will be able to withdraw, and we will withdraw with honor and victory. And we will not have a defeated military on our hands, and we won't have a wide -- risk of a wider war. And we won't have all the things that go along with defeat. So we will be withdrawing because we've succeeded. In all classic conflicts of this nature, you get the security environment established, then the government starts functioning effectively, then the institutions of society are able to proceed, and then you withdraw. I mean it wasn't invented in Iraq. It wasn't -- when I supported the surge and said we've got to do it, it wasn't because I invented it, it's because I studied history. So we will withdraw, and we will withdraw with honor and victory, and we won't have to go back.
\
Trib: But do you foresee a long-term presence beyond --
\
McCain: I think that's a relationship between the United States Government and Iraq. In Kuwait after the first Gulf War, we established a base there. They thought it was in their national security interests, we decided it was in our national security interests. In the case of Saudi Arabia, they decided that we should leave because of their internal political situation in Saudi Arabia. So what will be done is two sovereign nations will sit down together and decide what is in the best national security interests of both nations.
\
Trib: But what would be your position on that?
\
McCain: My position is that we would do what's in the national security interests of both nations. That would be my position.
\
Trib: Senator, you had called the situation in Afghanistan tough and you said that any failure there could lead -- could have dire consequences for the NATO alliance. Beyond Pakistan, what do you think it takes for the U.S. to succeed there? Is more troops the answer?
\
McCain: I think there is a whole lot of challenges that we face. One of them is whether we succeed or not in Iraq. I think that has a direct impact on the region. But I also believe that the Karzai government being more effective, the Pakistan situation as you and I discussed, the economic progress, again this is one of these situations where you've got to maintain the security environment, but then you've got to have the progress where people will have a better life to look forward to. And one of the failures, because of corruption, has been that we haven't made the progress economically in some of these parts of Iraq and we had this window of opportunity and it wasn't as well used as perhaps it could have. But again, I can't tell you that there's one solution to it with the struggle military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, it's all of one and yet it has various aspects. And I just finally would say, and I'm sorry for some wrong answers, but we are in this with other nations. That's important. And I'm glad that Sarkozy is sending additional French troops over there. I'm glad that many of our allies, I wish more of them and I wish the rules of engagement for some of them were better and a lot of things. But the fact is this is a -- this is a lot of nations that are in this in a common interest.
\
Trib: Do you think more troops should -- do you think -- some of the military have called for more additional troops ...
\
McCain: I think yes, and I'd love to see our allies to contribute more in a broad variety of ways. I'd love to see that. And we may have to send additional troops. As you know, they just extended the marine unit there by an additional 30 days. And I think they had -- they did that very reluctantly. Yes?
\
Trib: Senator, Sen. Obama has indicated that he would be open to having members of the Republican Party on his Cabinet. Is that something that would be -- does party preclude? Do you have any -- maybe not a specific person, but a type of person that you could see sitting on that Cabinet?
\
McCain: The one thing the American people want today is for us to work together. That's the frustration, that's their intense frustration is that we seem to be -- have our party first. And I'll put my country first. That's what I say in every speech. I put my country first, and that means including Democrats, Libertarians, vegetarians, whoever it is that take part, and I also would ask people who have been very successful. I'd like to ask John Chambers to come and work for $1 a year. I'd like to ask a lot of these people who have achieved enormous success to come and serve their country, and that will be an example to younger Americans as well.
\
Trib: Do you think it's a sign of a stronger leader if they are willing to have people that are at their table, that are part of their administration, that aren't always going to say yes to them? I mean is that something that you are comfortable with?
\
McCain: Oh, I think it's very important. I think the hardest thing for any President is to get unvarnished opinions from the people and unfiltered. That's the hardest thing. I think it's not the hardest, but it's one of them. It's one of the very difficult things just to make sure you are getting the benefit of the expertise and knowledge of a lot of people rather than hearing what you want to hear.
\
Trib: Senator, you've often said you are older than dirt. And you would be the oldest person ever sworn in as president. What can you do to assure people that you are not too old to be president?
\
McCain: I think it's a time when America needs experience and knowledge and judgment. America needs that now because of the challenges we face. I've served my country all my adult life. I know how to serve. I have the experience and the knowledge and the background to make the correct judgments. I don't need any on the job training, I don't need any preparation. I need to get smart people around me, but obviously I have nothing but dumb people around me now. No. I'm ready, and they need somebody who is ready, and they need somebody who has proven leadership qualities. And I believe that I am qualified. Yes?
\
Trib: For the last 20 years we've gone through a series of what I call balloon and bust cycles. There was the real estate boom that led to the savings and loan crisis, and then we had the technology bubble that caused the recession or close to one, and now we are in the mortgage and credit crisis. What kind of failures or failure to regulation? What failure is allowing these things to happen, because they are very unhealthy?
\
McCain: There is failures that are associated with almost every one of them that I think that a long view is that we have created 46 million jobs in America since 19 -- since 1982. And so we have experienced great prosperity. That's of no consolation for those people that were caught up in the savings and loan crisis, people who were caught up in the tech bubble, all of that stuff. And so I think that we have to learn the lessons, we have to pay attention to those who warn us about impending problems, and we have to make sure that any economic problems that we have are better anticipated. I think the best way to do that is make sure that we have great transparency. Transparency is the first step, and then where oversight is necessary is the second step. None of us ever anticipated that the subprime lending crisis would affect a town in Norway that lost ""X"" millions of dollars because they had investments that were affected by it. And the global economy is something we have to make adjustments to, and as rapidly as possible. Now the savings and loan crisis was bred by other problems in excessive capitalism and so was the dot-com bubble. But each one of those we have to learn, and our lesson is that we have to do a better job of anticipating these problems. And that means to start with greater transparency so we know what's going on in a global economy. And now the global economy travels at the speed of light, and so that is a new dimension to a global economy and one that we're going to have to try to anticipate better than we have in the past.
\
Trib: Senator, what would distinguish the McCain administration from the current Bush administration?
\
McCain: Climate change, spending, we wouldn't torture a single person in our custody, close Guantanamo Bay. There -- those are some of the major differences. Climate change is real in my view, and we have to act in my view to address it. Spending got completely out of control, as I said in the beginning of our conversation. It's not revenues that was the problem, it was spending. It was the dramatic increase in the size of government. It gave us massive deficits and caused the cycle of difficulties and challenges that we are facing. I begged them to -- I didn't beg them, I urgently recommended that they veto the spending bills that came across the president's desk. And they didn't, they didn't. And that I think is a very, very heavy price we're paying for allowing spending to get completely out of control.
\
Trib: How is your vice presidential search coming?
\
McCain: Moving down along in the process. Now you are going to mention Tom Ridge. Every place I go to we mention the name, and just let me say on the subject of Tom Ridge, he's a great American, he's a tremendous leader, he's an old and dear friend, and he has a great place in America's future and that of our party. But we are not mentioning anybody's name, it's just not appropriate, nor is it helpful to the person or the process.
\
Trib: Do you feel pressured to pick a woman or a minority vice president?
\
McCain: No, frankly, I hadn't thought about that. I ...
\
Trib: What kind of a vice president do you want?
\
McCain: Someone who shares my priorities and my principles. And also obviously who is ready to take my place at a moment's -- you know, immediately.
\
Trib: I think we've got time for about two more questions. And one of them I'm going to ask. So somebody needs to jump in, or I'll ask two. Immigration and border security, big concerns for us, big concerns for all Americans. What are you going to do about it?
\
McCain: Twice we brought up immigration reform. As you know, Sen. Kennedy and I, and twice it failed. And it failed because Americans did not have confidence that we would secure the borders. And there was some legitimacy to that concern because in 1986 we passed a law that gave amnesty to a couple of million people and we said we'd secure the borders. We didn't. Our borders have to be secured not only because of illegal immigration but because of drugs. As we have seen, the influence and inflow of drugs into our country is a devastating one. So we need to secure the borders first, but we need a comprehensive approach to the problem, and that means a temporary worker program that is associated with -- that is associated with a fundamental principle of this tamper-proof biometric documents. We have the technology for that. And again, that would be with an electronic employment verification system. When that word went around the world that the only way you can get a job in the United States of America is if you have the biometric tamper-proof documents, then that will dry up a lot of the supply that's coming in where they can get jobs. And they will not -- that will have a beneficial effect. And then we have to address the issue of the 12 million people who are in this country illegally. Two million of them, according to Chertoff, have committed crimes. They've got to be rounded up, using every means as possible, and deported. With the others we have to have a humane and compassionate approach to this issue, and the principle has to be that no one who waited legally or came legally should have any priority taken over them. In other words, they have to be first in line because they acted legally. But it still can be done in a humane and compassionate fashion, and addressed in that fashion as well. We are a Judeo-Christian-valued nation, and we can address that issue in that fashion. Today some person was picked up this morning, worked all day long for someone, and at the end of the day the guy said I'm not paying you. If you don't like it, turn me in. There's abuses of people's rights that are -- because they are human beings -- that are taking place all the time. That side of it is something when you see the activities of the coyotes, when you see the things that are done, it's a humanitarian issue as well as all of the others. But we can secure our borders. We can do that with electronic devices, with virtual fences, with sensors and walls in populated areas.
\
Trib: Why haven't we done it so far? I mean we've had seven years since our borders were breached in a terrorist way.
\
McCain: Because we've failed, we've failed as a government to do it. It's a federal failure. It's federal responsibility to secure our borders. So now you have sanctuary cities and you have this and you have that, and all the states and towns and cities are all in conflict with one another as a direct result of our failure to carry out a federal responsibility, 9 percent approval rating.
\
Trib: Everybody who runs for president, and everybody that we have interviewed in this room talks about how the other guy has failed and they are going to get in and change things. And it's all going to be better and they give us a litany of all the issues that they think -- and then four years later, or eight years later we are back hearing the same thing. Why should anybody who is going to vote in this election believe either candidate, both of whom are in the Senate, both of whom are part of the process, both of whom have been there through at least part of the last four years, that either of you gentlemen are going to change anything?
\
McCain: Examine my record. Examine my record for credibility. Sen. Obama has the most extreme voting record of anyone in the Senate. I have a record of reaching across the aisle and working together and getting things done. I mean this -- but also Americans not only want to examine your record, they want to have -- and that's important, in fact more importantly, they want to know what you are going to do to resolve these issues. But having a record is important. I still think Americans want hope, they want confidence in the future, they believe ... what they want to believe, and I believe it is true that America's best days are ahead of us. We've faced tough times in the past, we can overcome them, and they want a clear plan of action and I'm trying to provide that. And I believe that I am. But they also want to know what you've done for them. Most importantly, they want to know what you are going to do for them. I think it's a combination of both. And I admire and respect Sen. Obama, he is a great speaker, he has motivated people all over America, and I respect and admire him. We just have stark differences in how we approach the challenges that we face.

Trib: Is he the candidate that you are happy to run against in this election?
\
McCain: No, I -- you know, I had no role in that process, and I respect the process that the Democratic Party went through. I mean it's nothing I could affect in any way that I know of.
\
Trib: But of all the candidates you could have run against, is he the one you'd rather ...
\
McCain: No, no, I had no choice. I had no choice in the matter, and I obviously had no -- took no position. I respect Sen. Clinton, I know her and I've worked with her in the Senate. I respect Sen. Obama. I respect all of those who are willing to go through this tough process. And Americans I think want a respectful candidate. But obviously it's time for me to go.

In the coming months, debate on a proposed natural gas severance tax will heat up as legislators attempt to pass a balanced budget before June 30. Last year, lawmakers and Governor Rendell decided that taxing companies in their infancy would have crippled them. Facing another budget shortfall, Governor Rendell has now decided drilling companies can afford to pay and additional tax- but the harmful effects remain unchanged.
\
The proposed severance tax would take 5 percent of the value plus 4.7 cents per thousand cubic feet of extracted natural gas. In addition, the governor would continue leasing state lands to drilling companies in order to pull in an extra $180 million in revenue.
\
Rendell's argument that all other gas producing states have a severance tax only tells part of the story. Most of these states exempt horizontally-drilled wells (which are typical in the Marcellus Shale region). Oklahoma exempts these wells until the company recovers its investment. In Texas, these high-cost wells receive an 80 percent tax deduction. And Florida provides tax credits to small oil and gas producers. Moreover, these states' overall tax burdens are lower than Pennsylvania's 11th highest in the nation.
\
Rendell's ""fair share"" argument is further undermined by the fact that drilling companies already pay either the highest Corporate Net Income Tax in the world or the Personal Income Tax, plus the Capital Stock and Franchise Tax, leasing fees, and royalties, and they finance bonds to maintain local infrastructure.
\
Despite these costs, some gas companies are eager to invest in the Commonwealth. However, Gov. Rendell remains determined to tax energy sources that are creating permanent jobs to subsidize alternative energies unable to survive on their own merits.
\
Some lawmakers are proposing a five-year moratorium on drilling in state lands until the environmental effects are better understood. Yet the fracking process used in horizontal drilling has been utilized for decades with an excellent track record. A Penn State University study found that more than 95 percent of complaints received from homeowners suspecting contamination from gas drilling were actually due to preexisting problems or other activities such as agriculture. And when drilling sites are cited for infractions those problems are typically minor and easily corrected. Lawmakers who worry about the environmental impact should be mollified by the lack of evidence of water contamination due to Marcellus Shale drilling.
\
Others believe that a natural gas tax is necessary to pay for increased regulatory costs. Creating a new revenue source is unnecessary to deal with potential contamination. If pollution occurs, fines and penalties levied by the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) should cover the clean-up costs. Better yet, local problems should be addressed by local government in cooperation with the DEP. One example is the wear and tear on roads from increased truck traffic. Drilling companies are already accountable for any damaged roads or infrastructure, and in many cases roads have actually improved since drilling began. For example, Range Resources has spent more than $4 million in the last two years rebuilding roads and new bridges in three local communities in Western Pennsylvania.
\
If a severance tax is enacted, property owners' royalties will be taxed, and companies may choose to focus investment in other shale deposits around the United States. Recently, Devon Energy CEO Larry Nichols cited the ""political problems"" in Pennsylvania that dissuaded his company from investing in the region. State government is driving away these businesses while spending billions to attract other politically favored businesses. None of the above proposals effectively addresses the root problems of government overspending, which is why 90 percent of the proposed severance tax is going to the state General Fund, not for local environments or infrastructure.
\
Arguments in favor of the severance tax ignore a host of benefits the drilling companies are already providing, including: lease payments to the state treasury, royalties and signing bonuses to citizens, tax revenue through traditional sources, road repairs, and most importantly, thousands of jobs. Lester Lave, a Carnegie Mellon University professor and co-director of the university's Electricity Industry Center, recently said, ""You could have a blue-collar boom here. Cheap gas really could stimulate industry, everything from glass making, to fertilizer, to power plants- a lot of industries run on cheap fuel.""
\
The Marcellus Shale boom is accomplishing something that all of Governor Rendell's economic development programs cannot: permanent jobs and more state tax revenue without a dime of taxpayer subsidies. Resisting the calls to tax natural gas producers will ensure Pennsylvania maintains a competitive edge without compromising our fiscal health or natural resources.

620,"To the Editor:\“The $29,627,835 Final Budget of the North Schuylkill School District reflects an $832,218 or 2.9 percent, in-crease in estimated expenditures over the prior year budget and includes a 1.38-mill tax increase. The annual tax increase for the average home owner would be approximately $30. The increase is primarily a reflection of the years of underfunded mandates placed on the district by the state legislature, specifically, retirement, charter schools and special education.”\That’s what the press release stated from our June 20, 2018 meeting. However, people need to understand what schools are up against in meeting the bottom line.\If anyone believes that school board members want to raise taxes or have a cavalier attitude doing so really don’t have a clear understanding of the multitude of issues that school districts face. Do people truly believe that we want to pay more? We are taxpayers, too.\Folks are quick to say that we need to live within our budget. We do have a budget that provides a spending framework. Unfortunately, it is the mandates that we must find money to pay for while relying on our representatives to ensure that they fund what they hold us accountable to follow.\The talk of a budget in Harrisburg on time is welcome news; however, North Schuylkill’s increase from state sources is estimated at merely one percent, or only $89,724 more. While happy to have an increase, our contribution back to the state coffers for the pension plan has increased by 5.5 percent, or $202,000. We have not filled three positions, slashed the amount of allocation for supplies and are creating alternate learning environments to save money on out-of-district placements.\In the past few years, we have phased out double-digit positions, replaced full-time positions with part-time ones, changed how our health care plan operates and turned down some much-needed programs that we believe would be beneficial to save money. We are hopeful that the fair funding litigation gets cleared of all of legal hurdles in the appeal process and schools such as ours will have the same opportunities as all others in the state.\Charter school tuition and costs to educate students who choose not to attend North Schuylkill have also created a financial hardship. We know people say there is a reason that families make the choice to use a different approach; however, some families have never stepped into our district to see what we can offer. They simply didn’t like the place they previously attended and moved into the district and that bill gets shifted onto our district. This cost has risen by $144,000 or 18.24 percent, from the previous year. The state has allowed more than triple the amount of charter or cyber charter schools than originally allocated.\Property taxes are not a shared responsibility, but not for the reasons that you may think. We hear complaints that those renting don’t pay their fair share, but rest assured landlords aren’t going to pay that on their own and they pass it onto their tenants. One of the main concerns has been that some of our neighbors continue to allow their payments to go into arrears. A few million dollars is still owed to the district. If this was paid regularly we would not have to continue to increase taxes. That said, we encourage you to look on our website, www.northschuylkill.net, to see the lists of delinquents.\There is a buzz about property tax reform which, if a fiscally responsible plan would come along, we would support. It would make our volunteer “jobs” much easier and we could focus on what we all are here for, the kids. However, ask yourself some questions before jumping all in on this topic. What happened to the gas tax monies? Our roads are terrible, maybe the worst they have ever been. How about the casino money? PA’s casinos have broken revenue records; however, has the Homestead Act provided you with more money? Or the pension that was referenced earlier - our legislators allowed it to be unfunded for years and now have put the burden on local government to recoup the monies that they mishandled.\All of this on the backs of taxpayers. We will continue to try to be financial stewards of the tax dollars we collect and the allocations that we are provided; however, trying to provide a quality education with the dollars provided by our state versus the mandates that they expect you to fund is becoming more difficult.\North Schuylkill Board of Education\Charles Hepler, President\Roy Green, Vice President\Mary Ann Woodward, Treasurer\Edward Balkewicz, Thomas Fletcher, Douglas Gressens, Suzanne O’Neill, Janine Sims, Glenn Weist\Credit: Your Views"
621," A new report on funding highway maintenance, commissioned by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, makes some salient points, and some of its recommendations deserve consideration. However, it also offers up one very stupid idea: taxing hybrid and fuel-efficient vehicles through a special fee.\ That's an insult to Americans who are helping to ease, in their own personal way, this nation's dependence on foreign oil. It's a ridiculous notion, not just because of its underlying logic that cars with better gas mileage pay less in gas tax, and therefore should be taxed in some other fashion, but because it would penalize Americans who make an environmentally prudent purchase.\ Many hybrid purchasers understand that gasoline prices would have to climb substantially higher than they are now -- and stay there - - to offset the higher up-front purchase price. But they buy the vehicles anyway because at 50 miles to the gallon or more, they help the environment. Why should that spirit of good citizenship be punished?\ This isn't a make-or-break revenue source for highway spending, of course. Hybrids are only a tiny portion of the auto market. Even so, Toyota reckons 100 million gallons of gas have been saved by its hybrid vehicles in this country since the introduction of the Prius in 1997.\ It's the proposal's message that is so unpalatable. Instead of encouraging the purchase of vehicles with good gas mileage, it tells owners there's a price to pay for their environmentally sound choice -- and it comes in the form of a tax bill. That proposal should be parked, permanently."
622,"
Flanked by construction workers, union officials, and business groups, officials from the Associated General Contractors of America criticized the state House on Thursday, saying its inaction on proposed funding to fix the state's aging infrastructure will cost jobs.
\
Richard Barcaskey, executive director of the Western Pennsylvania chapter of the contractors' association, said if a transportation funding bill is not passed soon, 7,200 construction jobs will be lost and another 7,200 jobs will be lost in other industries.
\
""In an environment where everything seems to be so partisan, it's remarkable you can get the PA Chamber (of Business and Industry) and organized labor all together. It shows there's a need and the General Assembly needs to act,"" Barcaskey said.
\
""The main message is that business and labor are standing up together,"" said Ken Zapinski, vice president of the Allegheny Conference on Community Development. ""There's going to be an impact on the economy if the state does not act.""
\
The leaders gathered for a news conference under the Liberty Bridge, one of 1,000 bridges statewide on which PennDOT slapped weight restrictions last week. The Liberty Bridge weight limit is 30 tons, which likely bars loaded tractor-trailers and dump trucks from crossing it.
\
A $2.5 billion funding plan that would have uncapped the wholesale gas tax and increased license and registration fees passed the Senate 45-5 but died in the House.
\
Among those who opposed it was state Rep. Daryl Metcalfe, R-Cranberry, who contends PennDOT should pay for fixes out of the $7 billion it gets. He said the weight restrictions were a political move designed to wrestle more money from the Legislature, something PennDOT Secretary Barry Schoch has denied.
\
Bill Patton, a spokesman for House Democratic leadership, said the Democrats agreed with the contractors' criticism.
\
""It's way overdue for the Legislature to get something done on transportation,"" Patton said.
\
A spokeswoman said Gov. Tom Corbett wants a bill to move forward when legislators return to work this fall.

Gas industry officials divided Friday over whether Pennsylvania lawmakers should approve a gas tax.
\
State lawmakers have said they will negotiate next week over a tax plan for the Marcellus shale gas industry. Members of the House approved a plan that would add a 39-cent tax for every thousand cubic feet of gas extracted.
\
Drillers should pay something but the proposed tax is too high and ""onerous,"" said former Gov. Tom Ridge, a consultant for the Marcellus Shale Coalition, a trade association.
\
""You want to socialize the benefit of this transformative opportunity,"" Ridge said. ""Some of that obviously needs to be shared with the county governments and local governments.""
\
The Pennsylvania Independent Oil and Gas Association, which represents both Marcellus and conventional industries, opposes any tax, said Lou D'Amico, president and executive director.
\
""We're totally opposed to it certainly at this time,"" D'Amico said. ""Our biggest concern is that we are competing with every other shale play in the country for investment capital.""
\
Candidates for governor they are divided on the issue, too.
\
Dan Onorato, the Allegheny County chief executive and the Democrat running for governor, said he supports a tax lower than the House version but higher than a Senate proposal for a 1.5 percent tax that ramps up to 5 percent after three years.
\
""I'm going to put in a severance tax before they drill,"" Onorato told reporters.
\
His Republican opponent, Tom Corbett, the state attorney general, opposes any tax on the gas industry but has called for stricter regulations that would require companies to disclose the chemicals they use, limit water withdrawals and increase fines for violators, an aide said.
\
Separately, the Marcellus Shale Coalition released a list of guiding principles for members to voluntarily create safe working areas, protect the environment and operate with transparency.
\
""We're in this collectively,"" said Kathryn Klaber, president of the coalition. ""It's not about bad or good. It's about making everything better.""

TO THE EDITOR:
\
It doesn't matter how old you are in life, there is always something new to learn. In the Intell, Dec. 3, there was a story about cow gas polluting the environment.
\
I can't believe farmers didn't know their cows were a hazard to society. Perhaps if they did, they would have installed a collection station in the meadow and trained their cows to back up and deposit their gas. The problem would be how to separate the different octanes. Just think, they could have run their farm equipment free for years. Oh wait, somebody would have come up with the idea you owe gas tax. Just think, someday people may be able to put a cow in the trunk of their car and drive down the road with the cow supplying the gas. Extra income for farmers.
\
I hope we don't see all the cows in the meadow with tanks attached to them collecting gas. Worse yet, we may see all wildlife in the future with gas collecting tanks. Someone must have stayed up all night thinking of this. Good luck, farmers, on your gas collecting adventure.

625,"
HARRISBURG Breaking ranks with his conservative colleagues, a Bucks County Republican on Thursday said he planned to introduce a bill to impose a tax on natural gas drilling.
\
Rep. Gene DiGirolamo's legislation would enact a 4.9 percent tax on the value of natural gas extracted and sold from state wells, potentially generating close to $640 million for the state next year.
\
""It's going to be a tough budget year,"" DiGirolamo said. ""There is an awful lot of need.""
\
Democrats for years have been lobbying unsuccessfully in the GOP-controlled legislature for a severance tax on drilling in the Marcellus Shale.
\
Gov. Corbett supported the smaller ""impact fee"" approved in 2012, but has opposed a tax, which other natural-gas-producing states have imposed.
\
Corbett's top energy adviser said gas companies have paid the state $2 billion in corporate, income, and other taxes since 2008.
\
""Gov. Corbett is focused on helping to create more jobs for Pennsylvanians, not more taxes that discourage job creation,"" said Patrick Henderson.
\
DiGirolamo said he thinks the topic is worthy of discussion by the legislature. He said he wants to protect the $237 million now going to counties and municipalities under the impact fee.
\
There has been no natural gas drilling in Bucks County, but the county does receive a small amount from the fees.
\
The additional $400 million would be divvied up within the state's general fund, with the largest piece - 40 percent - for education and the rest set aside for the environment, parks, solar energy, and health and human services.
\
DiGirolamo said the total impact fee, paid over 15 years, would amount to less than 2 percent of the value of the natural gas sold from the well. ""Our proposal, like that of so many other states, is to tax the value of the natural gas produced,"" he wrote in his memo seeking cosponsors for the bill.
\
DiGirolamo said the tax is lower than virtually all of those in the other gas-producing states, including neighboring West Virginia, which has a 5 percent gas tax.
\
Some gas companies have threatened to leave Pennsylvania if a drilling tax was imposed. Henderson said they would seek out a ""more favorable business climate.""
\
DiGirolamo doubts that would occur. ""I think the industry is thriving here, and it looks to me that the gas deposits in Pennsylvania are incredible,"" he said. ""This is a reasonable tax, and it's the right thing to do.""

626,"HARRISBURG -- Discussion of the burgeoning Marcellus Shale natural gas issue will take up much of legislators' time today.\House Republicans this morning unveiled a four-part plan for maximizing the use of natural gas pumped from deep underground areas of shale that covers about 60 percent of the state.\Stan Saylor of York, House Republican Policy Committee chairman, proposed these items:\* Since the state has 16,000 vehicles in its fleet, it should gradually ""transition"" them to vehicles that run on natural gas rather than gasoline, ""to reduce the commonwealth's reliance on oil and create a tremendous demand for the natural gas available right here in Pennsylvania.""\Because the state buys new vehicles every few years as the old ones wear out, it would take a few years to completely replace old cars with new ones using natural gas.\* provide tax credits for companies that convert their fleets to natural gas from gasoline.\* offer financial incentives to local governments and mass transit agencies that convert vehicles to natural gas.\* build natural gas stations at every other service station along the Pennsylvania Turnpike so it's easier for drivers to refuel their gas-powered cars.\This afternoon, a coalition of environmental groups will hold a rally here urging legislators ""to adopt a set of actions to protect residents from Marcellus gas drilling.""\These groups, concerned about drilling-related contamination of streams, wells and underground water sources, include Clean Water Action, the Sierra Club, the Gas Accountability Project and Penn Environment.\Also, state legislators later today may discuss House Bill 1489, which would be used to establish the Marcellus Shale gas tax that Gov. Ed Rendell is pushing. But the exact amount and nature of the tax still hasn't been determined."

President Obama's executive order on greenhouse gas emissions is a refreshing first step toward reversing the government's harmful inaction on climate change.
\
With a stroke of his pen, Obama repudiated eight years of the Bush administration's head-in-the-sand approach to global warming. The president directed Environmental Protection Agency chief Lisa Jackson to consider California's request to establish its own limits for emissions from cars and trucks, action that Bush resisted.
\
If the EPA approves the application, as expected, it would allow California and other states, including Pennsylvania and New Jersey, to set tougher emissions standards than the federal government.
\
New Jersey has been at the forefront of efforts to limit carbon dioxide, the gas emitted from vehicle tailpipes and factory smokestacks. In Pennsylvania, cars and trucks produce one-third of the state's air pollution.
\
Obama's action won't impact the environment or public health quickly. In the short term, his order is more important as a clear signal that his administration intends to reverse Bush policies and to actively fight global warming. That's a welcome move, and should send a message to other nations that the United States is ready to lead on this issue.
\
The president also ordered new federal rules directing automakers to start building more fuel-efficient cars, as required by law. This effort places greater costs on the reeling auto industry, but Detroit automakers already bargained for fundamental change when they accepted a bailout by taxpayers.
\
While these strong steps make a statement, there is more to be done comprehensively in Washington. A patchwork of varying state standards on air pollution isn't the best way to attack global warming. Congress needs to take a sterner approach with fuel-efficiency standards, and find a way to cap greenhouse gas emissions nationwide.
\
And, as opposed as motorists are to the idea, raising the federal gas tax still makes good sense as public policy. It would generate money for needed infrastructure projects and encourage more commuters to drive clean cars or use mass transit. The spike last summer to $4 gasoline showed that consumers can change their habits when prices climb.
\
The goals are to reduce dependency on oil, to ease the national security risks that come with such dependency, and to gradually ease a building environmental crisis.
\
The sooner the United States prepares for that future, the better.

628,"KELSEY THOMASSON \KTHOMASSON@LNPNEWS.COM \Lancaster County will receive a little more than half a million dollars as its 2014 share of impact fees meant to help municipalities offset the impact associated with natural gas drilling. \The impact fee law, Act 13, was signed in 2012 by then-Gov. Tom Corbett. The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission is responsible for collecting the fees from drillers and then disbursing the money across the state to facilitate various programs and infrastructure repairs and upgrades. \The payments are due to state agencies and county and municipal governments July 1, according to the PUC. \Lancaster County's 2014 share is $507,694.29 from the state's total of $223.5 million. The county's share was marginally higher than last year's share, while the state's total was marginally lower than the $226 million collected in 2013. \Currently, there is no natural gas drilling in Lancaster County. \According to Act 13, 60 percent of the collected fees are distributed among counties and local governments with unconventional gas wells within their borders. The remaining 40 percent goes to the Marcellus Legacy Fund, which is distributed by the PUC to all counties, regardless of whether it has wells, for various projects. \The amount of funds each county receives is dependent on several demographic characteristics in that particular region, including population, miles of major roadways, or number of bridges. \Lancaster county uses the proceeds for preserving farmlands and repair of public infrastructure such as bridges. \""The impact fee is very valuable to the county. We have invested the legacy portion of the funds in our nation-leading agriculture preserve program directly and with challenge grants to the Lancaster Farmland Trust,"" County Commissioner Dennis Stuckey said. \The fees and other funds will help the county reduce the number of structurally deficient standard bridges from 33 to 13 by 2018. (Overall, there are 64 bridges in Lancaster County.) \The Marcellus Shale Coalition, a drilling industry association, said the money is ""essential"" to county and local government budgets as it helps lower taxes. \""What's more, these special natural gas tax revenues, which are overwhelmingly sent directly to local governments rather than Harrisburg, are enabling important infrastructure and other vital community improvement projects,"" coalition President David Spigelmyer said in a statement."

He said fighting between parties, like that found in Lancaster City, can drive business away since agreements made with government leaders may not be kept after the next election.\ ""We allow minority groups of individuals to spring up and fight a project,"" Kauffman said, adding that this discourages potential investors even if a majority of residents support their efforts.\ He said opponents of development plans should be challenged to come up with realistic alternatives.\ ""If you've got an idea, put it on the table,"" Kauffman said. Poor transportation. For too long, the commissioner said, the county's roads have been neglected.\ He urged people to support a gas tax increase to provide more money for road repairs and said local boroughs or townships should take over more state roads.\ A burdensome regulatory process. By speeding approval of projects inside urban growth boundaries and streamlining state and local requirements, Kauffman said approvals should be issued within 120 days.\ ""If we want to compete...that's where we've got to be,"" Kauffman said, pointing out that businesses today need to move quickly on expansion plans.\ Too little cooperation among institutions that teach workers. ""We must provide specialized job training,"" Kauffman said. ""This is the single largest tool that's available to us.""\ He challenged education leaders to meet and plan a strategy to work together instead of competing for funding.\ EDC and its affiliate, EDC Finance Corp., work to overcome some of these challenges and support existing and new business in the county. Today's breakfast was for the 73 companies that fund the private, non-profit corporations.\ David K. Nikoloff, EDC's executive director, said the agency provided direct assistance to 13 firms in 1996. They received $5.2 million through state and federal programs EDC helped administer. Those projects will create 496 new jobs and retain 2,234 existing jobs in the county. The companies EDC supported pledged to invest more than $115 million in their local operations.\ EDC is involved with the planned move of Harrisburg Area Community College into the former Bon-Ton store on Penn Square and the establishment of Diversified Data Services Call Centers in the former Pinnacle building on Chestnut Street.\ Today's program included comments by outgoing EDC president Ken Stoudt, president of The Stoudt Companies, and new EDC president, W.

I only end up putting half a tank in because it's too high.""\The good news is economists predict lower gas prices by the Fourth of July, leaving plenty of time for summer treks.\Afshar said there's no way to predict how low prices will go. The price jump, he said, was caused by overseas suppliers reducing their inventory, intentionally or because of market uncertainty.\Now, the Iraqis have permission to sell oil, which will lower prices. And the government just defeated a 4-1/2-cent gas tax.\But because we're kicking off the high-travel, high-demand season, prices may not drop significantly.\AAA suggests several gas-saving tips such as traveling with friends to share costs, choosing a destination that won't require use of your car after you arrive and packing carefully to avoid added weight in the trunk.\In the safe-travel department, police are asking motorists to abide by speed limits and other traffic laws and to rest often to remain alert.\The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports highways have never been safer, with more drivers buckling up, asking for air bags and staying sober. The death rate per 100 million vehicles is 1.7 deaths, about half what it was in 1980.\To help ensure the trend continues, Pennsylvania State Police from nearly every barracks will conduct drunken-driving checkpoints over the weekend."

Amid the talk about how much new legislation President-elect Bill Clinton will be able to get enacted during his first hundred days, it might be a source of comfort to the President (and the public) to know that there is at least one campaign promise he can keep without passing any new laws.
\
The promise involves mass transit. ""We are on a threshold of a new era for public transportation,"" Mr. Clinton told the American Public Transit Association in October. The necessary law for accomplishing this is indeed already on the books; all that's needed is to fully fund it.
\
The program is known as ISTEA, which is pronounced just like the name of the rap singer Ice-T (but is no relation) and stands for the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act. It provides money for both highways and mass transit. While more could be done in both areas, it was mass transit that was short-changed under the Reagan and Bush administrations.
\
Fully funding the program would send an immediate signal that the new administration really intends to follow through on its declared intentions of repairing the infrastructure and encouraging development in urban areas. The mass-transit portion would also help clean up the environment and create jobs in industries that build transportation equipment.
\
Under ISTEA, spending for mass transit could be increased by $1.4 billion in the current fiscal year, to $5.4 billion. Highway spending could be increased by $2.5 billion, to $20.5 billion. An innovative aspect of the legislation allows states with urban areas, if they so choose, to use up to 40 percent of their highway funds for mass transit. That could be a great help to the Philadelphia region, where any sane transportation strategy clearly involves a mix of highways and transit.
\
The clause in ISTEA that permits this choice was put forward by U.S. Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan (D., N.Y.) to get away from the tradition of deciding funding priorities based on the Washington clout of the highway lobby. Instead, ISTEA calls for making decisions based on creating the best system of mobility for each state.
\
Not only is the authorization for this spending already enacted, but, more incredibly, the funds have been collected - from the federal gas tax. Much of the money is currently kept in federal trust funds, rather than being expended, to make the federal deficit smaller. It should be acknowledged that, if these funds are spent, cuts will have to made in other programs, or additional revenues collected, to prevent the deficit from mushrooming.
\
However, an executive decision to expedite transportation funding would be an excellent way for the Clinton administration to signal its seriousness about creating economic growth by investing in the nation's future.

632,"The Trump administration has made its case for freezing the so-called CAFE requirement for increased fuel economy in American automobiles. But the argument is less than fully persuasive.\The proposal rolled out last week by the Department of Transportation would halt the mandated increases in fuel economy that are ordered to take place in model years 2021 through 2026. Instead of continuing to rise, the standards would stay the same as model year 2020, when the new fleet will have to average 30 miles per gallon in real-world driving.\The administration is following the accepted protocol for proposing a change in the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standard, and it deserves a hearing. Interest groups and the industry have 60 days to comment before any changes can be adopted.\The auto industry, in agreeing to these standards in 2012, had insisted on a review in 2017 and were assured of it. Instead, according to the auto industry, the Environmental Protection Agency, seven days before Donald Trump's inauguration, rushed the review and unilaterally imposed the final five years of CAFE increases.\The two relevant agencies - the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the EPA - under new leadership now contend that postponing the costly next level of the CAFE mandate - to 54.5 mpg by 2025 - actually will encourage consumers to go out and buy newer, safer cars and will have minimal impact on the environment. They say that imposing the higher standards, on the other hand, would freeze demand.\They argue that the 2021-2026 standards will be significantly costlier and more difficult for car makers to achieve, leading to increasing the price of cars by $2,340. And consumers would balk.\The Trump administration contends that lower car prices will spur consumers to junk their old cars, now averaging 12 years, and replace them with newer cars with better airbags, rear-view cameras and other safety improvements, not to mention the improved engine efficiency already mandated.\There is a case for a CAFE freeze, but there should be congressional hearings and thoughtful national debate on this matter.\No one wants to cripple the American car industry. And if delaying the more demanding CAFE standards gets more people into safer, fuel-efficient cars than immediate application of the more stringent standards, that is a no-brainer. Let's just be sure that this is a solid prediction, based on data, and not a rationalization. There will always be reason to delay strict conservation standards.\The car companies are not all to blame. Americans consumers are driving the market. They roundly prefer bigger cars with more powerful engines to highly fuel-efficient, hybrid or electric cars. With cheap fuel, they have little reason to change. There is no real incentive for Americans to move to smaller, greener cars.\It's a difficult goal, but to achieve conservation, the incentives for auto buyers - not just automakers - will have to change. But no one is saying there is a gas tax in our future, which is something we ought to at least talk about."

634,"Pennsylvania'sstate budget has been balanced in recent years using one-time revenue sources and creative accounting gimmicks.\As Auditor General Eugene DePasquale and Treasurer Joe Torsella recently pointed out, the commonwealth faces a budget imbalance of upward of $3 billion. Cracks creatively can be papered over; a chasm is, or should be, a different story.\It is therefore high time that the General Assembly consider a fair and reasonable natural gas severance tax.\Pennsylvania remains the only major natural gas-producing state without a drilling tax. We have a modest impact fee, which should be preserved, but the nonpartisan Independent Fiscal Office found that the fee translates into the lowest effective natural gas tax rate in the United States.\Placing a fair and reasonable tax on top of the impact fee, which in sum would be about the same rate as the severance tax rate in neighboring West Virginia, would yield hundreds of millions of extra dollars per year in revenue for the commonwealth.\While natural gas prices have been sluggish at times, listening to the industry and its supporters would make people think that we're talking about a struggling corner grocery and not some of the largest, most profitable corporations on the planet.\Anyone doubting the ability of the gas industry in Pennsylvania to pay the same tax here that it pays in all the other states in which they do business should consider:\? Natural gas dramatically has displaced coal as a source of electricity generation in the past decade. In the northeastern states, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, gas increased its share of generation from 23 percent to 41 percent from 2006 to 2016, while the share of coal decreased from 31 percent to 11 percent. These trends are expected to continue.\? The industry continues to build out a spider web-like network of local and long-distance pipelines to get gas to market. As the citizens of Lancaster, Chester and many other counties well know, federal law presents tremendous obstacles in terms of limiting this development.\? Pennsylvania's gas industry has the best location near lucrative markets of any state. This strategic location will be enhanced this year with the opening of a liquefied natural gas shipping terminal in northern Maryland, and the potential development of such an overseas terminal in Philadelphia.\? With the assistance of the largest state tax break in Pennsylvania history, Shell Chemical Appalachia will construct a huge petrochemical plant in western Pennsylvania that will provide a significant market for Pennsylvania natural gas.\In light of this undeniable momentum and industry profitability, Pennsylvania's refusal to enact a fair and reasonable severance tax is foolish and costly.\A portion of the tax revenue could help address our staggering budget deficit.\It could also help fund public education, strengthen the stitching of our human services safety net for times of need and provide valuable investments in the environment, such as our popular Growing Greener program that is in dire need of new funding.\Along with Republican Tom Murt of Montgomery County and Democrats Harry Readshaw of Allegheny County and Pam DeLissio of Philadelphia, we have crafted House Bill 1401 that would impose a 3.2 percent tax on top of Pennsylvania's impact fee to create an overall tax rate similar to that of neighboring West Virginia.\The issue is whether we have the courage to move forward.\Credit: Gene DiGirolamo and Steve Stroman"
635,"
Washington will spend $24,106 per household in 2007, the highest total since World War II and an inflation-adjusted $4,000 more than in 2001.
\
The federal government will collect $21,992 per household in taxes. The remaining $2,114 represents this year's budget deficit per household, which, along with all prior government debt, will be dumped in the laps of our children.
\
Washington will spend this $24,106 per household as follows:
\
Social Security/Medicare: $8,301. The 15.3 percent payroll tax, split evenly between the employer and employee, covers most of these costs. If nothing is done, taxes eventually will need to rise by $11,651 per household (adjusted for both inflation and rising incomes) to pay all promised benefits.
\
Defense: $4,951. The defense budget covers everything from military salaries to operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to the research, development and acquisition of new technologies.
\
Anti-poverty programs: $3,550. Nearly half of this spending subsidizes state Medicaid programs that provide health services to poor families. Federal anti-poverty spending now tops 3 percent of GDP for the first time ever, and state and local governments add another 2 percent of GDP.
\
Interest on the federal debt: $2,071. The federal government is $9 trillion in debt. It owes $5 trillion to public bond owners and the rest to other federal agencies (mostly to repay the Social Security ""trust fund,"" which lawmakers raid annually). Despite rising debt, record-low interest rates have limited costs.
\
Federal employee retirement benefits: $907. This spending funds the retirement and disability benefits of federal employees, including the military.
\
Health research/regulation: $664. This spending is up 51 percent since 2001; much of this growth is concentrated in the National Institutes of Health.
\
Veterans' benefits: $627. The federal government provides income and health benefits to war veterans. Spending is up 36 percent since 2001.
\
Education: $584. Education spending is primarily a state and local function; 9 percent of the total comes from Washington. Federal education spending has surged 62 percent since the 2001 enactment of the No Child Left Behind Act.
\
Highways/mass transit: $418. Most highway and mass-transit spending is financed by the 18.4 cent per-gallon federal gas tax.
\
Justice administration: $392. Justice spending includes federal attorneys and prisons, as well as law enforcement grant programs. New homeland security costs have added $100 per household to justice spending.
\
Natural resources/environment: $305. This includes national parks, federal lands, water projects and environmental clean-up.
\
International affairs: $304. This includes foreign economic and military assistance, operation of American embassies abroad and contributions to organizations such as the United Nations.
\
Unemployment benefits: $299. Unemployment costs fluctuate based on the number of unemployed Americans. This year, unemployment costs are decreasing as job growth continues.
\
Community and regional development: $282. The doubling of spending in this category since 2004 comes from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which is financing much of the Hurricane Katrina relief.
\
The programs listed above cover $23,655 per household. The remaining $451 is allocated to all other federal programs, including farm subsidies, social services, space exploration, air transportation and energy.

636,"
When you're writing about a highway, the middle of the road is a pretty dangerous place.
\
Three weeks ago, I wrote a column about the newly opened I-476, the Blue Route of endless controversy, which links I-95, just north of Chester, with the Schuylkill Expressway near Conshohocken and the Pennsylvania Turnpike at Plymouth Meeting.
\
The point was that this is a highway that is very well-designed, and obviously much needed, though because it is several decades late, its impact on development will probably be greater at either end than along its route. The column also warned against the seductiveness of this suddenly open road and noted that such apparent freedom has substantial costs, both monetary and environmental.
\
This column has produced more interesting mail than anything I have written in a long time. It elicited criticisms from some that it exemplified the mind- set that kept the highway from happening for so long, and from others that it was too gentle and unspecific about the difficulty in sustaining an automobile-borne society.
\
There were letters that took me to task for not mentioning the handsome stonework near the Route 30 exit, or the plan to build a Turnpike-I-95 interchange in Bucks County. Another said PennDot did too little to facilitate traffic flow where the Blue Route's exits meet arterial roads. Still another pointed out that many decisions about the road came from political expediency rather than sound policy and argued that another of the proposed routes would have been better.
\
This strong response reminded me that such highways are truly public works, perhaps the only ones that our society regularly produces. This column often
\
considers symbolically public works, such as downtown plazas incorporating works of art, or malls and other places where people come together in environments that are attractive precisely because they are under private control. But high-speed, limited access highways are concrete, deeply sincere statements about the shape of the civilization we are creating.
\
This is particularly true for the United States, a nation conceived in terms of personal liberty, which has been inextricably linked with physical mobility. The open road has been a powerful image for centuries, even though it was the railroad that really made our transcontinental expansion possible.
\
While other cultures may be able to deal with transportation as a practical matter of moving people and things from place to place efficiently, Americans seem doomed to grapple with it as an existential one. We are born free, but we are everywhere in traffic jams. And that feels like a betrayal.
\
Commuting times are increasing, as are the number of trips being made, which involve costs in productivity, energy and pollution. I believe that such a wasteful use of land tends to diminish both the natural landscape and the opportunities that emerge when people live closer together. One letter-writer termed me ""an elitist troglodyte."" As it happens, I don't live in a cave, but I do walk to work, certainly a primitive activity. Modern man drives to the health club, gets on the treadmill and never faces the risk of meeting someone coming in the opposite direction.
\
Louis F. Hansell of Drexel Hill took exception to my statement that many of Philadelphia's older suburbs, including some along the Blue Route, create harmonious landscapes that should be preserved in some way:
\
""The 'haves' - old money - always promote 'preserve,' "" he writes. ""They preserved, for example, joblessness in Chester. They 'preserved' cars idling . . . along Route 320 in Swarthmore, or Bryn Mawr, at many intersections along Haverford and Lancaster Avenues, among other places. My commute is an example. A 39-minute ride is now 21 minutes at the same rush hour. My engine is off 36 more minutes per day. Who is measuring this benefit? I travel most of the journey at 55, a speed at which my engine is more efficient by at least 20 percent. Who is measuring this benefit?""
\
As it happens, I also heard from Richard Voith, senior economist of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, who has been trying to measure such benefits, along with their costs. ""The implication that Blue Route users ultimately pay for the cost of the highway through fuel taxes is not quite right,"" he says, in what a study he enclosed reveals to be an extreme understatement.
\
As he summarizes in the letter: ""User fees from gasoline and other taxes will cover less than 10 percent of the fully amortized cost of the Blue Route. Every car using the Blue Route has an implicit subsidy of over $1.60 per trip""
\
Crudely put, Louis Hansell's time-saving drive will cost him about 32 cents a day in user fees, which is probably a good buy. His trip will cost the rest of us about $2.88 a day in subsidies. This may actually be a worthwhile expenditure; we'd need more information on his automobile emissions, about the value of his time and about the cost of providing alternatives to be able to judge for sure.
\
And although we might not know the result of such calculations, simply doing them makes what seems at first to be a private matter into a public concern. You have to ask whether there might not be a more efficient way to transport this commuter. And you also have to ask whether, as taxpayers, we might find a better use for this nearly $700 a year in public subsidies for his commute.
\
Voith adds, ""Some areas, such as older cities, are not well-suited to new highway construction, but motorists in these cities still generate substantial amounts of gasoline tax revenue. These revenues may be diverted to areas more suitable to highway construction, in effect subsidizing the growth of outlying areas. City motorists may be better off spending their gas tax revenue on improved public transportation rather than these distant highways.""
\
You should note that Voith is making this argument quite narrowly. He is predicting a benefit for the city motorist - in the form of less street congestion - rather than for city residents in general, many of whom already depend on mass transit. He is suggesting that it is possible to defend mass transit not as a service for those who don't drive but as something that makes life easier for those who do.
\
Riders of some of SEPTA's suburban lines receive per-trip subsidies much larger than that provided the Blue Route driver. Sprawl is expensive, no matter how you choose to move around it. But while subsidies of transit riders are frequently the subject of public scrutiny, debate and annual appropriations, highway subsidies are viewed as an entitlement and rarely discussed at all.
\
This leads back to the issue of democracy and elitism. I left myself vulnerable on this issue by saying that the houses and landscapes of pre-World War II-suburbia, of which Philadelphia still has quite a lot, should be preserved.
\
It is tempting to contrast these privileged, mostly custom-designed dwellings in generous, well-considered settings with the mass suburbia of the post-war era and see the first as oppressive and the second as democratic. If you are placing blame for the plight of Chester, however, you can begin by looking at the public policies of the immediate post-war era. These were designed to generate a high level of consumer spending and not let the economy fall back into a depression. Thus, mortgage guarantees were available for new houses, but not for old ones. Racially mixed areas were, for several years, explicitly excluded from federal mortgage guarantees.
\
Physical dispersion of both housing and employment was encouraged as a matter of policy, because it was believed to make the country less susceptible to bombing. This was backed up with highway programs that encouraged dispersal, in the name of national defense, and not incidentally, helped the automobile industry.
\
Americans have long been accustomed to seeing their house as their chief source of personal wealth, and in most outlying areas, continuing investment in roads and other public improvements has helped support this.
\
For all these reasons, living in a post-World War II suburb has long been the most rational choice a family can make. People follow subsidies, even when they don't call them by name. And the mechanism that Voith describes, by which new highways continually open up new areas of low-cost land and inexpensive development, keeps the metropolis expanding. Such roads as Route 422 to
\
Pottstown and beyond, and Route 55 to Vineland are even now beckoning businesses and residents to places they had never considered before. The ultimate impact is longer commutes, more traffic, and less opportunity for those who can't afford cars and insurance.
\
This has been the American way for the last 50 years or so. It isn't the only way, or necessarily the best way, and its limitations have been ever more evident, in the form of congestion, pollution and loss of community values and natural landscapes.
\
The future shape of American life is an issue of increasing interest and urgency. The growth of Los Angeles is increasingly being regulated on the basis of air quality, and the city is building a subway. Meanwhile, we're opening the Blue Route.
\
Keep those cards and letters coming. And happy motoring!

Big money grab
\
EDITOR: In the spirit of your request for residents and officials to press ahead to articulate the best use of gas tax revenue, I would like to expand on your editorial titled ""Gas boom tax revenue must remain locally--Part 2.""
\
The comment you made, ""We favor a severance tax with the majority of the money reverting to local governments,"" could be viewed as a ""fair"" and common sense stand on a severance tax issue. But unfortunately we are not discussing an issue of designing a fair severance tax. What we are dealing with is a big government money grab. The governor is seeking a severance tax to help fill the void in the state's $3.5-billion deficit, not to reconcile the industry impacts, along with adding additional burden of a personal income tax increase of just over 16 percent.
\
That brings us to my question I asked of all the commissioners last Thursday. I preluded my question, by acknowledging Mr. Smith had met with the governor, about the state budget, as it had been reported in several media outlets. My question was: Did you discuss with the governor about the governor's proposed severance tax and proposed 16-plus percent increase in the personal income tax, and do you support these tax increases? Commissioner Smith said those issues never came up with the governor, but did respond in the affirmative to supporting the severance tax as you reported in your editorial. Also as you reported in your editorial a respectful debate ensued between commissioners Mclinko and Smith. When I was able to redirect Commissioner Smith back to my question he never responded to the PIT increase and was unwilling to discuss the severance tax as a budget issue. These questions were never asked of Commissioner Smith in any of his post governor meeting interviews and I was hoping to get the taxpayers some insight to these very important state budget issues that will impact all taxpayers of this county. It is unfortunate; Commissioner Smith squandered the opportunity he had with the governor.
\
The governor and his supporter's ideology, on taxing us out of this deficit, is best described by President Reagan when he said ""Government's view of the economy could be summed up in a few short phrases: If it moves, tax it. If it keeps moving, regulate it. And if it stops moving, subsidize it."" I would propose that if a severance tax becomes an absolute necessity then and only then it should be looked at, and designed to fill the needs identified. We shouldn't assume that generalized impacts are sufficient reason to tax it.
\
The gas companies didn't cause the state deficit nor did any other private industry in this county. So why don't we treat the gas industry as any other industry coming to Pennsylvania and give them a business environment that would be conducive for them to flourish, and in turn, our communities will flourish.
\
As our legislators battle the next few weeks to bring us a balanced budget, let's not become confused between our wants and needs; phone, fax, or e-mail them and let them know we can afford, NO NEW TAXES.

This system can remain sustainable only if there are enough workers to support all retirees, which is why it risks collapsing under the weight of 77 million retiring baby boomers.\ Defense: $4,951.

639," Borrowing a slogan from the labor movement, House Democratic Leader H. William DeWeese urged local Democrats to ""agitate, educate and organize"" in their quest to become a political force in Republican Lancaster County.\ DeWeese delivered a 20-minute pep talk, noting that during a recent trip to Mexico he was startled to learn that although more than 50 million of the country's 94 million people live in an economically middle-class environment, it is only in the last decade that democratic government has grown at the local level.\ ""Eighty-three percent of the people who live on this orb live under the iron boot of a dictatorship,"" DeWeese said, noting the absence of democracies on almost the entire continents of Africa, Asia and South America.\ In most of the world, people are threatened by the political establishment if they gather in small groups in their living rooms to ""figure out how to get a few more of us rather than a few more of them, and try to get a handle on who is going to run the show.""\ So, DeWeese advised the local Democrats to press on in Republican Lancaster County, because ""We have that opportunity.""\ About 100 people turned out at the Days Inn on Keller Avenue Thursday night to help local Democrats raise money. Kay Angermier, party chairperson, estimated the party raised about $6,000 from the dinner.\ Angermier called the dinner a success, but it was not without some glaring problems, most of them related to scheduling.\ The party leadership decided to hold its biggest fund-raiser Thursday, not realizing that there were other events that would take some of the party's stars away from the dinner.\ Mayor Janice C. Stork and state Rep. P. Michael Sturla did not attend because they had accepted an invitation to speak to Leadership Lancaster alumni.\ The Democrats also have a mayoral primary battle going on, and the party's two mayoral hopefuls, Councilwoman Billie Jo Herr and former Councilman Jon C. Lyons, arrived late _ DeWeese had departed for his Greene County home already _ because of a mayoral debate Thursday.\ Bill Saylor, retired WGAL-TV newscaster and former state Senate candidate, quipped that DeWeese had to leave early because he wanted to get as much driving in as possible before Gov. Tom Ridge's 3 1/2-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax increase kicks in.\ Most Democratic lawmakers opposed the gas tax increase on the grounds the state has a huge surplus that made it unnecessary this year.\ The two Democratic mayoral hopefuls kept their remarks brief when they did arrive, and neither had an unkind word to say about the other.\ Herr said, ""I hope that you all will be behind me 100 percent, thank you, and when we move into the mayor's office and a majority on City Council in January, I hope we're all out there for the party."" Lyons followed, declaring, ""We're going to win the mayor's office. We're going to have a Democrat who's the mayor. We're going to have a Democratic City Council. And, we're going to show them how we can transform the city and make the city the best place in Lancaster County to live.\ ""We're going to do that, and we're going to build a Democratic Party out to the county.""\ The Democrats also heard brief remarks from candidates for Council, appellate court judgeships, and courthouse row offices.\ Jennifer Kiralfy and Scott Brubaker, who work for the House Democrats in Harrisburg, were named Democrats of the Year. They will be married this weekend."

Since 1980, the Pittsburgh region's biggest problem has been lack of population growth. Just about every financial challenge we have faced during that 35-year period was the result of losing jobs in and related to the manufacturing of steel.
\
While we have grown other industries such as health care, education and technology, our population has remained flat.
\
That condition began to change about three years ago due to the growth of the natural-gas industry. For the foreseeable future, our best and perhaps only chance to see that magnitude of growth of jobs and population in Southwestern Pennsylvania will be the continued development and maturity of that industry.
\
During the gubernatorial campaign of 2014, then-candidate Tom Wolf ran on a platform that primarily featured one issue: the imposition of a natural-gas extraction tax, the proceeds of which were to go to public education.
\
Since becoming governor, he has introduced an extraction tax and wellhead fees that total almost 9 percent.
\
The governor claims his proposal will raise $1 billion for education and will also replace the 3-percent impact fee now being paid by the drilling companies, the proceeds of which are going to local municipalities and several state government departments.
\
What is not being said is that because of our inordinately high business taxes, gas drillers are paying more in combined state taxes in Pennsylvania than they pay in most other states, including those that impose an extraction tax.
\
Also consider the state taxes being paid by the many thousands of new workers in the gas industry and by the multitude of landowner recipients of gas lease payments.
\
Two problems stand in the way of the governor's proposal: First, given the current price of natural gas, an increase of this magnitude will result in either a drastic reduction or a curtailment of drilling. Second, even in the unlikely event that drilling would continue at or near its current level, the governor's numbers don't add up to the promised $1 billion. The real net gain is more likely to be closer to half that amount.
\
Since the Republican-controlled state Senate and House are unlikely to pass a plan that imposes such a draconian increase on an industry that is providing most of the economic growth of the commonwealth, a better approach is needed.
\
Gov. Wolf, please take a deep breath, have a cold Yuengling and reconsider your gas tax proposal.
\
Your goals of improving education, health care and the environment are all worthy endeavors but will not likely be accomplished unless we grow our economy.
\
The economy and the population grow when jobs are created. Please don't put our best opportunity to achieve that outcome in jeopardy.

Two political newcomers challenging state Rep. Tom Stevenson for the Republican nomination have similar plans: Cut state spending.
\
Daniel Hackett and Mark Harris will square off against Stevenson in the 42nd District in the May 16 primary. The winner will face Matt Smith in the November election. Smith is running unopposed in the Democratic primary.
\
The 42nd District includes Mt. Lebanon, Green Tree, Rosslyn Farms, Thornburg and parts of Scott and Bethel Park.
\
Both Hackett, 49, and Harris, 21, are making their first runs for political office. They jumped in after Stevenson voted for a controversial pay raise that hiked lawmakers' salaries 16 to 54 percent last summer. Stevenson voted for the pay raise and accepted the money early as unvouchered expenses, but paid it back shortly after lawmakers repealed the raise last fall.
\
Hackett and Harris said the pay raise shows Stevenson is out of touch with his constituents.
\
The incumbents ""forgot who their bosses are,"" Hackett said. ""They forgot they're public servants.""
\
A self-employed financial planner, Hackett, of Mt. Lebanon said he would neither accept nor vote for a pay raise, nor would he accept a state-paid rental car. He suggested putting future lawmaker raises up for voter referendum.
\
Hackett said he would accept cost-of-living increases, state-paid health care and a state pension.
\
He favors legislature reforms, including eliminating per-diem payments to lawmakers, reducing the size of the Legislature and eliminating Community Revitalization Grants, once called Walking Around Money.
\
He advocates smaller government and wants to create a more business-friendly environment by reducing the corporate net-income tax and immediately eliminating the capital stock and franchise tax.
\
Harris, of Mt. Lebanon, will be graduating from George Washington University a few days after the election. While attending school, he works as a self-employed Web page designer for nonprofit and political groups.
\
""It's time for change,"" Harris said. ""People are fed up. The problems the state faces are not new. Nothing has been done.""
\
Harris said he would neither vote for nor accept a pay raise. He would also reject a state-paid rental car but would accept mileage reimbursement for business trips. He would accept state-paid free health care as long as the Legislature remains a full-time job but said he would not accept a state pension.
\
Harris also said he would like to reduce the size of the Legislature, cut corporate net income taxes, lower the gas tax and reform the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. He wants to move away from property taxes by allowing school boards to levy income or sales taxes.
\
Stevenson, who is completing his fifth term, said his experience and his accomplishments should not be overlooked.
\
He touted his Hero Scholarship bill, which allows children of police officers, firefighters, paramedics and National Guardsmen killed in the line of duty to attend state colleges for free. He also pointed to laws allowing start-up companies to sell tax credits for cash in order to keep expanding their business and helped pass a law that reduces taxes for movies filmed in the state by 20 percent.
\
""I have a proven track record and good constituent services,"" Stevenson said.
\
Stevenson said he apologized to his constituents for the pay raise and after listening to their feelings about it, voted to repeal the raise. He said he will accept cost-of-living increases.
\
He does not have a state-paid rental car but does have a state car from the general fleet. He says it's cheaper to drive that car than to file for mileage reimbursements.
\
Stevenson said that since he's paying into the state pension plan he will accept a state pension.

Recently, the natural gas and petroleum industry has been inundating newspapers and the airwaves against Gov. Wolf's proposed 5 percent natural gas severance tax, which was the centerpiece of his election campaign. They are pulling out all the stops to scuttle this keystone of the governor's proposed budget.
\
As a good Republican, taxes aren't my favorite thing. However, Pennsylvania continues to face massive shortfalls in state revenues and severe deficits. Despite the cry of many of my fellow Republicans that Harrisburg has a spending problem, not a funding problem, Pennsylvania has major challenges that only the executive and legislative branches working together can solve.
\
In addition to the blame-game debates on education spending and public-sector retirement plans, infrastructure like our bridges and roads are simply crumbling. And while the imposed increases in the gasoline tax will ease some of the transportation burden, it doesn't provide enough revenue to fix all the problems.
\
That's why I suggest that Pennsylvania follow the lead of Texas. It may surprise you to know that the home of Rick Perry and Ted Cruz maintains a 7.5 percent severance tax on natural gas. A 2012 Texas State Report shows that the natural gas tax saved Texas from a massive increase in the deficit, and continued education funding. If only Pennsylvania would have been so forward thinking, our financial woes would have been far less severe. We can't change the past, but we can create a better future.
\
I'll be honest; I have mixed feelings about natural gas.
\
Leaks in the natural gas infrastructure help create smog, unconventional drilling uses massive amount of precious water, and improper well construction can lead to groundwater pollution. And methane, the major component of natural gas, is 86 times more potent as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide.
\
Despite these problems, the reality is that natural gas drilling and production will continue in Pennsylvania, and we need to do it as safely as possible and have it benefit all Pennsylvanians.
\
Our Pennsylvania Constitution states: ""The people have a right to clean air, pure water, and to the preservation of the natural, scenic, historic and esthetic values of the environment. Pennsylvania's public natural resources are the common property of all the people, including generations yet to come. As trustee of these resources, the Commonwealth shall conserve and maintain them for the benefit of all the people.""
\
In accordance with our Constitution, let's stop playing politics, stop listening to the special interests who wish to profit only for themselves, and urge Gov. Wolf and the Republican-controlled General Assembly to work together to pass a budget in the best interests of all Pennsylvanians.
\
The budget must include not only the 5 percent natural gas severance tax, but use the revenue to work for us all. As requested in the governor's budget, the extraction fees should be used to help fund education, act as a down payment for providing our kids a clean energy future, and provide additional drilling inspectors to defend our children's health.
\
We have the chance to work together and provide a good today and a better tomorrow.
\
May God shed His grace on our elected leaders so they can find common ground to benefit all Pennsylvanians.

OUR ENERGY policy resembles the strategy employed by a little kid who holds her hands over her ears while humming loudly so as to keep from hearing something she doesn't want to hear.
\
It doesn't work for 6-year-olds - and it won't work for a nation that turns 232 next month.
\
A gallon of gas now costs $4+ and is on its way to $5. The rapid increase in prices over the past few months has triggered a downward economic spiral. Our dependence on foreign oil has taken our national security out of our own hands and placed it into the palms of Middle Eastern dictators and Venezuelan eccentrics. In the meantime, the climate change aggravated by burning fossil fuels is quickly approaching the point of no return.
\
Yet Tuesday, the U.S. Senate couldn't bring itself to pressure the big oil companies to spend more on research and development of renewable fuels. Republicans threatened to filibuster a bill to impose a 25 percent ""windfall-profits tax"" on the five top oil companies in the United States that have logged a half-trillion dollars in profits since 2001, while eliminating $17 billion in tax breaks.
\
Democrats were nine votes shy of the 60 needed for cloture, but even if the bill had passed, President Bush had vowed to veto it.
\
The increase in taxes that the legislation would have produced wasn't meant only to channel the anger and frustration of American consumers. Under the bill, the tax money would have been used to create an Energy Independence and Security Trust Fund, with the goal of reducing dependence on foreign and ""unsustainable"" energy sources.
\
Meanwhile, oil companies could avoid the windfall-profits tax if they invested in research and development of renewable energy - that is, new ways to make profits.
\
That's a meaningful incentive, but Big Oil was having none of it. The only proposal they and their minions have for dealing with the crisis is to increase the supply of what they sell now, not what they could develop for the future. Their one-note refrain: drill, drill, drill -especially in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
\
Never mind that, even if we were to destroy that precious environment, oil from the ANWR would result in a few-cents-per-gallon reduction in U.S. gas prices at most, and that wouldn't happen for at least a decade. It would not address a major cause of rising prices- increased demand from developing countries like India and China.
\
Lots of American drivers have figured this out already. They refused to fall for the phony promise of a ""gas tax holiday"" promised by presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and John McCain. To the surprise of some economists, many consumers have begun to alter their behavior: They're driving less. Consumption is down 4.7 percent from Memorial Day 2007, according to the Energy Department.
\
They're using public transportation more: Ridership is at the highest rate since 1957, reports CNN. They're ending their romance with big cars, dumping them abruptly as they would a philandering fiance.
\
The rejected Senate bill would have imposed new regulations on speculation in oil commodities, which could have stabilized gas prices somewhat. But the truth many people don't want to hear is that never again will there be enough oil to meet the demand generated by Americans living their lives in the 21st century. Our future is dependent on increasing renewable energy resources.
\
High gas prices have led us to a crossroads as a nation this election year. Can we switch course to pursue alternatives to oil, or continue down the path that got us to where we are now?
\
At the end of that road is a sign that reads, ""Dead End."" *

644,"Gov. Tom Wolf’s address to a joint session of the General Assembly Tuesday drew mixed reactions from pundits statewide and from our own community members of the Westmoreland and Valley News Dispatch editorial boards. Here are their responses to the governor’s remarks and his 2018 proposed budget:\In listening to Gov. Wolf’s address, the one item that struck me is his quote that Pennsylvania is a better place to do business because of the tax structure.\Overall Pennsylvania is in the top 15 states of the country with the highest tax burdens when you look at the overall tax structure. Our personal tax burden may be in the bottom 10 states, but you also need to look at our gas tax, which is in the top 10 states; our sales tax and real-estate taxes are in the top 15 states; our beer tax is one of the lowest in the country; our cigarette and liquor taxes are in the top 15 states; our spending per pupil and teacher pay are in the top 15 states; our higher education is in the bottom of the states; our police and roads spending is in the top 20 of the states.\With all these other tax burdens, is Pennsylvania’s burden on its businesses and individual families mild or steep?\— Eric Elia Bononi\Westmoreland Tribune-Review Editorial Board\I thought the governor’s speech was very reasonable and forward-looking. I like the emphasis on education at all levels and especially the need for a severance tax. I’ve never understood why Pennsylvania allows out-of-state industries and businesses to take our natural resources (that can only be found here) and pollute our environment without paying the state for it. Seems rather shortsighted, given that we’re still cleaning up the mess from the last industrial age.\— Phyllis Framel\Valley News Dispatch Editorial Board\We need more “investment.” Translation: We need more money. It’s like a broken record. Never a thought about spending less. Despite the governor’s streamlining government and reducing costs, we always see an increase in the budget; just once can we see it not increase? Another plea for a severance tax — sure, only if a law is passed that reduces our state income taxes dollar for dollar with severance tax dollars.\— Reed PedersonWestmoreland Tribune-Review Editorial Board\I read through the text of the governor’s address a couple times. It sounds more like a campaign speech than a budget, long on past successes and short on specific details. It did not address the billions of dollars of state deficit. In fact, he is increasing spending — not a good recipe for fiscal responsibility.\— Vince Mercuri Valley News Dispatch Editorial Board\As a mother to two school-aged boys, investing in our schools is of the utmost importance. However, Western Pennsylvania houses a good portion of the worst districts in the state. Which makes me question if investing money really equates to better performance. With an astronomical amount of student debt, brought on by my chosen (or lack thereof at the beginning) profession, I was pleased to hear Gov. Wolf push for an increase in Pennsylvania’s trade and apprenticeship programs. I was also pleased to hear Wolf address the opioid epidemic. However, arming law enforcement with “the tools they need” is just the tip of the iceberg: You save lives and then allow them to go right back to it, creating a habitual cycle that is draining the already limited funds.\All in all I was pleased to hear of no new tax increases and trimming government officials, pensions and pay.\— Anna Morcheid Joyner Westmoreland Tribune-Review Editorial Board"
645,"
Slashing the state budget and implementing government reforms dominated discussion at Wednesday morning's legislative debate, an annual forum organized by the Schuylkill Chamber of Commerce.
\
The debate was hosted by the Pottsville Club, 201 S. 26th St., Pottsville, and included the six candidates for the state House of Representatives in the Nov. 2 election.
\
State Reps. Neal Goodman, D-123, Jerry Knowles, R-124, and Tim Seip, D-125, were in attendance, as were their challengers, Republican Ettore DiCasimirro, Democrat Jeff Faust and Republican Mike Tobash, respectively.
\
Schuylkill County's VISION co-sponsored the debate.
\
Republicans focused on cutting ""wasteful"" spending from the budget, as well as creating a more business-friendly environment in Pennsylvania.
\
""Pennsylvania is one of the most expensive states to do business in,"" Tobash, a 20-year veteran of the insurance industry, told the crowd. ""I think what we ought to do is make it more friendly for (companies) to do business here.""
\
Knowles called the state budget ""totally unacceptable,"" citing its growth from $20 billion less than a decade ago to about $28 billion now.
\
DiCasimirro called for the legislature to lower or eliminate state property taxes while also taking shots at Goodman.
\
""My opponent ... promised jobs that never came,"" DiCasimirro said, claiming Democrats like Goodman and Gov. Ed Rendell have fallen short on their pledges to create jobs and grow business.
\
While defending his record and his nearly eight years of service to his constituents, Goodman didn't take DiCasimirro's bait.
\
""I'm not going to get into a personal spat with my opponent,"" Goodman said.
\
Seip also bashed Tobash for his use of ""half-facts,"" which included Tobash's and other Republicans' claim that a pending tax on Marcellus Shale natural gas extractions - the House has passed legislation imposing a tax, while the Senate has not - would represent one of the largest taxes ever passed in Pennsylvania.
\
Instead, Seip focused on how he helps his constituents and related several personal stories of people who come to his 125th legislative district offices looking for assistance.
\
""You can either send someone back to Harrisburg who really cares or you can send an insurance man,"" Seip said.
\
Meanwhile, with Knowles zeroing in on state spending, his Democratic opponent said lawmakers must exercise extreme caution when taking a knife to the budget.
\
""We have to be careful that we don't have blanket cuts that hurt our senior citizens,"" Faust said.
\
Many believe Republicans are poised to make big gains in next month's election in both state and federal races. If that happens, Knowles promised GOP leadership will address major challenges on Pennsylvania's horizon.
\
Those challenges include: fixing a looming pension crisis driven by growing benefit payments to retired state workers; securing adequate funding for road and bridge repairs across the state in lieu of a plan to toll Interstate 80; and cutting government red tape with respect to small businesses and local government initiatives.
\
Knowles also addressed unemployment compensation, promising the Republicans would look for ways to fix a system which he said often rewards people who are not truly trying to get back on their feet.
\
""There are some people ... who may not be working (to find) jobs"" while receiving unemployment benefits, Knowles said.
\
On the pension front, the Democrats also promised action. Goodman said the pension system cannot be allowed to ""collapse under its own weight,"" and said a long-term fix must be put in place before it's too late.
\
Goodman also said he's prepared to make the ""tough votes"" when it comes to transportation funding, admitting that it appears a gas tax hike or increases to car registration and other driver fees may be the only options left to raise needed funding for infrastructure repair.
\
""My people do not have a metro"" system, Goodman said when describing how important it is for his constituents to have quality roads.
\
The legislators and their challengers also answered questions about clean energy, specifically whether it is the government's role to mandate use of wind or solar power, for example.
\
""I don't think it's the government's role to pick winners and losers,"" Knowles said.
\
""Clean energy should come, but it should come at a proper pace,"" Faust said.

646,"Two bad choices\As I read John Grogan's column, ""Not speaker, or speaking, either,"" from Dec. 8, I was sad to realize that even a victory for Democrats will ring hollow on Jan 2.\I found no satisfaction in the fact that Pennsylvania's choice for speaker of the State House of Representatives could boil down to Republican John Perzel, who rigorously defended the indefensible lawmakers' dead-of-night pay raises, or to the Democrat minority leader, Bill DeWeese, who used Gestapo tactics to demote 15 Democratic House members who refused to vote in favor of it.\Pennsylvanians of both parties deserve better.\Paula Eagle\Malvern\City needs the Pearl\As mayor, John Street has not always displayed a keen sense for watershed moments - those historical developments that carry a great deal of symbolic capital in a city desperate for any sign that its fortunes are on the rise. The Pearl Theatre and its adjacent retail and residential development in North Philadelphia is an anchor in more ways that one - a seed of economic activity and the vibrant street life North Broad Street so desperately needs, and a development that, if successful, will show the way for others to pour money and talent into the area.\It is essential that the mayor take strong steps now to quickly reverse the negative tide created by the shooting near the Pearl. Whatever it takes: a drastically increased police presence; reaching out to developer Bart Blatstein to formulate a security plan; and, to take a page from Newark Mayor Cory Booker, the appearance of the Street himself, late some evening when movies are letting out.\For the sake of this city, the Pearl cannot be allowed to fail. The mayor needs to show us - not just tell us - that he understands this.\James Sturdivant\Narberth\Invest in transit\Re: ""Heading toward a ditch,"" Dec. 3:\Kudos to the Governor's Transportation Funding and Reform Commission for its clear-eyed assessment of Pennsylvania's transportation system and the need for additional investment in infrastructure. The federal, state and local funding now spent in the region is barely sufficient to maintain the system. It does not provide for safety improvements, operational enhancements and capacity increases in our highway and transit systems. Investing in transportation can help rebuild our communities, improve our environment, and grow our economy.\A 2005 Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission survey found that 49 percent of the region's residents would support an additional 5-cents-a-gallon gas tax if the money were reinvested in local transportation needs, with 62 percent of those preferring the funds be used for roads and transit (which is prohibited under the state constitution). A 2006 IssuesPA/Pew poll found that 71 percent of Philadelphia residents and 59 percent of suburban residents would support a regional tax to fix deteriorating roads, and 64 percent of Philadelphia residents and 41 percent of suburban residents were in favor of a regional tax for public-transportation services.\Now, we need 51 percent of our representatives in Harrisburg to support the recommendations of the commission's report to secure additional transportation funding for Pennsylvania. We can't afford not to.\Barry Seymour\Executive director\Delaware Valley Regional\Planning Commission\Philadelphia\Profiting from Iraq\The Dec. 7 article ""The real focus is Bush,"" about the Iraq Study Group's report, quotes Tony Snow, the White House press secretary, as saying that the ""White House was 'not going to outsource the business of handling the war in Iraq.'

War may be hell, but, I suppose, for some it's just one great big business deal.\Robert J. Rosania\Phoenixville\ \Credit: "

When a Texas gas company hired Michael Pascuzzi's earth-moving business to build two water impoundments, he sat down at his desk and cried.
\
The family-owned company had been headed for bankruptcy.
\
""We were real close to throwing in the towel,"" said Nicholas Pascuzzi Jr., Michael's father and president of their McDonald-based company, New Dominion Construction.
\
Marcellus shale saved the company, fresh evidence of how the commercial discovery of gas in the deep shale formation boosted the economy of Western Pennsylvania during a national recession.
\
Still, gas companies need to do more, Gov. Ed Rendell said Tuesday on a visit to Washington County.
\
Rendell wants a 5 percent severance tax on gas sales and a flat tax of 4.7 cents for each thousand cubic feet of gas produced. State lawmakers agreed during budget negotiations this summer to enact a natural gas tax by Oct. 1.
\
""There's no doubt that this activity and this industry is creating new economic opportunities for our state, but it also creates a lot of new challenges for the host communities and poses a threat to our environment,"" Rendell said.
\
The candidates seeking to replace Rendell at the end of the year have different opinions. Fellow Democrat Dan Onorato, the Allegheny County executive, said he favors a ""competitive"" severance tax. Republican Tom Corbett of Shaler, the state attorney general who promised not to raise taxes if elected governor, opposes the levy.
\
If Pennsylvania enacts a severance tax, it needs to be competitive with other shale gas states, and lawmakers should not do so with a short-sighted view of filling a one-year budget hole, said Kathryn Klaber, president of the Marcellus Shale Coalition.
\
""It doesn't do anybody in Pennsylvania any good to chase away capital investment,"" Klaber said.
\
New Dominion has built landfills for 12 years, but with the economic slowdown, companies and consumers are tossing less garbage. The Pascuzzis' annual revenue fell to barely $8 million, leaving them at least $2 million in the hole, Michael said.
\
This year, with the Marcellus business, New Dominion could make more than $14 million. Most of the company's work comes from Range Resources, a Fort Worth firm with a Cecil office, and Talisman Energy, a company from Calgary, Canada, with offices in Warrendale.
\
Michael said his family fears a slowdown in gas development, and orders dropped suddenly in the late summer. A severance tax on natural gas could slow development more, Michael said.
\
Range encountered temporary delays on permits from state and local agencies, said spokesman Matt Pitzarella.
\
""Every single time we go to a new municipality ... they write the rule book over again,"" he said.
\
Michael said he remains optimistic. He spent most of his career on the road, following work in other states. Now, he rarely leaves Washington County.
\
""It's good to finally see something positive in the economy here,"" he said. ""Not only have we got an economic engine, we've got one of the baddest engines in the world right now.""

648,"Congress should get rid of fuel taxes and move toward a system that charges road users for the miles they travel, a leading national research organization said Wednesday.\A report by the RAND Corp. explored several different mechanisms for switching to a vehicle-miles-traveled fee, ranging from having motorists self-report their odometer readings to sophisticated onboard devices that track where and how far a driver goes.\A growing body of transportation experts, including two commissions established by Congress, has concluded that the per-gallon gasoline taxes that currently fund the lion's share of highway budgets are obsolete and inadequate.\The 18.4-cent federal gas tax hasn't been increased since 1993, and the advent of more fuel-efficient and alternative-fuel vehicles has further eroded that revenue source, causing the federal Highway Trust Fund to become insolvent.\""Failure to raise fuel taxes in recent years to keep pace with inflation and improved fuel economy has created significant transportation funding shortfalls at the federal and state levels,"" said Paul Sorensen, lead author of the RAND report.\""The prospect of more fuel-efficient conventional vehicles and alternative-fuel vehicles in the coming decades -- though clearly beneficial in terms of the environment and energy security -- threatens to make funding challenges worse. Shifting from fuel taxes to mileage-based road use fees would help to overcome this problem, and there are several promising options for implementing such a shift.""\Since 1980, the total number of vehicle miles traveled in the United States has doubled but fuel consumption has increased only 50 percent, RAND reported. Charging by miles driven would place the burden for maintaining roads and bridges on those who use them most.\Any transition to a vehicle-miles-traveled, or VMT, fee would have potential drawbacks and might be controversial, the organization acknowledged.\Researchers said three options offered the most promise.\Mileage could be estimated based on fuel consumption. Vehicles would be equipped with an electronic ID tag, and when they are refueled, electronic readers at the pump would calculate the vehicle's fuel economy and determine its estimated mileage based on the gallons purchased. The VMT fee would be added to the purchase price.\The other two options involve using cellular technology or global positioning systems to track a vehicle's travel. The most sophisticated system also could be used to vary the VMT fee based on how many miles are driven during peak times on congested highways. So-called ""congestion pricing"" -- charging more for peak-period travel on crowded roads -- has been effective in encouraging drivers to shift their travel to off-peak times and less-congested routes.\The authors noted that systems that trace a driver's whereabouts and travel times would generate privacy issues.\""Even though people's movements can now be tracked to some extent through their cellular phone records, law enforcement officials often need a court order to access that data. Consumers will be understandably concerned about on-board devices tracking their vehicle's position and movement, and will want safeguards as to what kinds of data are recorded and who has access to that information,"" said Martin Wachs, director of RAND's transportation, space and technology program.\The RAND researchers rejected options that involve self-reported odometer readings or annual odometer inspections as unreliable and too difficult or expensive to administer and enforce.\VMT metering equipment could be phased in as consumers buy new vehicles, Mr. Sorensen said.\Liisa Ecola, another co-author, said there was no guarantee that VMT fees would be any less controversial than increasing gasoline taxes. ""However, it's clear that the present system isn't working and fees based on vehicle miles traveled, if properly implemented, could result not only in more money to support the nation's transportation system, but also spread the cost burden in a more fair and equitable way."""
649,"
If Gov. Ridge was trying to make a splash last week by previewing some spending proposals in advance of his Tuesday budget address, he may have fallen somewhat short.
\
The three initiatives he put forward - a tax cut for people who use natural gas, a 3.3 percent increase in state education funding, and a plan to restructure environmental spending without increasing it - did not set the state capital abuzz.
\
But if, as his communications director insists, Ridge simply was trying to highlight more modest features of his budget that could be eclipsed by bolder pronouncements Tuesday, then the governor accomplished his mission.
\
``This is a way of drawing attention to small slices of the budget that could have been ignored,'' Ridge spokesman Tim Reeves said. ``These things are important, but they're not the policy equivalent of taking your clothes off.''
\
Traditionally in Harrisburg, Reeves said, the budget was locked away like a military secret, and then the whole package was dumped on reporters at one time. Significant proposals got lost, he said.
\
Last year, the Ridge team began announcing some proposals in advance of the formal budget address to the legislature, in the hope of drawing media attention to them. It worked, so the strategy was repeated this year.
\
Ridge parceled out the budget news at three public appearances, but it was somewhat overshadowed by spicier developments surrounding public financing of stadiums and legalized gambling.
\
The setting of Thursday's announcement of the natural gas tax cut was a home in New Cumberland, near Harrisburg. Ridge said he wanted to eliminate a 5 percent tax that about 2 million Pennsylvanians pay. The average family that uses gas for heat would save $55 per year, Ridge said, and it would cost the state treasury $80 million in annual revenue. The tax has been a sticking point in negotiations to bring gas competition to the state, and Ridge said he wanted to end it for that reason.
\
Much of Harrisburg, however, was busy trying to sort through the latest stadium funding proposal from House Majority Leader John Perzel, who wants to lend the teams $320 million at no interest rather than give it to them.
\
Ridge drew more attention - if not universal praise - from two other proposals. On Monday, in a speech before the Pennsylvania Press Club, he presented his education spending plan for a 3.3 percent increase in state education subsidies.
\
The proposal included a new $35 million program to strengthen primary-grade reading instruction, which Ridge first discussed during his reelection campaign. But otherwise it broke little new ground, mirroring Ridge's past practice of increasing education subsidies at slightly more than the rate of inflation.
\
Overall, it included about $190 million in new money for the state's 501 school districts and would increase state education spending on elementary and secondary education to $5.8 billion. It drew criticism from school boards and teachers advocates, who called for more money.
\
On Tuesday, Ridge turned to the environment, touting a ``Growing Greener Initiative'' to redirect $1.3 billion in spending over five years. Ridge said the plan would allow the state to spend more wisely. No additional money was proposed.
\
On Friday, Ridge released a $1.6 million plan to connect 4,000 day-care centers to the Internet.
\
Reeves promised more dramatic strokes in Tuesday's speech.
\
Democrats were less than impressed - so far.
\
``The governor proposed no bold initiatives for education, and did nothing about reducing property taxes,'' said Bill Patton, a spokesman for House Minority Leader William DeWeese. ``There's a small program to let toddlers play on the Internet, while thousands of them don't have health insurance. It's just more of the same pabulum he's given the state for five years.''

Since 1980, the Pittsburgh region's biggest problem has been lack of population growth. Just about every financial challenge we have faced during that 35-year period was the result of losing jobs in and related to the manufacturing of steel.
\
While we have grown other industries such as health care, education and technology, our population has remained flat.
\
That condition began to change about three years ago due to the growth of the natural-gas industry. For the foreseeable future, our best and perhaps only chance to see that magnitude of growth of jobs and population in Southwestern Pennsylvania will be the continued development and maturity of that industry.
\
During the gubernatorial campaign of 2014, then-candidate Tom Wolf ran on a platform that primarily featured one issue: the imposition of a natural-gas extraction tax, the proceeds of which were to go to public education.
\
Since becoming governor, he has introduced an extraction tax and wellhead fees that total almost 9 percent.
\
The governor claims his proposal will raise $1 billion for education and will also replace the 3-percent impact fee now being paid by the drilling companies, the proceeds of which are going to local municipalities and several state government departments.
\
What is not being said is that because of our inordinately high business taxes, gas drillers are paying more in combined state taxes in Pennsylvania than they pay in most other states, including those that impose an extraction tax.
\
Also consider the state taxes being paid by the many thousands of new workers in the gas industry and by the multitude of landowner recipients of gas lease payments.
\
Two problems stand in the way of the governor's proposal: First, given the current price of natural gas, an increase of this magnitude will result in either a drastic reduction or a curtailment of drilling. Second, even in the unlikely event that drilling would continue at or near its current level, the governor's numbers don't add up to the promised $1 billion. The real net gain is more likely to be closer to half that amount.
\
Since the Republican-controlled state Senate and House are unlikely to pass a plan that imposes such a draconian increase on an industry that is providing most of the economic growth of the commonwealth, a better approach is needed.
\
Gov. Wolf, please take a deep breath, have a cold Yuengling and reconsider your gas tax proposal.
\
Your goals of improving education, health care and the environment are all worthy endeavors but will not likely be accomplished unless we grow our economy.
\
The economy and the population grow when jobs are created. Please don't put our best opportunity to achieve that outcome in jeopardy.

651,"Alan Greenspan yesterday said the odds of a recession have grown since earlier this year, even though ""the economy is not doing badly at this stage.""\In an interview with The Associated Press, the former Federal Reserve chairman put the odds of a recession at greater than 1 in 3. ""But best I can judge, it is less than 50 percent,"" he said.\Mr. Greenspan's 1-in-3 prediction earlier this year rocked Wall Street, which has been suffering through a period of turbulence. A deepening housing slump and a spreading credit crunch have raised fears on Wall Street, on Capitol Hill and on Main Street about the country's economic health.\Many analysts are counting on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates today to provide some relief.\On other issues, Mr. Greenspan said the United States must look at ways to reduce gasoline use, both as a matter of national security and to protect the environment. Mr. Greenspan said he favors a tax on gasoline to help curb demand. But recognizing that this could be an ""undue burden"" on poor people, he suggested a rebate of some sort. There is a national gas tax of 18.4 cents a gallon.\The interview with Mr. Greenspan dovetails with the release of his new book, ""The Age of Turbulence: Adventures in a New World.""\He also expressed frustration about expanding social programs, especially at a time when a wave of 78 million baby boomers will start to retire next year -- putting a huge burden on the nation's resources. He singled out Medicare, which is projected to go bust by 2019 unless something is done.\""The whole slew of candidates -- it's mainly Democrats, but some Republicans -- want to add to it more,"" Mr. Greenspan said. ""Nobody wants to ... look at the issue and come up with a rational solution. This is, I regret to say, irresponsible.""\In his book, Mr. Greenspan suggests that Medicare benefits would have to be cut substantially for the affluent, whom he envisions having copayments approaching 100 percent.\His concerns come as Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton yesterday unveiled a health care plan built around universal coverage. The price tag: about $110 billion a year.\Mr. Greenspan ran the Fed for 18 1/2 years, under four presidents, until early 2006. His utterances can still move markets, even though he is no longer at the central bank and now runs his own economic consulting firm. He acknowledged that his musings on the economy can complicate the job of his successor, Ben Bernanke.\""It complicates it a little, and that's the reason why I've been working so hard to keep it down,"" said Mr. Greenspan, adding that he mostly talks off the record and behind closed doors. He said he does not talk about monetary policy."

TOMORROW, Gov. Rendell will give
\
his eighth and final budget address. That budget will include a $450 million deficit, much smaller than last year's
\
$3.2 billion hole.
\
This time around, the process must not be allowed to drag on for months, as it did last year.
\
One obvious solution to nailing it down quickly: The legislature should take a harder look at closing some glaring tax loopholes. In good times, these can be merely annoying - in bad times, they are unjustifiable. Some of the items now exempt from state taxes: smokeless tobacco, helicopters, candy bars, dry cleaning and legal services. And there are many others.
\
But the easiest to deal with should be the natural-gas extraction tax. Last year, the governor proposed a tax on gas from the newly discovered wells in the Marcellus Shale region. The proposal would have generated $632 million over the course of five years, but Rendell scrapped the idea, saying he was worried about hurting an infant industry.
\
Gas companies may just be getting started, but extraction will soon be big business. There are massive gas deposits under almost every part of the state (except right here in the southeast). This natural resource has the potential to transform the state's economy, especially in rural areas that have been hammered by job losses.
\
Managing this new industry is a major challenge for state government. We have to create an environment that encourages job creation but also takes long-term steps to invest in Pennsylvania's future. A tax on natural-gas extraction has to be part of that equation.
\
Thirty-nine other states with natural-gas deposits all have some kind of tax on the industry. Companies consider it the cost of doing business. Adding our own state tax to the mix will not hurt our ability to compete.
\
If we need any more evidence of that, consider what happened when the rights for drilling for natural gas in state forests were auctioned off. Officials expected to raise $64 million. Instead, gas companies coughed up $128.5 million. Clearly, these same companies can afford the tax.
\
Make no mistake: We need the revenue from a new tax to offset the negative impact of natural-gas development. Mining can threaten wildlife, pollute the local water supply and erode the fertile topsoil needed for farming.
\
The state will have to boost funding for environmental monitoring and safety protections for workers. Also, many of these mines will lead to economic development in rural communities. That's a good thing, but it also means that state and local government will have to invest in basic infrastructure like roads and sewers.
\
Some of the revenue should also be set aside to invest in building the state's green economy. We already have incentives for alternative energy companies. These could be expanded with a portion of the extraction-tax revenue. Ultimately, the state's energy sector should include natural gas, solar and wind.
\
Some of the money must also go to the general fund. In tough economic times, the state can't afford to turn away revenue from a new source. Most businesses are hurting right now and paying less in taxes. It's only fair that companies making big profits from drilling pay their fair share.
\
The main reason a gas tax failed to pass during the last budget cycle was the automatic opposition of many lawmakers to any new taxes, an unworthy response to a major financial challenge.
\
We can have an honest debate about taxes and spending, but Pennsylvania must take the steps necessary to make sure our natural wealth benefits everyone.

653,"
A bill to give each state lawmaker a $10,000 raise cleared its first legislative hurdle yesterday, winning the unanimous approval of the Senate Revenue, Finance and Appropriations Committee.
\
The bill would boost the annual pay of each Senate and Assembly member to $35,000 in January 1990, six years after the last legislative pay increase took effect. The Senate president and the Assembly speaker would continue to get one-third more.
\
In addition to working toward pay raises, legislators took actions yesterday to grant reductions in charges for cable television, to abolish the Department of Energy and to increase the state gasoline tax.
\
The pay-raise measure, already agreed to by legislative leaders in both houses, now heads to the Senate floor. Passage is expected both in the upper house and in the Assembly, where an identical bill is pending.
\
The bill, if approved, would mark the third straight time in the last decade that the legislature has acted immediately after an election to vote itself a raise. The last such votes came in January 1978 and January 1984.
\
Key lawmakers have been quietly discussing a pay raise for weeks, but the necessary legislation was not introduced until Dec. 10 in the Assembly and Monday in the Senate.
\
Sen. Matthew Feldman (D., Bergen), a sponsor of the Senate's pay-raise bill, said the growing demands of the job and the need to ensure that top- quality people run for the legislature necessitated a raise.
\
""Legislators should not make a personal financial sacrifice to be here,"" Feldman said before the Senate committee voted on the bill.
\
In other action yesterday, the Senate approved legislation that could grant rate reductions and afford greater privacy to cable-television subscribers. The three bills involved had been approved by the Assembly but now must return to the lower house for concurrence with minor amendments made by the Senate.
\
""This legislation is consumer-oriented,"" said Assemblyman Walter M.D. Kern (R., Bergen), a co-sponsor of all three cable measures. ""It is very important.""
\
One bill establishes the Cable Subscriber Privacy Protection Act and was sponsored by Kern and Senate President John F. Russo (D., Ocean). It would regulate the collection, use and disclosure of information about a subscriber by the cable company. The measure is intended to protect the privacy of subscribers who use cable television services, without hampering the ability of cable companies to conduct business.
\
Another measure would grant subscribers credit for interruptions in their service. The bill, also sponsored by Kern and Russo, would require cable companies to return to the subscriber a full day's credit for any day in which a cable television failure lasted at least six hours.
\
The third measure was introduced by Kern and Senate Majority Leader John Lynch (D., Middlesex). It would prohibit cable companies from assessing a surcharge on subscribers who have connected videocassette recorders or amplifiers to their television sets.
\
A bill to raise New Jersey's gasoline tax by 2 1/2 cents a gallon was amended and approved by a legislative committee yesterday and now awaits a vote by the full Senate.
\
The two-part proposal approved by the Senate Revenue, Finance and Appropriations Committee would channel funds raised by the tax increase to extend the life of the Transportation Trust Fund, a state program that pays for highway and bridge construction and mass-transit improvements.
\
It would also increase by 2 cents a gallon the amount of the current 8- cents-a-gallon gas tax that is dedicated to transportation programs. The trust fund is due to expire this year.
\
In other action, the state Energy Department, which was already gutted by Gov. Kean, would be abolished under a bill approved yesterday by the Senate Energy and Environment Committee.
\
If approved by the full Senate and signed by Kean, the bill would pave the way for creation of a cabinet-level Department of Veterans Affairs.

654,"We sometimes wonder if those running for governor understand what awaits them.\This year Democrat Dan Onorato and Republican Tom Corbett are vying to succeed Ed Rendell. Governors rarely have an easy time of it in Pennsylvania, even when the economy is humming along. Faced with a depressed economy, whomever is elected faces a difficult four years ahead.\Onorato, the Allegheny County executive, is being coy about how he will shape future budgets, suggesting he will cut spending but not saying where or how deeply he will cut.\Corbett, the state attorney general, is doing his best George H.W. Bush impersonation. All that's lacking from his vow not to raise taxes is the ""read my lips"" line.\Here's the dilemma:\With the elimination of $2 billion in federal stimulus funding, the legislative and teacher pension bump, increased payments to repair roads and reduced tax revenue due to the economic downturn, the next governor faces a budget shortfall of $5 billion to $8 billion.\Balancing the budget means that programs will have to be cut and state revenue will have to be increased.\But how?\Corbett has said he will not raise taxes. He is opposed to taxing natural gas extraction from the Marcellus shale deposits. That's a position that not only puts him at odds with his own party, but with most Pennsylvanians. It has been reported that the natural gas industry has pumped more than $700,000 in contributions into his campaign.\Corbett's vow not to raise taxes is, to an extent, a practice in semantics. Earlier this month he said he would consider raising the amount employers and employees pay into the state's Unemployment Compensation Fund. When asked about that, he chose to call the increase a ""contribution"" rather than a ""tax."" That, of course, would have been an involuntary contribution. He has since backed away from the idea.\Corbett also opposes increasing gasoline taxes, but has said he would consider charging drivers a fee for every mile they drive or for driving in designated congested areas.\For those who thought Rendell's idea of leasing the Pennsylvania Turnpike was nutty, Corbett said he would consider selling the turnpike.\He also has said he might consider funding the Pennsylvania state police from the general fund as opposed to using gasoline taxes and vehicle registration fees.\Onorato has not taken the gratuitous no-tax-hike pledge. He understands that a natural gas tax is essential to regulate the industry and to provide the necessary funds to protect the environment. He will work to close the Delaware loophole that allows 71 percent of Pennsylvania companies to avoid paying taxes in Pennsylvania by incorporating in our neighboring state. He wants to lower business taxes and said he will work to reform the current pension system, which he termed ""unsustainable and indefensible.""\As Allegheny County executive, Onorato streamlined county government. He cut the county workforce by 10 percent and consolidated five 9-1-1 call centers into one that covers the entire county.\He was willing to take on unions by cutting jobs when necessary, yet has received the backing of organized labor in his bid for governor.\Onorato has demonstrated an ability to get things done. He understands the need to impose taxes where necessary and to cut the size of government. He is committed to continuing the educational gains made by Pennsylvania students over the past eight years.\The next governor faces a host of challenges. It is our view that Dan Onorato is the better candidate to tackle those issues."
655,"Lancaster County is home to 11,000 companies, so why worry about attracting new ones, Terry Kauffman asked this morning.\""We're bright, we're rising, but there's some clouds on the horizon,"" the chairman of the Lancaster County Commissioners told his audience of business leaders.\At the associate member breakfast of the Economic Development Company of Lancaster County, Kauffman outlined those clouds:\* An environment that's not always attractive to business.\When executives want to build a new plant, Kauffman said, they look for stable politics. He said fighting between parties, like that found in Lancaster City, can drive business away since agreements made with government leaders may not be kept after the next election.\""We allow minority groups of individuals to spring up and fight a project,"" Kauffman said, adding that this discourages potential investors even if a majority of residents support their efforts.\He said opponents of development plans should be challenged to come up with realistic alternatives.\""If you've got an idea, put it on the table,"" Kauffman said.\* Poor transportation. For too long, the commissioner said, the county's roads have been neglected.\He urged people to support a gas tax increase to provide more money for road repairs and said local boroughs or townships should take over more state roads.\* A burdensome regulatory process.\By speeding approval of projects inside urban growth boundaries and streamlining state and local requirements, Kauffman said approvals should be issued within 120 days.\""If we want to compete...that's where we've got to be,"" Kauffman said, pointing out that businesses today need to move quickly on expansion plans.\* Too little cooperation among institutions that teach workers.\""We must provide specialized job training,"" Kauffman said. ""This is the single largest tool that's available to us.""\He challenged education leaders to meet and plan a strategy to work together instead of competing for funding.\EDC and its affiliate, EDC Finance Corp., work to overcome some of these challenges and support existing and new business in the county. Today's breakfast was for the 73 companies that fund the private, non-profit corporations.\David K. Nikoloff, EDC's executive director, said the agency provided direct assistance to 13 firms in 1996. They received $5.2 million through state and federal programs EDC helped administer.\Those projects will create 496 new jobs and retain 2,234 existing jobs in the county. The companies EDC supported pledged to invest more than $5 million in their local operations.\EDC is involved with the planned move of Harrisburg Area Community College into the former Bon-Ton store on Penn Square and the establishment of Diversified Data Services Call Centers in the former Pinnacle building on Chestnut Street.\Today's program included comments by outgoing EDC president Ken Stoudt, president of The Stoudt Companies, and new EDC president, W. Kirk Liddell, president and chief executive officer of Irex Corp."

I don't know about you people who are glad the election is over; I miss it already. It combined the suspense of ""Monday Night Football,"" the drama of a TV soap opera and the cheap thrills of a Madonna video.
\
It is time, however, to give it a rest - after one last look at the the fictions already being told about it. All history being revisionist, let me be the first to revise the following:
\
* The campaign, in its later stages, degenerated into a name-calling contest. It was no contest. President Bush and his minions did virtually all of the name-calling, from bimbo eruptions to bozos.
\
Bill Clinton kept a relatively respectful attitude toward the president, responding to his taunts more in sorrow than in anger, and Ross Perot was absolutely adamant about maintaining a decorum redolent of a school board meeting.
\
All in all, the campaign was carried on at a higher level than in 1988. We are thankful for small mercies.
\
* Perot forced the other candidates to concentrate on the issues. As a matter of fact, not even Perot concentrated on the issues.
\
He spent tens of millions on TV ads, almost all aimed at convincing us he was what Mother Teresa would be if she had his money. His treatment of his plan for saving the economy - a gas tax, cutting Social Security - was at best perfunctory.
\
This left the other two candidates free to talk around the issues - health care, education, the environment - without seriously confronting the financing.
\
* The press was unfair to George Bush. I can't tell you how much that charge hurts me (Oh, I could, but I'm laughing too hard). People confuse fairness with kindness. The press was not unfair to Bush, it was unkind. And he deserved it. He ran a slanderous campaign based largely on falsehood and exaggeration.
\
If you have to spend most of your time pointing out that the candidate is lying, naturally it's going to look as though you're being mean to him.
\
* This was a watershed election. Probably not. Clinton will take office with a $350-billion deficit and a $4-trillion debt facing him. His room for maneuver is slight.
\
Should there be an international crisis soon or a major failure of our banking system, he'll be baling water, not shedding it.
\
If, on the other hand, he manages to rebuild the Democratic coalition and restore the image of government as a useful tool for progressive reform, it will prove to have been a watershed election. He's a long way from there.
\
* President Bush was badly hurt by Perot's candidacy. Not really. If anything, Perot hurt Clinton more than Bush; more likely, he hurt both equally.
\
Pat Buchanan was the one who did Bush in. In the New Hampshire prima ry, he opened a wound that would not close, then at the Re publican Na tional Conven tion he poured salt into it.
\
More impor tantly, his attack on the president as a moderate cross-dressing to look like a conservative spooked Bush into spending the first three- quarters of the campaign trying to win the hearts of radical right-wingers who, after all, had no place else to go.
\
The President never recovered his stride after those early Buchanan hits. In the end, he didn't lose because he had too many enemies; he lost because his friends didn't like him.
\
* Clinton doesn't have a mandate to govern. Of course he has a mandate; all presidents do. While Clinton's might be a weak one, it is fairly clear. If you combine the Clinton and Perot votes, you get 62 percent of the electorate saying: ""Don't just stand there, DO something."" That's the mandate.
\
This election, by the way, provided a great demonstration of the value of the Electoral College. Without it, Clinton would be the most feeble of winners, commanding the support of well under half the electorate.
\
Instead, he carried 32 states, got 370 electoral votes and has the look of a landslide winner.
\
Other than that, everything you've read about the election is probably true, or half-true.

657,"
Because of the effects of climate change and globalization, the world right now faces ""incredible opportunities masquerading as insolvable problems,"" said Thomas Friedman on a recent visit to Philadelphia. The New York Times columnist and best-selling author of The World Is Flat was in town for a World Affairs Council luncheon to promote his new book, Hot, Flat, and Crowded.
\
Friedman's book centers on his call for a ""green revolution,"" and the need for America to be at the forefront of that revolution, both in order to lead the rest of the world and to enhance America's security.
\
""This book masquerades as a book about energy and the environment, but actually it's a book about America,"" and how the country can ""get its groove back.""
\
Friedman detailed what he sees as the five major problems facing the world, which include climate change, what he called ""petrodictatorships,"" energy poverty, inverse supply and demand for energy and natural resources, and declining biodiversity
\
""We humans have introduced so much CO2 into Mother Nature's operating system that we no longer know the difference between an act of God and an act of man,"" said Friedman, referring to global warming's effects on, say, hurricanes. He said global warming would lead to ""global weirding,"" in which extremes get more extreme - wetter wets, hotter hots and greater force behind weather events like tropical storms.
\
The columnist likened world climate to body temperature - ""very small changes in temperature can have big, big effects,"" he said, using the example that when a person's body temperature rises just two degrees above normal it may not be much, but a rise of two degrees beyond that can lead to real trouble and hospitalization.
\
However, he joked, one of the benefits of the advances in medicine is that all the climate deniers will live long enough to see the actual effects of climate change.
\
Part of the reason the country has lost its groove, Friedman said, is because it lost its main competitor - Russia. Hot, Flat, and Crowded touches on the innovation spurred by the Cold War, which led to space exploration and rapid advances in technology, among other things.
\
""We've gotten disconnected,"" Friedman said. ""The country that's always exported hope now exports our fear.""
\
He continued: ""Our government today can no longer solve any big, intergenerational problem, and, as a result, all the innovative capacity that still exists in this country"" can't be harnessed by the government-He likened the country to a rocket without enough power to escape the atmosphere and get into orbit.
\
In the same way that the revolution in information technology dominated the end of the 1990s, Friedman predicted the world's next great global industry would be environmental technology, or ""ET"" Truly going green will only be accomplished by innovation, he said, not by more regulations or a modernday Manhattan Project.
\
""We need 100,000 people in 100,000 garages trying 100,000 different things,"" maybe two of which will work, he said.
\
'PETRO-POLITICS'
\
In the meantime, Friedman said Americans have been funding terrorists with our gas dollars, while at the same time funding our own armed forces and the war on terror with our tax dollars. Those monies spent at the gas pump, he said, go to ""petrolist"" countries, including Russia, Nigeria, Iran and Venezuela - countries where the price of oil and the pace of freedom are inversely correlated.
\
That's also detailed in the book, where Friedman provides a number of charts outlining those correlations. He also calls for a gas tax to spur innovation.
\
""There's one word you should never use about the green revolution, and that's 'easy,'"" said Friedman. A green revolution will require sacrifices, and if America is going to lead the revolution, then the country will have to be willing to bite the bullet.
\
""When everybody's a winner in a revolution, that's not a revolution - that's a party.""

658,"The nation has gone backward in the last four years from an already sorry performance in maintaining vital infrastructure, a national engineers group reported yesterday.\""America's infrastructure rates a cumulative grade of D,"" the American Society of Civil Engineers said, citing delayed maintenance and chronic underfunding of roads, bridges, transit, dams, aviation and other infrastructure.\The organization issued its comprehensive 2009 Report Card for America's Infrastructure yesterday as a U.S. Senate committee wrestled with ways to come up with more funding, including Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell's proposal for a federal capital budget funded by borrowing.\The organization said surface transportation and aviation systems have declined since its last report card in 2005, with aviation and public transit falling from D+ to D and roads from D to D-.\""Americans spend 4.2 billion hours a year stuck in traffic at a cost to the economy of $78.2 billion, or $710 per motorist,"" the report said. ""Poor conditions cost motorists $67 billion a year in repairs and operating costs.""\The group estimated that $2.2 trillion must be spent in the next five years to restore the nation's infrastructure to good condition. ""Current spending amounts to only about half of the needed investment,"" it said.\The organization's president, D. Wayne Klotz, said spending more money on infrastructure ""is important, but the solution will involve more than just money. It will take sound technology, wise community planning and involved citizens willing to partner with the government and private sector to make real change.""\The report was cited frequently at a hearing yesterday in Washington, D.C., of the U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works Committee attended by Mr. Rendell and U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood. While the parties generally agreed on the need for increased infrastructure spending, they disagreed on how to raise the money.\Mr. Rendell said current federal funding levels won't allow states to tackle big new transportation projects. ""It's impossible to do anything but fixing, repairing, maintaining,"" he said.\He said the federal governments should, like state and local governments, adopt a capital budget with borrowing that spreads the cost of projects over 20 or 30 years ""instead of all up front.""\He called for creation of a national infrastructure bank that could leverage private investment and would choose projects for funding based on merit, rather than the politics-driven earmarking process now in place.\""I think the American people will support common-sense infrastructure investment,"" Mr. Rendell said.\He said he supports an increase in the federal gasoline tax, which hasn't been raised since 1993, but said that was only part of the solution.\The committee chairwoman, Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said she was ""averse"" to raising the gasoline tax and cool to the idea of abandoning a pay-as-you-go system of funding transportation improvements.\With Congress set this year to fashion a new multiyear transportation funding bill, Mr. LaHood said ""there's a very strong commitment from President [Barack] Obama to put everything on the table, see what ideas stick, what makes sense.""\But on a federal gas tax increase, he said: ""That's off the table right now"" because of ""hard economic times.""\Ms. Boxer noted that the federal stimulus legislation provided $48 billion for transportation improvements, including $27.5 billion for highways, that she said would improve infrastructure and create jobs.\The bill ""was a good start, but it is not enough. We must have continued investment to maintain these jobs, and to make additional, needed improvements to our transportation infrastructure,"" she said.\""It is important to note that the $27.5 billion for highways in [the] stimulus is in no way a substitute for the hundreds of billions needed to address our nation's infrastructure crisis,"" said Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla.\""Transportation and infrastructure are not all that complicated,"" said Sen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont, an independent.\""The bottom line is ... if you allow your infrastructure to deteriorate year after year after year, you don't put funding into it, you know what? It's going to get worse. And that is precisely what we have done as a nation.\""The irony is it costs more to rebuild crumbling infrastructure than to simply maintain it. We have been really dumb and we have wasted enormous sums of money.\""We are going to have a great debate on how we raise the money, but we must raise that money."""
659,"WASHINGTON -- Ohio Gov. John Kasich's rejection of federal high-speed rail projects isn't necessarily a death knell for a Pittsburgh-to-Cleveland rail corridor but it could mean a temporary ""railway to nowhere"" that stops before it gets to Ohio.\Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood was adamant Wednesday in a meeting with regional reporters that decisions by Mr. Kasich and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker to turn down high-speed rail funding will not impact surrounding states' chances to get hold of the $53 billion over six years the Obama administration is proposing as part of the president's budget, to be released next week.\Mr. LaHood compared the administration's goal of connecting 80 percent of the country via high-speed rail over the next 25 years to the interstate highway system. It will be done in increments, and the administration doesn't know where the money is coming from yet, but Mr. LaHood vowed it will get done.\""There was ridicule when they started building the interstate system when they built Peoria to Bloomington,"" Mr. LaHood said. ""It didn't go anywhere except to Peoria and Bloomington. You know what now, though? Peoria's connected to Chicago and Bloomington's connected to St. Louis by the interstate. These things take time.""\When asked directly about a much-discussed rail route from Pittsburgh to Cleveland, Mr. Lahood said he had a meeting scheduled this week about ""some different corridors in that region.""\""Our investments on high-speed rail have gone to the states,"" he added. ""They provide the match money. And, you know, some of the members in this region are interested in high-speed rail, so we're going to talk about it.""\Mr. LaHood, joined at the meeting by Jason Furman, deputy director of the National Economic Council, was just as vague when talking about how the funding would come from the newly tight-fisted Congress. Mr. LaHood said there will be no gas tax hike -- the traditional method of funding for transportation bills -- but didn't throw out any ideas on how to pay for the funding increases.\In his State of the Union address, President Barack Obama said he will freeze domestic discretionary spending. But his budget will increase transportation funding -- with $8 billion in fiscal 2012 going to high-speed rail -- because of its job-creating possibilities and the poor state of the nation's infrastructure, with cuts coming elsewhere, Mr. Furman said.\""The president had to make a set of tradeoffs, a set of difficult choices in an environment where the budget as a whole is very tough, is coming down,"" Mr. Furman said. ""There are important areas where he chose to increase investment, transportation being one of them.""\Republicans, who now control the House, have derided Mr. Obama's ""investments"" as just more spending at a time when the spiraling public debt must be brought under control. Mr. Furman countered that the president's bipartisan fiscal commission determined transportation funding should not be cut because of its importance.\Mr. LaHood, said he still hopes to get a transportation bill to Mr. Obama's desk by August -- even though the last Congress, controlled entirely by Democrats, was unable to pass a full reauthorization.\Key House Republicans -- including transportation chair John Mica and railroads subcommittee chair Bill Shuster of Blair -- have called the high-speed rail funds a boondoggle that could be better used in proven, high-traffic areas like the Northeast.\But Mr. LaHood insisted that a nationwide high-speed rail network was not only possible but essential for the country.\""This is a vision of the president to connect America,"" he said. ""The same vision that President [Dwight] Eisenhower had about connecting America with the interstate. And what do we do? We did it. Because we do big things"""
660,"
Safeguards against underage consumption of alcohol have been planned into Gov. Tom Corbett's proposal to privatize the state liquor store system, Corbett's deputy chief of staff said.
\
Luke Bernstein, a Conyngham native, told those in attendance at a special Red Carpet Luncheon hosted by the Greater Hazleton Chamber of Commerce on Monday at the Valley Country Club about the governor's $28.4 million 2013-14 budget proposal.
\
Two of the four main components of the proposal are to sell the state liquor store system, which would raise $1 billion, and use that money to enhance the state's education system.
\
Opponents of the sale are fearful only big-box retailers will be able to afford the liquor sales licenses the state will sell, and that the sale of liquor in a retail environment will make it easier for kids to get their hands on booze.
\
Bernstein said that is not true.
\
""Some parts of this plan don't get talked about a lot,"" Bernstein said. ""There are significant new enforcement penalties and regulations for the sale of alcohol to minors. Every outlet would have to have a scanner which would scan everyone's (driver's) license. And we would have 25 percent more liquor control agents. We talked to a (security) company that processed 20 million customers, and had one infraction all of last year.""
\
State stores have outlived their usefulness, Bernstein said. While their revenue is growing at a 3.5-percent rate, costs are growing at a 5.5 percent rate. The way stores are run also make liquor more expensive to the Pennsylvania consumer.
\
""The LCB (Liquor Control Board) came out of Prohibition,"" he said. ""There is a 30 percent markup for profit, an 18 percent Johnstown Flood tax, and a $1.50 surcharge per bottle. We've got to pay for all of that overhead. Last year, there were 53 stores that did not make money.""
\
The money from the sale would generate $1 billion for education, including the Hazleton Area School District, and would eliminate an inherent flaw - having a regulatory agency also be the sales and marketing end of the business.
\
""It (the sale) would allow the LCB to take on its original role - liquor control board, not sales and marketing board,"" Bernstein said. ""It is time for Pennsylvania to get out of the liquor business. Selling liquor is not a core function of government. Education is. That $1 billion can be reinvested in education.
\
In Hazleton, $7 million to $8 million would come to Hazleton, if the governor's plan is enacted. They (HASD) can utilize those resources for their STEM initiative.""
\
Bernstein said House Bill 790 - which is the governor's proposal - has been introduced.
\
Local school districts would also get about $100 billion - or half - of savings the state would realize if the state Legislature goes along with the governor's proposal to reform the state pension system.
\
Bernstein also discussed the governor's transportation proposal, which has four main components: Reduce the flat retail gas tax by 17 cents; lift the artificial cap five-year period on the wholesale price of gas; require vehicle registration every two years instead of every year, and make drivers' license renewal from every six years instead of every four years.
\
""The previous cap went to $1.25, and it would now go to market rate,"" Bernstein said. ""There would be a lot of efficiencies achieved by moving to a two-year structure (on registration). We would save a lot in administrative costs if we moved license renewal to six years.
\
""The governor has put together a comprehensive transportation plan that not only addresses short-term solutions, but long-term needs as well.""
\
Bernstein said the governor inherited a $4.2 billion budget deficit.
\
""Being able to close it without raising taxes is quite a feat - and quite a contrast to what we have in Washington,"" Bernstein said.
\
""It's great to be home, wonderful to be back in the town where I grew up and be able to share news from Harrisburg about all the initiatives the governor is leading. Because of these initiatives and sacrifices the first two years (of Corbett's term), we have been able to take major steps in changing the Commonwealth.""

661,"
HARRISBURG -- In their first gubernatorial debate, Attorney General Tom Corbett described Dan Onorato, the Allegheny County executive, as a ""career politician"" who tells ""you half the story."" Onorato, meanwhile, touted his record running Allegheny County and said he doesn't need to take the ""hokey"" anti-tax pledge Corbett embraces.
\
Last night's debate in the Hershey Lodge and Convention Center featured Corbett, a Shaler Republican and Onorato, a Brighton Heights Democrat, before the state Chamber of Business and Industry's annual dinner. A second debate is scheduled next month in Pittsburgh.
\
It's the first governor's race since 1978 featuring two Allegheny County candidates. Former Republican Gov. Dick Thornburgh defeated former Pittsburgh Mayor Pete Flaherty in that race.
\
Swirling around this race is a potentially devastating $4 billion state budget deficit in 2011.
\
""I'm the only candidate for governor who has balanced a budget. I haven't raised property taxes in seven years,"" said Onorato. ""The biggest difference is our resume."" While he won't take a pledge as Corbett has, Onorato insisted he won't raise taxes.
\
Corbett stood fast on his stance, too.
\
""Am I prepared to violate the (anti-tax) promises I made to the people of Pennsylvania?"" said Corbett. ""Absolutely not.""
\
Onorato charged that Corbett ""changed the definition"" of that pledge three times, such as not ruling out a state fee increase.
\
""We have been taxing and spending ourselves into debt,"" Corbett said. He said he would start cutting with 14 percent of ineligible Medicaid payments identified by Democrat Auditor General Jack Wagner. Corbett said the state's budget was $22 billion in 2002 and is now $28 billion.""I believe we need to go back,"" Corbett said.
\
Onorato entered the debate trailing in the polls. If he needed to land a knockout blow, that didn't occur. Neither candidate committed a gaffe. Neither one drew blood.
\
The debate was broadcast statewide on PCN-TV.
\
In the debate moderated by former ""Nightline"" host Ted Koppel, the sharpest differences between the two came over the proposed Marcellus shale natural gas tax pending in the Legislature. Lawmakers face a self-imposed deadline of Oct. 1 to pass a tax, though any observers doubt that deadline will be met.
\
Onorato favors a ""competitive"" severance tax that would replace cuts made in the state environmental protection budget and provide money to local governments impacted by drilling.
\
Corbett opposes a shale tax, saying the industry has invested $4 billion in Pennsylvania and will fuel government coffers through lease payments and taxes paid by companies and employees. Those who note Texas has a severance tax, he said, need to look at the entire business tax structure of that state.
\
Onorato countered, saying ""even Sarah Palin's Alaska has a severance tax.""
\
As a former U.S. attorney and now-attorney general, Corbett said he is the only candidate who has fought to protect the environment through litigation and supporting legislation to protect Pennsylvania's streams.
\
Corbett said Onorato's commitment to a so-called ""costing out study"" to continue to invest more state money for school districts would result in a significant increase in state spending.
\
Onorato said declining state support simply pushes tax increases onto local taxpayers.
\
Koppel asked whether as governor either would sign a bill allowing plaintiffs' lawyers to argue specific monetary damage awards for ""pain and suffering"" before juries. Both said they oppose the bill, but Corbett went further saying such legislation would be detrimental to the critical need to reform the civil justice system to curb frivolous lawsuits.
\
Onorato said as county executive not only did he hold the line on property taxes, but he consolidated county row offices and 911 centers. The difference still comes down to experience and his resume, Onorato said.
\
Corbett said while Onorato would have people believe he is ""only a prosecutor,"" he says he has spent his entire career ""making tough decisions.""

662,"
For the Daily Record editorial board, it came down to this:
\
We don't have to be big fans of Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge to endorse him.
\
We aren't, and we do.
\
There's a boat load of circum stantial evidence that the Ridge administration filters everything through a political prism, not so much to further the Republican Party as to further the governor's long-term ambitions. There's something smarmy about his ""Governor's Club"" of big-ticket givers who meet in New York City. The $14 million-plus in the Ridge campaign coffers seems like overkill.
\
The close match between administration and corporate positions on some issues raises Clinton-esque questions about policy positions being for sale. Tom Ridge seems a little too polished, too calculating.
\
But the guy delivered the goods. He showed he could lead. He certainly showed he could get impor tant things done.
\
Pennsylvania is a better place to live than it was four years ago. It's a better place to put a business, a better place to create jobs and a better place to play. There's an important process at work to improve education. Remarkably, the state is even a better place in which to drive a car than it was four years ago.
\
While Tom Ridge doesn't deserve all the credit for that, his administration certainly is entitled to a healthy dose of it. Some examples of first-term achievements offered or supported by the Ridge administration:
\
Workers compensation reform.
\
Lower corporate income taxes and tax cuts for the working poor.
\
Welfare reform.
\
Charter-school legislation. Significant education-reform proposals in areas such as teacher certification and academic standards.
\
""Brownfields"" legislation that allows redevelopment of abandoned industrial sites in cities such as York.
\
Numerous ""get tough"" bills on crime; measures to improve consideration of crime victims.
\
Utility deregulation. (The jury is out on its success but the intent is honorable: to lower electricity charges through competition.)
\
Accepting political risk by backing a needed gas- tax hike to improve roads.
\
Recognizing and boosting tourism, including efforts to make the state attractive to Hollywood filmmakers.
\
Signing important reforms involving government open meetings into law. The governor has backed sorely needed reform in campaign finance and lobbyist disclosure laws.
\
A start, at least, on wrestling with the problem of urban sprawl through appointment of the 21st Century Environment Commission. Now the governor must support the commission's findings and lead reform of the commonwealth's 17th century government structure.
\
That's an impressive list. Maybe most important was Mr. Ridge's use of the governor's pulpit to send signals across the land, and across two oceans, that Pennsylvania was a good place for employers to come.
\
Pennsylvania needed a business cheerleader. Fair or unfair, its reputation was awful. Now, through Mr. Ridge's boosting and new legislation, the state is poised to be a winner in the dog-eat-dog quest for economic prosperity.
\
All that is worth enough to overcome his challengers, the main ones being Democrat Ivan Itkin of Pittsburgh, a minority-party leader in the state House of Representatives, and Peg Luksik, the Constitutional Party candidate.
\
Mr. Itkin offers good ideas on subjects such as education funding, combating urban sprawl and consumer rights in health care. But his woefully underfunded campaign suggests that even his own party doesn't take him seriously. Why, then, should the rest of us?
\
Ms. Luksik, as always, impresses as a bright, focused person who knows the issues. She has evolved from someone who first appeared as a conservative ""values"" candidate on subjects such as public education and abortion. Her passionate followers are testimony to her leadership skills.
\
Indeed, if Pennsylvania were in a crisis, in need of a dramatic kick-in-the-pants, it would be fascinating to see what Ms. Luksik could do as governor. Harrisburg's good ol' boys might be in for quite a shock.
\
But 1998 does not represent a crisis year. Tom Ridge has accomplished a lot. In a second term, we're hoping he converts us into fans.
"
663,"On Dec. 28, Gov. Tom Wolf executed a line-item veto that allowed money to flow to social service agencies and school districts. \He could have used his line-item veto when first presented with the budget June 30. I believe this would have provided for a much better negotiating environment, resulting in the Legislature and governor likely having passed a full-year budget by now. \So, now that Wolf has vetoed 77 of 401 line items, we can focus on coming to agreement on those items. Talks will begin to determine how to find the revenue to support increased spending on the items. \And in coming weeks, negotiations will focus on whether taxes should rise to support additional state spending. \Every year the Legislature passes approximately a dozen bills that make up the Pennsylvania budget. The two most significant bills are the General Appropriations Bill, or the spending bill; and the Tax Code Bill, or the income bill. \Just as with your household budget, income must support all spending. \If the state had unlimited income from taxes and other sources, we could fund more services. This is no different than any individual who might like more personal income for additional spending. \But unless he or she figures out a way to generate more income, he or she will need to budget using current income. \The state must operate under the same principles, as we are required to have a balanced budget each year. \Elected to represent the people of Pennsylvania, we legislators held a vote June 1 for the governor's original spending plan. \It called for a 3.7 percent personal income tax, up 21 percent from the current 3.07 percent, and a large expansion of the state's sales and use tax and a boost in the rate to 6.6 percent in most of the state. This plan would have raised more than $12 billion in new taxes over a two-year period. \The result was unanimous - the governor's original revenue plan did not receive a single vote from either party. \On Oct. 7, Wolf proposed another tax plan, and another vote was cast. This bill sought lower increases in taxes than the governor's original proposal but required an increase in the personal income tax to 3.57 percent and also a severance tax. (The original claim of a ""$1 billion natural gas tax"" was never going to transpire because of the current market price of natural gas; the governor's administration had to lower the revenue expectation to around $200 million.) \This proposal failed in the House of Representatives on a bipartisan vote of 73 in favor and 127 against. \Last month, discussions on the $30.8 billion ""framework budget,"" supported by Wolf, broke down because there was not enough revenue to pay for the governor's spending plan. \The Democrats in the House and Senate, as well as the governor, cannot agree on how to raise taxes to pay for their spending. Some Democrats prefer raising the personal income tax, and some prefer raising the sales and use tax. \The current negotiations will focus not just on what the governor wants to spend, but on how much the citizens of Pennsylvania are willing to pay. \My hope had been that we could find some additional savings and revenue from pension reform or liquor privatization, but those attempts were vetoed by the governor June 30. Current topics of discussion include increased tobacco taxes, gambling expansion, increases in the personal income tax, and a sales tax increase and expansion. \As previous votes and discussions in the General Assembly have proved, there is no consensus or agreement among the House, Senate and governor on a revenue plan. For most people, it is much easier to talk about how to spend money than it is to decide who should pay for the spending. \I will continue to fight for a fiscally responsible budget that respects the taxpayers of Pennsylvania."

Montgomery County Commissioner Josh Shapiro on Tuesday defeated Allegheny County District Attorney Stephen A. Zappala Jr. in the Democratic primary for attorney general, based on unofficial election returns.
\
Shapiro, 42, of Abington, beat Zappala, 58, of Fox Chapel, 47 percent to 37 percent, with Northampton County District Attorney John Morganelli trailing with 16 percent based on 80 percent of precincts reporting.
\
""I'm running because I believe Pennsylvania needs real reform,"" said Shapiro. ""Too many people feel the system is rigged against them.""
\
Zappala told his supporters at the IBEW Local 5 Hall in the South Side, ""We just didn't have the votes in the western part of the state. We had to overcome a lot in southeastern Pennsylvania. It was a good fight.""
\
In the November election, Shapiro will face Sen. John Rafferty, 63, a Republican from Montgomery County.
\
Rafferty defeated Joe Peters, 58, a former Scranton policeman who has worked as a state and federal prosecutor. Rafferty served as a deputy attorney general prosecuting Medicaid fraud cases and helped push through a gas tax and transportation funding bill in 2014. Rafferty handled a range of civil law issues in private practice.
\
""I want to thank my voters and supporters for the work they did to help me win the nomination and ensure our party is set up to win this race in November,"" Rafferty said.
\
Attorney General Kathleen Kane, a Scranton Democrat facing criminal charges, did not seek re-election, creating an open race for the state's chief law enforcement officer also vested with broad civil powers.
\
""Overall, it's a contest that's been about experience, reform and vision of the office,"" said G. Terry Madonna, a political science professor at Franklin & Marshall College.
\
Zappala emphasized his 18 years of experience as a prosecutor running the second largest district attorney's office in the state, despite not trying a case as head of the office.
\
Shapiro, as a member of Gov. Tom Wolf's transition team was a key adviser on preparing a state budget in 2015, but portrayed himself as a reformer. He was not a prosecutor but served as a congressional aide in Washington, D.C., in the state House where he co-chaired the Speaker's Reform Commission, and more than four years as county commissioner.
\
Zappala said he could replicate the work he's done as Allegheny County's top prosecutor -- establishing a domestic violence and abuse task force, cracking down on illegal guns and pioneering police use of video -- in Harrisburg and establish an office of civil rights. Shapiro wants to expand the scope of the office, using its powers and bully pulpit to protect seniors from scams, children from online predators and the environment from natural gas development.
\
Morganelli spent most of the race on the offensive, viciously attacking Shapiro during debates and press conferences for alleged connections between campaign contributions his campaign received and Montgomery County contracts he voted to award as commissioner. Several questioned whether Morganelli and Zappala had teamed up to take down Shapiro, a suggestion both campaigns denied.
\
Shapiro defended his work as commissioner, touting reforms he fought for in Harrisburg as a state representative and as head of the county commission. A pair of ads late in the race questioned Zappala's stance on abortion, women's rights and race.
\
Women and black leaders supporting Zappala organized a pair of press conferences to denounce the ads.
\
The candidates fought heavily for votes in Philadelphia and surrounding cites. Zappala spent two or three days a week campaign around the city of brotherly love. He stopped campaigning for more than a week to focus solely on the investigation into gunmen who ambushed and killed six people in March in Wilkinsburg.
\
Shapiro visited the Pittsburgh area on a few occasions, once visiting shops and talking to voters with city Councilman Dan Gilman, who endorsed Shapiro early in the race.
\
Shapiro raised more than $3 million during the campaign, including about $1.2 million he transferred from previous races. Zappala raised nearly $2.3 million, including $620,000 of his own money he loaned to the campaign.
\
Shapiro picked up key Democratic endorsements from President Barack Obama, Wolf and former Gov. Ed Rendell.
\
Zappala received heavy support from John Dougherty, business manager for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers in Philadelphia, which donated nearly $135,000 to the campaign, and he garnered the support of U.S. Rep. Bob Brady, chairman of the Philadelphia Democratic Committee.

666,"
HARRISBURG - Facing a $1.5 billion state deficit, lawmakers are taking another look at taxing natural gas extraction despite Gov. Tom Corbett's opposition.
\
""There are more and more people beginning to talk about Marcellus shale taxation,"" said Sen. Edwin Erickson, R-Delaware County, sponsor of legislation for a 4 percent severance tax.
\
""I think there's a good chance something will go through,"" said Jeffrey Weber, chairman of the political science department at East Stroudsburg University.
\
It's ""bipartisan, bicameral support,"" said Senate Minority Leader Jay Costa, D-Forest Hills.
\
Industry advocates warn of consequences.
\
""Uncompetitive, shortsighted new taxes on one of our most promising industries will lead to fewer jobs, lower energy production and less tax revenues,"" said Marcellus Shale Coalition President Dave Spigelmyer.
\
Senate President Pro Tempore Joe Scarnati, R-Jefferson County, said he has seen evidence of those jobs and doesn't want to ""kill the goose laying golden eggs."" He thinks lawmakers should talk about all revenue-generating options.
\
Still, Scarnati did not rule out a shale gas tax.
\
There are other proposals for a 5 percent severance tax, including one from Corbett's general election opponent, Democrat Tom Wolf of York, who would earmark the money for education and the environment.
\
A 5 percent tax would generate about $500 million annually, said Stephanie Weyant, spokeswoman for the House Democratic Appropriations Committee.
\
Yet there are substantial legislative hurdles. Corbett wants lawmakers to enact pension and liquor reform ""before he'll consider anything else,"" including a budget, an extraction tax and myriad other revenue proposals, spokesman Jay Pagni said.
\
Costa predicts a ""very long summer"" if Corbett insists on expanding beer and wine sales prior to passage of a budget.
\
The budget, by law, must be completed by June 30.
\
Many House Republicans insist the starting point for new revenue should be a full liquor divestiture plan the House approved last year. It has languished in the Senate.
\
""Send a real liquor bill over, with revenue,"" said Stephen Miskin, spokesman for House Majority Leader Mike Turzai, R-Bradford Woods.
\
Miskin said lawmakers are not linking a liquor bill and a shale gas extraction tax.
\
Turzai's bill aimed to get the state out of the liquor business. The Senate is not considering his sweeping plan; instead, it would expand private sales of wine and beer, allowing convenience stores to sell six-packs and retailers with ""R,"" or restaurant, licenses to sell bottled wine. Those establishments, including grocery stores, can sell beer to go.
\
Rep. Gene Digirolamo, R-Bucks County, predicts there are ""120 to 130 votes"" in the 203-member House for a shale tax. Passage of a measure requires 102 votes.
\
""Something drastic needs to happen"" before the House Republican Caucus takes up a shale-tax bill, said Rep. Seth Grove, R-York County.
\
House Democrats consider such a tax a ""high priority,"" spokesman Bill Patton said.
\
""We believe it can be passed now, if the Republican leadership allows a vote,"" he said. ""House Democrats will support a rate that's fair to producers and raises hundreds of millions of dollars.""
\
An extraction tax is only one piece of what's needed to balance the budget, and debate is under way about whether money from it should be devoted exclusively to school funding.
\
""That (tax) is not a panacea,"" said Rep. Bill Kortz, D-Dravosburg.
\
Public education advocates on Thursday urged lawmakers to approve a 5 percent shale gas extraction tax. They fear increases that Corbett proposed for education in the 2014-15 budget are in jeopardy because of the overall budget shortfall.
\
""Essential programs and personnel have already been cut in school districts throughout the state - counseling services, nurses, librarians,"" said Rhonda Brownstein, director of the Education Law Center of Pennsylvania. ""Further cuts would devastate our schools and communities.""
\
Anthony May, a former top aide to the late Democratic Gov. Robert P. Casey, predicts Corbett will pivot on the shale tax, but he'll do so reluctantly.
\
""He's fought this long and hard,"" May said. ""Better for Corbett to sign the shale tax than have Tom Wolf beat him over the head in TV ads in October.""
\
Pennsylvania, a leading state in gas production, in 2012 imposed an impact fee of 1.6 percent or less on energy companies, designed to offset local costs from drilling; it's optional for counties.

667,"HARRISBURG -- State Sen. Joe Scarnati won't be running for re-election until 2012, but that hasn't stopped him from racking up the second highest total of campaign contributions from the oil and gas industry.\According to a compilation by Common Cause/Pennsylvania at marcellusmoney.org, Senate President Pro Tem Scarnati has taken in $117,575 from energy companies, including many that are drilling for natural gas in the deep underground areas of Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania. Of that total, $8,000 came from a company called East Resources Inc. of Warrendale, in six donations made at various times from 2002 to 2009.\But in addition to the $117,575, Mr. Scarnati, of Jefferson County, also got a $25,000 donation from Terrence and Kim Pegula of Boca Raton, Fla., on Aug. 17, according to a Scarnati campaign report to the Pennsylvania Department of State that is available online. Mr. Pegula is listed as president/chief operating officer of East Resources, although the firm was sold in May to Shell Oil Co.\Republicans control the Senate, and as the top Republican, Mr. Scarnati is a key negotiator in the stalled talks over whether Pennsylvania will put a severance tax on the large amount of natural gas being pumped from Marcellus Shale. \Common Cause official Alex Kaplan said that the $25,000 check from Mr. Pegula came in mid-August, when talks about a gas tax were in progress. Such a large donation from ""a natural gas CEO to an influential senator, when he's not up for re-election, is a stark attempt to buy influence during a crucial time for a severance tax,"" contended Mr. Kaplan.\Asked if the gas industry contributions have influenced Mr. Scarnati's policy-making, legal counsel Drew Crompton had a short answer: no. In mid-August, he said, ""We were knee-deep in a working group to establish a reasonable tax."" \He said that East Resources is the largest gas driller in Tioga County, part of Mr. Scarnati's senate district, and it's been a while since a new industry brought a lot of good jobs to that rural, northern-tier county.\""Sen. Scarnati cares about jobs in places where they haven't had good economic news in years,"" Mr. Crompton said. ""He won't vote any particular way just because someone gives him $25,000.""\He said his boss doesn't want a Marcellus Shale tax rate that's too high because it could hurt the growth of jobs.\Democratic Gov. Ed Rendell wants legislators to enact a gas severance tax in order to raise at least $100 million to help protect the environment and municipal roads from drilling-related damage and bolster the state budget. Talks in October among state officials have so far failed to produce an agreement on a revised shale tax, and the Senate doesn't plan to return to work before the session ends Nov. 30.\According to his campaign report, Mr. Scarnati had $554,724 in contributions on hand as of Sept. 13, even though he doesn't have to run for re-election to another four-year term until 2012. Mr. Scarnati is No. 2 on the energy industry contribution list, with Republican gubernatorial candidate Tom Corbett getting more than $700,000 so far.\Right now Mr. Scarnati is both the Senate leader and the state's lieutenant governor, due to the death of Lt. Gov. Catherine Baker Knoll in 2008. But he will go back to being just a senator in January, when a new governor and lieutenant governor are sworn into office."

\
Turzai's bill aimed to get the state out of the liquor business. The Senate is not considering his sweeping plan; instead, it would expand private sales of wine and beer, allowing convenience stores to sell six-packs and retailers with ""R,"" or restaurant, licenses to sell bottled wine. Those establishments, including grocery stores, can sell beer to go.
\
Rep. Gene Digirolamo, R-Bucks County, predicts there are ""120 to 130 votes"" in the 203-member House for a shale tax. Passage of a measure requires 102 votes.
\
""Something drastic needs to happen"" before the House Republican Caucus takes up a shale-tax bill, said Rep. Seth Grove, R-York County.
\
House Democrats consider such a tax a ""high priority,"" spokesman Bill Patton said.
\
""We believe it can be passed now, if the Republican leadership allows a vote,"" he said. ""House Democrats will support a rate that's fair to producers and raises hundreds of millions of dollars.""
\
An extraction tax is only one piece of what's needed to balance the budget, and debate is under way about whether money from it should be devoted exclusively to school funding.
\
""That (tax) is not a panacea,"" said Rep. Bill Kortz, D-Dravosburg.
\
Public education advocates on Thursday urged lawmakers to approve a 5 percent shale gas extraction tax. They fear increases that Corbett proposed for education in the 2014-15 budget are in jeopardy because of the overall budget shortfall.
\
""Essential programs and personnel have already been cut in school districts throughout the state -- counseling services, nurses, librarians,"" said Rhonda Brownstein, director of the Education Law Center of Pennsylvania. ""Further cuts would devastate our schools and communities.""
\
Anthony May, a former top aide to the late Democratic Gov. Robert P. Casey, predicts Corbett will pivot on the shale tax, but he'll do so reluctantly.
\
""He's fought this long and hard,"" May said. ""Better for Corbett to sign the shale tax than have Tom Wolf beat him over the head in TV ads in October.""
\
Pennsylvania, a leading state in gas production, in 2012 imposed an impact fee of 1.6 percent or less on energy companies, designed to offset local costs from drilling; it's optional for counties.

669,"
HARRISBURG -- Proposals to tax or impose fees on Marcellus shale drillers are on a potential collision course with Gov. Tom Corbett, as fellow Republicans controlling the House and Senate attempt to break an eight-year cycle of late budgets.
\
Chief among them is a proposal from the Senate's top Republican leader, which a Senate environmental committee amended and approved on Tuesday, setting it up for a floor vote over the next two weeks.
\
Key lawmakers warn that legislation to tax drillers will become entangled with budget-related bills as they attempt to pass an on-time budget by June 30. Waiting until Corbett's Marcellus Shale Advisory Commission makes its report on July 22 -- as the governor wants to do -- would effectively put the impact fee issue off until fall because the General Assembly will be on summer recess.
\
""I think it's probable that deadline pressures are going to have an impact on the outcome of this shale-tax debate,"" said Joseph DiSarro, chairman of the political science department at Washington & Jefferson College. ""The Legislature doesn't have time to wait for the governor's commission, and they aren't going to do that. The challenge is coming up with a proposal that satisfies Pennsylvanians, who widely favor a tax, while avoiding that (gubernatorial) veto.
\
""Neither the Legislature nor the governor want to look bad by missing the budget deadline or failing to reach some consensus"" now that Republicans control both chambers, DiSarro said.
\
Corbett spokesman Kevin Harley said the governor ""is going to wait for his Marcellus Shale Advisory Commission."" It is taking a ""measured, methodical"" look at how drilling impacted communities and what the costs are, Harley said.
\
But Thomas Baldino, a political science professor at Wilkes University in Wilkes-Barre, said, ""Clearly there are enough members from both parties in both chambers who believe some kind of tax or fee is important to have. The governor, while he doesn't embrace this now, may have to embrace this as part of a compromise to get a budget done on time.""
\
Senate President Pro Tempore Joe Scarnati, author of the impact fee bill that the Senate Environmental Resources and Energy Committee approved yesterday, warned that various shale-tax proposals will be offered to state fiscal code legislation that must accompany the budget. The fiscal code sets tax rates.
\
The Jefferson County Republican crafted his proposal to attempt to meet Corbett's criteria. He argues it's better to approve his bill than take chances on whatever gas-tax legislation might emerge in the final days of budget deliberations.
\
Corbett has said the legislation must be a fee, not a tax. He pledged as a candidate last year to oppose all tax increases. He says the money must remain with affected communities.
\
The Scarnati bill spends 60 percent of the money locally and 40 percent for statewide environmental funds. The amended version shifts priorities away from using money for open space, recreational trails and community conservation projects to cleaning up hazardous sites, repairing roads and mine reclamation.
\
Scarnati's bill doesn't send revenue to the state's General Fund, which Corbett wants to avoid. The Public Utility Commission would collect and distribute the money.
\
The bill increases the fee for drillers and makes it a flat fee by removing adjustments for volume and price. The first-year fee would be $40,000 per well. Scarnati originally proposed a plan that would levy, on average, $25,000 per well.
\
Scarnati said he is on board with the changes.
\
Matt Pitzarella, spokesman for Range Resources, a shale driller, said the new version of the bill seemed to address concerns that the fee was ""too tax-like"" by making it a flat amount payable during the period of impact.
\
""We remain committed to a concept that is competitive, keeps money local and allows for strong, but predictable local oversight,"" Pitzarella said.
\
An environmental group sees no improvement.
\
""I didn't see anything in the bill that makes it better if you're concerned about the environment,"" said Jeffrey Schmidt, lobbyist for the Sierra Club.
\
""The Scarnati bill basically punishes communities that want to protect their communities and their water,"" Schmidt said. He was referring to a provision that prevents revenue from going to municipalities that adopt more stringent zoning ordinances than a ""model ordinance"" that the PUC would adopt.
\
A Bucks County Republican House member today plans to introduce an impact fee that she says was designed to meet Corbett's criteria. Rep. Marguerite Quinn's bill would levy an initial $50,000 per well and avoid deposits into the General Fund.

Taxpayers filing their 1040s are likely wondering just where all their hard-earned tax dollars are going, anyway.
\
Washington will spend $31,406 per household in 2010 -- the highest level in American history (adjusted for inflation). It will collect $18,276 per household in taxes. The remaining $13,130 represents this year's staggering budget deficit per household, which, along with all prior government debt, will be dumped in the laps of our children.
\
Government spending has increased by $5,000 per household since 2008, and nearly $10,000 per household over the past decade. Yet there is no free lunch: If spending is not reined in, then eventually taxes must also rise by $10,000 per household.
\
Washington will spend this $31,406 per household as follows:
\
Social Security/Medicare: $9,949. The 15.3 percent payroll tax, split evenly between the employer and employee, covers most of these costs. This system can remain sustainable only if there are enough workers to support all retirees, which is why it risks collapsing under the weight of 77 million retiring baby boomers. Unless these programs are reformed, paying all promised benefits would eventually require doubling all income tax rates.
\
Defense: $6,071. The defense budget covers everything from military paychecks to operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to the research, development and acquisition of new technologies and equipment. Lawmakers drastically reduced military spending after the collapse of communism in the early 1990s. The 9/11 attacks reversed this trend, and the inflation-adjusted $2,472 per household increase since 2000 has returned military spending closer to its historical levels (but still lower than during previous wars).
\
Anti-poverty programs: $5,466. Nearly half of this spending subsidizes state Medicaid programs that provide health services to poor families. Other low-income spending includes: Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, food stamps, housing subsidies, child-care subsidies, Supplemental Security Income and low-income tax credits. President George W. Bush increased anti-poverty spending to record levels, and it has grown an additional 32 percent since the end of 2008 under President Barack Obama.
\
Unemployment benefits: $1,640. Unemployment costs have surged by 411 percent during the recession.
\
Interest on the federal debt: $1,585. The federal government is $13 trillion in debt. It owes $9 trillion to public bond owners, and the rest to other federal agencies (mostly to repay the Social Security trust fund, which lawmakers raided annually before the program went into deficit in 2010). Record-low interest rates have recently held down these costs. However, the national debt is set to double by 2020, which will combine with higher interest rates to raise annual interest costs to nearly $6,000 per household.
\
Veterans' benefits: $1,052. The federal government provides income and health benefits to war veterans. Spending is up 83 percent since 2000.
\
Federal employee retirement benefits: $1,018. This spending funds the retirement and disability benefits of federal employees, including the military.
\
Education: $914. Education spending is primarily a state and local function; 9 percent of the total comes from Washington. The federal education budget has leaped 125 percent since 2000. Most federal dollars are spent on low-income school districts, special education and college student financial aid.
\
Highways/mass transit: $613. Most highway and mass-transit spending is financed by the 18.4 cent per-gallon federal gas tax. Washington subtracts an administrative cost and sends this money back to the states with numerous strings attached.
\
Health research/regulation: $550. This spending is up 50 percent since 2001, and much of this growth is concentrated in the National Institute of Health. The category also includes the Food and Drug Administration and dozens of grant programs for health providers.
\
Mortgage Credit: $470. While most of the bank bailouts occurred last year, the bailouts of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the rest of the housing market continue.
\
The programs listed above cover $29,328 per household. The remaining $2,078 is allocated to all other federal programs, including justice, international affairs, natural resources, the environment, regional development, farm subsidies, social services, space exploration, air transportation and energy.
\
Taxpayers -- and the next generation that will be paying nearly half of the bill -- must decide for themselves if they're getting their money's worth.

671,"Motorists may find the high price of gasoline painful this Memorial Day weekend, but it could eventually improve their quality of life.\After 15 months of high gasoline prices, people say they are driving less, according to surveys. If prices remain high, people also will buy smaller, more-fuel-efficient cars. Together, that should lead to fewer traffic jams and accidents, cleaner air, and possibly a slowing of global warming.\The impact of higher gasoline prices, which have risen 28 cents a gallon on average since late March, illustrates an often-glossed-over trade-off in the debate about energy policy.\Low energy prices promote economic growth, and give more people the means to, for example, drive bigger cars and enjoy the comforts of central air-conditioning. By encouraging power consumption, however, low prices also make it harder to breathe, shroud skylines in smog, and tie people up in traffic jams - all factors that may be as important to quality of life as the comforts of economic well-being.\One answer to this conundrum: Raise fuel prices to a level that better balances economic growth with environmental costs. Gasoline prices in the United States overly favor the economic side of the equation, economists say.\While some lawmakers want to suspend all or part of the federal gasoline tax of 18.4 cents a gallon this summer to give drivers a break, many economists say the gas tax should be increased instead.\""Overall, the benefits of cleaner air and freer-flowing traffic will exceed the costs of having to pay more for energy,"" said Ian Parry of Resources for the Future, a Washington policy research institute focusing on environment and transportation.\From an economist's viewpoint, the tax on gasoline should reflect the added costs to society from consumption of the fuel, such as health costs and time lost in traffic jams.\Based on recent studies, Parry estimated the environmental and congestion costs combined at between 84 cents and $1.12 a gallon. A $1 tax would push the current U.S. price of regular gasoline up to $2.29 a gallon.\Even without a higher tax, market forces are expected to keep gasoline prices up for some time. The nationwide average price of regular unleaded has risen to $1.69 a gallon from about $1.18 in May 1999. Prices in some parts of the country are higher. As a result, 52 percent of Americans are driving less to save money, according to a poll released Thursday by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press. Also, 36 percent of the respondents said they were considering buying a car that gets better gas mileage.\A separate poll by the Associated Press found that 23 percent of Americans were cutting back on vacations or canceling them because of the higher gas cost.\If energy prices rise high enough, they can help drive the economy into recession, as they did in 1974. Economists are keeping an eye on energy prices, but are not overly concerned yet by the increase in gasoline prices.\Adjusted for inflation, the price of gasoline is 30 percent lower than its historic peak in 1980.\Moreover, the price of gasoline in the United States is lower than in Europe, Canada and Japan, all of which have higher taxes. Britons pay $4.26 for a gallon of gasoline, including $3.12 a gallon in taxes.\Taxes in the United States vary from place to place, with states and some local governments adding taxes on top of the 18.4-cent-a-gallon federal tax. State levies range from 7.5 cents in Georgia to 29 cents in Rhode Island. On average, total taxes on gasoline add up to about 40 cents a gallon.\The issue puts some environmental groups in a bind. Many activists are uncomfortable advocating higher prices because of their unpopularity. Instead, they frequently bash the oil industry for what they call price gouging and windfall profits.\But high gas prices ""should be your best friend if you're an environmentalist,"" said Jerry Taylor, natural-resources director at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. ""Gouging or not, higher prices mean less consumption, which means less pollution.""\ \ \Credit: By Ken Moritsugu INQUIRER WASHINGTON BUREAU"
672,"Gov. Tom Wolf’s address to a joint session of the General Assembly Tuesday drew mixed reactions from pundits statewide and from our own community members of the Westmoreland and Valley News Dispatch editorial boards. Here are their responses to the governor’s remarks and his 2018 proposed budget:\In listening to Gov. Wolf’s address, the one item that struck me is his quote that Pennsylvania is a better place to do business because of the tax structure.\Overall Pennsylvania is in the top 15 states of the country with the highest tax burdens when you look at the overall tax structure. Our personal tax burden may be in the bottom 10 states, but you also need to look at our gas tax, which is in the top 10 states; our sales tax and real-estate taxes are in the top 15 states; our beer tax is one of the lowest in the country; our cigarette and liquor taxes are in the top 15 states; our spending per pupil and teacher pay are in the top 15 states; our higher education is in the bottom of the states; our police and roads spending is in the top 20 of the states.\With all these other tax burdens, is Pennsylvania’s burden on its businesses and individual families mild or steep?\— Eric Elia Bononi\Westmoreland Tribune-Review Editorial Board\I thought the governor’s speech was very reasonable and forward-looking. I like the emphasis on education at all levels and especially the need for a severance tax. I’ve never understood why Pennsylvania allows out-of-state industries and businesses to take our natural resources (that can only be found here) and pollute our environment without paying the state for it. Seems rather shortsighted, given that we’re still cleaning up the mess from the last industrial age.\— Phyllis Framel\Valley News Dispatch Editorial Board\We need more “investment.” Translation: We need more money. It’s like a broken record. Never a thought about spending less. Despite the governor’s streamlining government and reducing costs, we always see an increase in the budget; just once can we see it not increase? Another plea for a severance tax — sure, only if a law is passed that reduces our state income taxes dollar for dollar with severance tax dollars.\— Reed PedersonWestmoreland Tribune-Review Editorial Board\I read through the text of the governor’s address a couple times. It sounds more like a campaign speech than a budget, long on past successes and short on specific details. It did not address the billions of dollars of state deficit. In fact, he is increasing spending — not a good recipe for fiscal responsibility.\— Vince Mercuri Valley News Dispatch Editorial Board\As a mother to two school-aged boys, investing in our schools is of the utmost importance. However, Western Pennsylvania houses a good portion of the worst districts in the state. Which makes me question if investing money really equates to better performance. With an astronomical amount of student debt, brought on by my chosen (or lack thereof at the beginning) profession, I was pleased to hear Gov. Wolf push for an increase in Pennsylvania’s trade and apprenticeship programs. I was also pleased to hear Wolf address the opioid epidemic. However, arming law enforcement with “the tools they need” is just the tip of the iceberg: You save lives and then allow them to go right back to it, creating a habitual cycle that is draining the already limited funds.\All in all I was pleased to hear of no new tax increases and trimming government officials, pensions and pay.\— Anna Morcheid Joyner Westmoreland Tribune-Review Editorial Board"
673,"
HARRISBURG -- Facing a $1.5 billion state deficit, lawmakers are taking another look at taxing natural gas extraction despite Gov. Tom Corbett's opposition.
\
""There are more and more people beginning to talk about Marcellus shale taxation,"" said Sen. Edwin Erickson, R-Delaware County, sponsor of legislation for a 4 percent severance tax.
\
""I think there's a good chance something will go through,"" said Jeffrey Weber, chairman of the political science department at East Stroudsburg University.
\
It's ""bipartisan, bicameral support,"" said Senate Minority Leader Jay Costa, D-Forest Hills.
\
Industry advocates warn of consequences.
\
""Uncompetitive, shortsighted new taxes on one of our most promising industries will lead to fewer jobs, lower energy production and less tax revenues,"" said Marcellus Shale Coalition President Dave Spigelmyer.
\
Senate President Pro Tempore Joe Scarnati, R-Jefferson County, said he has seen evidence of those jobs and doesn't want to ""kill the goose laying golden eggs."" He thinks lawmakers should talk about all revenue-generating options.
\
Still, Scarnati did not rule out a shale gas tax.
\
There are other proposals for a 5 percent severance tax, including one from Corbett's general election opponent, Democrat Tom Wolf of York, who would earmark the money for education and the environment.
\
A 5 percent tax would generate about $500 million annually, said Stephanie Weyant, spokeswoman for the House Democratic Appropriations Committee.
\
Yet there are substantial legislative hurdles. Corbett wants lawmakers to enact pension and liquor reform ""before he'll consider anything else,"" including a budget, an extraction tax and myriad other revenue proposals, spokesman Jay Pagni said.
\
Costa predicts a ""very long summer"" if Corbett insists on expanding beer and wine sales prior to passage of a budget.
\
The budget, by law, must be completed by June 30.
\
Many House Republicans insist the starting point for new revenue should be a full liquor divestiture plan the House approved last year. It has languished in the Senate.
\
""Send a real liquor bill over, with revenue,"" said Stephen Miskin, spokesman for House Majority Leader Mike Turzai, R-Bradford Woods.
\
Miskin said lawmakers are not linking a liquor bill and a shale gas extraction tax.
\
Turzai's bill aimed to get the state out of the liquor business. The Senate is not considering his sweeping plan; instead, it would expand private sales of wine and beer, allowing convenience stores to sell six-packs and retailers with ""R,"" or restaurant, licenses to sell bottled wine. Those establishments, including grocery stores, can sell beer to go.
\
Rep. Gene Digirolamo, R-Bucks County, predicts there are ""120 to 130 votes"" in the 203-member House for a shale tax. Passage of a measure requires 102 votes.
\
""Something drastic needs to happen"" before the House Republican Caucus takes up a shale-tax bill, said Rep. Seth Grove, R-York County.
\
House Democrats consider such a tax a ""high priority,"" spokesman Bill Patton said.
\
""We believe it can be passed now, if the Republican leadership allows a vote,"" he said. ""House Democrats will support a rate that's fair to producers and raises hundreds of millions of dollars.""

674,"
A much-anticipated bill that would pay for everything from highway improvements and mass transit to bridge repairs and new bicycle paths probably will be delayed for several months.
\
The House Transportation Committee is expected to approve a stopgap measure today that would keep transportation funding at current levels for six months.
\
If the full House and the Senate go along, congressional committees will use the time to argue over a demand by Rep. Bud Shuster (R., Pa.) to sharply raise spending on transportation. House leaders have been pressuring Shuster to back off his bill, which would exceed limits in the balanced-budget resolution by about $34 billion over six years.
\
Lawmakers also will try to satisfy state demands for more-equitable cuts of revenue from the federal gasoline tax.
\
Shuster, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, confirmed yesterday that there would be a six-month extension of current funding as part of a deal worked out with House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R., Ga.). The House will renegotiate Shuster's transportation bill next spring as part of a new budget agreement that permits more spending, he added.
\
``If not, we can bring it to the floor and fight it out there, and see who prevails,'' Shuster said.
\
He said that, ``all things considered, this is a reasonable compromise. You have to be realistic.''
\
The committee's action raises the prospects that important decisions on the legislation will be deferred until next year. While senators vowed yesterday to push ahead with their version of the legislation, they won't be able to pass a final measure until the House decides on a long-term bill, and time is running short in this year's legislative calendar.
\
A delay at the federal level will percolate to the states and local transportation authorities, who cannot make plans for road improvements until they are certain how much money they'll receive.
\
``States deserve to have consistency and continuity. They're waiting for us to do something,'' said Nicholas Graham, spokesman for Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Chairman John H. Chafee (R., R.I.).
\
The House transportation panel's three-year, $103 billion spending plan proposed by Shuster is aimed at making the distribution of about $25 billion annually in federal gas-tax revenue more equitable. Money from the tax is used for such matters as building bicycle paths, landscaping highways, shoring up bridges, and expanding interstates.
\
Under the current formula, some states, particularly in the Northeast, receive more money than they contribute. For example, Massachusetts gets about $2.49 for every dollar of gasoline taxes it contributes, while Florida gets about 78 cents.
\
Bills in the Senate and House propose shifting money so that all states will fare more equally. While the Senate bill stays within funding limits of the balanced-budget agreement, the House bill does not, and therefore has met with harsh opposition from House leaders.
\
The Senate public works committee passed its version of the bill 18-0 last week. That bill, while providing more money for states that got short shrift in the past, keeps spending within the budget's limits.
\
The chairman, Chafee, will continue to push the Senate bill forward, the press secretary, said.
\
``We are on track to have a Senate bill on the floor next week. We are prepared to go to conference before the October recess,'' Graham said. ``We have a good proposal. To delay for six months is very risky. They're waiting for more money that may or may not come through. I think that's a dangerous game to play.''

675,"
The rise in the price of crude oil over the last week might look like a
\
financial gusher for oil-rich states such as Texas and Oklahoma. But officials here are not betting on it - not yet.
\
Rising oil prices used to be reason enough for a fiesta here. But when the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait sent the price of Texas oil soaring from about $16 a barrel last month to more than $28 a barrel on Tuesday, state officials greeted the news calmly.
\
""An increase in prices for one week doesn't mean anything to us,"" said John Bender, Texas deputy comptroller. ""Six months from now we will have a better idea of what it all means. The situation is still so volatile. . . . At this point no one knows if those prices are going to hold for that long.""
\
Indeed, the price of crude oil, which has risen 24 percent since last Thursday when Iraq invaded Kuwait, took a dive Wednesday when futures for light crude closed down $2.35 at $25.96 a barrel.
\
Even if the price of oil lingers at $25 a barrel - each $1 increase in the price of oil over a 12-month period generates about $50 million in revenue in Texas - the price increase is not expected to have the impact it once did. Texas is a changed state.
\
During happy-go-lucky times in the 1980s, oil prices drove the state's economy and fueled its coffers. But those days are gone, and many feel they are gone forever.
\
Today, oil and gas-tax revenues account for only 8 percent of the state's budget, down from 28 percent in 1981. Less oil flows from Texas wells. In 1972, the state built up its economy by pumping out 1.3 billion barrels of oil. By 1988, oil production had slid to 725 million barrels.
\
The number of oil rigs operating in Texas increased to 322 in the last year, but that is a considerable drop from the 1,458 operating in late 1981.
\
And so it is with Oklahoma, where the manufacture of clothes, glass and automobiles has become the main staple on the state's economic menu.
\
""In the early 1980s, oil was the chief contributor, but today manufacturing is No. 1 and oil is seventh,"" said Harry Culver, public information director for the office of state finance.
\
As the Oklahoma economy branched into new directions, it became more reflective of the national economy, officials said.
\
So, when the nation was thrust into a recession in the early 1980s, Oklahoma, Texas and Louisiana found a protective shield in their abundant oil
\
revenues.
\
But now production is down and the shield may be gone.
\
""During the early 1980s, Oklahoma, as well as neighboring Texas and Louisiana, enjoyed a serendipitous counter-cyclical economic boom from the same higher energy prices that caused much of the rest of the nation to slide into a recession,"" said Alexander Holmes, director of the office of state finance.
\
""That condition may no longer exist today. In fact, because of the closer economic ties between Oklahoma and the national economies, the potential for a national recession spawned by high oil prices poses a possible negative for Oklahoma.""
\
In other words, the state and its residents may be losing more than they are gaining this time around.
\
For each $1 increase in price per barrel of crude oil, Oklahoma stands to gain $7 million a year in tax revenues. But Holmes said Oklahoma motorists would shell out $200 million if gasoline prices go up just 10 cents, and recent price increases have exceeded that figure.
\
Even if there were a burgeoning demand for U.S. oil, getting it would not be immediate, and it would not be cheap.
\
When the oil industry went bust, many technicians, geologists and engineers left the field and the oil states - 150,000 jobs were lost in Texas alone in the mid-1980s - and much of the oil-drilling equipment was dismantled.
\
What's more, most of the more accessible oil fields in the United States have been drilled, leaving untapped those that are smaller and more difficult and expensive to reach under traditional drilling methods.
\
There is some feeling here that bankers, after their experience of a few years ago, may be reluctant to make energy loans in an uncertain environment.
\
On the other hand, Manlio Huacuja, senior economist in the Colorado Governor's Office, said higher oil prices sustained over a period of years should encourage companies to increase their research and exploration, increasing the likelihood that new technologies could be developed for reaching inaccessible oil fields.

676,"
Does the recent decline in Americans' driving mark a transformation in how we get around, or is it just a speed bump on the highway to ever-greater traffic?
\
A study released today by the Brookings Institution concludes that the drop-off represents a ""permanent shift from reliance on the car to other modes of transportation.""
\
Other experts are unpersuaded. They say the decline is likely temporary, created first by high gas prices and now by the nation's worsening economy.
\
The Brookings study found that the total vehicle-miles traveled in the United States fell by less than 3 percent between December 2006 and September 2008. The period was marked by sharply rising gas prices, but the Brookings authors said the decrease in driving was more than just a reaction to the cost of fuel.
\
The authors cited a number of other factors that affected driving: market saturation of vehicle ownership; a leveling off of the number of women entering the workforce; increased ridership on mass transit; rising unemployment; development of commercial centers closer to workers' homes; migration of baby boomers from suburbs to cities; and a possible ceiling in the amount of driving an individual can tolerate.
\
Pennsylvania and New Jersey showed smaller percentage declines than the national average, with 2.5 percent and 1.7 percent, respectively. The Philadelphia region was 17th lowest among 100 large metro areas in per-capita driving.
\
Recent numbers from the Federal Highway Administration show the decrease in driving has continued even as gas prices have fallen sharply. In October, the most recent month for which data are available, vehicle miles traveled were down 3.5 percent from a year earlier.
\
""It's not possible to say exactly why, but it's clear that something larger is going on in America,"" said Robert Puentes, an author of the study. ""There's no doubt that the economic downturn is a very important factor . . . but we detected these trends beginning years ago.""
\
In the last two years, mass transit has recorded the highest ridership numbers since the 1950s. Amtrak ridership reached a record this year.
\
In the Philadelphia region, SEPTA and PATCO both showed increases in transit riders, and for the first time in nearly a half-century, Center City vehicle traffic dropped in 2005, according to the most recent survey by the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission.
\
The Brookings authors said the apparent change in driving habits should be a factor in national policy-making on energy and the environment, as well as transportation. They recommended an increase in the federal gas tax to help pay for highway and mass transit improvements.
\
Others suggest the decline in driving may not last.
\
""I have a lot of difficulty believing any of it,"" said Alan Pisarski, a traffic consultant and author of the book Commuting in America. He compared the current decline to drop-offs in the early 1970s during the oil embargo and in 1979-80 during the Iranian revolution.
\
""As gas prices shifted lower or the economy improved, people went back to the growth rates,"" he said. ""The automobile still generates an immense benefit for very many people, and they are going to continue to take advantage of it.""
\
David Ellis, a research scientist at the Texas Transportation Institute, said, ""I don't know that we can say that this is permanent yet. We've had declines like this in the past, and we've seen [vehicle-miles traveled] come back.""
\
Several things are likely at work, said Barry Seymour, executive director of the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission. ""What remains to be seen is whether people find transit a reasonable alternative and stick with it as gas prices come back down.""
\
Scott Brady, manager of travel monitoring for the DVRPC, predicted that unless gas prices stay high for many years, Americans will not make permanent changes in their driving habits.
\
He said the recent spike in gas prices ""got a few people thinking, and that's important. If we can turn that thinking into action and present people with real travel options, then we'd see change.""

677,"
Winners and losers in Gov. Tom Corbett's proposed 2013-14 budget:
\
Winners
\
BUSINESSES: Large-enough companies will benefit because the capital stock and franchise tax goes away come January. The governor proposes cutting the corporate net income tax from 9.99 percent to 6.99 percent by 2025 with the first cut - to 9.89 percent - going into effect in January 2015. The cap on deductible net operating losses would rise from $3 million to $5 million over the next two years. New small-business owners will be able to deduct up to $5,000 of startup costs from their taxes.
\
SCHOOL DISTRICTS: They get an extra $90 million in basic education funding, their first increase in two years, and more state funding than before, but still well below what they got in the last year of Gov. Ed Rendell's administration, because federal money went away.
\
The $1 billion from privatizing liquor stores goes toward a new block grant program. The grants can be used to beef up security in schools, boost early childhood education, plan for individual instruction and fund programs that emphasize science, technology, engineering and mathematics.
\
The budget also contains additional funding for pre-kindergarten education. Districts can also apply for waivers from mandated instruction if they can prove they have a better way.
\
TAXPAYERS: No income or sales tax hikes.
\
AGRICULTURE: More money for county fairs and farmland preservation.
\
RETIRED STATE EMPLOYEES: No cuts to their pension benefits.
\
ELDERLY/DISABLED/MENTALLY ILL: The budget provides $40 million more in funding toward keeping elderly and disabled people in their homes and community-based homes, among other things. It also sets aside $2 million to modernize senior-citizen centers. More money for mental health treatment.
\
STATE POLICE: Funding to produce 290 new troopers and 90 new civilian dispatchers to replace troopers in those jobs.
\
DRIVERS: The governor proposed a plan to raise money to fix the state's thousands of decaying roads and bridges - $5.4 billion over five years. They would also have to renew their licenses every six years instead of four, and their vehicle registrations every two years instead of annually.
\
WINE AND LIQUOR CONSUMERS: The governor proposes privatizing the state liquor store system. Advocates say it will increase the availability of a wider variety of products.
\
CHILDREN: More money to cover more kids with health insurance.
\
PARKS: Almost $1.3 million for local park and recreation grants plus substantial renovations at state parks.
\
ENVIRONMENT: Almost $3.5 million more for operations and program management in environmental protection.
\
MUSEUMS AND HISTORICAL GROUPS: Slightly more money.
\
Losers
\
STATE EMPLOYEES: They get a pay raise, but the governor wants them to work 40 hours a week instead of 37.5. New employees will have to go into a cash-based pension plan that requires them to contribute 6.25 percent of their salaries toward retirement. Future benefits for current employees would also be lowered through a lower multiplier and other reforms. Current employees can keep their current multiplier if they contribute more to pensions. The governor also proposes eliminating about 900 positions.
\
Plus, liquor store employees will ultimately lose their jobs, but the governor provides them with job training to find new ones.
\
SCHOOL DISTRICTS: Their special education funding stays the same - again.
\
DRIVERS: Their win is countered by likely higher costs for fuel. The governor lowers the per-gallon gas tax over two years from 12 to 10 cents a gallon, but the lifting of the cap on what is taxable by the oil company franchise tax will likely increase prices.
\
COLLEGE STUDENTS: Funding for state universities and state-related universities remains flat, which likely means more tuition increases.
\
ZOOS: All funding gone.
\
PEOPLE WHO SUFFER FROM EPILEPSY, LUPUS, TOURETTE's SYNDROME AND LOU GEHRIG'S DISEASE: All support service money eliminated.
\
AGRICULTURE: Funding for agricultural, food marketing and hardwoods research is eliminated.
\
REGIONAL POISON CONTROL CENTERS: All funding eliminated.

678,"
The shale gas industry and allies of Gov. Wolf ratcheted up rhetoric this week over a key component of the state's stalemated budget debate:Imposition of a severance tax on natural gas production.
\
The Marcellus Shale Coalition says the proposed tax is the harshest in a series of hostile actions the Wolf administration has taken against the gas industry, one of the state's better-performing economic sectors in the last decade.
\
""Since Gov. Wolf was elected, he has been talking about this industry being successful, but his actions really don't match the words,"" said David Spigelmyer, president of the coalition. He characterized Wolf's manner as a ""my way or the highway"" approach.
\
The Democratic governor is calling the severance tax a mechanism to fund schools. The tax on gas production would generate $1 billion in its first full year, most of which would go to education.
\
But $225 million of gas-tax revenue would replace the current shale impact fee, which is assessed on a per-well assessment and mostly goes to drilling communities. About $10 million of the severance tax would pay for more drilling enforcement.
\
An additional $55 million of the severance tax revenue would pay off a proposed $675 million state economic development bond issue, of which $225 million would be allotted to energy projects, mostly renewable energy.
\
The shale-gas coalition objects that the gas industry would subsidize competing green-energy projects.
\
""A bill of goods has been sold here that this is all about school funding, and frankly it's more about picking winners and losers and funding a broader environmental activist agenda,"" Spigelmyer said.
\
The governor's team says the trade group does not speak for the entire industry. John Hanger, Wolf's policy chief, said some industry executives recognize the need for a severance tax to spread shale-gas benefits across the state.
\
""We had more than a few companies coming to Pennsylvania who were amazed that we had no [shale gas] severance tax,"" Hanger said of his time as environment secretary in the Rendell administration. ""Privately, they thought Pennsylvania was being a chump for not having one.""
\
The sniping is occurring amid a surge in rival ad campaigns over the state budget standoff. Wolf on June 30 vetoed a Republican budget that did not include a severance tax. Until the impasse is resolved, the state has no budget.
\
An affiliate of the Democratic Governors Association, whose biggest source of funding is public-employee unions, last week launched commercials bashing the vetoed GOP plan as letting the oil and gas industry off the hook, underfunding education, and deepening the state's deficit.
\
On Monday, Americans for Prosperity, an advocacy group founded by the billionaire energy executives Charles and David Koch, kicked off a radio campaign that says Wolf is ""cooking up schemes to hike your taxes.""
\
The shale coalition says the severance tax is only one of several unfriendly actions Wolf has taken.
\
Wolf remade the Oil and Gas Technical Advisory Board, not to the industry's liking. It imposed stricter gas-drilling regulations, which the industry says would raise costs without increasing environmental protections.
\
The state cut its estimate of direct and induced jobs generated by the industry to 89,000 from more than 200,000.
\
""To scale back those numbers to drive some broader political agenda is kind of silly,"" said Spigelmyer. Hanger said the old estimate was ""glaringly wrong,"" and the new estimate still amounts to an ""impressive"" 1.5 percent of state employment.
\
""There's nothing hostile about that,"" Hanger said.
\
The state last month also announced its ""intention"" to impose a record $8.9 million fine against Range Resources Corp. of Fort Worth, Texas, for allegedly failing to fix a natural gas well in Lycoming County that it says contaminated nearby water wells. Range denies its operations were at fault. The highest previous fine was $4.5 million against EQT Corp., which the company is challenging.
\
Spigelmyer says the higher cost of doing business in Pennsylvania will drive the industry to divert investments to more hospitable states.
\
Wolf's advisers say that's a hollow threat: Pennsylvania is now the nation's second-biggest natural gas producer because the Marcellus Shale is such a rich resource.
\
""Frankly, gas drilling will stop just about everywhere else in North America before it stops in Pennsylvania, because we have the best resource right here,"" Hanger said.

"
679,"WASHINGTON -- A pre-summer spike in gasoline prices has ignited an election-year furor, with President Barack Obama mocking presumed Republican ""three-point plans for $2 gas,"" all of which involve drilling, and Republicans claiming that Mr. Obama's energy strategy relies on algae, pond scum and chicken manure, not to mention bankrupt solar manufacturer Solyndra.\Few things send politicians to the barricades faster than rising gasoline prices. People tend to go ballistic over $4 gasoline while hardly blinking at paying as much for one cup of coffee.\With the predictability of a morality play, pro-environment Democrats are accusing oil companies of profiteering and Republicans are defending budget-busting tax subsidies to oil producers while attacking subsidies for alternative energy.\But higher gasoline prices are a proven way to encourage energy conservation, development of alternative energy, and domestic oil and gas production.\Politicians ""know that's not what the public wants to hear,"" said Severin Borenstein, director of the University of California Energy Institute in Berkeley. ""The public's upset and they think it is the president's responsibility to make sure gasoline is cheap.""\House Democrats have attacked GOP plans to open the Pacific and Atlantic coasts to drilling. But in Miami recently, Mr. Obama sounded like the driller-in-chief. He claimed credit for higher domestic fossil-fuel production set in motion long before he took office.\""Under my administration, America is producing more oil today than at any time in the last eight years,"" Mr. Obama said, promising to open ""more than 75 percent of our potential offshore oil and gas resources from Alaska to the Gulf of Mexico.""\Like his predecessor, George W. Bush, who lamented in 2008 that he had no ""magic wand"" to reduce gas prices, Mr. Obama said he had ""no silver bullet"" and embraced an ""all-of-the-above"" energy strategy, which includes ""public investments"" in green energy companies, ""even though some companies will fail,"" a tacit acknowledgement of the Solyndra bankruptcy and other green energy companies that received billions of dollars in taxpayer funds.\Mr. Obama also touted algae as a fuel source, prompting ridicule from the Republican National Committee, which recycled Obama campaign quotes from 2008 about pond scum and chicken manure.\""We're making new investments in the development of gasoline and diesel and jet fuel that's actually made from a plantlike substance -- algae,"" Mr. Obama said.\Biotechnology company Solazyme, which makes algae fuels, received $22 million in 2009 from the Department of Energy and contracted with the military to provide algae-based fuels.\Republicans blamed rising gas prices on Mr. Obama's blocking approval of the Keystone pipeline, which would take years to construct. On the campaign trail, GOP presidential hopeful Newt Gingrich promised a domestic drilling bonanza such that ""no future president will ever bow to a Saudi king again"" and everyone can buy $2.50 gas.\Higher domestic production of fossil fuels and alternative energy might reduce U.S. vulnerability to price shocks from overseas and keep more money at home, but that would have little effect on oil prices, which are set on a global market.\The boom in oil shales in North Dakota and tar sands in Canada helps increase incomes in those areas and keeps at home billions of dollars that might otherwise go abroad. But oil prices are set by ""a lot of external factors that George Bush couldn't control in 2008 and Barack Obama can't control today,"" Mr. Borenstein said.\Gasoline prices began heading up in December and reached a new February high, driven by higher oil prices, which now top $120 per barrel. The causes include fears of supply disruptions because of hostilities with Iran and instability in Nigeria.\China's rising wealth is also putting pressure on prices, as previously impoverished Chinese now have the means to buy cars. ""In five years, the number of cars on the road in China more than tripled,"" Mr. Obama said. ""Think about how much oil that requires.""\Policy analysts, as opposed to policy makers, have long recommended a higher gasoline tax or a broader tax on carbon to encourage increased energy supplies of all kinds and energy conservation, while filling the U.S. Treasury instead of the treasuries of Venezuela strong man Hugo Chavez, Saudi royalty and other dictators.\The 18.4-cents-per-gallon gas tax was last raised during the Clinton presidency, Mr. Borenstein said, and has fallen sharply when adjusted for inflation.\""We're collecting more revenue through taxing work through income taxes, and less through taxing things like gasoline,"" Mr. Borenstein said. ""So we are discouraging work and encouraging gasoline consumption, which is not good tax policy."""

Fuel tax option
\
Editor: I am responding to Mike Skerritt of Ararat Twp. in Susquehanna County (""Boost Gas Tax,"" Jan. 20), who opines that the government should impose an additional 50-cents-per-gallon tax on gasoline in order to improve our roads.
\
He opined that the motoring public should welcome this tax, since drivers had paid upwards of $4 per gallon in recent years. He suggested that the tax could be reduced if the price of gasoline approached $4 per gallon again.
\
Mr. Skerritt lives in an area where heavy trucks transport water and other materials necessary for Marcellus Shale fracking. This process generates significant income for landowners who lease their land for gas extraction. Indeed, just a few years ago, those landowners would not have expected to generate income from that process. This is really extra money in their pockets.
\
With this in mind, I have a better idea. I believe the state should impose a tax on landowners who lease their property for fracking purposes. The amount of the tax should be divided proportionally among those landowners and should generate income equal to Mr. Skerritt's proposed gasoline tax. Furthermore, this tax should remain in place until every state road, secondary township roads and all bridges in the state are returned to excellent condition.
\
I do not propose a tax on the gas industry because the drillers would just pass the additional cost to consumers.

Ruinous overtime

Editor: Apparently, Mayor Bill Courtright forgot about his campaign rhetoric during the last mayoral election, in which he said that he was trusted by municipal unions and that together they had a plan to reduce Police Department overtime.
\
According to Scranton Police Chief Carl Graziano in a Times-Tribune article published Jan. 8, the cost of overtime for 2014 was about $1 million. Clearly, Mr. Courtright's plan to reduce overtime in the Police Department for 2014 failed.
\
Unfortunately for taxpayers, the outrageous overtime amount is just another failed policy of the Courtright administration.

Mr. Courtright promised to get the city ""back on track"" and all we've gotten is a train wreck.

\
That is when the alleged concessions were made and agreed on, I suspect. They were not to benefit the taxpayers, but for his own personal agenda and those of the unions.
\
City council had questions about the proposed police contract extension, but passed it without the questions being answered. Where are the councilmen's brains located? Now, the taxpayers will suffer while the city goes deeper in debt and the unions smile all the way to the bank.

712,"
Every few years since 1961, New Jersey has borrowed money to buy land for parks and recreation - with voter support that has been more rock-solid than almost anywhere in the nation. But every few years, the money runs out.
\
That year-to-year uncertainty would become a thing of the past in November if voters approve a dramatic 30-year proposal to permanently earmark $98 million a year in the state budget for open-space preservation. In addition, $100 million a year would be borrowed for each of the next 10 years.
\
Almost unanimously on Thursday, the Legislature put that plan on the Nov. 3 ballot despite 11th-hour resistance among some Assembly Democrats, savoring their newfound muscle after derailing Gov. Whitman's gasoline-tax increase earlier in the week.
\
Conservation experts across the nation already are starting to take notice of the landmark environmental legislation.
\
``It would put New Jersey pretty much at the forefront,'' said Ernest Cook, senior vice president of the San Francisco-based Trust for Public Land, a national land-preservation group.
\
Other states, such as Florida, have put aside comparable dollar amounts for land preservation, but given the relative size of New Jersey, the scope of the project is staggering. The state measures 4.8 million acres, of which 3 million are already developed or preserved. Of the nearly 2 million acres still up for grabs, Whitman seeks to preserve 1 million acres, an area more than 10 times the size of Philadelphia. Some of it would be through outright land purchases, some of it through purchasing the development rights to farms.
\
Ambitious or not, environmentalists say New Jersey cannot afford to wait. It is the most crowded state in the country, at 1,085 people per square mile. The plan would preserve space for recreation, farming, and ecologically fragile watersheds.
\
Privately, some supporters doubt that the million-acre goal can be achieved with the new funds, since the plan anticipates that 200,000 acres will be donated. Yet Thursday's vote was universally praised as a step in the right direction.
\
``The bottom line is, everybody pulled together to do something for the future of everyone in New Jersey,'' said Jeff Tittel, New Jersey Sierra Club director. He called the plan ``one of the most important pieces of legislation in the last 10 years.''
\
Now on the comfortable side of seeing the measure pass both houses, supporters say it was never in serious jeopardy of defeat.
\
Earlier in the week they were worried that it would go the way of another Whitman proposal, a 4-cent-per-gallon increase in the gasoline tax to finance mass transit and highway projects, which died Tuesday after Assembly Democrats opposed it. They said that opposition was sparked largely by Whitman herself. Speaking to the Republican National Committee last weekend, she reiterated core GOP themes such as economic growth and, ironically, cutting taxes.
\
When the Assembly Appropriations Committee signed off on the open-space plan on Monday, not one Democrat voted for of it. This spelled potential trouble, according to environmentalists, some of whom had pushed for such a permanent source of funding for at least 15 years.
\
``It was a shock,'' said Maureen Ogden, a former seven-term assemblywoman and chair of the governor's council to study open space. ``Clearly it was a warning signal that we'd better not take anything for granted.''
\
Environmentalists then hit the phones to marshal legislative support.
\
``We reminded them that it would be detrimental for them to be the party that killed open space,'' said David Pringle, of the New Jersey Environmental Federation.
\
Some Democrats sought guarantees that funds would be spent to maintain existing parks, a category in which New Jersey ranks far below the national average. Others insisted that money be set aside for urban centers.
\
The bill makes no such guarantees. Nevertheless, it was two pro-environment Democrats from densely populated Middlesex County, Barbara Buono and Robert G. Smith, who swayed their colleagues during a closed-door meeting Thursday. Another Democrat, Neil M. Cohen, of Union County, drew chuckles from his colleagues, reportedly saying that by preserving farmland, New Jersey would ensure that more residents live in its cities - the traditional base of Democratic support.
\
``I think that this one had a much better grounding of support, and the Whitman administration didn't make the mistakes they made on the gas tax,'' Assembly Minority Leader Joseph V. Doria Jr. (D., Hudson) said later.
\
Now it is up to the voters, and proponents are optimistic, given the success of the 10 Green Acres and farmland-preservation bond referendums approved since 1961.
\
Moreover, Ogden noted, 53 of the state's municipalities and 13 of its counties already have their own open-space plans.
\
``This groundswell at the local level in New Jersey is unprecedented in any other state,'' she said.
\
If the measure passes, the Legislature must then approve a companion plan to spell out how the money will be spent. The governor's Council on New Jersey Outdoors broke down its million-acre recommendation as follows: saving 500,000 acres of farmland; 200,000 for public recreation spaces; 200,000 acres for greenways (such as stream corridors, trails or linear parks that connect larger open spaces); and 100,000 acres for watershed protection.
\
When it comes time to vote, the issue will be simple, said Dolores A. Phillips, another environmentalist who lobbied for the cause.
\
``Either New Jersey remains the Garden State or becomes the concrete state,'' she said.

713,"
Gov. Christie announced Wednesday that he was sticking to his decision to shut down the nation's largest public works project, a second rail tunnel to connect New Jersey and New York City.
\
The governor first announced his decision to cancel the tunnel on Oct. 7, but was persuaded by U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, who traveled to Trenton for a personal meeting, to reconsider. Christie said he would take two weeks to review his decision.
\
Since then, federal officials have offered New Jersey $358 million in new funding, on top of $3 billion already committed, as well as a host of options to lower costs, including trimming the scale of the project and low-interest federal loans.
\
But Christie said Wednesday none of that was enough to change his mind, given that New Jersey would have been forced to pick up any cost overruns.
\
""I cannot place upon the citizens of New Jersey an open-ended letter of credit, and that's what this project represented,"" the governor said. ""Nothing in the last two weeks changed that.""
\
Christie argued that although the tunnel would benefit the entire region, New Jersey would have borne the largest burden in paying for it.
\
The decision is likely to bring even more attention to Christie, a freshman Republican governor, when his star is rising within conservative circles around the country. The former federal prosecutor has been touring the country in recent weeks in support of fellow Republicans seeking office. He has won unstinting praise from some Republicans for his tough talk of smaller government and accountability.
\
Christie said Wednesday that his opposition to the tunnel, to be known as ARC, for Access to the Region's Core, was not philosophical, but merely a matter of dollar and cents.
\
""We are changing the way we do business in this state,"" Christie said. ""We are not going to be signing blank checks.""
\
At the start of work on the tunnel in June 2009, it was estimated that the project, which would have more than doubled train capacity between New York and New Jersey, would cost $8.7 billion. Recently, federal transportation officials have estimated the cost between $9.8 billion and $12.7 billion, but the Christie administration estimated that costs overruns could have reached $6 billion.
\
The Federal Transit Administration and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey had each committed $3 billion to the project, but New Jersey would have been responsible for additional costs.
\
The governor said that this time his decision was final, with ""no opportunity for reconsideration.""
\
Republicans applauded the governor as making a difficult but necessary decision.
\
""I support Gov. Christie's decision that refuses to allow the liability for overruns to be shouldered by New Jersey's taxpayers and commuters,"" said Assembly Republican Leader Alex DeCroce (R., Morris). ""The governor recognizes that we can no longer continue to burden the people who pay the highest taxes in the country.""
\
Federal officials, transportation advocates, and Democratic lawmakers criticized the move as short-sighted.
\
""I am extremely disappointed in Gov. Christie's decision to abandon the ARC tunnel project, which is a devastating blow to thousands of workers, millions of commuters, and the state's economic future,"" LaHood said. ""The governor's decision to stop work on this project means commuters - who would have saved 45 minutes each day thanks to the ARC tunnel - will instead see no end to traffic congestion and ever-longer wait times on train platforms.""
\
U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D., N.J.), one of the strongest proponents of the project, said, ""The federal government demonstrated its strong commitment to building this tunnel, but it was clear from the beginning that Gov. Christie planned to kill this project no matter what.""
\
Lautenberg also dinged Christie for taking to the campaign trail in recent weeks, saying New Jersey needed him at home.
\
""I was a CEO, and I know you need to be at work to do your job, and Gov. Christie is out in other states and not doing his job,"" Lautenberg said. ""While the governor is on political missions in Indiana, California, Ohio, and other states, he is ducking the needs of people in New Jersey.""
\
Proponents had argued that the tunnel, decades in the making, would create 6,000 construction-related jobs a year during the construction phase, through 2018, and 44,000 permanent jobs. The tunnel was expected to reduce congestion and increase air quality.
\
Some critics said the tunnel should have connected to existing stations, such as Penn Station, and accommodated Amtrak trains.
\
Christie was among those who questioned the tunnel's lack of connectivity to existing stations.
\
One question Christie did not answer Wednesday was whether he would use the money New Jersey had committed to the tunnel to shore up the nearly depleted Transportation Trust Fund, which pays for transportation projects across the state, including roads, bridges, and transit projects.
\
The governor has already ruled out raising the state's gas tax - one of the lowest in the nation - to replenish the fund. Almost all of the remaining money in the fund has been earmarked for debt service, which means the state must find a new source of funding or halt critical transportation projects.
\
On Wednesday, Christie said he had ""no idea"" whether he would reallocate money that had been slated for the tunnel to the fund.
\
New Jersey will likely be forced to repay the federal government the $350 million in federal funds already spent on the ARC project. New Jersey Transit has spent an additional $250 million.
\
Christie said he was open to the idea of partnering with Amtrak to build a new tunnel to New York City but said there were no immediate plans to do so.
\
Environmental advocates urged the governor not to raid the ARC tunnel money to pay for highways.
\
""On the heels of this unhealthy decision today, the governor should pledge that not a single dollar of funds now earmarked for the ARC tunnel will be used to expand highways and promote driving over cleaner modes of transportation,"" said Dena Mottola Jaborska, executive director of Environment New Jersey.

The spending was made possible by a strong state economy that by last month had pushed tax and other revenues $547 million beyond expectations. So much tax money has been flowing into state coffers in recent years that Ridge expects to be able to have nearly $1 billion in reserves at the end of the next budget year.
\
""I will proudly sign this new budget into law tonight to bring more jobs, better schools and lower taxes to the people of Pennsylvania,"" the governor said in a statement late yesterday afternoon.
\
Both chambers approved the budget by wide margins earlier yesterday, sending Ridge a proposal that was substantially the same as the one he proposed in February.
\
That plan's highlights included $183 million in tax cuts for business, an $82 million reduction in the natural-gas tax, and a personal-income tax forgiveness program for the poor that will cost the state $7.5 million.
\
Ridge also sought $64 million for the first phase of a proposed five-year tuition-voucher program that is targeted at certain counties in the state, including Philadelphia, Chester, Delaware, Montgomery and part of Bucks.
\
Those plans remained intact in the plan approved yesterday, thoughthe legislature must still authorize the voucher plan itself. But the legislature also made its mark.
\
Lawmakers added an additional $125 million in tax cuts, including $97 million to expand rebates on property tax and rent for low-income senior citizens and the disabled.
\
The legislators also increased overall spending by nearly $500 million over Ridge's plan, including $43 million for farmland preservation - tripling what Ridge had proposed - and doubled to $85 million the money available for grants to municipalities and community groups.
\
In addition, about $20 million was inserted for school-safety programs, and special-education funding grew by $8 million.
\
""It puts Pennsylvania on the right course and keeps it on that course to grow successfully,"" said Senate Majority Leader F. Joseph Loeper (R., Delaware).
\
Lawmakers also scrapped several Ridge proposals that would have hit municipalities hard. They refused to go along with a Ridge plan to eliminate a $46 million local sewer subsidy. Ridge wanted to channel that money to other environmental programs as part of his Growing Greener environmental initiative.
\
The legislature also approved $14 million to pay for state police patrols of 45 rural communities around the state. Without the money, which Ridge wanted to eliminate, those communities would have been forced to pay for their own protection.
\
Lawmakers barked partisan rhetoric on the floors of both chambers yesterday, but the spending decisions had been made long before the debate began. A group of House and Senate leaders spent recent weeks negotiating, and a conference committee released the final budget yesterday: a plan whose 4 percent spending increase outpaces previous administration budgets, which averaged 2.75 percent in growth.
\
Together with federal money, the state will spend nearly $28.9 billion.
\
The Senate approved it, 47-2. The House signed off, 141-58.
\
""There's no reason not to be pleased,"" said House Majority Leader John M. Perzel (R., Phila.).
\
The ranking Democrats on the House and Senate Appropriations Committees, both from Philadelphia, were not in Harrisburg yesterday. Sen. Vince Fumo was on personal leave, aides said. Rep. Dwight Evans was campaigning in the city's mayoral race.
\
Other Democrats complained that the budget fell short in education funding, middle-class tax relief, and funding for child care.
\
""We failed our schools and our children by not providing for greater investment in education,"" said Sen. Allyson Y. Schwartz (D., Phila.). ""This budget is a disappointment to the children and working families of this commonwealth.""
\
Ridge aides said they expected to finish the forthcoming budget year with a $630 million surplus.
\
Nearly $245 million of the expected surplus is to be set aside for the Rainy Day Fund, the state's hedge against future economic downturn. That is about $150 million more than required by law, which would put the fund at an unprecedented $983 million.
\
Though tax changes are expected to be made in legislation next week, they were reflected in the budget.
\
The cuts include reducing the capital stock and franchise tax, a levy on business assets, and the corporate net-income tax; cutting a 5 percent tax on natural gas, saving about two million families and businesses an average of about $30 each; and expanding a program that would exempt some of the working poor from state income taxes.
\
The legislature's $97 million expansion of a rent and property-tax rebate program for low-income senior citizens will allow 181,000 more seniors - nearly 500,000 total - to receive a rebate of up to $500.
\
Overall education spending, including higher education, will rise about 2.6 percent to nearly $7.3 billion. That makes up a third of the budget.
\
The spending includes a nearly 3 percent jump for schools in basic-education subsidies, which will grow by more than $107 million to nearly $3.7 billion.
\
In Philadelphia, basic and special-education subsidies will grow by about 2.7 percent to nearly $731 million. For Philadelphia officials, who predict a $94 million shortfall in their $1.5 billion budget for 1999-2000, it was not enough.
\
""Clearly, it does not address the immediate or long-term fiscal problems we've been talking about the last three or four years,"" said district spokesman Bill Epstein.
\
But Secretary of Education Eugene Hickok pointed to funding increases outside the basic subsidy, saying: ""The refrain for more money . . . is heard far too often and doesn't have the resonance it once did."" Temple University will get a 3 percent increase, and SEPTA will receive an additional $5 million in funding, or a 2.9 percent increase. Statewide, the budget contains an additional $42 million for special-education funding, a 6 percent increase over last year's budget and about $8 million more than Ridge called for.
\
The money will be distributed according to a new formula expected to benefit Philadelphia, which will see a $2.9 million budgetary increase.
\
Ridge's pilot school-choice plan was also funded, a five-year, $587 million program that would provide ""opportunity grants"" for parents to pay tuition at the public, private or parochial school of their choice.
\
Aides say the funding bodes well but is no indicator that the voucher plan itself will pass.
\
The budget also includes $20 million to fund school-safety programs, though how it will be spent remains unclear with more than 20 safety bills before the legislature.

I find it ironic that people who are happy to receive their government Social Security checks and have their medical bills paid by Medicare totally dismiss a government health-care option for those unfortunate people under 65 who can't afford private health care. For us seniors, it's an entitlement; for them, it's ""socialism.""

Yet that is just what happens to millions of people when they need medical care.
\
We don't call it socialism when government pays for police and firefighters and roads, or when it provides Social Security or Medicare. We call it serving the common good, a necessity for a developed, civilized society that cares about its people - all of its people.

Make lawmakers

\
This year's Pennsylvania budget process is unprecedented, but not just because we faced a historic economic downturn that resulted in a massive deficit. The budget was 101 days late.
\
The legislature worked hard to get a budget agreement, but partisanship and stubbornness got in the way. Because of disagreements, the public and critical state programs and services suffer.
\
I intend to introduce legislation that requires elected officials and cabinet members to forfeit pay if a budget is not passed by June 30. We all work hard, but this budget and others have shown that something is needed to achieve a timely resolution.
\
The state constitution requires us to have a balanced budget on time every year, and my legislation would provide additional safeguards to make sure that happens.

DEP spending
\
will grow, not shrink
\
Tucked away in a recent editorial (""Drilling for friends,"" Oct. 8) is your claim that the state Senate approved legislation that would reduce the Department of Environmental Protection's budget by 30 percent. That is nonsense.
\
While DEP's overall General Fund budget will decline by $58 million, little of this money is from enforcement. Much of the money comes from eliminating $11 million for safe water funds (which The Inquirer once referred to as ""WAMs,"" or Walking Around Money) and $15 million for consumer energy rebates.
\
This funding is more than offset by the $1.2 billion in water infrastructure bonds approved by the legislature last year, an additional $220 million in federal stimulus funds for water infrastructure, and nearly $253 million in federal stimulus funds for consumer energy efficiency projects. Additionally, DEP will soon have approved nearly $20 million in annual revenue from higher fees on the regulated community. When all is added up, DEP will actually be spending more this year than last.

Rendell made bad move in delaying drilling tax
\
Re: ""Natural gas tax needed to be delayed,"" Tuesday:
\
Gov. Rendell's choosing not to tax natural gas companies was a bad deal for Pennsylvania's environment and our economy.
\
The governor says that companies are focusing on where they can drill at the lowest cost. Well, 2008 saw Pennsylvania allow the second-highest number of natural gas wells in the nation - 4,000 - behind only Texas. Pennsylvania is perfectly positioned to implement the tax.
\
Second, Rendell says that ""additional costs simply decrease the pace at which these firms are willing to expand into Pennsylvania."" Range Resources has said that it expects to double its number of operating rigs in Pennsylvania by year's end.
\
Last, Rendell states that a six-month delay on implementing this tax is a suitable alternative. Then why didn't the governor work to pass this proposal and make the law's start date July 1, 2010, instead of putting it off indefinitely?
\
The governor has a legacy of pushing strong environmental policies. Unfortunately, he needs to do a better job of protecting the public interest.

716," Federal\ WASHINGTON - Here's how area members of Congress were recorded on major roll call votes in the week ending May 24.\ House\ Fuel tax cut: Voting 301 for and 108 against, the House sent the Senate a bill (HR 3415) temporarily lowering the federal tax on gasoline and other transportation fuels from 18.3 cents to 14 cents per gallon. This suspends for the remainder of the year a 4.3-cent levy that Congress imposed in 1993 to reduce the deficit by $24 billion over five years.\ A yes vote was to temporarily lower the U.S. gasoline tax from 18.3 cents to 14 cents.\ Pennsylvanians voting yes: Tim Holden, D-6, Curt Weldon, R-7, James Greenwood, R-8, Bud Shuster, R-9, Joseph McDade, R-10, Jon Fox, R-13, Robert Walker, R-16, George Gekas, R-17, Mike Doyle, D-18, William Goodling, R-19, Frank Mascara, D-20, Philip English, R-21.\ Voting no: Thomas Foglietta, D-1, Chaka Fattah, D-2, Robert Borski, D-3, Paul Kanjorski, D-11, John Murtha, D-12, William Coyne, D-14, Paul McHale, D-15.\ Not voting: Ron Klink, D-4, William Clinger, R-5.\ Pass-through: By a vote of 183 for and 225 against, the House rejected a Democratic motion to require oil companies to pass through to consumers the benefits of a 4.3-cent-per-gallon drop in federal fuel taxes (HR 3415, above).\ A yes vote was to require a pass-through of gas tax savings to consumers.\ Voting yes: Foglietta, Fattah, Borski, Holden, Kanjorski, Murtha, Coyne, McHale, Doyle, Mascara.\ Voting no: Weldon, Greenwood, Shuster, McDade, Fox, Walker, Gekas, Goodling, English.\ Not voting: Klink, Clinger.\ Spy budget: The House rejected, 176 for and 248 against, an amendment to make public the total U.S. intelligence budget, a classified figure widely reported at about $30 billion annually.\ This vote occurred as the House sent the Senate a bill (HR 3259) authorizing fiscal 1997 spending for the intelligence operations of 12 agencies.\ A yes vote was to declassify the total annual cost of U.S. intelligence.\ Voting yes: Foglietta, Fattah, Borski, Klink, Holden, Kanjorski, Fox, Coyne, McHale, Mascara.\ Voting no: Clinger, Weldon, Greenwood, Shuster, McDade, Murtha, Walker, Gekas, Doyle, Goodling, English.\ Journalists: The House voted, 417 for and six against, to make it more difficult for the CIA to seek to use journalists as intelligence agents. Under the amendment to HR 3259 (above), only the president could waive a ban on the CIA recruiting journalists, compared to present policy allowing the CIA director to grant waivers.\ A yes vote was to adopt the amendment.\ Voting yes: Foglietta, Fattah, Borski, Klink, Clinger, Holden, Weldon, Greenwood, Shuster, McDade, Kanjorski, Murtha, Fox, Coyne, McHale, Walker, Gekas, Doyle, Goodling, Mascara, English.\ Voting no: None.\ Minimum wage: The House approved, 266 for and 162 against, an amendment to raise the minimum wage from $4.25 to $4.75 an hour on July 1 and to $5.15 a year later.

The amendment was offered to a bill (HR 1227) that raises the minimum wage by 90 cents to $5.15 an hour (see previous vote).\ A yes vote was to exempt small businesses from having to pay the minimum wage.\ Voting yes: Clinger, Shuster, Walker, Gekas, Goodling.\ Voting no: Foglietta, Fattah, Borski, Klink, Holden, Weldon, Greenwood, McDade, Kanjorski, Murtha, Fox, Coyne, McHale, Doyle, Mascara, English.\ Small business: By a vote of 414 for and 10 against, the House sent the Senate a bill (HR 3448) providing small businesses, growers who hire foreign farm workers, charitable organizations and others with nearly $700 million in tax breaks over the next five years. The lost revenue would be offset by tightening several areas of the tax code.\ A yes vote was to pass the bill.\ Voting yes: Foglietta, Fattah, Borski, Klink, Clinger, Holden, Weldon, Greenwood, Shuster, Kanjorski, Murtha, Fox, Coyne, McHale, Walker, Gekas, Doyle, Goodling, Mascara, English.\ Voting no: None.\ Not voting: McDade.\ Senate\ Medicaid: Voting 55 for and 45 against, the Senate tabled (killed) a Democratic bid to spend $18 billion more on Medicaid through 2002 than the $730 billion that Republicans recommend spending. The added spending was to have been offset by closing unspecified corporate tax loopholes. The vote came during debate on a budget blueprint for fiscal 1997 and beyond (S Con Res 57) that awaited final Senate approval.\ A yes vote was kill the Democratic bid for higher Medicaid spending.\ Pennsylvanians Arlen Specter, R, and Rick Santorum, R, voted yes.\ Education: Voting 52 for and 48 against, the Senate tabled (killed) a proposed Democratic increase of $56.1 billion over six years for education and job training. This was a 19 percent increase in the Republicans' proposed budget of $302 billion through 2002. Offered as an amendment to S Con Res 57 (above), the increase was to have been offset by ending unspecified corporate tax breaks.\ A yes vote was kill the Democratic bid for higher education spending.\ Specter voted no; Santorum voted yes.\ Budget: The Senate passed, 53 for and 46 against, a fiscal 1997 budget blueprint (S Con Res 57) along with a plan for ending deficit spending by 2002. Drafted mainly by Republicans, the measure anticipates spending of $1.63 trillion, revenue of $1.47 trillion and a deficit of $155 billion in 1997. It goes to conference with a House version that provides $5 billion less for domestic programs.\ A yes vote was to approve the budget blueprint.\ Specter and Santorum voted yes.\ Environment: Voting 55 for and 45 against, the Senate tabled (killed) a Democratic bid to add $7.3 billion to S Con Res 57 (above) for environmental spending over six years. The amount was to be offset by reducing unspecified corporate tax breaks.\ A yes vote opposed the bid to increase environmental spending.\ Specter and Santorum voted yes."

Shale gas tax
\
should be imposed
\
It is truly a shame that Republican gubernatorial candidate Tom Corbett and his running mate, James Cawley, are more interested in preserving the gas-drilling profits of corporations than protecting Pennsylvania's environment.
\
Most states that extract natural gas impose specific taxes on that industry. Pennsylvania, however, does not. An extraction tax with a significant portion of the revenues going to environmental protection means that when drillers remove nonrenewable resources from beneath our state, the same companies fund the necessary cleanup of the mess they leave from drilling.
\
Cawley and Corbett falsely claim an extraction tax will stifle drilling investment. Studies have shown that the size and location of natural-gas reserves, the market price of natural gas, and the availability of investment capital are of vastly greater significance than a tax.
\
They also falsely claim drillers are already subject to one of the highest corporate tax rates in the country. But most drillers will only pay the state's personal income tax, rather than the corporate net income tax. In addition, drilling companies benefit from billions of dollars in federal tax breaks.

Was Blair awarded

a medal for liberties?
\
Tony Blair was a surprising choice by the National Constitution Center to receive the 2010 Liberty Medal. While Britain's former prime minister did some good things to bring peace to Northern Ireland earlier in his career, things changed radically once he jumped into bed with George W. Bush.
\
So, the Liberty Medal was awarded to the same Blair who so steadfastly supported Bush's unnecessary (and some would say illegal) war of aggression in Iraq, knowing, as we learned via the Downing Street memo, that the intelligence was being twisted to justify the war.
\
Blair and Bush certainly did take liberties there, but I don't think they're the kind of liberties the medal is supposed to commend. Like the Nobel Peace Prize awarded to President Obama, it appears the Liberty Medal is losing its value.

Along with John Neumann and Katherine Drexel, the parish also received Sister Patricia Waldron, who with nine other Sisters of Mercy from Ireland accepted the invitation of Bishop James Frederick Wood and Assumption's pastor, the Rev. Charles Carter, to found the ministry of the Sisters of Mercy in Philadelphia in 1861. This parish has cultivated a rich heritage of Catholic life that we celebrate.

Masterman isn't
\
a school for elitists
\
It was wonderful that President Obama gave his back-to-school address at Masterman School, but why does every article about Masterman have to make the school sound like the elite playground of the rich and connected?
\
Masterman's student body reflects the full racial, ethnic, and economic spectrum of the city. Masterman parents are teachers, nurses, construction workers, architects, doctors, social workers, and workers in many other professions.
\
Nearly 45 percent of the student body qualifies for free or reduced-price lunches. The student population is racially diverse, with African Americans making up 30 percent; Asians, 18 percent; and Latinos, 6 percent. Masterman provides a path to academic achievement and success that might otherwise be unattainable by many of its students.
\
Yes, Masterman has had some famous students and alumni since it opened in 1958. Yes, it has consistently been ranked the best high school in the city and state, and it is a Blue Ribbon School. But these results are testimony to the fact that everyone at Masterman - students, teachers, and staff - shares a love of learning and a desire to be the best. Please don't minimize their achievements by implying they are elitist.

Obama visit would have meant more to West
\
President Obama gave his back-to-school address Tuesday at Masterman. While we applaud his selection of a Philadelphia public school, and acknowledge the superior accomplishments of Masterman, which regularly place it in the nation's top 100 public schools, those students are destined to succeed with or without the president's visit. But what would a visit from him have meant to a comprehensive high school like West? West has not had consecutive years of annual progress under No Child Left Behind; only this year was it removed from the state's list of persistently dangerous schools.
\
Imagine if the president had not only acknowledged West's existence, but honored it; the impact would be immeasurable. West students are so earnest and hardworking. So many West students have not been privy to the resources and cultural capital available to Masterman's. A visit from the president would have demonstrated that they are valued, not because they are already top performers, but because, with positive attention like the type that regularly gets doled out to the Masterman students of this country, they can strive to be.

718,"
Gov. Rendell said Wednesday that he doubted he and state lawmakers would meet their Oct. 1 deadline to pass a tax on natural-gas drillers - which could pour hundreds of millions of dollars into state and local governments' recession-ravaged coffers.
\
Speaking to reporters after a gathering with local officials and environmentalists in Chester County, Rendell said he would veto any proposal that didn't come ""awfully close"" to his plan for a 5 percent tax on sales of the extracted gas, plus an additional 4.7 cents for every 1,000 cubic feet of gas produced.
\
Asked if he was confident that he and legislative leaders would get a gas tax enacted by their self-imposed deadline, the governor shook his head, smiled, and said, ""No.""
\
Leaders in the Republican-controlled Senate are expected to offer details of their own plan next week. They generally have rejected Rendell's as untenable.
\
""We're not confident that the House Democratic caucus and the governor can be reasonable on the tax rate,"" Andrew Crompton, chief of staff to Senate President Pro Tem Joe Scarnati (R., Jefferson), said Wednesday.
\
The comment signaled new trouble for the so-called gas severance tax, a plan that collapsed about the same time last year. The governor revived the idea this year, and, as part of budget negotiations, he and lawmakers agreed to reach a deal by Oct. 1. Rendell spokesman Gary Tuma said Wednesday night that ""no legal or practical reason"" prevented all sides from working toward a tax until the legislative session ends in mid-October.
\
Dozens of bills are floating around Harrisburg, and the next few weeks are expected to bring with them a frantic dose of lobbying and deal-making over the fate of the proposed tax.
\
In the balance could be one of the biggest single sources of state funding to emerge in decades - potentially hundreds of millions of dollars flowing from wells in the gas-rich Marcellus Shale formation beneath the state - and tens of thousands of jobs.
\
The Pennsylvania deposit underlies most of the state except for its southeastern corner. Thousands of drill permits have been issued in the affected counties in the last two years, and more are expected.
\
The surge has sparked water-pollution and safety concerns from environmentalists, along with worries from municipalities that fear being overburdened.
\
To get the gas, drillers shoot a mix of water and chemicals deep into the ground to break up the shale and release the gas trapped within it, pump the gas through wells, and then haul it away by truck.
\
Pennsylvania remains the largest gas-producing state not to collect any tax on those natural resources.
\
Industry officials have pressed for a 1.5 percent tax rate during the first five years of any such tax, arguing that they need the time to recoup startup costs.
\
""In order to ensure that the potentials of the Marcellus are fully realized, we remain focused on not only modernizing Pennsylvania's legislative and regulatory framework, but making certain that a severance tax does not discourage critical capital investments from flowing into the commonwealth,"" Kathryn Klaber, president of the Marcellus Shale Coalition, which represents many gas and energy companies, said in a statement.
\
Rendell's visit to Coventry Woods, a park in North Coventry Township, marked his third public appearance in a week to push for the tax.
\
The event was sponsored by environmentalists, who want some of the tax revenue earmarked for the state's Growing Greener initiative, which has seen its annual funding plummet to $15 million from $200 million in two years.
\
""We don't think that it's far-fetched that we could get half of that [$200 million] from a severance tax,"" said Andrew Heath, executive director of a group called Renew Growing Greener.
\
Heath said he and other environmentalists met weekly with several GOP legislators and industry executives this summer to discuss the issue. He said that the talks were cordial but that lawmakers ""are not really showing their cards yet.""
\
Rendell stopped short of saying exactly where the tax proceeds might go. He said it would be foolish for the state to discourage drilling, not only for the financial benefits but also because it would help ease national dependence on foreign fuel sources.
\
But he also said the plan must include safeguards for the environment and the communities where the extraction occurs. Drilling and transporting the gas has stressed hundreds of miles of local roads and scores of bridges, he noted.
\
Rendell held up a news article about a well fire in Hopewell Township, and cited the June explosion at a well in Clearfield County that spewed gas and chemicals for 16 hours because local fire crews were unprepared to cap it.
\
""This is what we're faced with,"" he said.
\
His tax proposal mirrors one imposed on drillers by West Virginia, another Marcellus Shale state.
\
Crompton, the aide to Scarnati, said GOP lawmakers believe a more reasonable model is Arkansas' tax, which began at 1.5 percent and rose to 5 percent after three years.
\
Neither side has discussed a compromise.
\
""We haven't actively engaged the governor's office, nor have they actively engaged us,"" Crompton said. ""Instead, he's out doing this tour across the commonwealth.""
\
Even a veto is likely to be seen as an industry victory, and could catapult the issue squarely into the governor's race.
\
Tom Corbett, the Republican nominee, has opposed any new taxes, while his opponent, Democrat Dan Onorato, supports taxing the drillers.
\
Rendell urged the crowd at Coventry Woods to target their local lawmakers. He named a half-dozen Republicans from the Philadelphia suburbs who he said could turn the tide on the legislation.
\
""I don't really have any leverage left,"" he said, comparing himself to a football coach on the cusp of retirement. ""I've been around for eight years, and all the players are sick and tired of listening to me.""

On a day packed with activity near the end of the session, New Jersey lawmakers on Thursday advanced a series of proposed constitutional amendments, including one to require payments into the state pension system, and another to permit casinos outside Atlantic City.
\
The measures cleared committees in the Assembly and Senate, but need other approvals before they could land on the 2016 ballot. In the case of expanded casino gambling, lawmakers in the two chambers have yet to reach consensus on a proposal.
\
Some of the ballot measures have been modified since their introduction.
\
Senate President Stephen Sweeney's proposal to make pension payments a constitutional requirement would now force the state to pay $2.4 billion into the system in fiscal year 2018 - down from $3 billion in his original proposal.
\
The proposal, advanced by Democrats on the Assembly Judiciary Committee on Thursday, would still increase payments into the long-underfunded pension system through fiscal year 2022, when the annual payment would reach between $5.5 billion and $5.6 billion, a Sweeney aide said.
\
The state's total budget this year is about $34 billion. Sweeney (D., Gloucester) argues that the plan - which would also require the state to make quarterly pension payments - is necessary to ensure funding for the system, after Gov. Christie backtracked on a 2011 law that required the state to make escalating contributions.
\
Opponents, including a Democratic member of a pension and health benefits commission appointed by Christie, argue that the plan could dangerously restrict the state budget.
\
Committees in the Senate and Assembly also advanced proposals Thursday to amend the constitution to expand casino gambling beyond Atlantic City, though the chambers have not reached agreement on the specifics of the ballot measure.
\
Each of the proposed measures would allow two casinos in separate counties a certain distance from Atlantic City, the Shore resort still reeling from a wave of casino closures last year. Both would dedicate a portion of the revenue the state generated from the new casinos to Atlantic City.
\
But the measures differ in how much revenue would be devoted to Atlantic City, who would be permitted to run the North Jersey casinos, and even how far they would have to be located from Atlantic City.
\
The Senate Budget Committee advanced a proposal by Sweeney and Paul Sarlo (D., Bergen) that specifies the casinos would have to be at least 72 miles from Atlantic City. That's a change from the measure Sweeney's office announced last week, which said new casinos would have to be at least 75 miles away.
\
A person familiar with the matter said the change would include more of Middlesex County in the range of possible locations, and net more support from lawmakers.
\
In the Assembly, the judiciary committee released a different measure.
\
The sponsor of that proposal, Ralph Caputo (D., Essex), argued that if the state did not expand gambling, it would lose more money to casinos in other states.
\
""Do we continue to see this business model collapse, or do we do something about it?"" he said during Thursday's committee hearing.
\
Atlantic City officials and business leaders oppose expanding gambling, which they say would cannibalize their market and imperil the local economy.
\
""If we change the game right now, it's going to create a more unstable environment,"" Joe Kelly of the Atlantic City Chamber of Commerce told Assembly lawmakers Thursday.
\
Assemblyman Chris Brown (R., Atlantic) accused Caputo of pushing the amendment without proper study: ""You're killing Atlantic City. You're killing it.""
\
Caputo said he did not need a study to see the decline of the casino industry in Atlantic City, and said it was appropriate to put the question to voters: ""The people don't read these studies. They're going to listen to our positions.""
\
Assemblywoman Holly Schepisi (R., Bergen) questioned the logic of dedicating funding through the constitution for Atlantic City: ""What happens if Atlantic City becomes financially stable?""
\
""We could always go back and put another constitutional amendment on it,"" Caputo said. ""It's the best we could do at this time.""
\
The differences between the Senate and Assembly proposals include restrictions on who could operate the new casinos. The Senate version would require both new operators to already have a license for a casino in New Jersey, or be linked with a current license-holder; the Assembly version would restrict just one of the operators.
\
If lawmakers want to compromise on the competing proposals, a Senate aide said, they would need to do so by early next week to hold a vote in the current session, which ends in January.
\
Constitutional amendments must sit for 20 days after clearing a committee before they can go before the full legislature for a vote. They do not require the governor's approval.
\
To get on the 2016 ballot, an amendment would have to gain a three-fifths majority in each house or pass with simple majorities in both houses in two legislative years.
\
Other amendments advanced by the Assembly Judiciary Committee Thursday included a proposal to expand the state's redistricting commission. The amendment would increase the commission's membership from 10 to 13 and require the commission to certify at least 25 percent of the districts as competitive.
\
Assemblyman John McKeon (D., Essex), the committee chairman and a sponsor of the measure, said the approach would take into account the Democratic-Republican split in statewide elections over 10 years. To the argument that this would favor Democrats, McKeon pointed to Republican Christie's 2013 reelection with more than 60 percent of the vote and said, ""Who knows who it's going to favor?""
\
Schepisi accused the committee of rushing the amendment, which was introduced Monday.
\
""To just kind of sneak this in as a last-minute thing when everybody's getting ready for Christmas, I find appalling,"" she said.
\
Senate Minority Leader Thomas H. Kean Jr. (R., Union) called it a ""power and money grab"" by Democrats.
\
Another amendment that advanced Thursday with bipartisan support would dedicate all revenue from the motor fuels tax to the nearly depleted Transportation Trust Fund. The measure would not increase the gas tax - among the lowest in the nation - but Assembly Speaker Vincent Prieto (D., Hudson) called it a ""commonsense first step"" in finding a transportation funding solution.

720,"
SHAMOKIN -- Most of the candidates for retiring state Rep. Robert E. Belfanti Jr.'s seat in the 107th legislative district are running their campaigns on the platform of jobs and economic development.
\
Sam Scicchitano has those same concerns, but said he is focusing on re-establishing traditional family values in the state, something he believes can spur economic development in the long run.
\
""You need to build a foundation before you build the frame of the house. The platform we need to stand on is traditional family values,"" said Scicchitano, 47, of Oak Ridge Estates, Mount Carmel Township.
\
The former chairman of the Mount Carmel Township Board of Supervisors said he would support only bills that do not diminish family relationships. That stance, he said, would be reflected in any votes, including those on liquor sales and gambling.
\
""Making alcohol available in public retail outlets -- making it more available -- can only lead to more problems and breakdown of the
\
family,"" he said about the suggestion Pennsylvania turn over its control of liquor sales to the free market. ""I would find it very hard to support such bills because it would create more problems for the family unit.""
\
He said the notion of the state helping its revenue problem with the liquor system sale to the private market would only represent a ""one-time shot-in-the-arm"" and not a long-term solution.
\
Gambling has also been linked to the breakdown of the family, he said, and the proposal to expand it to allow video-poker machines in taverns is only asking for more trouble, he believes.
\
""We start to prey on the vices of human nature. In doing so, a problem is created other than the breakdown of family units -- crime increased, addiction,"" he said.
\
It also doesn't help the economy when people are spending their money on gambling, he said. For example, money spent on video poker, ""That's a pizza that they can't buy at the local pizza shop,"" he said. ""One area (taverns or casinos) might see a tremendous increase, but there's a lot of other areas the money is being taken from.""
\
As for the state funding education through gambling revenues that help drop property taxes, ""It's a paradox to fund education with gambling revenue,"" Scicchitano said, saying gambling at casinos and taverns actually takes parents and guardians away from their children.
\
Furthermore, he said he was shocked to learn the state spent $37 million advertising the lottery in a recent calendar year.
\
Facing adversity
\
Scicchitano said he takes seriously the opportunity to offer the same commitment to the legislative position as he said Belfanti has for 30 years.
\
""My main commitment will be constituent services,"" he said. ""Serving their needs is of upmost importance.""
\
He said his experience in small businesses, local government and community service have given him the background to be successful.
\
Scicchitano is employed with Scicchitano General Contracting, a business owned by his parents since 1967.
\
He was a Mount Carmel Township supervisor for four years, where he worked with state agencies and local businesses, including major players in the Coal Township-SEEDCO Industrial Park, which has portions of the land in Mount Carmel Township. He said those experiences helped prepare him for a legislator's post.
\
Despite being involved in several controversies during his chairmanship and coming in fourth in the five-man race for three supervisor spots in 2009, Scicchitano noted he lost by just five votes in what is a strong Democratic region. Also, he did win election on his first try, he noted.
\
""It's a tough political arena. You're naive if you don't think you'll face adversity or be criticized,"" he said. ""There needs to be people who will be strong enough despite the adversity.""
\
He believes the township made significant strides during his tenure, most importantly expanding services without a property tax increase. He believes the township police department -- at the root of some of the uproar during Scicchitano's chairmanship -- is improved and more efficient as a result.
\
""The police saw higher pay raises. We purchased vehicles. We were able to provide more equipment,"" he said.
\
'Confidence' in region
\
Scicchitano said economic development needs to begin with the attitude of local people.
\
""We have to re-instill confidence that we have a good area,"" he said. ""Until we have property owners committed and people committed to investing privately in our area, things will remain difficult.
\
""I'm tired of the regression of the area. I believe our area has a lot to offer,"" he continued.
\
To help that confidence, he said the tax burden on businesses and individuals has to be addressed. He said he isn't yet familiar enough with the state tax structure to offer specifics, but said he would research, seek recommendations from experts and create a plan that would be most beneficial to large and small businesses.
\
Scicchitano said despite the state's efforts, it continues to be at or near the bottom in vital economic statistics. He suggested too much economic development amounts to ""corporate welfare"" and helping businesses that threaten to leave the state.
\
He said his lifelong involvement in his family's businesses, including Scicchitano Ace Hardware in downtown Mount Carmel, has given him an appreciation and understanding of the importance of small businesses and their value to downtown areas.
\
One area where he is convinced the state can save money is through changes in the prevailing wage law, which sets the rate for any state-paid construction work. He said the rates are too high and drive up the cost of roads, bridges, sewage treatment and other infrastructure, and school construction. He said one study he read suggested the increase is 30 percent.
\
""We need to get (prevailing-wage) labor rates more in line with the public sector,"" he said. ""It will make bids more competitive.""
\
Term limits, gas tax
\
While Scicchitano believes the job of legislator is full time, he said the number of terms should be limited, not unlike that of the governor's post.
\
He said a 12-year maximum is probably best, and also believes four years per term would be better than the current two years, allowing legislators to spend more time serving their constituents rather than campaigning.
\
Scicchitano agrees with the proposal to tax the extraction of natural gas as it relates to development of the Marcellus shale region, but said the state needs to be certain that revenue goes back to local governments first to repair roads and protect the environment.
\
Better opportunity
\
With great natural resources and the most valuable resource -- the people -- Scicchitano said he wants to restore pride and convince young people to start their adult lives in the same communities where they were raised.
\
His reason for running for office, he said, is to provide a better opportunity for generations to come and to seek improvements for hard-working families.
\
He believes his work with state agencies and varied issues -- and even the adversities he faced as township supervisor -- have prepared him for a legislator's position.
\
""I was strong enough to continue to serve,"" he said.

DON'T BLAME SPOTTED OWL FOR LOSS OF TIMBER JOBS
\
I read with disappointment the paragraph in ""The Scene: In the Nation and the World"" (June 19) on the spotted owl debate in the Pacific Northwest.
\
Carolyn Acker wrote that legislation which would protect spotted owl habitat and thus some of this country's last stands of old growth forests could ""cause thousands to lose work."" It seems that Ms. Acker has been duped by a multimillion-dollar timber industry campaign into believing that environmentalists are a threat to loggers' jobs in this country.
\
In fact, it is the timber industry itself whose practices threaten American jobs. Between 1979 and 1986, annual yields of timber cut in Oregon increased 25 percent. During that same period the Oregon timber industry laid off 38 percent of its workers. Timber companies have automated the industry and ship large quantities of raw logs overseas, thus exporting U.S. jobs.
\
It is becoming clear that the timber industry is only concerned about profits, and will sacrifice the spotted owl, American jobs and the remaining 5 percent of our primary forests to achieve its goals.

BEWARE OF MANDELA
\
Nelson Mandela, deputy president of the African National Congress, was a far more substantial political figure in Victor Vorster Prison than he is now approximately four months after his release.
\
In South Africa, Mr. Mandela and the ANC have been repeatedly accused of failing to outline a defined political objective. Plagued by disunity and rivalries in its ranks, the ANC stands revealed as a threadbare outfit, intellectually 30 years out of date. For years it has made clear its preference for violence and an economic system that in Eastern Europe has failed to sustain a supply of even the basic necessities of life.
\
It is difficult not to believe that President F.W. de Klerk's reforms have outpaced the ANC. He has emphasized to the West that he is in a hurry to reform and unwilling to compromise on Western democratic standards and economic values.
\
Mr. Mandela tours the world calling for continued economic sanctions, yet he has not solved pressing problems at home. He has shown himself to be incapable of exercising discipline over his supporters who mindlessly continue to destroy both life and property. The American people should look critically at Mr. Mandela and the ANC before supporting them both economically and politically. Support of a violent revolutionary movement is out of touch with reality.

NO DESIRE TO SHARE GAS TAX
\
I don't question the need for additional funds for mass transit.
\
I do question whether it is good government, though, to take money raised solely by highway users and designate it for other transportation purposes while billions of dollars of road and bridge needs cannot be met, according to the Pennsylvania State Transportation Commission.
\
Incidentally, the state gas taxes in Pennsylvania have been dedicated for highway purposes since May 1, 1929, not 1956, as written by Vukan Vuchic on the June 20 Commentary Page.
\
Both the highway system and the transit system are in need of a funding transfusion, but let's not rob Peter to pay Paul.

A DEGRADING COLUMN
\
I am writing to express my disdain for the column ""The Millionaire"" by Percy Ross.
\
Although I never enjoy Mr. Ross' self-congratulatory charity and am especially put off by his condescending, often degrading refusals to aid certain persons, I am most disturbed by the overt classism on which the column is based.
\
Mr. Ross is placed in a position of authority based on his economic superiority. He then lures the neediest (economic inferiors) to judgment - his judgment - as to whether or not they are worthy of his financial gifts. Along with his decision to give or to deny, he always adds his moral two cents, which have earned a place in one of America's most-read papers solely because the author is a ""millionaire.""
\
I question The Inquirer's endorsement of this column, classist by its very nature. If Mr. Ross wishes to donate privately to charity, I commend him. But to narrate to the public just where and why his money is going to a certain cause (and why it shan't go to certain other causes) degrades everyone involved in the exchange - including the newspaper in which it appears.

SCATHING INDICTMENT
\
I applaud The Inquirer for having the courage to publish what amounts to a scathing indictment of the media in Ted Meehan's June 22 commentary, ""The media's abortion bias."" All we ask, in the words of the recurring chant heard at the April 28 Rally for Life in Washington, is that the media ""tell the truth."" The death of 26 million pre-born babies should be incentive enough.

IRRESPONSIBLE AIDS ACTIVISTS
\
The mindless chaos created at the end of the international conference on AIDS by irresponsible activists was a wretched publicity stunt performed by insensitive radicals.
\
How dare those people, who supposedly represent the interest of AIDS patients, show such disrespect to the very doctors who tirelessly search for their cure? It is a tribute to scientists that they continue their quest to conquer AIDS with such dignity and courage. While the idiots whistle and holler, hard-working, intelligent doctors battle impossible odds and brave constant criticism from every corner of the scientific community. The last thing they need is to be demoralized by militancy that knows only the power of brute ignorance.

HOW STRANGE A STANCE FOR AN EDITOR
\
I was dismayed to read Donald Kimelman's June 26 Commentary Page article, ''America isn't suffering from a shortage of individual rights.""
\
In the 1950s McCarthyism was the result of a growing political climate that inhibited the free exercise of constitutional rights and liberties. Those who exercised their rights under the Fifth Amendment were viewed as subversives.
\
Today it is not the Fifth Amendment, but the First Amendment, that is under attack.
\
The Bill of Rights became a condition for ratification of the Constitution in order to guarantee that the power of the government could not overwhelm the fundamental rights of the people. The amendments that constitute the Bill of Rights reflect the experience of the people living under British rule, conditions that led to the American Revolution and the very establishment of this system of government.
\
To amend the Bill of Rights should be as unthinkable as to amend the Ten Commandments.
\
Today, however, such an amendment is being considered. In the face of this threat, it is the American press, as a voice and defender of the rights of the people, that should most loudly call for the defense of the Constitution.
\
We will not lose our liberties overnight. Rather the danger lies in a gradual erosion that begins with the creation of a political environment that inhibits the free expression of ideas.
\
This climate leads to the election of greater numbers of politicians who are less committed to the preservation of our way of life. Through the process federal judges are appointed who, case by case, slowly dilute our liberties.
\
This is already happening as reflected in the numerous 5-4 decisions by the Supreme Court.
\
It is the press more than any other institution that can and must sound the alarm when our individual rights are threatened; for there is no comparison between the ability of an individual to disrupt society versus that of unrestrained government power.

722,"In regard to the revitalization of Downtown Pittsburgh, a few people have suggested free parking. What is needed is more foot traffic, not vehicles. More cars would require more parking lots, which are ugly and take up real estate.\The automobile exacts a tremendous toll on the environment and has destroyed many a city and urban area. This is why parking should not be free. The development of light rail and an outdoor pedestrian mall that is off-limits to cars would benefit everyone.\Billions upon billions of tax dollars are spent to pave over the nation with asphalt and concrete. The gas tax only partially covers the expense. The rest comes from other taxes and sources.\Let's give a tax break to the people who use mass transit and companies that research alternative forms of energy. More money could go to health care and education instead of pandering to the avarice of the fossil fuel producers and to line the pockets of myopic politicians.\WILLIAM J.

Some schools in the Pittsburgh area do not hold classes on Veterans Day, while others do.\As a World War II veteran, I would like to make a point that many veterans feel that this is a disservice to the men and women who fought and died for the freedoms that many people enjoy today.\The Pennsylvania Public School Code of 1949 gives the school board the option of holding classes or declaring Veterans Day a vacation. In reference to additional holidays and vacations, it states: ""The board of school directors may provide for such vacations in its district as it deems wise.""\Where is the wisdom that some boards deem that Veterans Day, a national holiday on which banks, post offices and courts are closed, schedule classes but observe the first day of deer season as a vacation day? I am not suggesting that the choice of not having classes on the first day of deer season be replaced with a ""vacation day"" for Veterans Day, but would it not be more appropriate to honor veterans as well?\Many World War II veterans are dying every month. How much longer will these veterans be around to receive the tribute that they deserve?\What of the veterans from Korea and Vietnam, who are an aging group and also are deserving of the respect of their communities? Veterans who have served at any time should be honored.\Patriotism seems to be less evident as the years go by.

After three years of dealing with the university's so-called advisers, we transferred him to a local private college.\I'm sure there are students who have to work and deal with other factors in their lives, but for the majority of students, I believe the problem at our state universities is the advisers.\First, students are told that they are adults now and can do their own scheduling, even when the college's handbook states that advisers are to help with the scheduling. The one thing advisers will tell the students is that 15 to 18 credits is too hard a work load.\My son had one of his best grade-point averages during a semester taking 18 credits at a state university and still does well taking 18 credits a semester at the private college he now attends.\I also believe that the light class load that students take is part of the problem with partying at colleges; they don't have enough classwork to keep them busy and out of trouble!\Do you want to know why these state university instructors sign up to be advisers? So that they can get their own offices!\I am really against the state giving more money to the universities as an incentive to increase the graduation rate. These state universities should be ashamed of what they are doing to college students and their families.\DOUGLAS K. GILCHRIST\Clinton"
723,"
Gov. Whitman will propose a record $21.25 billion state budget tomorrow that contains no new tax increases or layoffs and promises property-tax rebates and more money for schools, municipalities and the arts, but that is devoid of the sweeping, 10-figure initiatives that marked her previous spending plans.
\
Taking advantage of a projected $850 million surplus, the budget is 6.4 percent bigger than last year's $19.98 billion plan, the largest to date.
\
Standing out in her mostly modest package is a compromise plan to refinance the transportation trust fund, which pays for nearly $900 million in highway and transit projects annually. Whitman proposes renewing the fund in the new fiscal year with $250 million in capital funding and $750 million in bonds.
\
""The budget Gov. Whitman will present on Monday is fiscally responsible with a clear vision for addressing the issues facing New Jerseyans,"" Rick Mroz, Whitman's chief counsel, said yesterday at a budget briefing. ""This budget is balanced, it's bold, and it honors Gov. Whitman's commitment to make New Jersey the best place to live, work and raise a family.""
\
School aid, at $6.57 billion, makes up nearly a third of the budget and represents the single largest line item and the single biggest increase from the previous year. It includes $8.7 million to beef up teacher-mentoring programs and $4.8 million for volunteer programs aimed at teaching children good values.
\
The budget sets aside $337 million for the second-year installment of Whitman's five-year, $1 billion property-tax rebate plan, called NJ Saver. The rebates for homeowners will double this year, from $120 to $240.
\
Money also is earmarked for Whitman's proposal to invest $165 million in the state's budding high-tech industry. Under the plan, $100 million would come from the state and $65 million from Washington and the private sector. The plan includes $40 million for venture capital for start-up firms and $37 million for state-sponsored technology initiatives and an array of job-training programs.
\
Taking advantage of low-interest rates, the state will undergo a building boom to upgrade aging roads, highways and bridges. Capital construction is expected to jump 30.9 percent, from $890 million to $1.16 billion.
\
Of the capital funds, $250 million is set aside for the transportation trust fund, which is due to expire in June 2000.
\
Under the plan, the state will float $750 million in bonds for the fund - $580 million in new trust-fund bonds and $170 million from the 1999 statewide transportation bond fund that voters approved in November.
\
Mroz said the $1 billion appropriation would put the state in a position to obtain another $1 billion in federal funding for transportation projects.
\
Mroz called the plan a ""hybrid"" in that it contains a mix of bonds already approved by voters, new bonding, and more than double last year's amount from the general fund. Whitman's initial attempt to sustain the fund with a 5-cent increase on the gas tax was rejected by the Legislature in 1998. Democrats also have said they are concerned that the fund's heavy reliance on borrowings will impose an unfair burden on future taxpayers.
\
Of the $530 million earmarked in the budget for debt service, $448.6 million is for the trust fund debt. Among the trust fund uses for the next fiscal year will be $19 million for light-rail projects.
\
Other spending increases include about $60 million more for cities and towns.
\
More than half of that extra money is intended to ""make whole"" about 400 municipalities that stand to lose $33.8 million in property taxes because of a change in valuation for Bell Atlantic properties throughout the state.
\
Unlike previous years, when Whitman proposed spending billions for property-tax relief and saving 1 million acres from development, the budget reflects the modest agenda she set out two weeks ago in her State of the State address. In that speech, she outlined initiatives for what she called ""the four E's"": the economy, education, the environment and the elderly.
\
""It looks to be a decent budget proposal with a lot of good ideas,"" said state Sen. Robert Littell, (R., Sussex) chairman of the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee. ""It provides an increase in school aid, an increase in municipal aid, and it provides for all the other essential benefits that the departments are responsible for, including those of health and human services.""
\
To pay for greater oversight of HMOs, Whitman proposed a new $3.3 million tax on the industry.
\
Democrats, the minority in both houses of the Legislature, said Whitman's preliminary budget, like her State of the State address, lacks specifics and does not adequately address big-ticket items, such as the multibillion-dollar school-construction bill and replenishing the transportation trust fund.
\
""They put money in for one year for $1 billion, but there is nothing beyond the first year,"" Joseph Doria (D., Hudson), the Assembly minority leader, said of the trust-fund proposal. ""Obviously, we have to fund this for more than one year.""
\
The governor and lawmakers also must reach an agreement on legislation covering school-construction, which could cost as much as $10 billion. The legislation has been introduced in response to a mandate from the state Supreme Court to give more financial assistance to the state's 30 neediest districts, most of which are urban, including Camden City, Gloucester City, Burlington City and Pemberton Township in South Jersey.
\
""This was a very sketchy outline,"" said Joseph Charles Jr. (D., Hudson), the ranking minority member on the Assembly Appropriations Committee. ""The main things that we've been looking for were not mentioned in our briefing, like the transportation trust fund, the school building and the tobacco-settlement money. Those are highlights we need to know something about.""
\
The budget includes $174 million of $471 million that the state expects to receive in the new fiscal year as part of the national settlement with tobacco companies. Mroz indicated that Whitman was saving the details about where the additional money would go for her budget address.
\
In an initiative to embellish her legacy, Whitman also proposed creating a cultural trust for New Jersey, which would provide up to $10 million a year in matching funds for arts and cultural projects during the next 10 years.
\
The budget shows a $850 million surplus, thanks to a $1.2 billion surge in sales, corporate and income taxes supported by the robust economy. About $720 million of the surplus is in the ""rainy-day fund,"" which can be tapped only for emergencies such as drought and flood relief.
\
""We have only reason to believe that the economic growth will continue,"" State Treasurer Roland Machold said.
\
The budget calls for creating 640 state jobs, nearly half in law enforcement and criminal justice. The new jobs include 113 positions at the troubled state police, including 70 troopers.
\
After Whitman formally presents the budget tomorrow, it will have to be put to the Republican-controlled Legislature. Whitman must sign a budget into law by June 30.

724,"Higher gas taxes, stricter emissions standards and raising the legal driving age are just a few of the proposals that could come up today and Friday at Northampton Community College, where a panel of government, business and civic leaders will discuss ways to reduce regional air pollution.\Known as the Lehigh Valley/Reading Ozone Stakeholder Working Group, the panel includes 35 members from environmentalists to gasoline company executives. Their mission is to develop a strategy for reducing ground-level ozone in Lehigh, Northampton and Berks counties and submit formal recommendations to the state Department of Environmental Protection.\The group will hold public meetings from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. today and Friday at the Electrotechnology Applications Center, 3835 Green Pond Road, Bethlehem Township. The group will hold additional meetings at the center Sept. 13 and 14 and Oct. 20 and 21.\The group will also meet Aug. 18 and 19 at PP&L headquarters, 2 N. 9th St., Allentown, and on July 22 and 23 and Nov. 17 and 18 at the Inn at Reading, 1040 Park Road, Wyomissing.\Formed by the DEP in March, the group is expected to submit its final report in December.\""Once the report has been put out, we go forward with those recommendations,"" said DEP spokeswoman Christy Hubley, who said it could take up to a year to implement them.\That means the group's upcoming meetings will have a profound impact on air quality regulations that will impact everything from the daily commute to how much area residents pay for electricity.\But members say they are still in the initial stages of their work and are months away from forming a consensus.\""We haven't really talked specifics about what we're going to do,"" said Harvey Joseph, environmental director of the Bethlehem Health Bureau.\""Everybody has different ideas. We have some people who don't want to do anything, and we have some people who want everybody to walk. You've got to have a happy medium.""\So far, all members seem to agree on is the need to reduce regional ozone levels, which do not meet the federal standard of 85 parts per billion over an eight-hour period.\""I do feel strongly that we should limit the ozone,"" Joseph said. ""Everybody knows something has to be done.""\According to DEP statistics, Lehigh County ozone levels averaged 96 parts billion from 1996-1998. Berks County averaged 92 parts per billion and Northampton County averaged 88 parts per billion over the same three-year period. Three-year averages are used when determining federal compliance.\Formed by the combination of heat and emissions from industry, automobiles and other sources, ground-level ozone at high levels can cause chest pain, coughing, nausea, sore throat and congestion.\Children, the elderly and those with respiratory problems are especially vulnerable to ozone's effect.\The ozone season generally runs from May through September, when solar radiation and temperatures are highest.\""Ozone is formed with hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxide and sunlight,"" said Tom DiLazaro, the DEP's Northeast Region air quality manager. ""If you don't have one of them, you're not going to have ozone.""\Two of the biggest contributors to ground-level ozone are automobiles and electric generating plants, but representatives from both groups on the stakeholder group say their industries have been leaders in emissions reduction.\Reid Clemmer, environmental supervisor at PP&L Inc., acknowledged that his company is one of the region's biggest producers of nitrogen oxide emissions, producing as much as 20,000 tons of it during the ozone season.\But, Clemmer said, PP&L has spent more than $110 million on environmental improvements since 1990 and has reduced its emissions about 50 percent during that time.\""We have made significant reductions already,"" Clemmer said, and ""there is the expectation that by the year 2003, we will be required to make further reductions.""\Clemmer said he would like to see the automobile emissions testing program strengthened and expanded to cut down on ozone levels.\Joseph said he is an advocate of reformulated gasoline, which costs 5 cents to 6 cents a gallon more than regular gas, but reduces ozone production.\Reformulated gasoline is already used in the greater Phiadelphia area, including Bucks and Montgomery counties.\But a fellow group member, Theresa Podguski of AAA East Penn, disagrees.\Podguski said the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reported that automobiles are 97 percent cleaner than they were in the 1970s, and less than 30 percent of all air pollution comes from automobiles.\""Automobile emission reductions have outpaced reductions from all other sources,"" Podguski said. ""In fact, control of emissions from cars is the single greatest contribution to the reduction of volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides in the last 25 years.\""Despite this progress, emission reduction efforts continue to focus on reducing automobile pollution rather than on reducing emissions from such other sources as utilities and industrial power plants.""\Still another member, Tom Lloyd, a research scientist at Lehigh University, favors increasing the gas tax and raising the legal driving age to 18 to reduce the number of vehicle miles driven annually and make people more aware of the environmental consequences of their actions.\""We just have to go after greater efficiency, so what this means, I think, is a carbon tax on any kind of fossil fuel,"" Lloyd said. ""You tax any kind of fossil fuel so people will be more conservative of it.\""If we're going to pollute the environment, we ought to pay for it.""\In addition to automobile and industrial emissions, group members say they also have to look at regulating other emission sources such as gas-powered lawn equipment, auto refinishing shops, dry cleaners, landfill gases, composting operations and other polluters.\No matter what action the group decides to take, Clemmer said it has to be done in the most cost-effective way possible.\""Because ultimately,"" Clemmer said, ""the consumers are going to pay for it."""

Relief wiped out in one tax hike
\
Editor: The North Pocono School Board proposes an 11.4-mill increase in the 2008-09 school budget. It's stated that this would amount to an increase of $194 on the average assessment of $17,000 for Lackawanna County properties in the school district. The average tax bill would amount to $1,778.
\
For a property assessed at $18,000, the bill would be $1,882. Based on last year's millage of 93.2, the proposed increase would then be 12 percent. For seniors on Social Security, or other fixed pensions, there was a whopping 2.2 percent cost-of-living increase in January. That was gone with the wind long before we were gassed to death.
\
Now along comes our man of good cheer, Gov. Ed Rendell, to let us all know that the gambling bill we so graciously supported to offer some relief to our school taxes has now produced a windfall to be distributed to each school district. We are told that this will amount to a $208 decrease for those of us in the North Pocono School District. We will see this in our tax bill for the 2008-09 school year.
\
However, this year's tax bill will increase $205 for a property assessed at $18,000 (do the math for your own property valuation). It will leave us a grand total of $3 in savings if all the figures hold up.
\
We sold our souls to the gambling industry for this? What the governor giveth, our tax-and-spend School Board taketh away.
\
Now there is a proposal to add table games to the gambling halls. Apparently there weren't enough seniors playing the penny slots to jack up gambling revenues high enough to make a significant decrease in property taxes.
\
Those of us in our so-called ""golden years' have run out of gold. The only true relief we will see is when we pop a pack of Rolaids after we open our tax bill.

End in sight
\
Editor: I read with complete dismay the May 19 Times-Tribune front page article ""Bush critical of Arab world."" I cannot fathom how G. W. Bush can claim the moral integrity to criticize anyone or any nation.
\
He has blatantly lied to his own people; he has redefined the word ""torture""; he implemented illegal wiretaps of American citizens; he sanctioned the abuses of prisoners at Abu Graib and Guantanamo; and, he conveniently circumvents our democratic process with abusive use of signing statements attached to legislation passed by Congress.
\
Mr. Bush is quoted as saying, ""I call on all nations in this region to release their prisoners of conscience, open up their political debate and trust their people to chart their future."" What hogwash. He has held prisoners at Guantanamo for years without charging them with a crime and deprived them of their right to legal counsel; he hasn't had an honest or open political debate in this country in eight years; and, if he had trusted the American people to chart our future, the disgraceful and senseless war in Iraq would have ended years ago.
\
Earlier in his trip to the Middle East, Mr. Bush again repeated his daily admonition against engaging in dialogue with those he describes as terrorists -- as though his policy has demonstrated great results. Does anyone in the world really feel safer? One definition of insanity is to do the same thing, day after day, expecting different results.
\
Fortunately, the end of all of this insanity is actually in sight -- Jan. 20, 2009. It will take years for his successor to discover all of the damage this president and his sidekick, Cheney, have done to our nation. And it will take additional years to correct that damage. I hope that we are as patient with his successor(s) as we have been with Mr. Bush.
\
Perhaps we are insane -- after all, we have allowed his incompetent ""leadership"" to continue day after day, thinking something might change.

Enough blame to share
\
Editor: President Bush is not all to blame for the high oil prices. Last I checked he was only one-third of government. The Democrat-controlled Congress has done little to nothing about these oil prices. Why do we not blame them?
\
This is the first time Congress has been controlled by the Democrats since 1994 and gas rose from about $2.85 a gallon in January 2007 to almost $4 a gallon currently. Under the Republican-controlled Congress gas rose gradually, but why is it increasing all of a sudden? President Bush was in office since 2001 and it seems that the only change is that the Congress went from Republican to Democrat control.
\
I agree with the Democrats that the solution to the problem of gas is to get off it, but that would take 10, 20 years. We need some relief now! Mr. Bush tried to get Saudi support. Sen. John McCain is proposing a gas tax holiday. What have the Democrats done?
\
Tapping into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve was an idea President Bush used back in 2005 with Katrina, but everyone said that the 70,000 barrels added into the market would make no difference in the price because we use millions of barrels a day. Now that the Democrats argue for tapping into the reserves, it suddenly makes a difference. In the early 2000s the Republicans proposed the idea of using ANWR to prevent this problem, but the Democrats would not have it.
\
Now people need to stop scapegoating President Bush and should instead start questioning the opposing party. We need to start drilling for our own oil to ease our pains in the near future and make the switch to alternative fuels gradually. Get over the caribou in Alaska and drill in ANWR. Are caribou worth more than people's jobs?

Fewer days, less travel
\
Editor: Take a clue from the Wallenpaupack Area School District, which is adding $400,000 to its budget to account for the cost of gas. The cost of gas and other fuels has presented our school boards with an additional incentive to make our school systems substantially greener and save money at the same time. But they better wear their flak jackets.
\
Schools should institute a four-day school week. There would be large savings in transportation, personnel, heating, lighting and air-conditioning costs, along with the associated reduction in pollution. The flak will come from the vocal few who mainly use our schools as ""day care.""
\
Given the four-day school week, business will follow with a four-day work week.

726,"SHADY GROVE - The jobs have not materialized a year after Manitowoc announced it was moving its crawler crane operation from Wisconsin to Pennsylvania.\The state backed the company's $19million investment with a $1.35 million grant. The project is expected to create 250 local jobs in three years.\Trouble is: The companies that make equipment for the construction industry are at the bottom of a down cycle. Manitowoc, known locally as Grove, makes cranes -- machines that lift steel and concrete.\""The $20 million investment hasn't created jobs yet because of the cyclical nature of the business,"" said Barry Pennypacker, Manitowoc Co. president and CEO. ""When business comes back this will be a booming facility.""\Pennypacker foresees when a policeman will direct traffic outside the 300-acre campus at the change of shifts. He recalled that the Grove plant once employed 2,200 workers.\The Shady Grove operation currently employs 1,240 people -- 740 in the shops, according to Les Middleton, senior vice president of Americas Mobile Cranes. Since Jan. 1 the shops have added 130 workers, but many are unrelated to the relocation of the crawler crane production.\""We need something to come out of Washington, D.C.,"" Pennypacker said.\Republicans and Democrats agree that something needs to be done about the nation's infrastructure, he said, but opinions diverge when it comes to talking about where the money should come from to pay for it all. Until the federal government commits to the investing hundreds of billions of dollars in infrastructure, the industry must rely on state spending. California could serve as a model, according to Pennpacker.\The California legislature recently raised that state's gas tax 12 cents a gallon, the first such hike in 23 years, and added an annual vehicle fee. The revenue will address about a fourth of the state's backlog. Half the state roads are in poor condition, according to the American Society of Civil Engineers.\Pennypacker invited Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development Secretary Dennis Davin to return when U.S. Rep. Bill Shuster, ""(President Donald) Trump's infrastructure guy,"" visits the plant later this year. Shuster, chairman of the House transportation committee, represents Pennsylvania's Ninth District, which includes Franklin County and Shady Grove.\Davin also said that the federal government needs to play big part in rebuilding the infrastructure. He mentioned Pennsylvania's three ports -- Erie on the Great Lakes, Pittsburgh to the Gulf of Mexico and Philadelphia on the Atlantic Ocean.\Davin walked through the Manitowoc buildings on Wednesday as part of his ""Jobs that Pay"" tour of Pennsylvania businesses. He said he was impressed with how clean the work environment is.\""This is not a dirty job,"" he said. ""They pay a great starting wage. Not every kid needs to go to a four-year college.""\During the informal tour, company and state officials discussed improving job training for manufacturers.\They also talked about Interstate 81 improvements, specifically on Pa. 16 at Exit 5. A truck loaded with a long, wide Manitowoc crane can take Pa. 16 directly to I-81, but cannot negotiate a left turn at Exit 5 to go south on I-81, according to Pat Cassner, vice president of Americas manufacturing. The driver must go 12 miles north to Exit 17 before turning south.\Manitowoc consolidated its U.S. crane manufacturing to improve efficiency and operating margins. The company is adding crawler cranes, cranes that move on treads instead of wheels, to Shady Grove. The local plant currently assembles mobile, hydraulic cranes that move on rubber tires.\The transition is about 90 percent complete, according to Middleton. The crawler operations should be fully operational at the end of August. The company reported in May that the cost of the move was on budget.\Pennypacker said the company had many reasons for choosing to consolidate at Shady Grove instead of in Manitowoc, Wisconsin.\He said the primary reason was the campus: ""Wisconsin fit here. This didn't fit in Wisconsin.""\Brian Ross, deputy director of the Governor's Action Team, said that the quality of the local workforce was one of the driving factors for Manitowoc's consolidation in Pennsylvania.\The stakes were high. Pennsylvania might lose not only the prospect of 250 new hires, but the 800 already working at Shady Grove, according to Ross. The action team looked at the impact of the jobs on the community. Manufacturing jobs create other support jobs in the community.\""You're not looking at minimum wage jobs,"" Ross said. ""We're talking about family sustaining jobs.""\Economic development is a double-edged sword if the economy is doing well, he said. Where do the employees come from and how do you train them?\For several months the local unemployment rate has hovered below 5 percent, a rate many consider to be full employment.\""We like to see a progression of the local workforce,"" Ross said. ""Manitowoc does a good job of training with its own programs.""\Manitowoc County, Wisconsin, meanwhile is not looking back to a year ago.\""We're not celebrating that,"" said Karen Nichols, executive director of the Chamber of Commerce of Manitowoc County. ""We have other things to celebrate. Our economy is strong.""\Manitowoc Co. laid off about 525 employees in Wisconsin over the past year as part of the move. Manitowoc County's unemployment rate spiked at 5.2 percent in February. Currently the jobless rate is 3.1 percent.\""The people of our community persevere really well,"" Nichols said. ""For many people the situation has turned out quite well. Everyone has adjusted quite well. We have a lot of companies looking for good, well qualified workers. We're very diversified in our economy.""\Wisconsin lost nearly 75,000 jobs in manufacturing during the recession, and has regained 50,000 of them, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Pennsylvania lost about 100,000 manufacturing jobs in the recession and has yet to get them back.\Davin said that Pennsylvania is set up well for manufacturing and recently ditched an onerous business tax.\Manufacturing comprises a larger part of the labor force in Wisconsin and Franklin County (both 15 percent) than in Pennsylvania (9 percent.)\In the past year Franklin County has lost 100 manufacturing jobs. The local area relies heavily on construction for its manufacturing jobs -- Manitowoc cranes, Volvo Construction Equipment and JLG Industries' lifts.\Pennypacker said that on his drive from Philadelphia on the Pennsylvania Turnpike he counted 26 cranes, 22 of them made outside the U.S.\""America's infrastructure should be built by American cranes,"" he said.\Middleton said Manitowoc has moved to be more efficient by consolidation and paring down support jobs.\The company faces a major obstacle outside its control, according to Pennypacker. The exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the euro and Japanese yen hurts American manufacturers.\""I'm at a 25 to 33 percent disadvantage,"" Pennypacker said. ""We have the best technology. We don't necessarily have the best cost. I think tariffs should be discussed and in be the cards. We have to have to have a better mouse trap, and that's what we have here.""\Jim Hook, 717-262-4759"
727,"
For the Republican Party, 1994 is the year that was.
\
The ""Republican Revolution"" that year gave the GOP its first taste in more than 40 years of being the majority party in both houses of Congress. On that one election day, Republicans gained 54 seats in the House, 8 in the Senate and 12 in governors' mansions around the country.
\
Now, 12 years later, Republican power -- majorities of 10 seats in the Senate and 20 in the House -- could unravel, or at least begin to, with this year's elections. Already, Pennsylvania's primary showed an anti-Republican incumbent mood. Of 17 incumbent state legislators who lost, 13 were Republicans, including the party's two top state senators.
\
Polls show that for the first time since 1994, Americans have more faith in Democrats than in Republicans to govern and to guarantee national security. If that attitude persists through the November general elections, Republican power could decline.
\
""If everything goes bad, Republicans could lose three or four Senate seats and 10 to 20 House seats,"" said former GOP House Speaker Newt Gingrich.
\
Gingrich, a native Pennsylvanian from a small town near Harrisburg who later served as a House member from Georgia, was the principal architect of the ""Contract with America,"" a policy declaration that propelled Republicans to victory in 1994. Eight years after retiring from the House, he has become the conservative movement's surrogate spokesman for the party.
\
Is it possible for Democrats to win control of the House?
\
""Barely,"" Gingrich said. ""They might win a very narrow majority. It is more likely that the Democrats will gain some seats, but Republicans will retain control of both the House and Senate.""
\
He believes Democrats will ""focus on being negative and obstructionist, and then they will try to wear a mask of being moderate, even though their leadership is the most left-wing in history.""
\
The Democrats' Senate leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, says his party offers a lot more than negativity.
\
""The American people are tired of Republican incompetence, they're tired of a Congress that just rubber-stamps President Bush's failed policies,"" Reid said.
\
Long-time Democratic Sen. Joseph Biden, of Delaware, says Democrats must ""come forward with real ideas -- but it is up to the individual candidate to do that, not the party.""
\
Biden says his party must send an affirmative message, and spell out ""who is going to protect you better, who is going to solve the energy crisis and who is better to handle escalating health care costs.
\
""They are the big national issues.""
\
It's important for Democrats to make clear where the party stands on Iraq, Biden said.
\
""People don't want to hear what went wrong (in Iraq); they already know that things are not going well,"" he said. ""They want to hear, what we are going to do about it?""
\
Dick Morris, a Fox News political analyst and former Clinton strategist who created campaign messages for Democrats, believes the party that delivers a message and gets out the vote will win the mid-term elections. Republicans kept control in the 2004 elections, Morris said, because of concern about terrorism.
\
""As that fear fades, which it shouldn't, voters turn to issues which are primarily Democratic historically -- energy, climate change, environment, health care and Social Security,"" he said.
\
""Republicans need to take over some of these issues with bold presidential leadership. Look how Bush took away the education issue in 2000, and Clinton used gun control and 100,000 extra cops to take the crime issue"" in 1996.
\
Morris says Republicans have been weakened by the immigration debate, giving an impression that they are confused and divided, much like the Democrats in 1994.
\
""The Republican Party has worked itself out of a job -- terrorism is at bay, taxes are cut, crime is way down, communism is gone -- all of the GOP issues have gone away because of their own success,"" he said. ""I think that the Democratic trend will continue.""
\
He ticks off a list of possibly vulnerable Republican senators -- Rick Santorum of Penn Hills, Ohio's Mike DeWine, Missouri's Jim Talent and Montana's Conrad Burns.
\
If those Republicans fall in November, he said, Democrats will ""most likely win"" Congress and the White House in 2008.
\
Democratic strategist Steve McMahon sees potential gains for Democrats if they stick to concerns that hit home.
\
""The domestic gas price issue eclipses every issue,"" said McMahon, a regular political commentator on Fox News and CNN. ""It is going to drown out everything else; there is no relief in sight for the GOP on this issue.""
\
Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, said his party is ""making progress on our goals"" to reverse the decline.
\
In February, fellow Republicans elected Boehner -- an original member of the ""Gang of Seven"" conservative, first-term Republicans who preceded the 1994 sweeps -- as House majority leader, replacing the king of gerrymandering, Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas.
\
""November's a long way away,"" Boehner said, and ""our job between now and then is to act on the issues Americans want us to act on.""
\
What voters should remember is that ""replacing one party with the other only changes the priority of programs on which the government spends money,"" said John McIntyre, co-founder of RealClearPolitics, a political Web site that condenses Beltway commentary.
\
McIntyre believes one problem Republicans have is the ""inability to control spending, undercutting their tax-cut message. That gives the Democrats leverage to claim that increased spending is tied to power.""
\
GOP strategists David Carney, in Washington, and Kent Gates, a former Pennsylvanian now in San Diego, said Republicans have the upper hand on one crucial factor in November: a comprehensive, get-out-the-vote machine that traditionally has done a superior job to the Democratic machine. The party's challenge is to excite its base enough so that those voters show up.
\
The best way to do that is to ""remind voters what will happen if Nancy Pelosi and Ted Kennedy are running Congress,"" Gates said.
\
""Republicans need to promote a more populist agenda and appeal to the middle-class angst about high gas prices and stagnant-to-declining disposable income. High gas prices, in a peculiar way, are a great opportunity for Republicans to win back a populist message.""
\
If GOP icon Teddy Roosevelt were alive, he ""would go after big-oil profits, eliminate the gas tax and promote alternative fuels -- a lesson for today's Republican leaders,"" Gates said.
\
Carney agrees, but takes that a step further: ""From fiscal restraint to values, to security issues, we could easily retake the offensive -- but we need the national party leaders to begin to communicate their intent on these important middle-class issues.""
\
Yet Rep. Rahm Emanuel, D-Ill., makes clear his party understands the importance of those efforts, too. The former Clinton policy point-man, now chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said ""much is at stake for both parties.""
\
Both parties are going to concentrate on raising money, tightening their agendas and energizing their base to get out the vote, he said.

Another vendor was cooking meat, and went to the same pond and washed his utensils, then went back to stir his meat.

THE BRINKMAN KILLING
\
Once again a Philadelphia teenager has been murdered at the hands of a large group of attackers.
\
The Philadelphia Police Department and news media seem intent on making sure the killing of Eric Brinkman is not viewed as a racial incident, stating that the motive in the crime ""appeared"" to be robbery, and reiterating that whites were involved in the attack, as well as blacks and Hispanics.
\
I find this ridiculous. Anyone approached by 15 to 20 animals would gladly give up their gold chains, but this was not enough. Outnumbered 4 to 1, Eric Brinkman and his friends were savagely attacked, and one boy was chased four blocks. Robbery?
\
Another disturbing facet of this crime is that it occurred in an area where the police presence is supposedly ""beefed up.""
\
On Aug. 22, this paper printed an article praising the success of a police mini-station located in North Philadelphia. Perhaps your paper should now mention the dismal failure the mini-station at Dickinson Square in South Philadelphia represents.

TRANSIT UNION LEADER DEFENDS GRAY'S FUNDING BILL
\
Rep. John Perzel (letter Aug. 22) is like a man picking up a rock only to drop it on his own foot. Every one of his criticisms of Congressman Bill Gray's efforts to require dedicated funding for SEPTA can be traced back to
\
himself and his party.
\
Perzel complains that federal assistance for mass transit has declined in recent years. He omits to mention that it was Republican administrations under Ronald Reagan and George Bush who tried to eliminate transit subsidies and Gray's Democratic leadership that restored part of those cuts.
\
He complains that Gray's bill to require dedicated transit funding is aimed at Pennsylvania. He omits to mention that this is because Pennsylvania is the only state in the country with a major transit system that lacks such funding.
\
He complains that the bill would withhold 25 percent of federal highway funding to Pennsylvania. But we would not lose a dime if the state passed the kind of dedicated transit funding everyone agrees is essential for our economy and environment.
\
Perzel and his fellow Northeast Philly Republicans torpedoed the initiative in Harrisburg to allow state gasoline tax money to be used for transit. Had that measure passed, Philadelphia would have complied with the Gray bill, and the issue would be over.
\
Perzel was a co-sponsor of the gas tax for transit measure, as was fellow Republican Fran Weston. They changed their votes at the command of Republican Chairman Billy Meehan, a highway contractor and member of the highway lobby which fights for rural interests against the needs of cities.
\
Tying highway funds to mass transit funding hurts nothing if Harrisburg would do the right thing. If they won't, it is an appropriate incentive to make the rural highway interests and their Republican flunkies think again about their opposition to dedicated SEPTA funding.

God bless William H. Gray III. Philadelphians should take their hats off to him.
\
Not only does he state the facts, but Congressman Gray gives you the figures, and if the two U.S. senators from Pennsylvania would take time to really go over his legislation, instead of calling it blackmail, Philadelphia would be better off.

Again, I say God bless you, Congressman Gray, at least you are trying to help the poor SEPTA riders.

A FEDERAL TAX ON GAS IS CALLED A TAX ON MOBILITY
\
Your Jan. 12 editorial - ""$1.07 a gallon!"" - chastised Congress for not passing a federal gas-tax increase larger than the 4.3 cents per gallon it added last October.
\
With current gasoline prices at a 12-month low, the editorial's author believed that a tax increase double that amount would provide something for nothing - $8 billion in deficit reduction ""pain-free."" That prompts me to ask ""pain-free"" for whom?
\
The burden of higher gasoline taxes falls heaviest on those who can least afford it. For the working poor, a higher gasoline tax increases costs for fuel, food and other basic goods and services. The trip to work is not only a major expense, it is also the principal hope for a better future.
\
Nebraskans, for example, pay over twice the gasoline tax that citizens in Pennsylvania pay. In Philadelphia, travel distances are shorter and mass transit is an option. But in most of our nation's suburban and rural areas, private vehicles are the principal means of mobility and often the only means. Higher gas taxes really are taxes on mobility.

HOMELESS DISAGREEMENTS
\
I find myself in the curious position of agreeing with nearly all of the substantive remarks about the causes of, and cures for, homelessness in Peter Gliatto's Feb. 5 Commentary Page essay, but hardly any of the opinions he attributes incorrectly to me and the Center City District (CCD):
\
* The CCD has consistently stated that the men who dwell on the streets of Center City are but 10 percent of the 4,400 who are homeless on any given day in Philadelphia and that young women with children constitute 40 percent of the citywide number.
\
* Our most recent survey found that 48 percent of Center City's panhandlers are not homeless and that 45 percent said they used the money for drugs and alcohol.
\
* Through the ""Campaign for Real Change,"" we have urged the public not to support the dependencies of these panhandlers but rather to give to programs that support drug and alcohol treatment, job training and a chance for real change.
\
* We have consistently recommended that more of the $44 million the city spends annually for the homeless be focused on recovery programs and on housing.
\
* Finally, with funds generated from the ""Campaign for Real Change,"" we address one of the root causes of homelessness - joblessness - and have provided work opportunities for over 80 formerly homeless men.
\
The task of getting the homeless off the streets and into appropriate facilities, housing or jobs is large and complex enough that Mr. Gliatto should continue to direct his energies to the commendable outreach work he is doing, rather than to further mischaracterizations of the work of other organizations.

MEDICAL HIGHWAY ROBBERY
\
The amalgamation of Independence Blue Cross and the Graduate Health System isn't, as you reported, a mirror of the national medical-reform highway, but is simply medical highway robbery.
\
The acquisition, euphemistically called a merger, will enable Blue Cross to charge higher rates for those who go outside Graduate's second-class hospitals to use quality facilities like Abington, HUP, Jefferson and Pennsylvania Hospitals.
\
Such a move would merely be an extension of Big Blue's abusive pattern of rate rapes. For example, Blue Cross already charges subscribers more to have a mammogram or MRI at Fox Chase Cancer Hospital, HUP or Jefferson than it does at non-hospital laboratories.
\
Big Blue pays 100 percent for tests at independent labs, but charges subscribers $50 per test if they use a hospital facility. Ironically, the inferior quality of an independent lab often leads to surgery that would have been unnecessary if the tests had been performed at a competent hospital facility.
\
Yes, Virginia, there is a health-care crisis. In the first two months of this year, Blue Cross increased group premiums 20 percent, nearly seven times the annual inflation rate. Despite claims to the contrary, the $1,000-a-year hike in premiums is either to fund the costs of a so-called ""merger"" or an attempt to beat a federally imposed price freeze.
\
Big Blue also engages in more subtle rate rape. A single stress test is now billed as two procedures, costing subscribers $100. And for more than one test in a hospital on one day, you now pay $50 per test. That's on top of the 20 percent rate hike.
\
Enough is enough! Turn your investigative reporters loose on Blue Cross. Maybe then the do-nothing wimps in City Council and the state legislature will stand up for the consumer and oppose the amalgamation of Blue Cross and Graduate Health System.

L&I SAYS HISTORY WON'T EXCUSE BLIGHT
\
William Duffy's Jan. 11 letter is inaccurate on facts and on the responsibility of the Historical Commission and the Department of Licenses and Inspections.
\
With respect to the Mayfair House, the department has issued an order to have the building either repaired or demolished. That order was affirmed by the Licenses and Inspections Review Board and the owner was given 72 days to seal the building, which also included the removal of the sash on the upper floors.
\
The sash had deteriorated and the residences adjacent to the Mayfair House are being subjected to a constant barrage of broken glass as well as other heavier objects. These objects are being tossed from the building by itinerant vagrants who had breached the barricades that had been erected by this department and prior ownerships.
\
The Mayfair House, while charming and representative of a certain epoch in the city's history, is not singularly unique and has come to represent the worst kind of blight intrusion into a stable and vibrant neighborhood. Historic preservation cannot be used as a rationalization for the decay and decline of adjacent neighborhoods.
\
The Mayfair House, which has been subject to all kinds of financial ''wheelings and dealings,"" has been ""abandoned,"" in this department's opinion, by irresponsible ownership. The department requested that the current owners pay their 1993 taxes as a show of good faith and intent. That payment has not been made, which leads the department to conclude that there is not a serious intent to go forward with any kind of rehabilitation of the building.
\
The department has on its staff many people who are professional engineers and who are knowledgeable in the area of construction technology. I am also a professional engineer and, before becoming commissioner, I had extensive experience in the building construction industry, including the design of many substantial rehabilitations of historic buildings.
\
We cannot allow stable communities to decline due to the lack of maintenance of any large structure, whether historically certified or not certified. I would suggest that rather than employees of this department and the Historical Commission taking a course at Drexel, maybe Mr. Duffy would like to spend a couple weeks living in one of the properties adjacent to the Mayfair House and experience for himself the impact that this historically certified blight is having on the local environment.

Now, about five households share the charger, he said. Two nearby blocks also have charging stations.\""It's one of the best options to promote electric cars, because people see it,"" said Knizhnik, a 36-year-old IT manager who drives a fully electric Tesla Model 3. ""It's people putting in chargers for the neighbors and others to share.. . . It's very much a sense of community.""\Knizhnik is one of thousands of Pennsylvanians who have switched to electric cars for the environmental and financial benefits. It costs his family about six or seven dollars in electricity to drive their car 300 miles, he said, and they aren't spewing carbon emissions from a tailpipe.\Over the last decade, as the threat of climate change has sharpened, hybrid and all-electric cars have become cheaper, their batteries have become longer-lasting, public charging stations have become more common, and consumer purchases of them have increased. Federal and state incentives - Pennsylvania offers up to $1,500 in rebates to such car buyers - also help.\Still, both in national comparisons and by its own admission, the state lags when it comes to the number of electric vehicles on its roads.\With about 7,700 electric cars registered in 2018, according to the Department of Transportation, Pennsylvania is behind New York, New Jersey, and Maryland. California leads the nation by far, with nearly 180,000 registered electric vehicles - the state has about 23 times more cars than Pennsylvania, though its population is just over three times as large.\The trend may be even more stark in Southeastern Pennsylvania, the most populous corner of the state. Here, about 5,000 of 2.4 million passenger vehicles on the region's roads were plug-in, electric, or hybrid as of November 2017, according to the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission, which has studied electric vehicle use.\""Part of it is an educational component,"" said Tom Schuster, a Johnstown resident who works on clean energy and climate policy for the Sierra Club, the environmental advocacy group.

The transportation sector is the single biggest contributor to U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, and the second-largest in Pennsylvania.\Pennsylvania's 2019 Climate Action Plan, which lays out an array of actions to reduce the state's emissions, includes incentivizing and supporting electric car adoption, and in February, the state put out what it called an electric vehicle road map for increasing use.\And obstacles that once might have discouraged car buyers have started to disappear. Most electric vehicles now travel at least 100 miles before needing to be charged, said Robert Graff, whose office oversees energy and climate-change initiatives at the regional planning commission. Within two or three years, the price of a new electric vehicle should be comparable to a gas-powered vehicle's, he predicted.

It expanded its Alternative Fuel Vehicle rebate program to include more eligible vehicles, and now provides $1,000 to $1,500 in rebates for a used or new vehicle purchase.

Through another state initiative, more than 160 charging projects have been approved for $3.2 million in funding.\In addition, Gov. Tom Wolf has directed the state government to replace 25% of its cars, about 500 vehicles, with electric and plug-in hybrid cars by 2025, and to replace diesel-powered vehicles blamed for nitrogen-oxide emissions.\'The way of the future'\One state program funds alternative fuel vehicles for school districts, municipal authorities, corporations, and other public entities.

\
I guess this is President Bush's way of trying to prove to the American people that he actually cares about the soldiers who are fighting and dying in Mr. Bush's war of choice in Iraq. I don't know how this guy can sleep at night knowing that, because of his decision to go to war against a country that posed no threat to us, more than 4,000 brave American soldiers have lost their lives. If he really cared about our soldiers and their families, he never would have started this needless war in Iraq.

Stop road raiders
\
Editor: Gov. Ed Rendell continues to press for control of the publicly owned Pennsylvania Turnpike to be privatized by offering a 75-year lease to the highest bidder.
\
Last week the public learned that the high bidder was a partnership of Citi Infrastructure Investors, of New York, and the Spanish company Albertis. If the Legislature approves this deal, the turnpike will be owned by absentee landlords, and Pennsylvanians will not only be robbed of their public property, but expected to pay tolls for the profit of these private companies. What should be a highway tax to fund the costs of operation and maintenance will become a highway rent.
\
At one point it was suggested that the value of such a lease might be as high as $30 billion, and Mr. Rendell himself suggested that a turnpike lease might be worth upwards of $20 billion, but the winning bid was a paltry $12.8 billion. That works out to less than $200 million per year (plus interest), while the Governor's Transportation Funding and Reform Commission said Pennsylvania needs to invest upwards of $1 billion annually in our highway and bridge infrastructure to maintain it safely.
\
The correct solution to Pennsylvania's transportation funding crisis is not to sell our assets for pennies on the dollar to private speculators or to take on debt by floating a bond. The proper solution, unpopular as it may be, is to begin to cover the costs directly, now, by either raising revenues (an I-80 toll, increased turnpike tolls, or a gas tax hike), reducing costs, or cutting spending on other items.
\
This is yet another instance in which private corporations are allowed to raid the public's assets for bargain treasures, either because the government has simply failed its responsibility of properly managing these public goods or as a deliberate plan.
\
We have seen the privatization of prisons, schools, utilities, drinking water, and natural resources on or under public lands. We see private property stolen from ordinary citizens using the government's power of eminent domain, only to be handed to a private for-profit corporate owner. We have even begun to see the privatization of our national defense, with a sizable increase in taxpayer costs. It was only a matter of time before someone tried to filch our road system out from under our vehicles. We should not accept privatization of our property. Not as a general principle, and certainly not in the particular instance of the Pennsylvania Turnpike. The Green Party of Pennsylvania condemns this attempt at privatization, and encourages all taxpayers and users of the turnpike to contact your state representatives to urge them to oppose it. If that should fail, then state motorists might consider the merits of a toll strike when control of the turnpike is transferred to these corporate road raiders.

733,"
The latest polls show Republican Tom Corbett leading his rival Dan Onorato with a large number of Pennsylvanians still undecided.
\
A poll released this week by Franklin & Marshall College showed Corbett with the support of 42 percent of registered voters compared to 30 percent for Onorato. The same poll showed that 26 percent of registered voters remained undecided.
\
Voter turn-out will be crucial for both men.
\
Corbett, 61, has served as the state's attorney general since 2004. He served in the Army National Guard from 1971 to 1984. He is relying on his experience in elected office to appeal to voters.
\
Onorato, 49, has spent a great deal of time in the Philadelphia area courting the state's largest Democratic base. He touts his track record as Allegheny County's chief executive, a job he's held since 2003, in his pitch to voters.
\
The Tribune has compiled a summary of each candidate's views on several important campaign issues.
\
The Economy
\
Job creation is the top priority for both men.
\
""I believe that I can turn Pennsylvania around, get Pennsylvanian back to work,"" said Onorato. ""I have a track record on the economy and reforming government. As governor I'll do the same thing.""
\
He pointed to record in Allegheny County noting that the unemployment rate in Allegheny County is about 7 percent, which is 2 percent below the national. As governor he would restructure the state's tax code to make businesses more competitive, increase the state's number of shovel ready sites and improve transparency and accountability in economic development programs.
\
As part of his jobs plan Onorato said he'd like to strengthen the ties between educators and employers to make sure Pennsylvania students have the training they need to capture competitive well paying jobs. All of those things would serve Philadelphians well, he said.
\
""If my goal is to turn the economy around of Pennsylvania I can't do that without turning Philadelphia around, without turning the southeast around,"" Onorato said. ""This place is the engine. It's the engine for the votes. It's the engine for the economy.""
\
Corbett said his first priority was ""jobs for today but also jobs for the future.""
\
""We have to create the economic climate for businesses to grow jobs in Pennsylvania,"" he said. ""We can't rely on government jobs. We need to rely on the private sector to provide those jobs.""
\
To do that in a long-term the state needs to prepare workers for the jobs of the future.
\
""Jobs are changing,"" he said. ""So we have to be able to be adaptable. We have to create matching job skills with the jobs that are available. We've just been doing the same things the same way.""
\
Government reform
\
Corbett said would institute ""fiscal discipline, limited government.""
\
In exercising fiscal discipline, Corbett said he would work to keep spending under control and would slash state government.
\
""We've increased spending in a lot of areas without seeing a return on investment,"" he said. ""We haven't made sure that the money is being spent properly.""
\
Corbett said he would start with the state legislature.
\
""There are 253 members of the legislature and almost 3,000 employees to support that,"" he said.
\
To demonstrate that he meant what he said, Corbett said, he cut the size of the attorney general's office by 100 people during his tenure.
\
Government reform also ranked high on Onorato's priority list with a promise to reduce the size of the legislature.
\
""The measuring stick for me will be a 20 cut in the cost of the legislature,"" he said. ""We've got to produce a 20 percent savings. We're going to change the culture, change the system in Harrisburg, which appears to be broken.""
\
Again he pointed to his experience in Allegheny County, where he eliminated 6 out of 10 of the county's row offices.
\
""My own party fought me on this"" he said, insisting he could cut the size of the state government despite what will be a tough battle. ""I think the environment is right for this. Voters are mad. They want to see reform.""
\
Taxes
\
Corbett said he would work on restructuring Pennsylvania taxes to make the state more business friendiy.
\
""You have to reduce the cost of government, to reduce the size of government, to reduce the budget of Pennsylvania and then you start to reduce the business taxes in Pennsylvania,"" he said, adding that he would not change much in the way of personal taxes. ""Personal taxes are pretty low in Pennsylvania.""
\
""But, the business climate in Pennsylvania, we're the 11th worst in the nation for overall business taxes.""
\
He said he would like to cut or even eliminate the corporate net income tax, a law that limits the amount a company can forward as a loss, the capital stock and franchise tax and the estate tax.
\
He singled out the estate - or inheritance tax - as particularly ""business preventive.""
\
It makes it difficult for small business owners and small farmers to pass on other businesses, he said. Ultimately, keeping those businesses and farms would allow those businesses to keep going and keep people employed.
\
""If we take the inheritance tax off those businesses will be able to continue better,"" he said. ""You lower the businesses taxes you're going to see a lot of businesses staying or coming to Pennsylvania.""
\
Onorato has promised not to increase income, sales or the gas tax but has been careful to avoid similar promises on other taxes. Onorato supports a severance tax on the states natural gas industry to raise money for environmental protection.
\
Onorato said he would consider legislation to replace local school property taxes with an expanded state sales tax if voter approved the idea. He has also called for reducing corporate taxes and making regulatory agencies more business-friendly.
\
Diversity
\
Speaking directly to African-Americans, Onorato said minority inclusion was one of his priorities from high level posts to jobs for the state's growing minority population.
\
""It's very important because if you exclude any segment, women, minorities you exclude a point of view,"" he said.
\
Republican candidate for governor Tom Corbett urged African-American voters to support his bid for the state's highest office saying he has the best interests of all Pennsylvanians at heart.
\
""I try to appeal to all the voters because I'm in this for what's in the best interests for Pennsylvania,"" Corbett said. ""I don't need to be running for governor. I could go retire, but I have a passion for this because I love Pennsylvania.""
\
He plans to help everyone to the benefit of African Americans, he said.
\
""The best way we can do it is to raise the level for everybody, whether that is white, Black, Hispanic Asian,"" Corbett said. ""Many of the decisions that the governor has to make have to be in the best interests of Pennsylvania.""
\
He pledged that he would include African Americans in his administration, where he could.
\
""One of the things I think is going to be the greatest challenge is finding more of them,"" he said. ""Finding more willing to come to government.""
"
734,"HARRISBURG -- When it comes to taxes and spending, gubernatorial candidates Tom Corbett and Dan Onorato have talked the big talk.\Elect them, they've promised, and they won't raise your taxes, and they'll make government live within its means -- just like you do. It's rhetoric that looks great on a bumper sticker and sounds even better in a campaign commercial.\But when it comes to the guts of how they're going to pull that off, Republican Corbett and Democrat Onorato have been frustratingly vague.\""I'm not going to give you specifics,"" Onorato said recently when a reporter asked him for specific examples of the programs he'd cut if elected. The response came moments after he ripped Corbett for failing to offer specifics of his own.\""When I get here, and get elected, I'll be ready when I get sworn in to show how we're going to live within our means,"" Onorato said.\Corbett has been terser.\""We've gotta,"" he said when asked how he planned to fill a gaping $5 billion budget deficit in fiscal 2011-12 without raising taxes. ""We've gotta.""\Six weeks before the Nov. 2 election, political observers say Pennsylvanians deserve more than evasion and platitudes from their next governor.\""Apparently, both camps think they are in better shape by not addressing it,"" said Christopher Borick, a political science professor and pollster at Muhlenberg College in Allentown. Tax hikes and spending cuts can be toxic on the campaign trail, but ""it gets to the ludicrous stage when we face this kind of [economic] situation and the candidates for governor are not getting to the reality of the situation.""\Here's the reality:\The next governor will face a $5 billion deficit when he presents his 2011-2012 spending plan to the General Assembly early next year. The hole has a few parts.\First, the new chief executive will have to find a way to replace $2 billion in federal stimulus money that ends with the current fiscal year.\And depending on which way a judge rules, $850 million may have to be repaid to a state fund that provides subsidized medical malpractice insurance to physicians.\Finally, the state may have to pony up as much as $3 billion to the federal government to repay money for unemployment compensation benefits.\The $5 billion does not include an explosion in public pension costs that will have to be met so that the state can provide benefits to retirees. And it doesn't answer how Pennsylvania will pay for at least $1 billion a year in repairs to roads and bridges.\A $5 billion deficit means the next governor would have to cut $1 of every $5 the state spends just for Pennsylvania to stay afloat in 2011-2012, an Associated Press analysis concluded earlier this summer.\On the spending side, there are not a lot of places to cut. Much of the budget, such as education, welfare and prison spending, is tied up in fixed costs. That means Corbett or Onorato will have to look to discretionary programs, which provides them with comparably little maneuvering room.\So where's the money going to come from?\Not from new taxes, says Corbett.\Earlier this year, the two-term state attorney general signed a pledge, sponsored by the conservative group Americans for Tax Reform, vowing not to increase taxes if he's elected governor. It's a high bar. Senior leaders within Corbett's own party have expressed skepticism that he'll be able to keep the promise.\Corbett has also said in the past that he intends to make a 10 percent, across-the-board cut in government spending, but he has not said which programs he would target.\Like Onorato, he has taken a ""we'll see when we get there"" approach. And, like Onorato, he has made repeated mention of trimming a $200 million account controlled by legislative leaders. Such a move requires legislative authorization, and lawmakers are unlikely to comply.\During an Aug. 27 appearance at a Lebanon County food manufacturer, Corbett said he'll make the cuts -- regardless of the political consequences. Again, he offered no specifics.\In a campaign commercial that began airing statewide earlier this month, Corbett provided an advance look at the kind of spending he might target as governor, such as borrowing for a new library on the campus of Philadelphia University named for outgoing Sen. Arlen Specter, D-Pa., and the $45 million renovation of state-owned office buildings in the Capitol complex.\In a campaign white paper, Corbett also proposed trimming the size of the state's vehicle fleet, eliminating taxpayer-funded expense payments for lawmakers and doing away with taxpayer-funded pet projects for lawmakers and the executive branch popularly known as ""WAMs,"" or ""Walking Around Money."" But there is vigorous disagreement over exactly what constitutes a ""WAM"" and what does not.\Onorato has dismissed Corbett's no-tax pledge as a gimmick, but he has also made a verbal commitment to not raise the state's personal income tax or sales tax, two of its largest sources of revenue.\He's also said he wouldn't raise motor vehicle fees or boost Pennsylvania's gas tax -- as proposed by departing Gov. Ed Rendell -- to help pay for needed bridge and road repairs. Onorato also opposes another plan, backed by Rendell, that would expanded the sales tax to more goods and services.\Unlike Corbett, who flatly opposes it, Onorato has embraced a new tax on Marcellus shale drillers. He has not said what rate he prefers, but would direct the revenue to restore cuts to the Department of Environmental Protection; create a new ""Growing Greener III"" environmental program that would pay for farmland and open space preservation, among other efforts, and underwrite a local impact fund that would help municipal governments pay for the effect that drilling has on local infrastructure.\Onorato has also said he hopes to wring ""efficiencies"" from other, unspecified areas of state government, arguing that even a 1 percent reduction in the $28 billion 2010-11 state budget would produce a $280 million savings.\But he has not said where or how he would make those reductions.\Like Corbett, Onorato also has vowed to eliminate legislators' expense payments and to eliminate WAMs.\Charlie Gerow, a Republican consultant from Harrisburg, credited Corbett for providing some details, even as he noted that ""the voters are entitled to some specifics.""\A conservative Harrisburg think-tank, the Commonwealth Foundation, has done some legwork for the candidates. This summer, it released a research paper identifying $4 billion in potential reductions across state government.\The think-tank claimed it could trim $1 billion from the state's $28 billion general fund budget; $2.21 billion from other operating funds and $926 million from the state's capital budget and other off-budget programs.\The analysis claims a $100 million savings at the Department of Corrections, which has one of the largest budgets in state government, by transferring 30 percent of the system's roughly 50,000 inmates into privately operated prisons.\There's also a claim that the state could save $400 million annually by eliminating what's known as the ""prevailing wage"" on school construction projects. That's long been a target of budget hawks, who complain the unions overcharge for their work.\Doing any of that requires getting legislative approval, and just about everything the foundation proposed is a political sacred cow to someone. Group President Matthew Brouillette says the next governor simply must muster the political courage to push the reductions -- and to get lawmakers to follow him.\""It's nickels and dimes, but eventually it adds up to billions,"" he said. ""It will take knuckling down.""\If Corbett wins and finds he must raise taxes or fees, he might find himself in league with former President George H.W. Bush's and his infamous ""read my lips"" pledge in the late 1980s.\""In this [political] environment, when you make that pledge, you'd better keep it,"" said G. Terry Madonna, a pollster and political science professor at Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster.\On the campaign trail, Corbett seems to be at peace with his decision to cut his way out of Pennsylvania's fiscal hole.\""If I only serve one term,"" he said. ""I only serve one term.""\Credit: John L. Micek OF THE MORNING CALL\Credit: John L. Micek OF THE MORNING CALL"

Editor: ""Dunmore rejects golf vote,"" focuses on Dunmore Council's refusal to let taxpayers decide if we should have a golf course.
\
I am not opposed to a golf course; there are just a few concerns. People are spending less money on recreation due to our weakened economy. What marketing approach will be used to overcome that? How are the other golf courses in the area doing as far as profit and loss?
\
Councilman Paul Nardozzi would like taxpayers to decide this issue via a ballot question. It's a great idea.
\
Council should continue with the studies and business plan, then have a public information session to answer any questions.

Editor: Sen. John McCain would have been served well had his campaign staff brushed up on Northeastern Pennsylvania's history prior to his visit July 23.
\
In referring to his proposal for a federal gas-tax holiday, Mr. McCain chided that such a holiday would only hurt members of Congress and ""pork barrel projects."" The audience at the Kirby Center applauded this remark while ignoring its larger callousness.
\
After the rapid decline in national demand for coal in the early to mid-20th century, the anthracite region survived solely upon redirected public funding designed to heal the gaping wounds of poverty, unemployment, and environmental degradation left behind by extractive industry. State and federal officials including Dan Flood, Joe McDade, Hugh Scott, Joe Clark, Bob Casey Sr., Bill Scranton, Paul Kanjorski, and Max Rosenn saw the benefit of public-sector investment.
\
Had it not been for desperately needed government expenditures, scores of federal and state programs, and hundreds of millions of dollars in public spending, Northeastern Pennsylvania's citizens would surely have starved and experienced greater dislocation than they already had. Not the least of such so-called ""pork"" programs included Tobyhanna Army Depot, Interstates 81, 84, 80, and 380, urban redevelopment and infrastructure, post-Tropical Storm Agnes recovery, the 1969 Coal Mine Health and Safety Act and its provisions for black lung compensation, the 1961 Area Redevelopment Act, the Appalachian Regional Commission, the Job Corps, the Comprehensive Employee Training and Education Act, Federal and State Abandoned Mine Reclamation, and many others. These programs pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into the regional economy. Many remain with us today.
\
Indeed, the birthplace of American free enterprise capitalism -- Appalachian Pennsylvania with its rich deposits of coal -- survived in the 20th century only as a result of public spending. It had long since been abandoned by corporate America.
\
It is easy to criticize government spending. The public sector is always an easy and casual target. The rhetoric is much different than the reality, however, when public spending means that people can work, eat, educate their children, and pay their bills. History demonstrates this. Just ask people who lived through the deindustrialization of the anthracite region in the 20th century.

Relocate tiger cubs
\
Editor: Letters expressing disappointment about the two tiger cubs in the Nay Aug Sanctuary have been pouring in ever since it was announced. There is no doubt that this ""sanctuary"" is not adequate for two grown tigers. Imagine putting your family pet in a small cage that lets it walk only a few paces in each direction for its entire life.
\
There are many larger tiger sanctuaries in the country that give the animals much more space. There are also accredited zoos. Unfortunately, the issue becomes economic since zoos and sanctuaries need to have the space and the budget for a new animal. Fortunately, there is time, since the cubs are probably still pretty happy at this point.
\
The city needs to come up with a long-term solution. It would also be a good PR opportunity if the city's progressive leadership sent these tigers to a better environment.
\
All residents who feel as I do, keep the letters coming. If the negative public response continues, there will be increasing pressure for city leadership to act in the tigers' behalf.

I was approached by the ""captain of the guard"" and asked if I was taking pictures of my family. I politely told the young man that it was not his concern. I reminded him that I was in a public place taking pictures of what was clearly in the public view. I told him that it was perfectly legal and suggested that he call the police.
\
I told the police I was in a public place taking pictures of what was in the public view. They demanded identification. After presenting them with my ID I asked them if I was free to go. They responded I was not. I asked them if I was under arrest and they said no but I was not permitted to leave.
\
They detained me for over 20 minutes.
\
The supervisor advised me that if I did this again, I would be escorted from the park and banned. I asked what law or rule I was breaking to which they had no response. I responded that they would not get away with that and that I could not be singled out for engaging in a legal activity
\
Three police officers to harass one man not breaking any laws while the criminals were doing God knows what.
\
I find it unacceptable that I should have to defend myself for taking pictures in public. It is even less acceptable that I should face being banned.
\
While I understand the concerns, all the people present in any public place are dressed in the clothes they chose. They are in full public view .
\
It is not against the law to take pictures of anything in public view from a public place. It would be nice for the average person to know this, and certainly, law enforcement personnel should know. Adults and children make good subjects.

736,"HARRISBURG - Local legislators on Tuesday greeted Gov. Tom Wolf's budget address with guarded warmth.\The governor presented his 2017-18 budget proposal Tuesday to a joint session of the legislature. Appropriations committees in the House and Senate will hold public hearings on the $32.3 billion spending plan later this month.\Six lawmakers represent Franklin County in Harrisburg. The two state senators and four representatives are all Republicans. Wolf is a Democrat.\Wolf urged the legislature to work with him.\""The truth is, the people of the Commonwealth have elected a Democratic governor and the most Republican legislature in modern history,"" Wolf said in his budget address. ""I think it's safe to say that they don't expect us to agree on everything. But no Pennsylvanian is interested in more of the same here in Harrisburg. Nobody wants to see us argue over who should get the credit for solving problems -- and if we don't solve problems, no Pennsylvanian will be interested in watching us argue over who should get the blame. The people who put us here want to see progress.""\Local lawmakers, who have outright dismissed the governor's budget proposals in previous years, said they were open-minded to his one, which proposes no broad-based tax increases. They are still worried about coming to grips with the pension crisis.\""I think this will be more of a legislative-driven budget this year,"" said Sen. John Eichelberger, R-Hollidaysburg.\""It's good to hear the governor's willingness to work with the Republican majority in our initiative to reinvent government,"" said Rep. Rob Kauffman, R-Chambersburg. ""As we examine the details of the governor's budget blueprint, I'm optimistic that we can find a way to work together if the governor seeks a collaborative effort to reduce state government.""\Wolf has proposed merging the departments of Aging, Health, Human Services and Drug & Alcohol Programs and Human Services into a Department of Health and Human Services to save money and to deliver services more efficiently.\""I am pleased that the governor appears to have heeded the call of working men and women across the state in his decision to end his fight to increase broad-based taxes,"" Kauffman said. ""The governor has put forth a plan that aims to merge several state agencies and departments to save state tax dollars and eliminate redundancies. While I haven't seen the details, this plan is worthy of serious consideration.""\Kauffman, who represents central and northeast parts of the county, chairs the House Labor and Industry Committee.\""Overall I'm pleased that the governor is trying to streamline state government and looking for ways to provide the same services with less overhead and administrative cost,"" said C. Adam Harris, R-Mifflintown. ""We now have three weeks of budget hearings to discuss the details but hopefully we can all work together to have a no tax increase budget on his desk before June 30.""\Harris, representing northwest Franklin County, chairs the House Liquor Control Committee.\""I'm hopeful that the new tone from Gov. Wolf leads to a better negotiating environment for this year's budget,"" said Rep. Jesse Topper, R-Bedford. ""While we certainly need to see some specifics, when the governor talks about reducing the size of government, making it more efficient and cutting red tape, he's speaking my language.""\Topper represents the southwest part of the county.\""A great deal of work remains in order to complete the budget, but I appreciate that the governor is willing to take a different approach to this budget than in years past,"" said Sen. Richard Alloway II, R-Chambersburg. ""While the governor deserves credit for exploring new avenues for savings, there are still areas of concern in his spending plan. As we tackle yet another huge budget deficit, I am disappointed that his spending plan does not acknowledge many of the factors that created that deficit in the first place. It is no coincidence that the growth in pension costs over the past several years equals or exceeds the deficit we face today. Our new pension costs alone make up more than half of the projected increase in state spending in Governor Wolf's budget proposal, but he didn't give us any ideas on how to fix that problem.""\""The governor didn't address a lot of major concerns, such as long-term spending,"" Eichelberger said. ""Most glaringly, he completely ignored the most significant issue causing our annual billion-dollar deficits -- the public pension crisis.""\Eichelberger said cost-saving changes have to be based on performance and not politics. He pointed to the governor's decision to furlough hundreds of Unemployment Compensation Call Center employees, including the state's most efficient center in Altoona.\""I applaud the Governor for expressing a genuine interest in making Pennsylvania government more efficient and less costly,"" said Rep. Paul Schemel, R-Greencastle. ""Perhaps he has looked at the outcome of the recent elections in Pennsylvania and realized that Pennsylvanians have no appetite for the larger and more powerful government that the governor sought the last two years.""\Wolf said, ""My budget protects the investments we've made in education, in senior services, in fighting the scourge of opioids, and in growing Pennsylvania's economy.""\Wolf projects a savings of $2 billion from efficiencies.\""Although the governor's budget proposal is a step in right direction, it still increases state spending by over $700million and calls for a tax increase on Pennsylvanians of $1 billion,"" Schemel said. ""All of this after Pennsylvanians have already received a tax increase this year to the tune of an additional 8 cents on the gallon of gasoline. Under the governor's proposal residents of Franklin County will pay more in taxes without fixing the state's broken education funding scheme or addressing our out of control pension deficit.""\Schemel represents southeast Franklin County.\Education\Eichelberger, chairman of the Senate Education Committee, said he was bothered by a proposed spending increase for education.\Educators however welcomed Wolf's proposal to spend more on education.\Deborah Gordon Klehr, executive director of the Education Law Center, said any additional funding would help, but Wolf's proposed increase of $100 million for basic education and $25 million for special education funding ""will not be enough to allow schools to close longstanding resource gaps.""\""Our schools currently face a $3 billion adequacy gap,"" Klehr said. ""And Pennsylvania ranks 46th in terms of state share of K-12 education funding and has the largest gap in the nation between what our poorest and wealthiest districts receive. His proposal to increase early education funding by $75million and to allocate additional funding to early intervention services represent crucial investments.""\Wolf's proposal also would provide the State System of Higher Education with about $453.1 million next year to help fund the operations of the 14 state-owned universities, an increase of almost $9million from the current year's funding level.\The State System also would get about $17.1 million next year from the Keystone Recreation, Park and Conservation Fund to help pay for deferred maintenance of campus facilities. A portion of the state's realty transfer tax supports the fund.\""We are so appreciative that both the governor and the General Assembly recognize the immense value of the State System and continue to support our universities and our students,"" said Board of Governors Chairwoman Cynthia D. Shapira. ""That support represents an important investment in Pennsylvania's future -- one that pays huge dividends for the entire Commonwealth.""\Wolf's proposal does not provide additional Medicaid funding for nursing homes, and W. Russell McDaid, president and CEO of the Pennsylvania Health Care Association, objected.\Natural gas tax\Wolf's budget would levy a 6.5 percent natural gas severance tax.\The tax would be detrimental to natural gas jobs and development in Pennsylvania, according to Pennsylvania Independent Oil & Gas Association President & Executive Director Dan Weaver. Low energy prices in today's market have made it difficult for drillers.\""The best that can be said is that we are holding onto our rigs and our jobs by our fingernails by being as smart and efficient as possible in our operations,"" he said. ""All of that will change for the worse with any type of severance tax, without any significant effect on reducing the state budget deficit."""
737,"
Mirror mirror on the wall, who's the most frugal Republican governor of all?
\
Is it Gov. William Weld of Massachusetts, who wants to cut personal-income taxes more than a half-billion dollars over the next two years?
\
How about Gov. Whitman? She's already lowered taxes. Now, she's going after the state workforce again and welfare.
\
In this era of governmental rollbacks, don't overlook Gov. Ridge. Pennsylvania's chief executive showed last week that he could trim, cut, reduce and hack away with the best of them.
\
He proposed a fiscal 1997 budget that, for starters, practically freezes state spending, offers no major new money to schools, takes cash away from some colleges, slashes benefits for 157,000 people on welfare, dumps 2,400 employees from state jobs (though he would add 1,200 to the Corrections Department), splices seven commerce programs into two, and gets rid of $60 million worth of business taxes.
\
Like his GOP gubernatorial colleagues around the nation, Ridge followed the GOP mantra of cut, cut, cut - then cut some more. He cited an anticipated $600 million less from Washington and projections of little growth in the economy as reasons for his austerity.
\
Depending on how you add up the numbers, his $16.2 billion general-fund budget represents either a spending decrease from last year of $30 million, a 0.2 percent reduction, (his math), or an increase of $60 million, a 0.4 percent gain, (the Democrats' arithmetic).
\
Either way, the Ridge budget, which must now be considered by the Republican-controlled legislature, is a prime example of the growing trend toward shrinking government.
\
The question is, what's provoking the trend? Is it the party of the governor, the times or something else, such as political ambition?
\
* Probably a bit of all three, said Joan Thompson, professor of political science at Beaver College in Glenside.
\
``It's partly the Republican agenda, responding to the '94 election,'' Thompson said. ``It seems as though the nation has accepted balancing the budget, cutting back on government and putting more money in private hands.''
\
Thompson said the public's embracing of smaller government budgets and fewer government programs also has generational overtones. Those who lived through the Depression saw poverty firsthand; that is not the case for a far larger percentage of people today.
\
Then, ``government came to the rescue. Everyone knew poverty could hit everyone,'' she said. Now, ``they are an aging cohort. They are leaving the electorate. We have a new cohort now that sees poverty differently and is responding to the cry of lower taxes. We have much more of a sense of an undeserving poor.''
\
Thompson said it is also not inconceivable that Ridge, Whitman and Gov. George Pataki of New York, another Republican reducer of big government, have another reason for pursuing a small-is-good theme.
\
``To some extent, it's competing for the vice-presidential slot,'' Thompson said. ``These three governors are all potential vice presidents. They have to show they're solidly in the conservative, slow-government vein.''
\
Although political party is certainly a factor, cutting taxes and government services is not strictly the province of the GOP.
\
Democratic Gov. Lawton Chiles of Florida asked his legislature to approve a budget that was less than he proposed last year - and he threw in some sales-tax cuts.
\
Closer to home, Democratic Gov. Parris N. Glendening of Maryland asked his legislature to downsize welfare. In Delaware, Democratic Gov. Thomas R. Carper proposed a budget that would increase spending 5.4 percent, but he also asked for a big break for small businesses - allowing them to deduct 100 percent of their health-care costs from their taxable income.
\
Lots of governors are looking to help business - a step they say is critical to helping their state economies by creating jobs.
\
Ridge is no exception. He proposed $60 million in such tax cuts, including a tax-incentive job-creation program, on top of the $286 million in business-tax reductions approved last year.
\
And, for the second year in a row, Ridge proposed a substantial cut in welfare, the most significant element of which is eliminating medical assistance for able-bodied adults without children. The state will save $249 million, Ridge said.
\
* Besides slowing or freezing spending and cutting taxes, another key aspect of the Ridge budget - and those of some other governors - is that it contained no major initiatives or radical surprises.
\
Last year, his first foray into state budgeting, Ridge went for the jugular - not so much with major spending changes but with a $40 million item that left the public-school establishment quaking in its sensible shoes.
\
Ridge proposed a school-voucher system that would have rewritten the rules for public and private education in Pennsylvania. Lauded by proponents, such as Catholic school officials, the program never was enacted - in part because of fears by teachers' unions that it would snowball into something that would ultimately cost public schools hundreds of millions of dollars, not to mention their jobs.
\
This year, the governor went for no one's neck. Instead, his major education initiative was a three-year, $121 million technology plan to put more computers in classrooms and connect schools with libraries.
\
For educators, the budget was notable more for what it did not do than for what it did do.
\
For the first time in five years, there would be no increase in the basic education subsidy, leaving school officials to complain that they will be forced to raise property taxes to maintain programs.
\
At the college level, Ridge was even more stingy. He froze funding of state-owned colleges, such as West Chester and Cheyney Universities, as well as state-related schools, such as Temple University. Private colleges, such as Drexel University, took more of a hit: Ridge proposed cutting their subsidies in half in fiscal 1997 and eliminating them totally in fiscal 1998.
\
Critics said his plan would only lead to bigger tuition increases.
\
The only real growth in Ridge's budget is in corrections and law enforcement. The Department of Corrections' appropriation would go up nearly 10 percent, to $916 million next year, to house an expected 32,270 inmates by December - a figure that, even with the increase in dollars for new prison beds, will exceed capacity by more than 8,000. The Board of Probation and Parole budget would jump almost 14 percent, to nearly $82 million, and the state police budget would climb 7 percent to $165 million.
\
Even with those increases and despite the flat economy and the smaller expected reimbursements from Washington on which his budget is predicated, Ridge stayed away from any kind of tax increase in this year, when the entire state House of Representatives and half the Senate is up for election.
\
Ridge did recommend increasing certain fees, however, to raise a paltry $12 million. The cost of getting a birth certificate, for instance, would rise from $4 to $8; death certificates would jump from $3 to $8. Robert Fisher, a Health Department spokesman, said the higher figures are still less than the average charges for other states.
\
* When it comes to controlling the public purse, governors love to portray themselves as tightwads.
\
In March 1979, Republican Gov. Dick Thornburgh proposed a ``no-nonsense, no-frills, no-luxuries'' budget.
\
Nevertheless, he asked the legislature to boost the gas tax, retain what were supposed to be temporary increases in personal-income and business taxes, and spend significantly more on public schools, colleges and welfare cash grants.
\
Democratic Gov. Robert Casey, eight years later, recommended adding state employees, increasing welfare cash grants, boosting the education subsidy and increasing the environment budget by 26 percent.
\
His budget, he said, was ``frugal.''
\
Well, Thornburgh might have been frill-less, and Casey might have been frugal, but when it comes to being a fiscal skinflint, Ridge showed last week that few can beat him.

CORRECTION, PUBLISHED MAY 13, 1997, FOLLOWS: Bob Volkmar's arithmetic was garbled in the editing of his May 12 letter. It should have said he believes that Dr. Laura Schlessinger ``ruins approximately 30 lives in four weeks'' on her radio call-in show, not 30 lives a week.

\
Ridge's rainy day fund doesn't hold water Gov. Ridge says he transferred $180 million into the state's rainy day fund because ``when times are good, we save because we know times aren't always going to be good.'' That is the most irresponsible statement since Custer said, ``Indians can't shoot.''
\
Doesn't the governor know that 99 percent of all middle-class taxpayers live paycheck to paycheck with nothing to fall back on?
\
Gov. Ridge, give the money back to the people who need it most, the taxpayers, or repeal the gas tax hike. Whatever you do, just be honest with the voters, tell them up front you intend to raise their taxes and let them decide whether they want you in office.

PT. BREEZE NEEDS NEW REP I'm a lifelong resident of South Philadelphia and it hurts my heart every time I walk from Point Breeze Avenue and Federal Street to Point Breeze and Morris Street. This once-thriving business area has turned into a haven for drug addicts, prostitutes, alcoholics, failed black businesses and new Asian merchants. It seems like the black longtime residents of the area have given up.
\
The person I criticize the most for this is state Rep. Harold James. Granted, he has done more than his two 186th District predecessors combined, but that's not saying much. His contributions are hardly noticed.
\
Point Breeze is a predominantly black neighborhood. It has a rich tradition and has produced and still is capable of producing great leaders and citizens. For a black man to be elected by black people and not nurture programs enabling his constituents to be self-employed, self-motivated and socially aware is a detriment to those he is supposedly serving.
\
His legislation on statewide issues may sound good to others, such as farm subsidy and health care issues, but what about his constituents, the ones who put him into office? It's time for a change if Point Breeze is ever to reap the benefits of its potential.

FAN CAN'T SEE PLAYOFFS As a Flyers Game Plan holder, I was unable to purchase any playoff tickets because - rumor has it - full-season ticket holders were offered the opportunity to purchase tickets for the playoffs.
\
As a Game Plan holder since 1992 and a fan since the early 1970s, I have loyally supported the Flyers. I continued to purchase tickets during the non-playoff years of the early '90s when Flyers' tickets were not in particularly high demand. Being an annual Game Plan holder allowed me to ensure myself the opportunity to buy tickets for the Stanley Cup playoffs and the eventual move to the CoreStates Center and provide my 12-year-old son the opportunity to become a Flyers' fan. Now despite years of loyal support, I have neither.
\
A lot of folks wonder why the Flyers no longer enjoy the distinct home-ice advantage they once did. I suspect it has a lot to do with the fact that many of the real hockey fans are not there.

I've listened to her regularly for the last few months, and her responses and personality have led us to believe that she's dangerous to the well-being of everyone who follows her beliefs.

Augusta Clark, Angel Ortiz setting a poor example
\
That Queen of Arrogance, Councilwoman Augusta Clark, is in arrears on her property taxes. Her response is, ``I'm taking care of it,'' and when pressed further, replies, ``It's none of your business.''
\
As someone who appealed my increase in real estate taxes and lost, I am pleased that this charmer has armed me with an obviously plausible defense against making timely property tax payments. I am certain the gang will attempt to put their hands in my wallet again next year and I can't wait to call Mayor Rendell and say, ``Yo, Ed, don't worry where my check is. It's none of your business.''
\
And that King of Compassion, Angel Ortiz, intervening on behalf of the murderer who robbed Sean Daily of his teen-age life. This was a kid beaten with bats and, while he lay helpless, shot. Ortiz seems to think this young rascal should be rewarded with an early release because he testified against his comrades.
\
With Clark and Ortiz on Council, it is time we elect a voice of reason from the Northeast to an at-large seat on this too liberal City Council.

It angers me that anyone would even consider paroling Aidan Soto. It angers me even more that Councilman Angel Ortiz is trying to get this man out of jail.
\
He says he can't understand why the district attorney opposes this parole. Well, let's see . . .
\
* No 1: Soto has killed another human being.
\
* No. 2: You get what you deserve. Does completing his GED and being a model prisoner erase his crimes?
\
Because Soto was out of control, the Dailys lost a son with a great future. What makes you think Soto won't lose control again?
\
As a Hispanic female, I am ashamed and embarrassed to share the same ethnic background with Councilman Ortiz.

I am shocked at Councilman Angel Ortiz's comments on parole for imprisoned killer Aidan Soto after only 7 1/2 years.
\
It seems the only time I hear from this tired '60s liberal is when it concerns some alleged injustice to Latinos.
\
When you compare Aidan Soto's relatively short sentence of up to 20 years with the permanency of Sean Daily's death, it should be clear that Soto should serve every day of his sentence.

Memorial should put FDR in his rightful place
\
Sandy Grady's emotional appeal to have the FDR memorial in D.C. without a statue of the man in a wheelchair is overly sentimental and not justified. Why should we hide the facts from young Americans about a great American? If he took pains to hide his disability, it was a media thing. Those at his speeches saw a man physically disabled, and they were enlightened by a man distressed physically and enabled mentally.
\
I question why history is hidden from view - half in sunlight, half in shadow. Shed light on the entire being and let the chips fall where they may.

Your May 2 story on the controversy surrounding the portrayal of Franklin D. Roosevelt mistakenly identifies memorial designer Lawrence Halprin as an architect.
\
Halprin is one of our country's most distinguished landscape architects and a fellow of the American Society of Landscape Architects. Landscape architecture is a profession distinct from architecture, engineering and the other environmental design professions. Frederick Law Olmsted coined the term ``landscape architecture'' in the late 1800s, and ASLA, the society that represents the profession, will celebrate its 100th anniversary in 1999.
\
The unique contribution that landscape architects make to environmental design can clearly be seen in the memorial's masterful use of space and form. The one point on which everyone has agreed is that Halprin designed more than a memorial - he created an experience that is truly moving and worthy of the president who led us through the Depression and World War II.
\
It is worth noting Halprin's professional discipline correctly because the public deserves the best in memorial and other total environment designs. Only by acknowledging and utilizing landscape architects' specialized skills can we ensure that future civic projects are equally outstanding.

Hornbeck needs to join the club
\
Now I know why Superintendent David Hornbeck did not get any money from Gov. Ridge for the Philadelphia public schools. He didn't join Ridge's Governor's Club.
\
Everybody who formed the club either got a chairmanship or state loan or state contract. It would have been worth $50,000 for Hornbeck to join.
\
Knowing how Ridge hates public education and his relentless fight to bail out religious schools with tax money, this probably would not have worked either.

IT'S SMALL CHANGE, BUT IT SPEAKS TO QUALITY OF SERVICE I consider myself an urban environmentalist. I live car-free and take my bike to work every day - except on the rare occasion when it's broken, which was the case recently. I went to wait for one of my rare SEPTA bus rides with a pocket full of quarters.
\
I got on the bus and dropped the quarters into the box one by one, until I got to $1.50. I asked the driver what the fare was. He said $1.60, so I dropped another quarter in. I looked at the fare box for a change slot, but found none. I then made my big mistake: I asked the driver if I could get change. He said nothing and pointed at the sign above his head saying, ``Driver has no change.'' His look was one of total dismissal.
\
I took my seat, realizing that I had just been swindled by SEPTA out of 15 cents. I can spare the change, but what bothers me is that if a private company did this, it would be illegal. I would really like to support public transportation, but these little insults are enough to make me give up on SEPTA and go back to taking taxis whenever a trip is out of bicycle range. The price of a cab is more than three times higher, but at least I get change when I ask for it, and I can tip the driver as a reward for good service. Maybe SEPTA can learn something from this.

THE GOP AND CATHOLICS It is ludicrous for Bob Dole and the Republican Party to try to lay claim to the Catholic vote (May 23). If they took the time to look at Catholic social teaching, Republicans would see how many of their positions conflict with official Catholic positions on a broad spectrum of social and economic issues. Republicans are simply pandering to the official Catholic position on abortion.
\
It is troubling, even for some lifetime Democrats, that the Democratic Party position on abortion is so intolerant of dissenting views, even to the point of censoring Gov. Casey at the 1992 Democratic National Convention. There are Democrats, including many Catholics, who see more of their values embodied in Democratic Party positions, even if they disagree with the party's dogmatic stand on abortion. By remaining in the party, these Democrats advance their concerns for social and economic justice and challenge the party to become more tolerant of diversity of opinion regarding abortion.
\
On a purely pragmatic level, those who embrace the Republican Party because of their opposition to abortion should ask what the Republicans have really accomplished on this issue. What effect did 12 years of Reagan and Bush have on the number of abortions performed each year? The empty slogans of party leaders, whether Republican or Democrat, will not resolve this debate.

ON `AMERICA'S MAYOR' The May 18 article ``Rendell faults selfishness in Beaver College address'' perfectly illustrates the flawed mentality that is responsible for creating irresponsible and ineffectual governments that disserve, in essence, the entire nation.
\
Mayor Rendell goes to great pains to point out the greed of the citizenry who strive to make profits and keep their money, then starts whining about the proposed rollback of the 4.3-cents-a-gallon gas tax that does not go to pay for roads, but was enacted by President Clinton and Congress in '93 for deficit reduction.
\
Who's the greedy one here?
\
I would not mind paying taxes if I knew the money wasn't being squandered to back deficit spending or creating a class of people who believe they cannot achieve without government's assistance.
\
I contend that it is Mr. Rendell and his like-minded associates who are greedy and will do or say anything to hold onto power on the backs of the hard workers who made this country great. Herein lies the source of the very ills that the politicos actually embrace. Some people define this contradictory attitude as liberalism. I define it as stupidity.

MEDICAL CONSUMERS NEED INFORMATION The May 20 Inquirer article on menopause as a passing phase of life rather than as a disease was heartening.
\
Countless women suffer from the complications of hormonal imbalances during the childbearing and post-childbearing years. The women's health advocates in this article appropriately stress the need for balance between relief of women's discomfort during menopause, and marketing of hormone-replacement therapy for treatment of menopause as a ``disease.''
\
Other recent media reports indicate a distressing trend to treat medical problems from the perspective of cost containment and profitability, at the expense of other human considerations.
\
Accurate information is what medical consumers need. Thank you for this thought-provoking story, which is sure to assist many women in their search for better health. All of us will need a great deal more health information to make informed choices as the population ages.

* Plaudits to Dr. Susan Love for not classifying menopause as a disease (May 20, Inquirer).
\
Considering menopause abnormal is like treating the monthly menstrual cycle as a medical aberration because of the vaginal bleeding. Menopause is part of a woman's life cycle and is as normal as day following night.
\
The zealous push for hormone-replacement therapy is a covert form of exploitation by the medical establishment and the pharmaceutical industry. Physicians are wooed by the pharmaceutical companies to peddle their products.
\
As a result, the mention of menopause and age 50-and-over will push a button, causing many doctors to start bellowing ``hormone-replacement therapy.'' This is borne out by the estrogen-replacement drug being the most highly prescribed ``medication'' in the United States, according to pharmaceutical market research data.

WILLIAMS IS LONG ON THEORY, SHORT ON KNOWLEDGE The statement of Walter Williams on the minimum wage and youth employment (May 4) is long on economic theory, but short on knowledge of how labor markets work in real life.
\
Mr. Williams claims that an increase in the minimum wage will destroy thousands of jobs for youth, who, in his view, are the major occupants of minimum-wage jobs. Further, he would have us believe that minority youth in particular will suffer the most from an increase in the minimum wage.
\
Regrettably, Williams is wrong on both the facts and the theory of the relationship between minimum wages and youth employment. More than two-thirds of all minimum-wage workers are adults, not teenagers, and about one-third of the adults are the sole breadwinners of their family. Many of these workers are single women with children trying to maintain a decent standard of living. The real value of the minimum wage has declined by 29 percent since 1979. Further, many violations of minimum-wage payments occur in industries that hire youth because the underground economy is often impervious to the enforcement efforts of our Labor Department inspectors.
\
Recent research by Alan Krueger and David Card at Princeton University, and other economists, shows that a modest increase in the minimum wage, like the 90-cent-an-hour increase over two years as proposed by President Clinton, is likely to have a negligible impact on the number of jobs, including jobs for youth. The economy is growing at a rate of more than 100,000 jobs per month, inflation is under control, and worker productivity is rising. In that type of environment, a modest minimum-wage increase can easily be accommodated without negative employment effects.
\
But further evidence suggests that the minimum wage might not be the main factor responsible for unemployment among minority youth.
\
In 1978 to 1980, the U.S. Department of Labor sponsored the Youth Incentive Entitlement Program to increase employment of inner-city youth in areas of high unemployment. Part of the funds from the $115 million program were used to test whether employers would hire youth if their wages were paid in whole, or in part, by the federal government.
\
The results showed that only 10 percent of the inner-city youth were hired by private-sector employers (including small businesses), despite the fact that the employers would have to pay only 25 percent or less of the teenager's wage. Most youth were hired by state and local public agencies. An evaluation of the youth-employment experiment showed that the personal characteristics of inner-city youth, including their race (not just the wage rate) were the major factors determining whether they would be hired.
\
The best way to improve job opportunities for youth is to improve their education, training and preparation for the job market. We must also assure equal job opportunity through affirmative action for minority-group youth.
\
The refusal to raise the minimum wage will do nothing to improve youth employment, but will further damage the standard of living of almost 10 million low-wage workers and their families.

740,"REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION '96\ It didn't include a detour through Russell, Kan., but Gov. Ridge's journey to San Diego provided a months-long trail of intrigue that boosted his national profile and climaxed a season in which his administration bounced back from a series of legislative setbacks.\ Yet the flirtation with the vice presidential nomination highlighted differences between Ridge and some more conservative elements of the Republican Party - differences that are potential roadblocks should Ridge ever attempt to take a larger role on the GOP's national stage.\ Ridge's 18-month-old administration took office with a string of early successes. He enacted get-tough measures on the crime issue that had been central to his 1994 campaign. But the honeymoon was short-lived.\ After investing considerable political capital in an education reform proposal that featured a pilot tuition voucher program and the authorization of charter schools, Ridge was twice rebuffed by the Republican-controlled Legislature.\ A call for a gas tax increase - advanced at the same time that national Republicans were calling for a rollback of fuel levies - landed with a resounding thud. In Eastern Pennsylvania, his administration was roundly derided over the collapse of efforts to revive the Philadelphia Navy Yard.\ But the administration reasserted itself this spring and early summer. In quick succession, the Legislature enacted reforms in the state's workers' compensation system, approved major changes in the state's welfare rules and adopted an austere budget that largely followed administration proposals.\ VP or not VP?\ The image of a reinvigorated administration was burnished through the summer as the vice presidential speculation was nurtured by Bob Dole's repeated campaign trips to Pennsylvania, and Ridge's acknowledgment that he had submitted financial and personal information at the request of Dole's selection team.\ Last week, leaks to The Associated Press and The Washington Post suggested that Ridge had taken himself off Dole's short list. That may have been the case. Or it may be that Dole wasn't planning to choose Ridge anyway, and allowed the story to circulate so the governor could save face.\ Ridge offered no guidance on that question. For weeks, he had spoken openly about how flattered he was to be considered for the spot. But in the final days before Dole's decision, he was silent. The governor may have shared his decision-making with the Dole campaign, but unlike Ohio Gov. George Voinovich's public pronouncements that he wasn't interested, Ridge didn't confide in his constituents.\ Still, Ridge had given some indication of the way he was leaning.\ Late last month, after the last campaign day he shared with Dole, Ridge said of the potential decision, ""I have got very personal considerations that would have to be weighed. I commuted 12 years back and forth from Washington. These are some of the considerations that would have to be weighed if and when the conversation (with Dole) ever took place.""\ The national spotlight also showed the different perspectives from which Ridge is viewed in Harrisburg and inside the Beltway, and why, despite his political strengths and whatever personal rapport he may have developed with Dole, he would have been a tough sell to some influential elements within the GOP.\ In Harrisburg, Ridge is seen as a conservative friend of business, a governor who faced down organized labor in the workers' comp fight and who dealt with burgeoning welfare costs by serenely supervising the cutoff of medical benefits to thousands of Pennsylvanians.\ Hostility in GOP\ But on the national scene, some Republican conservatives recoiled at the notion of him on the ticket. Strike One was his qualified support for abortion rights. The conservatives'\ resistance to the Dole campaign's effort to insert ""tolerance"" language into the platform's abortion plank suggests Dole would have fomented an intraparty revolt by choosing any abortion-rights supporter.\ Hostility to Ridge among some conservatives also was rooted in some of his congressional votes on labor and defense issues.\ Discussing some of those votes recently, Ridge voiced no second thoughts.\ In the late '70s, after working 30 years as a salesman for Armour Products, Ridge's father was suddenly laid off.\ ""Two weeks' notice and ""\ Completing the sentence, Ridge smacked his hands together with a report that filled his wood-lined office in the Capitol.\ ""That's why I voted for the 90-day community notification that gave all those Republicans heartburn,"" Ridge said.\ ""I just saw in microcosm what it did to my father. Look, when you're busting your butt for 30 years and they give you two weeks' notice, no golden parachute, no platinum parachute, no severance pay. Thank you, and in two weeks you're unemployed. It was anathema (for some in the GOP) for me to vote for that community notification. Some Republicans were apoplectic.""\ And despite his own military background, Ridge crossed some Republican hawks with his skepticism on aspects of defense spending.\ ""I caused a little bit of heartburn because I did not think we needed to spend $50 billion on a bunch of missiles called the MX,"" he said.\ ""I remember staying down there (in Washington) for a weekend. I didn't go home. I had my staff get a whole bunch of material on the MX. I'll never forget it. I read Saturday and Sunday. I weighed that very carefully, so I voted `no,' "" Ridge said.\ ""There are those who would take some of those votes and categorize them any way they want. I cast them as a Republican who from time to time disagreed with the mainstream of the party.""\ `A lot of tough votes'\ Still, he has conservative fans as well as detractors.\ In the days before Dole's decision, one of Ridge's strongest partisans was Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a fellow Vietnam veteran who said Ridge ""is a man who would be ready to be president.""\ ""He stands for what he believes in, and if it meant taking on his own leadership, he was ready to do so,"" McCain said. ""He was thoughtful, never knee-jerk. We would have gotten the Republican majority much sooner, frankly, if we had had more people, more thoughtful people, like Tom Ridge.""\ Ridge will get a slice of the national stage, speaking on crime Tuesday to the Republican Convention.\ But freed of the distraction of national politics, Ridge can return to push his agenda in the General Assembly.\ While acknowledging some disappointments in the past, Ridge lauded the Harrisburg record he has notched so far. And, in doing so, he obliquely referred to the informal competition he figured in through the summer.\ ""I can't imagine any governor, not only in this state - but I take a look at some of the other Republicans around the country - doing as much as quick as we did in welfare, and workers' comp, restructuring Commerce, redesigning DEP, the industrial sites reuse and the list goes on and on.""\ But, he conceded: ""I've learned a couple of things in the first 18 months. I think there was a feeling-out process (with the Legislature) I was the new guy in town. There were certain ways they did business here, and we're trying to honor some of those traditions and work with them.""\ Ridge strenuously disputed a question premised on the notion that his administration had sometimes projected a lack of respect toward legislators.\ ""I tip my hat to the Legislature because of all that has been done with their support and approval,"" he said.\ But an undertone of frustration with his legislative partners didn't seem too far from the surface as he contrasted the environment in the General Assembly with that of Congress, ""where we cast a lot of tough votes on a fairly regular basis.""\ ""I respect what they do and obviously wouldn't want to do anything to undermine that relationship or denigrate what they do. Occasionally, from time to time, I hear from isolated legislators, `That's a tough vote,' "" Ridge said.\ ""Well, my point is: I know. That's your job. People make tough decisions all the time. They make tough personal decisions in their work. This is their work.""\ Run at school reform\ Mark Holman, Ridge's veteran chief of staff, endorses his boss' view that ties with the Legislature are now on a more solid plane than after the first defeat of Ridge's school reform legislation.\ ""We learned to do a couple of things better,"" Holman said. ""We did a better job of conveying information to the General Assembly. We did a better job of using the governor outside Harrisburg. When you do welfare and workers' comp in a few weeks, it makes you think you'll be able to do a couple of tough things in the future.""\ Among them, Holman said, would be another run at the twice-rejected school reforms.\ ""We know in this administration that the governor wants this done,"" he said.\ Ridge said one more lesson of his tenure was that, ""The job of being governor is emotionally and intellectually more rewarding than even I thought it could be.""\ And it's not going to get any less challenging. The shift to block grants in federal funding, particularly in the area of welfare, will shift more budget decisions to the state level. One recent court case has produced a multimillion-dollar mandate for state funding of local courts. Yet another pending case has the potential to compound the burden of school funding at the state level.\ The ability of his administration to deal with those challenges will go a long way in determining whether Ridge is remembered as a footnote or a fixture in national politics."
741,"
Gov. Kean yesterday unveiled a new $12.1 billion state spending plan so austere that it is likely to trigger tax increases in some of New Jersey's poorest cities.
\
More well-to-do communities and school districts may also have to raise local property taxes to make up for lost state revenue.
\
Moreover, Kean's spending plan may result in tuition increases for the 48,000 students enrolled at the three Rutgers University campuses, as well as fare increases for the 315,000 riders of NJ Transit buses and trains.
\
Overall, the budget would increase spending next fiscal year by 1.8 percent over this year's $11.87 billion, a growth rate less than the rate of inflation. The $213 million increase would be the smallest jump in state spending since Kean took office seven years ago.
\
Republican Kean has prided himself on his willingness to use government to attack problems and has spent billions of dollars doing so, doubling state spending along the way. He increased spending this fiscal year by 12.5 percent, for example. But a shortfall in the growth of state taxes has suddenly fiscally dampened his final year in office.
\
His new spending plan would eliminate the state's longstanding $50 million revenue-sharing program, which gives aid to almost every municipality in New Jersey. It would also slash money to the three-year-old Distressed Cities program, which pumps special aid to New Jersey's 49 most troubled cities and towns. Money for that program would go from $120 million to $70 million.
\
Kean is to formally deliver his budget address today to the legislature, but in his prepared text, released yesterday, he acknowledged that his budget contained bleak news.
\
""All along,"" Kean said, ""we have known when revenues slowed, we would have to make some difficult spending decisions. This budget contains those decisions, and some, frankly, trouble me.""
\
The governor said his axing of money for cities and curtailing of the growth in aid to colleges were among decisions that bothered him.
\
He added: ""All of these programs are worthy. All of them deserve additional funding. But we simply cannot approve budget increases without the money to pay for them.""
\
The legislature has five months to consider the spending plan, which is to cover the 1990 fiscal year starting July 1. Throughout much of his tenure, Kean and the legislature, flush with the good will generated by good times, have adopted budgets smoothly, with little rancor. But it is already clear that will not be the case again this year.
\
The chorus of legislative protest began immediately yesterday. For example, state Sen. John H. Ewing, a Republican from Somerset County who normally is aligned with Kean, said the budget ""will devastate municipalities and dole out pain among communities through the state.""
\
In addition to cutting aid to the state's cities, the budget would not increase the basic grant to the 105,000 New Jersey families on welfare, most of whom live in those 49 distressed towns. That means those families would go a third year without an increase in the welfare check.
\
The budget trims money for numerous state agencies, including several whose work addresses some of the state's most pressing problems. The Department of Environmental Protection budget was trimmed 2.1 percent, for example, and the Insurance Department budget was cut 5.5 percent.
\
Health Department spending on fighting AIDS - New Jersey has the nation's fourth-highest death toll from the epidemic - was cut by about $1 million, though Kean administration officials hastened to point out that this loss should be made up by increased federal aid.
\
And the state's beleaguered Election Law Enforcement Commission, which critics say is failing badly at its task of keeping politicians honest, had its budget cut 4 percent.
\
The new budget also completely drains the state's highly touted Rainy Day Fund, a $246 million special budgetary reserve created just last year with the proviso from Kean that it would be tapped only in ""emergencies.""
\
Kean proposed no new tax increases, though the legislature recently approved extending the sales taxes to telephones, which will raise $35 million annually. Kean has also endorsed a special tax on plastic cups to raise money to clean up the environment, though his budget is not balanced by use of such a tax.
\
As Kean has previously disclosed, the budget would grant the biggest spending increase to the state's public schools, who would see their aid go up $271 million to $3.5 billion.
\
Even so, this increase would also be the smallest of Kean's tenure and would mean the state had again failed to spend the sum mandated under a complex court-sanctioned formula designed to ensure that impoverished urban schools are put on an equal footing with rich suburban ones.
\
Kean did find some money for new spending on a few programs, including $23 million on his ambitious venture to help welfare mothers obtain jobs and about $30 million to help alleviate the state's desperate shortage of apartments for the poor.
\
After schools, the biggest dollar increases would go to costs at the heart of every government budget - wages, employee benefits and pensions. Kean's chief counsel, Michael R. Cole, who briefed reporters on the budget yesterday, called those ""Pac-Men that just eat up revenue.""
\
For example, the budget sets aside $206 million more to give raises to the state's 83,000 workers and to cover new pension costs; the state is by far New Jersey's biggest employer. It adds $34 million to pay for the state's geometrically growing prison system. And it boosts spending on Medicaid, the programs of medical insurance for poor families, by $69 million.
\
The announcement earlier this month that state funding growth would be reined in sparked sharp protest from educators, who renewed that protest yesterday. Joining them were the mayors across the state, who warned that the state was backing them into the untenable position of choosing between cutting essential programs or raising taxes.
\
Though the budget includes no tax increases, it does include some budgets stratagems designed to ease the revenue pressure in the current fiscal year. Some of these changes - which a Democratic fiscal analyst denounced as gimmicks in a ""cash-flow game"" - will require legislative approval.
\
One change that the Kean administration plans is to more realistically estimate the amount of state income tax owed by New Jersey residents and collect those taxes in a more timely fashion. As a result, beginning March 1, the sum of taxes withheld from paychecks may increase from 50 cents to $2 a week.
\
The legislature, however, will have the say-so over another key budget proposal. The administration hopes to pick up $77 million in extra revenue this fiscal year by pushing forward a due date on taxes paid by out-of-state insurance companies.
\
In recent years, Kean and the legislature have spent millions more each year than the state receives in tax revenue. They have been able to do so
\
because the state gas tax accumulated an enormous budget cushion by racking up large surpluses in the early 1980s.
\
Yesterday, state fiscal officials disclosed for the first time that the state surplus for the last fiscal year, ending June 30, 1988, hit $1.02 billion, the biggest in the state history. According to the National Conference of State Legislators, that was probably the biggest state government surplus in the nation.
\
But that surplus is to be cut in half by the end of this fiscal year, on June 30, and in half again at the end of the next, on June 30, 1990.
\
Although New Jersey's economy is still robust, its growth rate has decelerated, setting the stage for Kean's undramatic and tight spending plan that counsel Cole called ""a virtually standstill budget.""
\
In his briefing, Cole said that ""in candor"" he agreed that some of the state's poorest cities might be forced to raise taxes. ""It's going to cause some increases, because they're not going to forgo those programs that those
\
dollars support,"" he said.
\
He also said it might force increases in college tuition. Indeed, Ruth Scott, spokeswoman for Rutgers University, with campuses in Newark, New Brunswick and Camden, said yesterday that even before yesterday's news, the Rutgers board had been considering raising tuition to keep up with inflation.
\
Susan Kirk, a spokeswoman for NJ Transit, said the agency had requested a $80 million increase but got only $7.5 million more, which would bring its state aid to $201 million.
\
She said the agency's board would meet Feb. 28 to consider possible fare increases or service reductions.
\
The budget also was greeted gloomily by activist groups that keep a watch on the state's welfare program.
\
But Cole, asked about welfare and about other cuts in the budget, stuck to a constant theme: Hard choices had to be made.
\
""This is a budget that's really characterized by difficult decisions,"" he said. ""It's designed to do the best we can with what little money we have available.""

"
742,"
With two years behind him and two years to go, Gov. Kean is not about to make a midcourse correction or unveil a catchy slogan summarizing his vision and agenda when he delivers his second State of the State address today.
\
""The top priority of this administration has always been jobs, the creation and retention of jobs, and obviously programs we come up with in the New Year will be designed to do that,"" Kean said in a recent interview.
\
The Republican will deliver the address to a joint session of the new 201st Legislature, which, like the 200th, will be controlled by Democrats.
\
As he begins the second half of his term, Thomas Howard Kean is in excellent political shape with his own party and the public in general. Some Republicans may muse about the possibility of a Republican gubernatorial primary in 1985, but no one is talking about challengers.
\
Said Sen. William Gormley (R., Atlantic): ""It would be foolhardy for anyone to run against Tom Kean."" As Kean's Democratic predecessor, Brendan T. Byrne, moved towards the end of his first term, more than 10 Democrats were gearing up to challenge him in the Democratic primary, Gormley said.
\
Kean's polls, the Democrats' polls and third-party polls show that the Essex County millionaire is popular with New Jersey's 7.3 million residents. In fact, an October 1983 poll by the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University showed that 20 percent of the people of New Jersey don't even know which party he belongs to, indicating that his appeal is personal as well as political.
\
But the governor's grades as chief executive of a $6.8 billion public operation aren't as glowing as the reports on his political health.
\
""The criticism that is made of Kean is that he doesn't have a programmatic purpose or vision,"" said Alan Rosenthal, a professor at Rutgers' Eagleton Institute.
\
The balance of the governor's term, Rosenthal said, will determine ''whether Kean can convey where the administration is going other than making government more efficient."" Rosenthal said he believed that it was too early to grade Kean.
\
Kean's agenda is considered substantial, if perhaps a little dry:
\
Proposed civil service reform. New prison construction that eased severe overcrowding. Streamlining the bureaucracy through his management-improvement plan. Slowing down the year-to-year rate of growth in government spending. Appointing the first woman to the state Supreme Court. A vigorous commitment to toxic-waste cleanup. Efforts to court new businesses and hold onto the ones in place. Proposals to attract better-qualified people to teaching. An infrastructure-bank proposal. Restoration of the death penalty.
\
Nevertheless, James Maloney, chairman of the state Democratic Party, said he found Kean's two-year performance lackluster, that the governor's proposals were not innovative and benefited narrow interests.
\
In an interview, Kean talked about his term so far and his plans between now and 1985.
\
The initiatives he will unveil today will revolve around promoting economic development with policies that affect the business climate, the state's image, the transportation system and the rest of the infrastructure.
\
To date, the legislature has rejected his gas-tax proposal as a method of providing a stable fund to upgrade the state's ailing network of roads and bridges; it has put his infrastructure-bank proposal on hold.
\
""I'm going to find a way that we get . . . the legislature to establish some kind of a permanent fund to fund infrastructure repair in this state,"" Kean said. Setting up a dedicated source of funds for the infrastructure, he added, wouldn't necessarily mean a new tax.
\
""It means some money has got to be set aside so we can use it, year in, year out, and so we can plan ahead so we can say, 'All right, we can plan on this amount of federal funds next year matched through this amount of state
\
funds; therefore we can do the planning today on this bridge or that highway.' ''
\
A firm schedule for projects will help companies thinking of locating in the state to decide whether necessary infrastructure elements will be in place, he said.
\
During the remainder of his four-year term, Kean said, he will focus on preserving and cleaning up the environment, continued experimentation with health-cost containment and pushing his teacher-certification proposals and other education initiatives.
\
""What I'm proud of is that New Jersey is starting to be recognized in some of these areas,"" he said. ""New Jersey, which was often unfortunately a laughingstock. . . . Now in area after area, people are coming to New Jersey and saying 'How did you do it?' "" Kean said.
\
Thirty states, he said, have inquired about the Governor's Management Improvement Plan, a privately funded group that used corporate donations and executives-on-loan to reorganize state departments, review programs and reduce the number of employees and middle managers.
\
Kean said other states also were coming to New Jersey to look at its environmental-protection programs, its public-education plans and its health- cost containment experiments.
\
A recent issue of Inc. magazine ranked New Jersey 10th as a favorite location for small businesses, Kean said. ""As this happens, something else very important has happened,"" he said.
\
""I think this image we've been fighting for years in this state is starting to change. It's not all objective evidence. . . . It seems to me I don't hear the number of jokes I used to hear about New Jersey. We seem to be being replaced by Cleveland for some reason.""
\
Despite the improvement he perceives in the state's image and the upswing in the state and national economy, Gov. Kean is not returning to the tax- cutting proposals of his 1981 gubernatorial campaign.
\
On the campaign trail, the Livingston Republican cultivated an image as a tax-cutter. Candidate Kean said he wanted to cut the sales tax sometime in his first term. He said he wanted to cut corporate tax rates from 9 percent to 6 percent in his first year, with further cuts in his second year.
\
Because of the recession and the budget gap he said he inherited from Byrne, Kean set that game plan aside for the most part. Through legislation, he has only been able to implement a gradual phase-out of the net-worth tax on businesses.
\
To close the budget gap and ride out the revenue needs of future years, he had to sully his tax-cutter image considerably. Under compromise bills adopted by the Democratic-controlled legislature and signed by Kean at the end of 1982, the sales tax rose from 5 percent to 6 percent and the income tax for people earning more than $50,000 was increased to 3.5 percent.
\
Kean said while he has not abandoned his desire to lower corporate taxes, he was convinced that he could not get such a bill through the legislature. Within the Northeast region, he said, he considers New Jersey's tax structure to be competitve.
\
The Democratic Party does not concur with Kean's appraisal of his first two years. State party chairman Maloney said there were that New Jersey is not better off today than when Kean took office.
\
As one indicator, Maloney cited a recently published Children's Defense Fund report that said New Jersey was one of 11 states in which infant deaths per 1,000 live births is rising.
\
A South Jersey lawyer and law partner of U.S. Rep. James Florio who lost the 1981 gubernatorial race to Kean by less than 2,000 votes, Maloney acknowledged that Kean's popularity is high.
\
""I think he's doing superficially well,"" Maloney said. ""As I assess his support, it's a mile wide and an inch deep.""
\
The response to Kean as an individual may be quite favorable, but when his name was linked with issues in a Democrat-commissioned poll, Kean's ratings were fair and poor, Maloney said.
\
Maloney dismissed Kean's complaints of not being able to move certain bills through the legislature. ""It's a reactive body,"" he said. ""It's not supposed to be an initiating body.""
\
Still, said Sen. Lee B. Laskin (R., Camden): ""Even if Tommy Kean had the greatest ideas, he couldn't get them through."" With a gubernatorial race in 1985 and Democrats in the legislature with gubernatorial aspirations, Laskin said, 1984 and 1985 will be ""a circus.""
\
Sen. Wayne Dumont (R., Warren) called Kean ""an extremely fine individual."" But Dumont, who has watched six governors, added: ""The question is whether he's as tough as he might be.""
\
Kean's method of dealing with the legislature is foreign to most lawmakers, lobbyists and the statehouse press, professor Rosenthal said. ""I don't think the Capitol community is comfortable with Kean's style,"" he said. ""He's more easygoing than forceful. The Capitol community is more comfortable with a governor who breaks arms.""
\
For his part, Kean said he was not opposed to applying pressure to move his programs through the legislature. ""I have twisted a few,"" he said. ""What I have said (is that) I would not do some of the things that have been done in the past. I will not involve judgeships in discussions of other pieces of legislation because I think it's wrong.""
\
Dumont's observations, according to Rosenthal, are evidence of an erosion of gubernatorial power that occurred in the Byrne administration but was less visible then.
\
Kean is fully aware of his nice-guy image: ""I hope I am,"" he said. ""But I hope they don't mistake that for weakness. I see no conflict between being a decent person and being strong as a governor. In fact, I hope they go together.""

"
743,"
Gov. Ridge was furious.
\
It was Jan. 28, the day after House Majority Leader John Perzel announced his idea to lend the state's pro football and baseball teams $320 million for new stadiums instead of granting it to them, as Ridge had promised to do.
\
Ridge was sitting in his Capitol office, radiating waves of anger at his chief legislative lobbyist, Dennis Walsh. Months before, Walsh had laid out a strategy to rescue his boss' ailing stadium plan - a strategy that called for a close partnership with Perzel.
\
Now, one week before the expected vote, Ridge was holding a newspaper article that quoted Perzel proclaiming the governor's stadium plan dead - and offering an alternative that the teams were refusing to accept. Perzel had ignored Walsh's entreaties not to make his loan idea public.
\
``You've had me pursuing this strategy for 2 1/2 months, and this is what I get?'' the ordinarily measured Ridge exclaimed, according to three people familiar with the exchange.
\
Ridge couldn't see it then, but the bomb Perzel dropped would not destroy his stadium plan. Instead, it would blow up the logjam that seemed to doom its passage. Five days later, lawmakers were rushing to embrace a compromise stadium bill that called for the teams to guarantee $300 million in new tax revenue - essentially the Ridge plan, fortified by some Perzel-inspired armor.
\
In the end, the success of the once-unpopular stadium bill - a huge political win for the Erie governor and the Philadelphia legislator - stemmed in part from the friction that has long existed between them, according to lobbyists, gubernatorial and legislative aides, and Perzel himself. It also stemmed from their ability to swallow that animosity at the crucial moment and forge a deal.
\
When Ridge failed to understand how badly his original plan needed resuscitation, Perzel administered an uncomfortable shock. And when Perzel was considering passing a loan plan that the teams said would kill the deal, Ridge aides made clear that there would be serious consequences if he did.
\
Of all the myriad political and personal subplots that drove the stadium saga, the rivalry between these two very different Pennsylvania Republican leaders arguably loomed largest.
\
``We had to get off the dime,'' Perzel said Friday, explaining why he ignored Ridge's wishes and publicly announced his loan plan. ``We had to do something if we were going to save this thing.
\
``I've got to represent the majority in the House,'' Perzel said. ``It's not like he's the CEO and I'm the president and he tells me what to do.''
\
It wasn't personal, Perzel added: ``I love the guy.''
\
Ridge was similarly statesmanlike Wednesday night as he basked in the glow of the successful stadium vote.
\
``He just said publicly what a lot of members had been telling me privately,'' the governor said of Perzel's loan pronouncement. ``And the fact that he is majority leader gave it a lot more credence. I think it significantly improved the environment within which [Ridge general counsel Paul Tufano] could negotiate the deal on behalf of the state. So it was a big help.''
\
The tone wasn't always quite so lofty. On Tuesday morning, just after he decided to accept Ridge's compromise proposal, Perzel walked onto the House floor to hear Ridge's budget speech before a joint session of the legislature.
\
When he saw Ridge's chief of staff, Mark Holman, Perzel disclosed his decision, with a good-natured locker-room jibe:
\
``You won, you little . . . .''
\
* To understand the dynamic that played out between Ridge and Perzel, it helps to understand the differences in their backgrounds and styles.
\
Both have blue-collar roots, lived in subsidized public housing as children and attended Catholic schools.
\
There the similarities end. Ridge, 53, won a scholarship to Harvard, then volunteered for duty in Vietnam, where he saw combat as a staff sergeant. He graduated from Dickinson School of Law, worked as a prosecutor, then spent 12 years representing Erie in Congress. He lives in a tony suburban development.
\
In Erie, a city that many Philadelphians will never visit, Ridge is a prodigal son.
\
Perzel, 49, attended several colleges before earning an economics degree from Troy State University in Alabama. In 1978, he won the House seat representing his blue-collar Northeast Philadelphia neighborhood of Mayfair, where he still lives. During his first eight years in the legislature, he continued moonlighting as a restaurant maitre d'.
\
In a Democratic city where Mayor Rendell is the political star, most people wouldn't recognize Perzel on the street.
\
Their public demeanors could hardly be more different. The tall and imposing Ridge is so self-controlled that he drives reporters covering him to fits of boredom. The rumpled, intense Perzel regularly erupts with a passionate, colorful candor that sometimes gets him into trouble.
\
When Ridge came to town from Washington in 1995, lawmakers and lobbyists say, he brought with him a notion that the Republican chief executive should set the policy agenda - and the Republican legislature should carry it out.
\
Perzel did not - could not, he says - see it that way. Though the Senate is three-fifths Republican, Perzel rules with just a two-seat majority, and two Republican mavericks routinely vote against him. Sometimes Ridge's ideas just could not fly.
\
Ridge, meanwhile, expressed frustration over the way lawmakers would leverage their votes for favors.
\
Yet, time and again, Perzel has delivered tough votes for Ridge - from workers' compensation reform to electricity deregulation to a gas-tax increase. And Perzel has often complained that he doesn't get the credit he deserves.
\
``I think John has a sense that the governor does not have an appreciation of how difficult it is to manage the politics of the House,'' said one lawyer-lobbyist intimately involved in the stadium deal.
\
That certainly was true with the stadium saga, Perzel said in an interview Friday.
\
Since 1995, Ridge had been calling for the state to pay one-third of the cost of four new stadiums for the Pirates, Steelers, Eagles and Phillies. The cities would pay another third, and the teams a third. That became a priority late last year, when it became clear the Pirates would leave Pittsburgh unless they could move into a new ballpark.
\
During the post-election, lame-duck session in November, Ridge's plan passed the Senate easily. But support never materialized in the House. Suburban and rural Republicans said their constituents could not abide a ``giveaway'' to wealthy sports moguls, while Rendell failed to corral Philadelphia Democrats. No vote was taken.
\
Ridge started his second term knowing he had to make something happen by February, or the Pirates would start their departure process - and deal a crippling blow to Pittsburgh.
\
Yet all the publicity surrounding the issue had made taxpayers even more skeptical of the notion that the state would pay for one third of the stadiums though grants. By last week, Speaker Matt Ryan said, ``It was apparent to John and to me that the first bill wasn't going to make it in the House.''
\
Perzel agonized. He did not want to be blamed for losing a team. But he could not push lawmakers where they didn't want to go.
\
Several lawmakers had been talking about lending the money to the teams instead of giving it to them. Perzel liked the idea, but Ridge resisted.
\
Finally, Perzel went public. In a speech before the Pennsylvania Newspaper Association, Perzel announced his loan plan. Just a concept meant to spark debate, he said.
\
It did. Ridge fumed, but recalcitrant lawmakers took another look. This, coupled with the $453 million for other projects that Ridge had included in the new package, was something they could sell back home.
\
Shortly after Perzel revealed his plan, legislative leaders decided they wanted to hold the stadium vote the next week. That left Tufano, Ridge's lead negotiator, just four days to seek a compromise that team owners could live with.
\
Tufano came up with the idea of requiring the teams to guarantee the increased tax revenue they had long been promising. That would be considered a repayment of the subsidy. Legislative leaders reacted warmly, but they weren't sure. Would the public buy this?
\
Last week, they commissioned a statewide poll. Even with local projects thrown in, only about half of those surveyed supported a state stadium grant, Ryan and Perzel said. But if those polled thought the money would be repaid, support rose to more than 70 percent. People did not see much difference between Tufano's plan and Perzel's loan, Perzel said Friday.
\
Still, Perzel's anger gave him pause, he said. He was mad at Rendell, who acknowledged botching the initial vote. He was mad at Pittsburgh Mayor Tom Murphy, who made insulting remarks about lawmakers when the first bill failed. And he was mad at Ridge, who, he said, ``expected us to vote for a giveaway.''
\
He considered, he said, simply trying to pass his original loan plan, and telling Ridge and the teams to take it or leave it. But he knew an irate governor would have spelled trouble for his members and his party.
\
Perzel also considered something else.
\
``I really thought the Pirates would leave,'' he said, ``and I didn't want the House of Representatives to be blamed.''
\
So the House Majority Leader began selling his governor's new plan. Lawmakers bought it, in droves. It won by comfortable majorities, 136-62 in the House, and 34-15 in the Senate.
\
At the celebratory news conference, Ridge made amends for the way he took his lobbyist, Walsh, to the woodshed.
\
``When we were riding high, he was riding high,'' Ridge said of Walsh. ``And when we were riding low, he was still riding high. Because he believed that at the end of the day, the legislature would do the right thing.''

744,"See related stories: ""Pennsylvania wants to be rail system hub,"" by \ The decades-old transportation network of the Northeast, the nation's most populous area, lies in disrepair and neglect.\ But, buoyed by the passage last November of a six-year, $151 billion highway and mass-transit bill for all 50 states, transportation officials envision a 21st century renaissance that includes high-tech, high-speed trains, and computers that guide drivers to the least congested highways.\ ""The act signals a renewal of federal commitment to rebuild and expand our nation's transportation systems,"" said Louis J. Gambaccini, chief operating officer of the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority.\ The Northeast depends on more types of transportation than any other section of the country, and its transit lines carry 5.3 million passengers a day, more than the rest of the country put together.\ Top priorities outlined in interviews with government officials and planning experts include:\ *Getting enough money from the federal and state governments to repair and maintain highways, bridges, rails and subways scheduled for long-term use.\ *As new technology develops, making hard decisions on which systems to rebuild and which to discard.\ *Developing a new transportation network and at the same time meeting the requirements of the Clean Air Act of 1990 to reduce auto emissions. Some of the air in the Northeast is the worst in the nation, with New York City ranking behind only Los Angeles.\ *Implementing high-speed, steel-wheeled trains that roll along steel rails at nearly 200 miles an hour, and maglev trains supported, guided and propelled by magnetic forces that glide above a guideway at more than 300 miles an hour.\ *A continued major role for mass transit, and computerized highways to ease traffic tieups by the year 2000.\ *Intelligent Vehicle Highways Systems, computerized highway monitors that show how many vehicles are on each road and how fast they are moving. They tell drivers the fastest routes to each destination and exactly how many minutes it will take to get there.\ The Northeast already is spending billions of dollars to rebuild roads, bridges and subways that have been neglected for more than half a century.\ Still, much more needs to be done to modernize the country's oldest road network, which is choked with increasing traffic, and subways that are dirty and dangerous.\ The recession has forced some states to delay or abandon even more ambitious proposals to widen highways, replace bridges as old as 70 years, and extend subway lines to the suburbs.\ ""Many of the bridges are reaching the end of their design life at a time when there are not enough funds available,"" said William M. Wilkins, executive director of The Road Information Program, a Washington-based research organization supported by contributions from the highway industry.\ So are the highways. A survey of 2,500 truckers by Overdrive Magazine rated the Cross Bronx Expressway in New York City the nation's worst. The expressway carries Interstate 95 from the George Washington Bridge across to the New England Thruway.\ ""You can't drive a truck over 15 miles an hour,"" said trucker Steve Abbe. ""If you go faster, you'll hit a pothole and go into the other lane and probably kill somebody.""\ On many of the Northeast's highways, traffic has increased by as much as 50 percent beyond what they were designed to accommodate. By the year 2015, there are likely to be 5.5 million additional cars in the tri-state region of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.\ A Connecticut study forecast that three lanes would have to be added in each direction along Interstate 95 in the next 20 years to handle the growing traffic in that state's southwest corridor that empties into New York City.\ Wilkins said it would cost more than half a trillion dollars to bring America's roads and bridges up to date. While no breakdown by region is available, much of the highway disrepair lies in the Northeast.\ To modernize bus and rail facilities over the next five years, it will take $17.1 billion, much of it in the Northeast, according to the American Public Transit Association, a Washington-based lobbying group.\ The Northeastern states are planning $2.3 billion in new systems and extensions in the next 10 years in Baltimore, Boston, New York City, northern New Jersey, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.\ November's transportation bill doubles mass transit funding over the next six years to $32 billion and raises the ante by allowing states to divert as much as nearly half of the $119 billion in highway funds for subways and trains.\ ""There's never been that flexibility on the use of these dollars,"" said Jack Gilstrap, executive vice president of the transit association. ""We're entering the next century with a new approach, where emphasis is on ride sharing, conservation of energy and a clean environment.\ ""It won't just mean building more mass transit systems,"" he said. ""It'll mean encouraging people to share rides in a variety of ways, such as car and van pools. The whole array of techniques designed to manage transportation, that is the wave of the future.""\ But has the emphasis on highways and air transportation delayed that wave?\ Vukan R. Vuchic thinks so, in comparison to Western Europe and Japan, which pioneered high-speed rail travel.\ Vuchic, a professor of transportation engineering at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, says air travel is fine for longer distances but less efficient closer to pairs of cities, or to corridors such as Washington-Baltimore, Wilmington, Del.- Philadelphia, and New York-Boston.\ ""Access to airports is so cumbersome that air travel becomes very inefficient,"" says Vuchic. ""Compared to other countries, we have rather poor public transportation between cities. The federal government has neglected rail transportation.""\ Transportation officials acknowledge the need for linking highways, airports, trains and subways and for providing the suburbs with access to roads and public transportation.\ ""Highways and railways have got to be hooked together,"" said Gil Carmichael, federal railroad administrator in the Department of Transportation. ""Train stations need to be at the airport. You get off a plane and get on the train.""\ As for highways, The Road Information Program's Wilkins said many studies draw the same conclusion: ""As a country, we're not investing the amounts of money that need to be invested.""\ But where would the money come from?\ Wilkins said that not all the money being collected from the states in gasoline taxes that go into the federal highway trust fund are being spent.\ ""The highway trust fund has a balance of about $10 billion,"" he said. ""The federal government is letting the balance stay at that level because it makes the federal deficit appear smaller than it is. Critics call that a smoke-and-mirrors act."" A House bill just passed calls for drawing down the fund.\ Also, some states hard hit by the recession are diverting tolls and other user fees from highway and bridge improvements.\ As one example, a coalition of transportation supporters in Boston has filed a suit challenging the diversion of $239 million in state gasoline taxes pledged for highway work into the general fund to make the budget deficit appear smaller. The gas tax was increased 10 cents a gallon last year.\ According to Wilkins, a survey of highway funding methods in all 50 states in 1990 showed that $4.3 billion in highway tolls was diverted from highway and bridge improvements for other uses.\ Carmichael said money could come from private developers and investors building high-speed trains and toll roads in partnerships with the states.\ New York and Massachusetts, for example, might hook up to build a maglev train from Albany to Boston to New York City.\ ""It's very revolutionary,"" Carmichael said.\ Next: Rebuilding the Northeast's crumbling highways."

Our election page has more information about this race and the others that affect York County in 2014.
\
1. Two property tax reform bills were voted on last year in the House. House Bill 1189 from Rep. Seth Grove, R-Dover Township, gives each school district the choice to move from property tax to income and other taxes, passed the House and is awaiting approval from the Senate. House Bill 76, from Rep. Jim Cox, R-Berks County, would completely eliminate property taxes. However, the bill failed a vote in the House. Do you support either of these bills? Why or why not? If you don't support either of these bills, please explain your position on property tax reform.
\
Merisotis:Like the Midnight Pay Raise Seth Grove's Bill HB 1189 was rammed through the house at record speed. HB 1189 adds new taxes without removing oppressive property taxes. It is nothing more than career politicians pretending to help property owners without actually doing something.
\
Why is it that career politicians refuse to help while thousands of good people are losing their homes to property taxes? They know that HB 76 could end property taxes for school funding once and for all -- yet they won't even allow it to come to the House Floor for a vote. If we don't act now property taxes will skyrocket to pay for the $47 billion pension crisis that started when Ron Miller and his fellow career politicians voted to raise their own pensions by 50 percent. I fully support the passage of HB 76 NOW.
\
Phillips-Hill:I support real, meaningful property tax reform. School districts have a spending problem. That spending problem has been created by Harrisburg. We must fix the root causes of the spending problem or school districts will continue to burden taxpayers, regardless of how they are funded. No reform will be complete without these four measures: funding formula reform, pension reform, eliminating unfunded mandates, and eliminating prevailing wage requirements for school districts. As a Dallastown school board director, standing on my record of having worked tirelessly to provide a quality education to students in a fiscally responsible manner without raising taxes, I know that staying that course is tenuous without these reforms. In addition, I support HB 76 as the legislative mechanism to reform property taxes. I will work to ensure that it adequately replaces property tax revenue so that passage of this measure is finally secured.
\
2. Natural gas production from the state's Marcellus Shale formation has been a boon to gas companies who say the influx has kept prices low for consumers. In 2012, Pennsylvania enacted an impact fee on wells drilled into the shale. But analysts and groups such as the Pennsylvania Budget and Policy Center estimate the impact fee generates less revenue than a severance tax. Should natural gas drillers pay a severance tax? Or is the impact fee sufficient? Why or why not?
\
Merisotis:The claims that gas companies aren't paying their fair share of taxes just isn't true. A sound tax policy requires that people or businesses pay for the government they use, including the cost of extracting natural gas. Despite the passage of a natural gas ""impact fee"" almost two years ago, some lawmakers insist drillers still aren't paying their ""fair share.""
\
Gas companies are already paying for more government than they're using, including an estimated $800 million in 2013 royalties to landowners, $500 million on road repairs, and billions in existing state taxes. Also gas drillers face the same tax climate common to every other Pennsylvania business, including the highest effective corporate income tax rate in the industrialized world. Much of the $400 million collected by the ""impact fee"" is funding broad programs that have little connection to natural gas drilling impacts.
\
Phillips-Hill:Natural gas from the Marcellus Shale has not only benefited gas companies and consumers, but has also benefited our state, our country, and our geopolitical security. I'm proud that Pennsylvania's gas production has helped to diminish our dependence on foreign energy sources. The impact fee was well intentioned, in that it sought to protect the taxpayers and communities where drilling was occurring from financial liability caused by drilling operations. Clearly, states that impose a severance tax generate more revenue than states with only an impact fee from drilling activities. While I am willing to examine a move to a severance tax, I question raising the tax burden on a business sector that is helping to drive the Pennsylvania economy. We must look at the complete tax burden, including the high corporate tax rate, on Pennsylvania drillers to ensure they remain a viable part of Pennsylvania's economy. Pennsylvania families and businesses should not suffer under unnecessarily high energy prices to balance our state budget.
\
3. Last year, the state Legislature approved a $2.3 billion transportation bill paid for by increased motorist fines, fees, and a gas tax that made its way down to drivers in the state. Did you support the approved funding plan? Why or why not? If you did not support the funding plan, how would you have funded the necessary infrastructure repairs in Pennsylvania?
\
Merisotis:Despite what the governor says, the transportation bill is a massive tax increase. Do we need to fix the roads? Absolutely, but where has the money gone? Why have roads and bridges been allowed to get this bad? How much of the money we are currently spending go to fund public transportation in Philadelphia? About 20 percent of the revenue from the new taxes will go to Philadelphia and Pittsburgh? What ever happened to the stimulus money that Governor Rendell received from the Obama administration for those ""shovel ready"" projects?
\
Prevailing wage laws raise the cost of government construction projects by 25-30 percent and yet in this bill it was raised to a floor of $100,000. Most Government projects easily cost over $100,000. By eliminating prevailing wage we could save the taxpayers billions of dollars at the state, county and local levels.
\
In the real world we live on a budget and we can't just spend more in one area without cutting somewhere else. Why didn't lawmakers cut spending in another area to provide the needed funding? We have a big spending problem in our government.
\
Phillips-Hill:I was not a member of the legislature when the decision to approve the $2.3 billion transportation bill was made and hindsight is always 20/20. Should I be elected, my job will be to make sure that money from this bill comes to York County to address our road infrastructure capacity and congestion issues. The money allocated in this bill must pay for boots on the ground and shovels in the dirt, not general fund expenditures.
\
4. In January, a bill was introduced by state senators Daylin Leach and Mike Folmer that would allow the use of medical marijuana in Pennsylvania. The bill was subsequently the subject of a Senate committee hearing on the issue. Should Pennsylvania legalize medical and/or recreational marijuana? Why or why not?
\
Merisotis:I do not support the legalization of recreational marijuana.
\
I cannot support the legalization of medical marijuana until medical studies show in greater detail what the long term effects would be.
\
Phillips-Hill:I empathize with people facing medical challenges that could potentially benefit from medical marijuana, especially children with severe forms of epilepsy. As a parent, I would move heaven and earth to alleviate my child's suffering. I would be open to the approval of medical marijuana that is in a certain form, such as a pill or oil based medicine, with tight restrictions that require a prescription and physician's supervision. I do not support the legalization of recreational marijuana since it is a gateway drug that poses health risks.
\
5. What would be your other priorities if elected, and why should voters support you?
\
Merisotis:Scott Wagner's stunning victory over Ron Miller in the recent special election proves that your vote does count and now I would like for you to make it count again by voting for me, Ernie Merisotis, in the May 20th Republican primary.
\
Why is it that career politicians refuse to help while thousands of good people are losing their homes to property taxes? They know that HB 76 could end property taxes for school funding once and for all -- yet they won't even allow it to come up for a vote. If we don't act now, property taxes will skyrocket to pay for the $47 billion pension crisis that started when Ron Miller and his fellow career politicians voted to raise their own pensions by 50 percent.
\
So If you're okay with politics as usual in Harrisburg, then you can vote for my opponent Ron Miller's former staffer who will continue to support his failed policies and his agenda.
\
But if you want a true Republican who will work for the elimination of property taxes, and restore some much needed common sense to our government then please vote for me, Ernie Merisotis, on Tuesday May 20th.
\
Phillips-Hill:If elected, I will work for economic growth through less taxes and regulations to create an environment where business and agriculture can create more jobs and opportunities. I will work to reform the school funding formula so that it is fair and equitable. I will work to reform the state pension system. That reform will start with me - I will not take a taxpayer funded pension. Service in government should not be a profession, so I support term limits and will limit my own tenure in Harrisburg to 5 terms. I will work to strengthen Pennsylvania's human trafficking laws and support measures to increase awareness of the importance of organ donation. Voters should support me because I am a proven fiscal conservative that has dedicated most of my adult life to public service and our community. I care about people, do my homework, and work hard to get things done. I will place my highest priority on listening to your concerns and making your agenda, my agenda in Harrisburg.

"
746,"Thirteen candidates are vying for a seat on Wilkes-Barre City Council. The Citizens’ Voice identified three pressing issues facing city council and we asked the same question to each candidate.\Question one appears today, question two runs Tuesday and question three runs Wednesday.\Topic\Blighted and unkempt properties, potholes, and increased fees for garbage and recycling collection and downtown parking have been among the chief complaints raised by Wilkes-Barre residents at council meetings over the past few years. Mayor Tony George’s unsuccessful attempt last year to have the state declare the city financially distressed through Act 47 also was a subject of debate. Distressed status would have made the city eligible for a no-interest loan, able to limit concessions such as raises and benefits to budgeted amounts when bargaining union contracts, and at least temporarily impose or increase certain taxes that would be otherwise prohibited.\Question\What would you do to try to improve city finances and the quality of life in the city if elected?\--Mike Belusko (Incumbent, District A)\“I believe every resident deserves safe and clean streets, neighborhoods, parks and an overall presentable city.\The administration’s “Taking it to the Streets” program has shown some success and I encourage the administration to continue this worthy endeavor yearly if not more. This program not only increases the quality of life for residents but also brings in much needed revenue, further helping our great city.\I will also continue to respond to city residents’ issues regarding problems in their neighborhoods. As your councilman, the past three plus years I’ve been working for the quality of life we all deserve.”\-- Tony Brooks (Incumbent, District B)\“Increased job creation improves the quality of life and the city’s finances and should be the city’s number one goal along with providing services, security and public safety. Continued enforcement of the new “Quality of Life” ordinance and initiatives to bring residents together through the existing neighborhood associations and by creating additional neighborhood groups so people can work together with the city to improve neighborhoods. The current project with the Rolling Mill Hill Residents’ Association and the redevelopment of Spruce Street Park and the Downtown Residents’ Association collaboration with the restoration of the Zebulon Butler House are two examples of neighbors working together to improve quality of life. I will continue to recommend ideas that reduce expenses and increase revenue such as moving current 65 and over employees to Medicare, request workers to live in the city, and explore new collection agencies to collect on back fees and taxes.”\-- Mark Shaffer (District B)\“The first thing is to address our crumbling infrastructure. Damaged creeks threaten to flood our homes and poor roads damage our cars. Infrastructure investment addresses these concerns while also making us more competitive, drawing in business. New business means new jobs, meaning new earned income revenue for the city as well as a boost to local consumption.\Secondly, we must address the blighted properties and poor housing stock in the city. New policies like land banking can clean up these properties. The Lackawanna land bank in March celebrated clearing its 100th property in two years, we need to learn from this success.\Thirdly, we need to aggressively confront the opioid crisis by expanding services to addicts.”\-- Eugene Wallace (District B)\“Find the money to fix the main streets. Pennsylvania has the highest gas tax in the nation, but no funds to repair the chief roads. More should be like Pennsylvania Boulevard.”\-- Harry Cropp (District B)\“First, I would do my best to get all the citizens together. There’re not enough of us voicing ourselves at the city meetings, including myself. We have a diverse amount of races and religion in Wilkes-Barre. We should be out getting to know, help and learn new things from each other.\I wouldn’t take a penny to serve on council if I got elected. I would try to get the city to grow and dispense recreational marijuana. I would have most of the revenue help the elderly and veterans in our city. ”\-- Beth Gilbert (Incumbent, District C)\“I believe improving the quality of life in our city starts from the ground up. It is time the city applies for LSA grant money to fix our roads and to, quite literally, clean up our city. If we were awarded this funding, we could double our current efforts. I also believe in leading by example, which is why I hold cleanups monthly in my district throughout the Spring and Summer months.\I refuse to vote on a budget that does not include more funding for public safety, as this is an increasing issue in our city. Our police and fire departments need more resources to keep our residents safe.”\-- Bill Barrett (Incumbent, District D)\“The current council worked with the administration to recently create the “Quality of Life” ordinance which has vastly improved and expedited the process of handling blighted property complaints and issues. I would like the city to increase the number of health and code inspectors, which would allow us to further improve our efficiency in handling nuisance property complaints while simultaneously improving the quality of life.\City finances need to be a priority. The city has retained the services of a professional municipal finance management company and it is imperative that we follow their recommendations to ensure that we avoid Act 47 status. Although we are in a state of financial distress, I believe the negatives outweigh the positives of the Act 47 program, especially for residents and property owners. Act 47 could conceivably result in mandatory tax increases throughout the recovery period and may also simultaneously result in lower property values for everyone.”\-- Jeff Thomas (District C)\“As a councilman in Wilkes-Barre, my goal would be to make the city a more attractive destination for business and residents. Additionally, we must improve the quality of life in Wilkes-Barre for its current residents. This can be done by lowering crime rates, increasing employment opportunities and making the cost of living more affordable for families. We need to increase police presence in our neighborhoods. We need to incentivize businesses to locate in the city so that we can provide our residents with more job opportunities. We also have to assure taxpayers that we will not continually increase their taxes.”\--Linda Rowe (District C)\“Residents are voicing concerns about the state of neighborhoods and the city as a whole. We must ask, do people enjoy living in Wilkes-Barre? How do others view our community based upon opinions of residents? Do we provide an accurate portrayal of services, recreation and resources available? Are we supporting small businesses? Are city workers and administrators as committed to creating a safe, clean and welcoming environment as taxpayers? Are residents willing to invest to improve their homes?”\Creating an aggressive system of checks and balances, making sure that tax dollars are well spent, as well as seeking out grant opportunities to resolve pain points like blight, trash, vacant properties, without further burdening taxpayers, we’ll be on a road to increasing our tax base by creating a community in which people want to invest and reside.\-- Ryan Verdekal (District D)\“Make sure the city is actively collecting revenue - $750K in overdue recycling fees while Mayor (Tony) George wanted to hike the fee $10 is unacceptable. I would only vote yes for gaming grant projects that improve roads and neighborhoods and fight crime. We must improve the image of our city so more people from other areas want to come here to patronize our businesses and purchase homes. We don’t have a good image and it will take several years to fix it.”\-- John Marconi (District E)\“Review the ordinances to make sure they are up to date and expand them to cover more problems of blight. Strongly enforce the laws that are currently in place, and reach out to our crime watch and city resident associations for their complaints and input. Hold landlords, tenants and homeowners accountable for the conditions of their properties. Review costs involved in curbside cleanup. Bring back yearly hand sweeping of the city streets. Explore the cleaning of our catch basins. Search for grants to help with more funding for code enforcement. Search for grants, both private and governmental. Explore ways to cut costs across the city by working with council and the administration as a team. Check other municipalities on ideas to increase revenue. Look for new ways to increase revenue without tax increase. Research for a better process collecting overdue city fees. Hold people accountable.”\-- Jessica McClay (District E)\“If elected, I would improve the quality of life in the city by cleaning up our streets. Many of our streets are run down and uninviting. Not only are they uninviting for the city residents, they are unattractive to visitors.\I have visited many cities like ours and I always take notice of the streets. They are clean, well lit, and many have flowers at the entry points to the city. This may seem like something small but it shows that they care about the appearance of their city and it is inviting to visitors. I will also focus on blighted properties. Having abandoned properties brings increased crime into the neighborhoods. I believe cleaner neighborhoods will lead to safer neighborhoods and this will attract new business as well as residents. All of this will lead to a positive impact on the city finances.”\-- Tony C. Thomas (District E)\“Wilkes-Barre City Council needs to embrace using data as a means to study problem areas in our city. I support the creation of a problem property task force to target frequent violators of city code. One bad property can bring down an entire neighborhood. We need to work with state and federal law enforcement and health agencies to deal with the opioid crisis in our region. A two-fold approach of dealing with the criminal and health elements of opioid abuse would be a proactive approach to tackling an ever-growing issue. Improving quality of life will be one way of increasing city revenue over time. A better Wilkes-Barre means a place where people will want to become homeowners, become employed in and invest in. Initiatives to assist first-time home owners and small business owners are a necessity for improving Wilkes-Barre.”\Crédito: Staff report"
747,"
Work on the highway project that Finn M.W. Caspersen wanted is moving right along these days. And, if the weather holds, this $40 million widening of I-287 in Somerset County in central New Jersey should be done by the end of next year.
\
Oh, sure, Caspersen wasn't the only person who was frustrated over daily traffic tie-ups on the highway. But Gov. Whitman says lobbying by Caspersen and other corporate leaders helped persuade the state two years ago to accelerate work on the long-planned project.
\
``When he talks about what businesses need, I will certainly listen and take him seriously,'' said Whitman, who went to visit Caspersen when he threatened to move his company, Beneficial Management Corp., out of the state, partly because of traffic snarls in the area. ``It would be silly to say that you didn't have a higher level of concern when the talk is with someone who hires thousands of people.''
\
Caspersen looms large in the minds of politicians such as Whitman these days. And why shouldn't he? The portly banker is a major employer who makes thousands of dollars in contributions to candidates in state and federal elections.
\
He also raises large sums for Harvard University, where he went to law school, and counts its president, Neil Rudenstine, among his friends.
\
But Caspersen's chief allegiance appears to be to his business. While Whitman has named Caspersen co-chair of a group whose purpose is to promote New Jersey as a desirable place to do business, he says he would have no qualms about moving Beneficial Management to another state if he can get a better deal.
\
* In the last several months, Caspersen and his company have become one of the biggest players in the U.S. Senate race in New Jersey.
\
He, members of his family and Beneficial Management have so far contributed $21,000 to the campaign of U.S. Rep. Richard A. Zimmer (R., N.J.) in his battle against fellow Congressman Robert G. Torricelli, a Democrat, according to Federal Election Commission (FEC) records.
\
Caspersen, 55, who says he is a registered Independent, has lately favored Republican candidates, but he also has been a big supporter of Democrats. In 1992, he gave $50,000 to the Democratic National Committee, when President Clinton was running against George Bush.
\
A year later, he declined a request by representatives of candidate Whitman, who was running for governor against Jim Florio, for an endorsement of her tax-cut proposal.
\
``He said he could not be part of it because Florio was governor and he had to work with him,'' said one person who worked on the Whitman campaign. ``He never ventured an opinion; it was just a flat-out no.''
\
Caspersen's campaign contributions have made the soft-spoken executive one of the nation's top political fund-raisers.
\
But those contributions have also made him a controversial figure in New Jersey, drawing the ire of good-government groups that contend Caspersen's cash gives him outsized influence in the Statehouse and in Congress. He became the target of particularly sharp criticism last year when he joined with other business leaders in successfully pushing legislation that eliminated the use of student tuition for the New Jersey Public Interest Research Group's Trenton lobbying activities.
\
PIRG had alienated Caspersen and other business leaders by fighting highway expansion projects and pushing for tighter environmental laws.
\
``Because of the money, he has access to the administration in a way that other people do not,'' said Neil Upmeyer, executive director of the Center for the Analysis of Public Issues in Princeton, which tracks campaign giving in New Jersey. ``Other businessmen may have the same interests he has; he simply goes to the head of the line.''
\
The numbers are huge.
\
Since 1991, according to the FEC, Caspersen, members of his family and a Beneficial Management employees' political action committee gave more than $1.5 million to dozens of members of Congress.
\
Recently, much of that money has gone to lawmakers on the House Banking Committee, which handles legislation affecting his business.
\
In the meantime, Caspersen is, by one measure, the single largest individual campaign contributor in New Jersey elections.
\
According to a study by the Center for the Analysis of Public Issues, Caspersen gave more than any other person in the 1995 state Assembly races, the last statewide legislative election, spending $142,000 on Republican and Democratic candidates.
\
That made Caspersen fifth overall among big givers in New Jersey, behind such perennial powerhouses as the New Jersey Laborers PAC and Philip Morris USA, but ahead of Anheuser-Busch, the Medical Society of New Jersey and the Dental PAC.
\
``Finn's money follows power,'' said Tom Wilson, executive director of the New Jersey Republican Party. ``Every morning, he wakes up a businessman first and does what is in the best interest of his company, and that is why he is such a successful businessman.''
\
While Caspersen has become a symbol to such groups as New Jersey PIRG of what is wrong with the current campaign finance system, he also has admirers, who praise Caspersen for his substantial contributions to charities.
\
Rudenstine says that while Caspersen has steadily contributed funds to Harvard over the years, his assistance has gone beyond simply writing checks. Several years ago, Rudenstine said, he sat on several committees that re-evaluated graduate education at Harvard.
\
While granting that his campaign funds may result in access he wouldn't have otherwise, Caspersen denies that issues are decided in his favor simply because he gives politicians plenty of money. He says his goal is simply to support elected officials who promote economic development.
\
``I basically ask, `Do their policies promote a strong economy?' '' Caspersen said. ``I think it may give access, but then there is the question of how one uses that access.''
\
Caspersen has tended to operate behind the scenes for much of his career, unlike more visible business figures such as casino developer Donald Trump. But he took on a more high-profile role in 1994 when he threatened to move Beneficial and its 1,200 employees out of New Jersey, contending that worsening traffic congestion on I-287 had made it difficult for his employees to get to work.
\
In addition to improvements to eight miles of the highway, he also wanted help ironing out a dispute with the state Department of Environmental Protection over an application to greatly increase emissions from a cogeneration plant on the grounds of the office complex.
\
In response, the Whitman administration assured him that the widening of I-287 and other road projects in the area would be accomplished.
\
The administration also approved a new permit for Caspersen's cogeneration plant that nearly doubled allowable emissions of nitrous oxide, carbon monoxide and other pollutants from the facility. The DEP said the increased emissions were within state and federal limits.
\
The Whitman administration, while granting that Caspersen's threat to move his company helped accelerate its decision to move forward with I-287 improvements, said that no special favors were done for Caspersen and that work would have been done anyway.
\
Still, the negotiations prompted the PIRG to assert that Caspersen's huge campaign contributions had given him an edge.
\
Caspersen, for his part, says he had no edge and, in fact, got very little out of the deal.
\
``We got diddle for staying here; we can't even get a decent road here,'' he said. ``We got something, but compared to what you can get anyplace else, it was nothing.
\
``The perception is that, `well, they got some benefits' for staying in New Jersey,'' he said. ``And the answer I would submit is that we should have gotten a lot more benefits because we employ 1,200 people at an average salary of $35,000 to $40,000. These are exactly the kinds of jobs that New Jersey needs.''
\
* The source of Caspersen's cash is Beneficial, the nation's largest second-mortgage lender. The bulk of the company's business is making second-mortgage loans, but it also has banks, sells insurance, and issues credit cards.
\
As chairman and chief executive officer, Caspersen, who joined the company in the mid-1970s, is paid a base salary of $1 million a year, but can earn much more through performance bonuses. In addition, he and family members hold slightly more than 2 percent of the company's outstanding stock.
\
Caspersen, at the same time, is a major figure on the blue-blood social circuit of the Somerset Hills region, where he is building a 26,000-square-foot brick mansion with a wine cellar modeled after that of the medieval Italian winery of Martini & Rossi.
\
Caspersen's links to policy-makers go well beyond funding political campaigns. After taking office in 1994, Whitman asked Caspersen to serve as the co-chairman of Prosperity New Jersey, a public-private venture created by Whitman to encourage businesses to stay in New Jersey and to convince out-of-state businesses that they should relocate here.
\
Caspersen has contributed $183,000 to the venture. Caspersen also agreed to a request by Whitman in 1995 to set up the Coalition for Better Transportation, which promoted Whitman's plan to set aside gas-tax money for road improvements. The group raised $436,000 from paving contractors, engineering firms and others to pay for advertising and other activities to advance the plan.
\
To promote its views on banking and other issues, Beneficial employs several lobbying firms, which regularly weigh in on legislation.
\
Such was the case in 1992, when Beneficial successfully sought enactment of legislation that allowed second-mortgage lenders to charge points for the first time.
\
Caspersen and Beneficial also pushed legislation several years ago that would have lifted a restriction on campaign contributions by regulated industries. That prohibition, signed into law by former Gov. Woodrow Wilson in 1911, bars Beneficial and other tightly controlled industries, such as telecommunications and insurance companies, from making political campaign contributions.
\
The measure was released from committee but died in the Senate following a public uproar over the issue.
\
Last year, Caspersen took on PIRG, whose activism on environmental and consumer issues had earned the enmity of business groups, by backing legislation to end student funding of its lobbying activities.
\
Similar legislation had come up before in the New Jersey Legislature, but PIRG members say it took off once Caspersen got involved.
\
Andy Igrejas, a former PIRG organizer in New Jersey, says that Caspersen, who hadn't participated in other efforts to defund PIRG, sought to cut off funding for the group because of its opposition to a plan to widen I-287.
\
Caspersen grants that he was irked by PIRG's opposition to the road project, which included a high-occupancy-vehicle lane that he said would promote carpooling and would benefit the environment.
\
But he says he also opposed on philosophical grounds automatic funding for PIRG activities through student fees. Many students, he said, thought the fee was mandatory.
\
The bill was signed by Whitman last year.
\
Despite the fact that Caspersen serves as co-chairman of Prosperity New Jersey, he says he doesn't know whether the company will stay in New Jersey once the company's lease on its facilities in Peapack-Gladstone runs out in the year 2000.
\
He says he would like to stay, but will move his company if it turns out there are better business conditions elsewhere.

"
748,"
94th House District:
\
David Colon (D)
\
Kelly Henshaw (R)
\
Stan Saylor (R)
\
Our election page has more information about this race and the others that affect York County in 2014.
\
1. Two property tax reform bills were voted on last year in the House. House Bill 1189 from Rep. Seth Grove, R-Dover Township, gives each school district the choice to move from property tax to income and other taxes, passed the House and is awaiting approval from the Senate. House Bill 76, from Rep. Jim Cox, R-Berks County, would completely eliminate property taxes. However, the bill failed a vote in the House. Do you support either of these bills? Why or why not? If you don't support either of these bills, please explain your position on property tax reform.
\
Colon:Neither House Bills (HB) 1189 nor HB 76 provides a real solution to the problem, which is what Pennsylvanians are looking for. HB 1189 allows districts to lower property taxes in favor of wage taxes, which only shifts the tax burden from one class of individuals to another, in particular wage earners. Meanwhile, the Pennsylvania Independent Fiscal Office (IFO) analysis of HB 76 has projected that schools would receive $2.6 billion less in 2018 than what could be expected from the current system, a serious hurt to our educational system at the expense of eliminating property tax -- this is not a viable solution.
\
As a strong proponent of property tax relief, I will work across the aisle to bring relief to seniors, middle income families and all property owners by supporting a severance fee on Marcellus Shale drilling; not only can we cut property taxes but we can find money to restore the recent severe cuts to public education that have been carried out by Gov. Corbett.
\
This solution ensures students will receive a high quality education no matter where they live and could significantly reduce the burden of property tax for all Pennsylvanians.
\
Henshaw:I am a strong supporter of HB/SB 76, a clean, non-nonsense bill that will once and for all eliminate school property tax. In the past, anytime legislators reformed the tax we ended up paying more - and had other tax burdens added on. My opponent voted against the critical amendment that would have helped assure passage of HB76, even though with much ballyhoo, he had previously signed on as a co-sponsor of the bill. Every year in Pennsylvania, 10,000 families lose their homes because of property taxes. It is time to put an end to that tragedy.
\
Saylor:Property taxes continue to be a top issue facing many of us in York County. Despite record high education spending levels by the state, York's fast-paced growing population coupled with a flawed education funding formula, have driven property taxes to an unsustainable level. I support and have co-sponsored both House Bill 1189 and House Bill 76. I continue to support other measures to bring property tax relief to my constituents. This session the House finally had the opportunity to cast a vote for House Bill 76. It is important to note that for those who were listening to the debate and discussion of this bill on the floor of the House, the author of the bill, Rep. Jim Cox, confirmed to all of us that the projected revenue numbers generated by the bill did not meet the needed amounts to provide the property tax relief we all wanted. Since then, House Bill 1189 sponsored by Rep. Seth Grove offers property owners with a true form of property tax elimination but offers the added benefit of allowing York County to keep the local tax dollars generated in York County. York County cannot afford to send millions of dollars in taxes to Harrisburg to be unfairly distributed to other school districts like Philadelphia. Property tax elimination must be successfully achieved and I hope the Senate will quickly act on House Bill 1189.
\
2. Natural gas production from the state's Marcellus Shale formation has been a boon to gas companies who say the influx has kept prices low for consumers. In 2012, Pennsylvania enacted an impact fee on wells drilled into the shale. But analysts and groups such as the Pennsylvania Budget and Policy Center estimate the impact fee generates less revenue than a severance tax. Should natural gas drillers pay a severance tax? Or is the impact fee sufficient? Why or why not?
\
Colon:A reasonable severance fee will significantly increase the State revenue, with a nominal impact on the profit margin of the drilling company; therefore, it will not impact jobs. Pennsylvania has been blessed with an abundance of natural gas and we should guarantee that it is being drilled safely, efficiently and in an environmental friendly manner. However, we should not lose sight of the prospect of creating a statewide program that will develop renewable energy, new opportunities for business, create good paying jobs and improve national security by reducing dependency on foreign oil.
\
Henshaw:No. Anytime a business is taxed it is forced to make several moves, all of which hurt the consumer: (1) Pass on the costs to the consumer, making natural gas cost more on the backs of people that may be struggling to pay their energy bills now; (2) Drill less; (3) Lay people off and/or go to other states to extract gas.
\
Saylor:Democrats and Democrat think-tanks find taxation to be the easy answer to all our budgetary problems. The natural gas impact fee in Pennsylvania has added over $2 billion in taxes to our state revenues since 2008. Suggestions that the industry is only paying impact fees is simply not true. In fact, companies are paying the personal income taxes, sales and use tax, liquid fuels tax and a corporate net income tax at a much higher rate than other states who impose the severance tax. York County, despite being hundreds of miles from the natural gas region, received $365,749.59 from this natural gas impact fee. The impact fee has worked to protect the environment, develop infrastructure and spur job growth. Jobs, not only at the site of the drilling, but thousands of jobs in manufacturing, welding and engineering are being created here in York and across the state.
\
3. Last year, the state Legislature approved a $2.3 billion transportation bill paid for by increased motorist fines, fees, and a gas tax that made its way down to drivers in the state. Did you support the approved funding plan? Why or why not? If you did not support the funding plan, how would you have funded the necessary infrastructure repairs in Pennsylvania?
\
Colon:Pennsylvania's roads and bridges are certainly a major priority and I am supportive with the intent of the bill. Although, I would have liked to see far less tax increases than have been included in the law, I may have been able to accept most of them if the bill had not been tied to a cut in the prevailing wage.
\
Henshaw:I am against this transportation bill because the legislators will not use 100 percent of the money to fix the bridges and roads, a problem I agree needs to be addressed. Some money will be funneled to Philadelphia and Pittsburgh to subsidize their failing mass transit systems at the expense of the vast majority of Pennsylvanians who will never use them. Transportation money is also used for rail trail and beautification projects throughout the state. When your roof is leaking, you don't remodel your basement. The taxes on gas and diesel for which my opponent voted are now the highest in the nation and will drive up costs to the consumer for all goods and services. The fact is, if we properly allocate the transportation funding now available, there will be sufficient money to fix the bridges and roads now needing repair.
\
Saylor:The vote for transportation funding was one I wrestled with and in the end voted in favor of the bill. The issue was a struggle to balance cost to the taxpayers with the safety and security of those same citizens traveling on our roads and bridges. This was not an easy vote for me nor one I made quickly without weighing the financial and safety impact my vote would have upon my constituents. Yes, the bill will bring about significant job growth to our region. Yes, Republicans were finally able to push through a small increase to the prevailing wage which was greatly needed. And yes, York County and the 94th legislative district will see several dramatic improvements to our transportation network. But in the end, as I was updated on the deteriorating conditions of our roads and bridges and listened to the stories of congestion and tragic fatalities,safety continued to be my utmost concern. This is one example of legislation that no matter how one voted, you would be criticized. I fully accept that as my role as state representative. I understand the cost of the bill is a concern; however, I could not have accepted what would have happened had I voted no on the bill and a bridge collapsed like the one the nation witnessed in Minnesota. I can live with my vote on transportation, but I could not have accepted being blamed for being irresponsible and not taking the necessary steps to protect our citizens. I sided with my conscience and the safety of constituents.
\
4. In January, a bill was introduced by state senators Daylin Leach and Mike Folmer that would allow the use of medical marijuana in Pennsylvania. The bill was subsequently the subject of a Senate committee hearing on the issue. Should Pennsylvania legalize medical and/or recreational marijuana? Why or why not?
\
Colon:I would support the compassionate use of medical cannabis, as long as it is well controlled, regulated and prescribed by a doctor.
\
Henshaw:I am in favor of allowing doctors to prescribe medical marijuana in an oil form to be available at a pharmacy as with other controlled narcotics.
\
Saylor:I am not supportive of the recreational use of marijuana nor am I supportive of adopting legislation to decriminalize, at the state level, its use for medicinal purposes. I have discussed this issue with various medical professionals and as one would expect, I continue to hear mixed information about both the benefits and harmful effects of the drug. Regardless of any conflicting studies or reports, drug safety should be at the center of any decision made on the issue. I am a firm believer in that every narcotic taken by you or a loved one must be subjected to a thorough review by the United States Food and Drug Administration. I do not support any quick acceptance of drugs by the General Assembly that are not supported or approved by the FDA. The federal agency is there for various drugs to undergo a tremendous approval process. The decision to authorize drugs should be left to the best and brightest in our medical fields without the influence of special interest groups.
\
5. What would be your other priorities if elected, and why should voters support you?
\
Colon:My top goals are to work for the best interests of seniors, middle-income families and small business. I am a strong believer that the foundations of a successful economy are a climate that encourages and supports small businesses and public education that provides a quality education for all our children.
\
Henshaw:We must get the state pension system under control before it bankrupts the state. The day my opponent joined with other career politicians in Harrisburg in a vote to increase his own pension by 50 percent, the system was already $10 billion in the red. Now it is over $47 billion in the red with no sign of recovery. This is a large factor contributing to our school property tax increasing at an alarming rate. We must move all newly hired employees into a defined, 401K-type contribution plan. My pledge to the voters is that I will not take the state pension. It is unconstitutional! In article 2, section 8 states that legislators will receive a salary and mileage reimbursement as compensation and nothing else. And that is all I or any other legislator should receive.
\
Saylor:The last four years have focused on economic development and recovery. After facing a $4 billion deficit by Governor Rendell, I worked to make the tough decisions to reduce wasteful spending, reduce welfare fraud, prioritize the true responsibilities of government and stop the government from tying the hands of small businesses and families so they can grow the economy and prosper. Next session, my priorities will remain geared toward fiscal responsibility and spending within our means. As our economy is turning around, I will be pushing for tax reform so families and hardworking individuals will be able to reduce their own tax burdens, which will increase the paychecks they take home. If the Senate fails to act upon the property tax elimination bill we passed in the House, I will get this at the top of the list for legislative action. I will continue to lead the efforts in fighting against welfare fraud and the continual expansion of public handouts. Last and equally important, my record for having an open door to all of my constituents and my eagerness to help them cut through the red tape of government is at the heart of my desire to continue serving and working for the people of the 94th legislative district.

749,"Cash-strapped governments around the country that are reluctant to raise taxes are increasingly plunging forward with bold experiments: enlisting investment banks, pension funds and other eager investors to fund billions of dollars of highway, bridge and other infrastructure projects. \In Chicago, then-Mayor Richard M. Daley plugged a short-term budget gap in 2009 by turning over 36,000 metered parking spaces for 75 years to a private venture organized by Morgan Stanley. With little information and little time to analyze the transaction, Chicago's city council overwhelmingly embraced the deal and its upfront payment of $1.2 billion. \At about the same time, then-Pittsburgh Mayor Luke Ravenstahl had considered a $452 million plan to rehabilitate his city's woefully underfunded pension plans by privatizing parking. City council members rejected it. \Based on Chicago's experience, it's probably just as well Pittsburgh didn't go that route. \Escalating meter rates and longer meter enforcement hours are just the start of Chicago's problems. Six months after Chicago inked the deal, the city's inspector general conservatively estimated the city received $974 million less from the 75-year lease than it would have received by keeping the meters and operating them under the same terms it gave to the investors. \Moreover, terms of the parking meter lease and the 99-year, $563 million lease of four city parking garages to another Morgan Stanley partnership in 2006 require the city to compensate the private operators for meter revenue lost when Chicago takes actions that crimp revenue. Those actions include closing streets for festivals or parades, creating lanes for buses or bicycles, or allowing someone to build a competing parking garage. \So far, the operators have billed the city for $61 million in reimbursement. \Just how much more it costs motorists to park now is evident in the private operator's results. While the meters collected about $24 million in the last year the city operated them, last year they took in $135.6 million, generating a $43.6 million profit for the Morgan Stanley investors. \Chicago's experience illustrates many of the issues that can occur when governments rely on public-private partnerships, or P3s. The long-term agreements are so complex that government officials often times do not realize what they are agreeing to, critics contend. They can result in unanticipated costs and limit a government's ability to serve the public interest. \While greater private sector involvement offers the promise of delivering more efficient infrastructure sooner and at a more affordable price, critics say the widespread use of federally backed loans makes the relationship less private than advertised and puts taxpayers at risk. \Nevertheless, Pennsylvania and other states increasingly are turning to P3s as a way to supplement limited public funding and deliver more thoughtfully designed roads, bridges and other infrastructure. \Over the next four days, the Post-Gazette will examine why states are pursuing public-private partnerships, what kinds of projects they are undertaking, the private sector players involved, and whether the partnerships are living up to their potential. \In the P3 business \Public-private partnerships are the intersection where investors eager to cash in on America's $3.6 trillion infrastructure needs collide with taxpayers and elected officials unwilling or unable to provide the money. P3s are based on long-term agreements that turn over to the private sector infrastructure traditionally built and operated by the public sector. \They are government by another name. \While P3s are common in other parts of the world, they have been slow to catch on in the United States, much to the chagrin of investors eager to provide the funds. But that's changing. \Texas, Virginia, Florida and other states are using such partnerships to build toll roads to relieve urban congestion. Indiana and Kentucky are partnering with private investors to build bridges over the Ohio River. A P3 was used to erect a $495 million court house in Long Beach, Calif., where private investors will operate the state-owned building for 35 years. \Denver is using a P3 to build a commuter rail line. Maryland wants to do the same in its Washington, D.C., suburbs. On the other side of Washington's Beltway, a $2 billion ""managed"" lane P3 project allows Fairfax County, Va., commuters to avoid Interstate 495 traffic jams by using express lanes where tolls vary based on the speed of traffic. In Baltimore, a P3 accelerated expansion of a terminal at the state port, enabling it to accommodate the larger ships expected to move through the Panama Canal starting in 2016. \Pennsylvania, after rejecting proposals to privatize the turnpike and state lottery, is getting into the P3 business. Legislation enacted in 2012 allows the state Department of Transportation to enter into public-private partnerships. The first major project involves hiring a consortium to build and maintain about 600 state bridges for about 30 years. \Underlying the debate is the fact that P3s allow government officials to avoid being blamed for raising taxes, tolls and making other unpopular decisions to generate the $3.6 trillion that the American Society of Civil Engineers estimates is needed by 2020 to restore the nation's roads, bridges, airports and other infrastructure. \""It's really about a political unwillingness to do what is necessary,"" U.S. Rep. Michael Capuano, D-Mass., said at the March hearing. ""As a former city councilman, mayor and congressman, none of us like raising taxes. ... Let's be honest about what this is."" \'Magic pixie dust' \President Ronald Reagan's plea to ""get government off our backs"" inspired a mistrust of government's ability to efficiently provide roads, schools and other vital services at a cost taxpayers can afford. Mr. Reagan encouraged the belief that the private sector can do a better job. The result was replacing government workers with private sector workers who mow lawns around government buildings, collect trash, operate school cafeterias and buses, and provide other services under government contracts. \P3s are more far-reaching undertakings than hiring private companies as contractors. They involve turning over infrastructure to private investors who can design it, finance it, build it, operate it and maintain it. \The ventures are attractive to cash-starved governments, which sometimes get hefty upfront payments. Even when they don't, investor funds enable governments to take on projects they might not otherwise be able to afford. The deals also fit many taxpayers' notions about cutting waste, eliminating bureaucracy, and running government more like a business. \""P3s are one of the better tools we have out there for addressing a need, and that need is a lack of state and predominantly federal funding,"" said Rodger Rochelle of North Carolina's Department of Transportation. \That state recently approved $655 million plans to add 26 miles of toll lanes along a heavily traveled stretch of I-77 near Charlotte. Cintra, a Spanish infrastructure firm, leads a group that will design, build, operate and maintain the lanes under a 50-year lease. Cintra's other P3 projects include the Indiana Toll Road and State Highway 130, a Texas toll road that recently defaulted on bank debt. \Many believe the transportation funding deficit stems from Congress' failure to raise the gas tax that supports the highway trust fund. \The tax has been 18.4 cents per gallon since 1993. Cars have become more fuel efficient since then, with fuel economy increasing 5.5 miles per gallon since 2007, according to the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute. The institute also documented that the distance driven by motor vehicles each year peaked in 2004 and has declined since, further crimping revenue from the tax. \Rather than anger constituents by raising the tax, Congress has dipped into general funds, used pension accounting gimmicks and relied on stop-gap measures that don't provide a long-term solution to the funding shortfall. \""When you want to raise revenue beyond what the public would accept, you do it in a P3 contract. You can say the privatizer is the evil one because they're charging too much,"" said Cornell University's Mildred Warner, a critic of privatization. \In an environment where tax increases can be career-ending events for elected officials, ""P3s are kind of a magic pixie dust,"" said Phineas Baxandall, senior analyst for U.S. PIRG, a coalition of state consumer watchdogs that is critical of such deals. \Investor opportunity \The public funding shortfall ""presents institutional investors with an unprecedented opportunity,"" Standard & Poor's wrote in a January report. Pension funds, foundations and other institutional investors like P3s because they can generate predictable, long-term returns no matter what happens to the economy or inflation. \Investors have provided an estimated $200 biIlion to fund more than 100 U.S. infrastructure projects, according to investment research firm Prequin. Investors in infrastructure funds organized in 2010 have realized median returns of 14.9 percent, the company said. Infrastructure funds have outperformed private equity funds since 2008, Prequin said. \P3 investors include government pension funds. Camelot Global Services, the British company that offered Pennsylvania more than $34 billion for the chance to operate the state lottery for 20 years, is owned by the Ontario Teachers Pension Plan. Pension plans covering Dallas police and firefighters invested in a $2.9 billion, 52-year P3 that built 13 miles of tolls lanes near the Texas city. \Financing for P3s comes from a mix of government and private funds and includes cash and debt, including billions in low-cost, federally guaranteed loans that P3 operators can use. How much each party puts in and how long the agreement lasts depends on how the deal is structured. \Private investors like longer agreements because they supply a cushion should revenue fall short of projections. Agreements lasting 50 years or longer provide tax benefits that sweeten investor profits. Another factor is how risk - from cost overruns, construction delays, revenue shortfalls and other potential problems - is divided between the public and private sector. The riskier a P3, the more cash private investors generally have to contribute. \The agreements detail how often and how much private operators can raise tolls and parking rates, at what point the government receives a cut of the profits, and how well the project must perform. \Performance-based P3s call for investors to receive government funds only when a project is completed and payments based on standards included in the agreement. Because private investors want to ensure return on their investment, the agreements specify when they are to be reimbursed for government actions that threaten their revenue - provisions that haunt Chicago officials. \Another figure that investors rely on is projected revenue. Texas' State Highway 130, which defaulted on about $686 million in loans on June 30, is not the only P3 where traffic forecasts exceeded reality. \""Optimistic projections falling short is a bit too common in this space,"" said R.J. Gallo, head of Federated Investors' municipal bond investment group. \Terms of the deals \Because of the complexity of concession agreements, negotiating terms can take months as each side seeks to identify problems that could occur over the decades-long life of the project and protect themselves from those risks. A cottage industry of consultants, attorneys, financial experts, lobbyists and public relations professionals has sprung up. A November meeting about Pennsylvania's P3 bridge project drew representatives from nearly 150 engineering and construction companies, investment banks, law firms and other organizations. \Many feel governments are at a disadvantage in negotiating long-term deals because private industry can better afford the high-priced expertise. \""The knowledge level of the private side is so far above the knowledge level of the folks at state departments of transportation, well above the level of state lawmakers, and well, well above the knowledge level of the average voter and motorist out there,"" said lobbyist Ryan Bowley of the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association, which represents professional truckers hard hit by toll increases on P3 roads. \The Government Accountability Office concluded in 2008 that state governments aren't capable of providing the proper oversight. \One of the problems, critics contend, is the lack of public information about terms before agreements are approved and, in some cases, the rush to approve them. Chicago's City Council only had a few days to consider the parking meter deal. Privatization of the Indiana Toll Road was also approved after a short debate. \""Everybody had a deer-in-the-headlights look,"" Indiana state Rep. Terri Austin told the House Transportation committee at a February hearing. \Earlier this year, a group of Colorado lawmakers and a clean energy group protested after lawmakers and the public were not allowed to review terms of a 50-year P3 involving U.S. Highway 36 near Denver. \Officials of the Colorado Department of Transportation withheld details, saying they did not want to reveal proprietary information to competitors of Plenary Group, the Australian infrastructure developer leading the investor group that was awarded the concession. \The claim that some terms should remain confidential bothers Lee Cokorinos. The Silver Spring, Md., public interest research consultant describes it as ""the biggest loophole for proper vetting."" Columbia University professor Elliott Sclar, a P3 critic, agrees. \""If it's such a good deal, why do they have to hide all of this? That's a warning flag,"" he said."
750,"
As the United States takes its first tentative steps toward high-speed rail travel, the initial hurdle is the biggest: money.
\
In the past, the nation's enthusiasm for fast trains has always evaporated when sticker shock set in. Political support has been inconsistent and ephemeral, leaving previous efforts to die amid debates over ridership, land acquisition, and cost - especially cost.
\
This time, politicians and railroaders believe the momentum is greater than ever to actually build and operate high-speed lines in the United States.
\
They compare planned U.S. rail projects to the transformational development of the interstate highway system more than 50 years ago, and they cite polls that show Americans more receptive to paying for the economic and environmental benefits that fast trains can bring.
\
The success or failure of the first line in the United States may decide the fate of U.S. high-speed rail. An expensive bust could kill plans elsewhere, while a technical and financial success could create demand for more, as it did in Europe.
\
""We have to show the traveling public that this is real, and let them experience it,"" said Joseph C. Szabo, administrator of the Federal Railroad Administration, who will issue a new national rail plan next month. ""The doubters won't be convinced until they can touch it, see it, ride it."" President Obama has made high-speed rail a priority of his administration. To tout its benefits, he and Vice President Biden went to Tampa, Fla., where the first U.S. high-speed tracks may be laid.
\
""We want to start looking deep into the 21st century, and we want to say to ourselves, there is no reason why other countries can build high-speed rail lines and we can't,"" Obama said to loud applause on the day after his State of the Union address. ""And that's what's about to happen right here in Tampa - we are going to start building a new high-speed rail line - building for the future, putting people to work.""
\
Obama cited construction jobs. Manufacturing jobs. Cleaner air. Less gridlock. Reduced dependence on foreign oil. And no herding in airport security lines, with all its attendant little indignities: ""I mean, those [trains] are fast, they are smooth. And you don't have to take off your shoes.""
\
He brought with him the promise of $1.25 billion to help build a $3.2 billion, 84-mile Tampa-to-Orlando high-speed line that could be the nation's first.
\
He also announced $6.75 billion more for 29 other rail projects in 30 states. The plans ranged from true high-speed rail corridors, as in Florida and California, to less ambitious efforts to upgrade existing Amtrak service, as in Pennsylvania and the Midwest.
\
For the first time, U.S. high-speed rail was getting the one thing it had always lacked: cash.
\
Andy Kunz, president of the U.S. High Speed Rail Association, says his lobbying has gotten easier as public support has grown and other forms of transportation have become less attractive.
\
""Airlines are such a nightmare now, and highways are so congested,"" Kunz said. ""High-speed rail is actually an easy sell, especially for anyone who has been to Europe or Japan.""
\
""It all comes down to how much money we throw at it,"" he said.
\
U.S. Rep. John Mica of Florida, the ranking Republican on the House Transportation Committee, noted that some European lines cost from $25 billion to $40 billion to build.
\
""That's not out of line with what we're talking about here,"" Mica said. ""We'll never get these projects done at a better cost than now.""
\
Art Guzzetti, the vice president of policy for the American Public Transportation Association, said public support - and public money - would be crucial for high-speed rail.
\
""We're not going to get these built without public involvement, and we should not expect it to be otherwise,"" said Guzzetti.
\
""The whole country needs to feel engaged in this. We need to connect high-speed rail to other issues that are overarching, such as energy, environment, mobility, and jobs.""
\
Robert Yaro, an urban planning professor at the University of Pennsylvania and president of the Regional Plan Association, a New York-area research group, said high-speed rail was the only reasonable response to the nation's congested highways and skyways.
\
""The only other answer is to build more lanes on I-95, and I don't think that's going to happen, do you? Or we could build lots of new runways at O'Hare and Newark and JFK. I don't think that's going to happen. . . . We're out of airspace.""
\
Yaro said the hundreds of billions required ""is the kind of money that other countries are spending. This is what the rest of the world is doing. . . . This is what we have to do.""
\
In just four U.S. cities, high-speed rail development could create 150,000 jobs and $19 billion in new business in the next 25 years, according to a report for the U.S. Conference of Mayors issued in June.
\
The report looked at Orlando, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Albany, N.Y., and concluded: ""Results particularly point to an increased economic payback when intercity travel time is under three hours.""
\
Frank Nero, president of the Beacon Council, a business group pushing for high-speed rail in Florida, said: ""Most of our people haven't tried it, so they don't know if they will like it.
\
""People here have the view that trains are a romantic, old form of transportation. They don't view it as a modern, futuristic way of transportation.
\
""We need to make the case that it's not just a great way to go on vacation, but that it will sustain our economy.""
\
The federal government, since 1991, has designated 10 corridors for high-speed rail development, including the Philadelphia-Harrisburg-Pittsburgh ""Keystone Corridor."" Those 10 corridors don't include the most heavily traveled one, the Northeast Corridor between Washington and Boston.
\
With the exception of Florida and California, the corridor plans call for incremental steps to speed up existing service, rather than installing true high-speed service with trains traveling at more than 155 m.p.h.
\
Such incremental ""higher-speed"" development is much cheaper, allowing passenger trains to share tracks with freight and commuter trains.
\
But it does not allow for the full advantages European or Japanese-style high-speed rail offers, such as dramatic travel-time savings that can make trains competitive with airplanes on trips of up to 600 miles.
\
Eventually, ""higher-speed"" U.S. corridors could be upgraded to true high-speed service, with separate tracks and state-of-the-art signal systems.
\
Experience in Europe and Asia shows that, with enough passengers, high-speed rail lines can be operated profitably. But the lines generally require taxpayer funds to build.
\
So, the old questions remain: How much will the lines cost, and where will the money come from?
\
""These are expensive ventures,"" said Jack Short, secretary-general of the International Transport Forum, a transportation think tank in Paris. ""The $8 billion won't go far, will it?""
\
The average cost of construction for a high-speed line in Europe is $24 million to $60 million per mile, according to the International Union of Railways.
\
Spain is devoting $150 billion over 10 years for its burgeoning high-speed rail network, about 1 percent of its gross domestic product. China spent $88 billion in the last year alone.
\
""These are big, expensive projects that take years to complete,"" said Petra Todorovich, director of America 2050, an urban-planning organization in New York City. ""They're not for the impatient.""
\
She said ""$10 billion a year would be a good start, but it's not enough.""
\
She estimated the cost of a U.S. high-speed network at $500 billion to $1 trillion over the next 40 years.
\
Eric Peterson, president of the American High Speed Rail Alliance, estimated the cost at perhaps $1 trillion in current dollars.
\
The $8 billion committed by the Obama administration is ""pretty laughable,"" U.S. Rep. Peter DeFazio (D., Ore.), a member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, told a recent meeting of the Coalition for America's Gateways and Trade Corridors, a trade group that advocates for more federal spending on freight infrastructure. ""China will spend that much in eight weeks,"" added his colleague Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D., Ore.).
\
China, planning to spend $100 billion a year on high-speed rail, touts its ability to take advantage of previous development by the Europeans and Japanese.
\
""It's an advantage of the latecomer. We are late, but we achieve big,"" Chen Juemin, director-general of China's Ministry of Railways' international cooperation department, told the official newspaper Renmin Ribao last month.
\
A recent report by Duke University researchers estimated the number of jobs rail spending would create: 24,000 construction and manufacturing jobs per $1 billion in capital investment, and 41,000 operation and maintenance jobs per $1 billion in operating investment.
\
Most of the construction money for high-speed rail is likely to be a federal responsibility, with states and regions on the hook for perhaps 20 percent of the costs.
\
Once the lines are built, private or public entities could operate the trains, with taxpayer subsidies if fares and other revenues fail to cover the costs.
\
Opponents of high-speed rail argue the cost is too high, especially when the nation struggles to recover from a recession. Some contend it is unfair to ask taxpayers who will never use the service to help pay for it; others argue that unending subsidies will be required to operate the service.
\
Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal refused in September to pursue $300 million in federal funds for a high-speed rail project between New Orleans and Baton Rouge because state taxpayers could be responsible for annual operating and maintenance costs.
\
In California, Kris Vosburgh, executive director of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, decried that state's planned $45 billion high-speed rail line as ""just an extravagance that very few people are likely to use. . . . We are hearing extravagant promises, but this is just going to run us deeper into debt.""
\
Others object to proposed rail routes since they involve the seizure of private or public land for construction.
\
Airlines in the United States, aware of the impact of high-speed rail on air travel in Europe as well as America's historic reluctance to develop high-speed rail, have been cautious in their response.
\
""I don't know what the airline industry will look like when high-speed rail is built. We haven't taken a position other than to point out that the transportation-funding priority should be on the modernization of our air-traffic-control system,"" said David A. Castelveter, spokesman for the Air Transport Association of America. ""If there's a way to do both on parallel tracks, so be it.""
\
A recent analysis by the U.S. Government Accountability Office concluded that building high-speed rail service in this country ""is a difficult, multiyear effort"" that hinges on financing that goes ""far beyond the funds provided by the Recovery Act in a time of continuing federal and state deficits.""
\
The GAO also noted that states would have to cooperate with one another and with freight railroads, and that the Federal Railroad Administration would have to ""transform itself from essentially a rail-safety organization to one that can make multibillion-dollar investment choices"" while still taking care of its original responsibilities.
\
In Washington, 106 members of the House in April asked Obama to support spending $50 billion over the next six years on high-speed rail. The lawmakers asked the president to help develop a dedicated source of revenue so funding would not depend on annual budget negotiations.
\
The administration and Congress are looking to make dedicated funding of high-speed rail part of the next federal transportation reauthorization bill, which is expected to be put together in the next year.
\
Among the possible ways to pay for high-speed rail:
\
Gas taxes. The federal gas tax has been 18.4 cents per gallon since 1993. It pays for building and maintaining the nation's interstate highways. States also levy gas taxes. The taxes could be increased and tied to inflation, based on the argument that motorists would benefit from reduced traffic congestion.
\
Highway tolls. Most highway tolls are levied by states. New tolls could be added, or existing tolls increased.
\
Sales taxes. Many states and local governments have used sales taxes to pay for transportation projects that are seen as benefiting local residents.
\
Regional payroll taxes. A tax could be placed on businesses in regions served by high-speed rail, similar to the current tax levied on payrolls by New York's Mass Transportation Authority.
\
Rail-passenger surcharges. A charge could be added to the cost of every rail ticket. Since most rail passengers are now in the Northeast, they would bear the heaviest burden of such a tax.
\
Freight fees. A charge could be levied on trucking and railroad shipments or containers, with the argument that shippers benefit from reduced highway or rail congestion.
\
Driver-related fees. States could levy higher driver's license fees, registration fees, auto-rental fees, or other motorist-related charges.
\
Private financing can be part of the picture, if investors are convinced they will get a return on the money they put into building or operating high-speed rail systems.
\
To attract that private investment, high-speed rail in the United States would have to offer investors something it never has in the past: stability.
\
Previous U.S. flops in Florida and Texas have demonstrated the risks of putting money into fast-train projects without assurances of long-term support.
\
""This country and the idea of high-speed rail is competing against a lot of investment opportunities around the world,"" said George Bilicic, vice chairman of investment banking and global head of power, energy, and infrastructure for the Lazard investment bank. ""You have to have stability of revenue.""
\
Government can provide that stability by assuring that projects move forward and attract the necessary ridership, Bilicic said at a recent high-speed rail forum in Florida.
\
""The government has to decide what social good is being served,"" he said.
\
Revenue will come from fares, and fares will come from passengers, so accurate forecasts of ridership are crucial to financial success.
\
If ridership is underestimated, there won't be enough trains to handle the passengers, potential revenue will be lost, and would-be riders will be disaffected. If ridership is overestimated, too many expensive trains will be purchased and crews hired, and millions of dollars will be wasted.
\
""With a new line, within three months you know if it is a success - you know if the traffic is there or not,"" said Michel Leboeuf, one of the creators of the TGV high-speed trains in France. ""If you can react within the first three months, it's very important. We saw that on our earlier lines.""
\
Leboeuf, who is now director of SNCF Voyages, overseeing long-distance passenger projects in France and abroad, said it is crucial to be able to alter fares quickly to react to airline competition or to unexpected changes in ridership: ""The first year is very important.""

751,"Scott Wagner entered full campaign mode Tuesday after resigning his state Senate seat Monday to focus on the governor’s race.\Wagner, 62, of York, was scheduled to speak Tuesday to the Pennsylvania Chamber of Commerce about Pennsylvania’s unemployment rate, which at 4.7 percent is higher than the national rate of 3.8 percent.\He is scheduled Wednesday to visit Philadelphia. On Saturday, he pledged to cut the grass at Malcolm X Park, which had become overgrown, if Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney didn’t get it cut. The grass has been cut since then, despite problems with a contractor, a park representative said Tuesday.\Wagner plans to visit the park anyway “to ensure they did a satisfactory job,” his spokesman said in an email Tuesday.\Wagner won election to the state Senate through a write-in campaign in 2014 and won re-election the same year.\His decision to resign Monday to run full-time for governor drew criticism from his fall opponent, Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf, whose campaign said it showed Wagner is “only interested in furthering himself politically.”\State GOP Chairman Val DiGiorgio approved of the decision, saying Wagner’s best chance at fixing the “broken” aspects of state government would come if he were elected governor.\Wagner’s prepared remarks on the Senate floor Monday totaled more than 2,400 words. They appear below in their entirety:\“Good afternoon – Mr. President.\I want to thank you for giving me this opportunity to make some remarks.\As many of you know, today is my last day here in the Senate.\My decision to leave the Senate was a tough decision.\I weighed each side of my decision with counsel from trusted advisors to determine first and foremost what was best for the constituents from the 28th Senate District.\Serving here in the Senate, and serving alongside so many of you, has been an honor that I will forever be grateful to have had.\Before I go any further with my remarks there are some people I want to thank.\First of all, I want to thank the people of the 28th Senate District for writing in my name at the election polls on March 18th of 2014.\I didn’t get elected into the state Senate the traditional way.\It was through an unprecedented campaign, where over 10,000 people came out to write in my name on to their ballots and send me to Harrisburg.\I will never forget the historic manner in which I was elected to this position.\I want to thank my staff for their tireless work on behalf of all the people of our district.\You know each and every one of us are the faces of the office, but it is the staff that puts forth the day to day effort to execute and take care of the constituents.\They don’t get the credit they deserve and I want to thank them again for all they do.\Over the last four years I also noticed something that some people would not normally recognize – somewhere between 30 and 50 percent of the people who arranged to meet with me or my staff were not from the 28th Senate District – in almost every case we scheduled the meeting and had informative discussions.\I need to thank my family, including my wife Tracy.\When Tracy and I started dating in 2010 I don’t think she expected this would be our life.\Nonetheless, she has been supportive beyond belief and I am looking forward to the entire state getting to know her more.\I want to thank my leaders, President Pro Tempore Scarnati and Majority Leader Corman for their help along the way.\Our caucus and our state couldn’t have a better leader than Senator Corman, and I am grateful for his guidance, his counsel, and most of all his friendship.\A special thanks to my fellow caucus members for their patience, their support, and their willingness to welcome me into the caucus.\And to my friends on the other side of the aisle, although we have had our disagreements, we’ve also been able to work together on so many things.\I’m proud of our work on things like the Clean Slate Bill, where I partnered up with my friend and colleague Senator Tony Williams to end the prison to poverty pipeline.\I’m proud of my work with Senator Pat Browne to try to end discrimination.\I’m proud of all of our work to make sure hard working Pennsylvanians get a boost, and to break the cycle of poverty through education reform.\I also want to acknowledge the efforts and leadership of Senator Gene Yaw for leading the Senate’s effort to combat the opioid and heroin epidemic.\To both the Republican and Democratic Senators, I am looking forward to working with you again in a few months.\At this time, I would like to do a reflection on my time in the Senate.\Before I joined the Senate in 2014 I was a complete outsider and I had a very strong opinion of Harrisburg.\I first ran for the Senate because I believed that Harrisburg wasn’t working for the folks who work every day and the people that employ them.\I came to Harrisburg with a strong personality and a strong will to get things accomplished.\I’ll admit that I wish I would have given more thought to some of the things I said when I first took office.\But I’m the type of person, when I dive into projects that I know need close attention and present opportunities, I become very driven and sometimes overly passionate.\If I have offended people inside this chamber, other people in the building or state government, I offer my apology.\When I first got to Harrisburg I immediately noticed several glaring problems.\Pennsylvania does not have a revenue problem, it has spending and mismanagement problem.\Harrisburg operates at a snail’s pace – crisis issues take way too long find resolutions.\The best example would be the heroin opioid crisis – how long did it take to get the prescription drug database reporting system passed and implemented?\I report to my colleagues today that I had orthoscopic knee surgery twelve days ago and after my surgery I was given a prescription by the surgeon for pain – an opioid prescription.\Out of curiosity, I asked my surgeon if his office was required to enter my prescription into the prescription drug database.\He responded that he hadn’t.\My pain level has been low until yesterday, so I went to a large chain pharmacy to fill my prescription and I asked the shift supervising pharmacist about the drug data base and reporting my prescription – and the answer was not clear if he had done so.\So I walked away without clarity of the protocol.\Why do I tell this story?\Because passing a law is only a first step.\We need to follow up on the work we do and make sure that what we enact is being carried out properly.\But what we do here isn’t always about how many laws we’re able to pass or bills we can introduce.\I’ve said from day one, I didn’t come here to create more laws.\I came to change the culture.\I’d like to think that my time here in the Senate has put some of that change in motion.\I had the honor of serving as the Chairman of the Senate Urban Affairs and Housing Committee in 2015 and 2016.\In August of 2015, the Urban Affairs and Housing Committee held hearings in Greene and Fayette counties.\The morning of the hearings our committee was given a tour of the City of Monessen and Donora Borough with elected officials to see firsthand high levels of blight.\We had a very informative tour of both Monessen and Donora, the hearings were well attended and I had the opportunity to meet good people, who were asking for help to solve the blight issues in their community.\We heard from person after person who said that their area was forgotten, that their area was left for dead and that there was little hope.\And it affected me.\I went home and told Tracy about it and I felt helpless.\That wasn’t the only time.\Over the last four years that I’ve spent going around the commonwealth I’ve seen it time and time again.\In Shamokin they are literally overrun with blight and drugs -- and opportunities are few and far between.\I’ve seen the same in Erie, Scranton, Old Forge, Harrisburg, York and Greensburg.\In Philadelphia, there are neighborhoods dealing with staggering violence and unimaginable poverty.\I am very disturbed that elementary school children in Philadelphia are in buildings in deplorable condition, that flaking paint chips are falling from ceilings on to their desks and some children are eating those paint flakes and getting lead poisoning.\I don’t care what political party you are from - this is very wrong.\I’ve heard my colleague Senator Hughes passionately advocate for these schools and I look forward to working with him when I am back here as Governor to try to right this wrong.\I don’t understand how ten miles from Philadelphia there are opulent school campuses being built – but in Philadelphia school buildings are crumbling.\I have come to the realization that there is only so much I could do as a Senator on these issues.\Another major issue that I think we have to do more about is education.\People have branded me as a person who wants to cut funding.\That could not be further from the truth.\I want to make sure more money is getting to the classroom.\Let me tell you a quick story.\If you visit my companies you will never hear me talk about profits first.\What you will hear me talk about first is safety and providing good customer service.\Trust me - we are obsessed with safety and service at our companies.\We have built a culture and environment around safety and service.\If we work safe, and provide a good product to the consumer, we believe the profits will follow.\We believe that executing the fundamentals will help us achieve our larger goals.\That’s the attitude I will bring to fixing our broken education system.\We need to go back to basics.\We need to retool and reinvent our curriculum and our programs to make sure that we are preparing EVERY CHILD to meet the needs of the modern economy.\Whether our children choose to enter into the workforce, to attend a trade school or to go to college, we need to do a better job preparing them.\Education is the key to many of the crisis issues we have in Pennsylvania.\Our prisons are bulging, we have a heroin – opioid crisis, we have a mental health crisis, we have high dropout rates in our schools, we have a skilled labor crisis, we have a state unemployment rate that is 20 percent higher than the national average.\We have many students that do not have life skills to survive.\We have students graduating with degrees loaded with student debt.\If we can change the way we educate, we can address all of these issues.\I meet employers every single day who are not able to find skilled labor, electricians, plumbers, carpenters, welders, machinists, equipment operators, truck drivers, nurses, the list is long.\Most of the professions I just mentioned have pay ranges from $40,000 to over $100,000 per year or more.\Let’s start informing our children about those opportunities and getting them ready for those careers.\Let’s take that student who wants to drop out and give him or her a solid job in the skilled labor field.\In addition to curriculum reforms, when it comes to education, we also need to talk about what we are spending our money on.\We currently spend a lot of money on education.\Teachers and administrators routinely tell me that they are being held back by mandates.\I don’t know how anyone can know whether each and every dollar we spend on education is being spent wisely.\We need to find out, and we need to find out fast.\I have seen so many issues as I travel throughout our state.\We have the nation’s highest gas tax, but our highways are filled with potholes, bracketed with trash, and bordered by overgrown brush and trees.\We have seniors and young families drowning in school property taxes.\Health care costs are out of control.\We have veterans who are homeless, we have a high incident rate of veteran’s suicide, and veterans who do not have access to healthcare.\Pennsylvania is now the number four state with seniors aged 85 and over.\Seniors face many issues, access to health care, access to prescriptions, affordable housing, access to personal care and nursing home facilities.\Over the last four years I have seen firsthand more issues than I can count.\Hundreds of people have come to my Senate offices to meet with me and staff members to discuss issues that were and are important to them.\I’ve toured farms, small businesses, manufacturing facilities, senior centers, coal mines, natural gas drilling sites, nuclear power plants and so much more.\I have learned so much over the last four years from so many good people of Pennsylvania.\We didn’t always agree – but we had respectful and honest conversations\No amount of money could ever buy my experience discussing and witnessing issues.\Now on to the really good news.\Most of the issues that we face can be solved, first by a laser focus on education, second by getting our finances under control, balance Harrisburg’s check book, implement zero based budgeting, rein in out of control regulations, demand that Harrisburg become more customer friendly to job creators and hardworking taxpayers.\Instead of running all over the country trying attract new business with all kinds of incentives and cash we do not have, we need to focus on the 975,000 businesses already here in Pennsylvania to help them grow and expand.\If we were to be more customer friendly and rein in regulations hampering our 975,000 businesses and they hired just one additional person, we could have 975,000 new jobs on our hands.\Then the question would become where are we going to find 975,000 people that are trained and have to skills to go to work?\Nationwide, we have 10,000 people turning 65 years old for the next twenty years – where in the world are we going to find all of the people needed in Pennsylvania to fill jobs?\Let’s get real serious about the things I just mentioned and you will see Pennsylvania’s economy grow and the paychecks of hardworking Pennsylvanians will get fatter.\I have come to realize there is only so much I can do as a Senator on these issues - as Governor I can do more.\That’s why I am resigning today – because I owe it to the forgotten people all over Pennsylvania to put all of my energy into a campaign to be their voice.\The coming months will determine the direction of their lives more than the direction of mine.\As many of you know, my life has been blessed in so many ways.\I’m not running for governor for people like me – I’m doing this for hardworking, genuine, salt of the earth Pennsylvanians.\I’m on a mission – and that mission requires me to leave the comforts of the Senate and pour everything I have into fulfilling that mission on behalf of the people I want to lead.\A successful mission for me will mean coming back to Harrisburg in another capacity and to work “with” each and every Senate member, House members and state employees from both sides of the aisle to solve issues important to their constituents and their community\Thank you for the time today Mr. President, and thank you for the opportunity to serve.”\Wes Venteicher is a Tribune-Review staff writer.

When I was a student in the early seventies at York Country Day, a science teacher asked our class, ""How long will we reach into the oil cookie jar for our energy?""
\
One only has to look at our society some 30 years later and wonder how much longer can we keep reaching?
\
When I decided to make my small studio business solar powered I did so because I wanted to do my part in providing clean, renewable energy. In doing so it would replace a small amount of dependence on oil, nuclear and natural gas. The only economical incentive one has to do this at an ""end user level"" is net metering. Net metering is a policy recognized by many states as an incentive to promote renewable energy. The amount, even with net metering, is small, and I would still build such a system, as I feel the benefits go beyond that monetary amount.
\
The real issue of net metering is control of the grid. Electric companies don't like this, as it could interfere with their centralized generation system, and if many individuals built solar and other renewable systems it would have an adverse effect on their income (unlikely scenario).
\
Solar best fits in a decentralized grid, one in which electricity flows from a centralized generator and many small ""end user"" units as it takes advantage of much unused real estate, millions of roof tops.
\
The economics of renewable energy is not comparable to conventional sources as society sees it. We don't put a price on ecological degradation, Mideast wars or depleted natural resources. Adams Electric Cooperative representatives told me that it is unfair to other customers to pay for ""wealthy individuals"" to use the grid to store their power, and I agree. One only has to look at the corporations that produce power now and oil corporations that write this country's energy bills.
\
However, to deny conscientious people who have decided to finance a renewable energy source net metering is not corporate welfare. My company is small and far from ever being an energy mogul. All benefit from renewable energy and those benefits outweigh throwing them the ""net metering bone.""
\
If companies that build solar energy systems are to become ""like Henry Ford"" and build cheaper systems, they need the demand, and presently the only way to do this is at the individual, grassroots level.
\
The technology is there, and it is left to society to make an environment that will move this forward. We are at a critical point in time, as we will need the energy cheap oil gives us to build an infrastructure of renewable energies. There is no choice, oil is finite and our consumption is insatiable. Imagine a world without oil; it will happen sometime in this century.
\
The work Adams Electric Cooperative does with conservation is commendable and maybe deserving of keeping it from PUC policies demanding electric companies to reach specific renewable energy goals. However, they shouldn't be allowed policies that keep individuals from building authentic, safe renewable energy systems. These policies may have to be developed by legislation or courts.

Did you know that both the rooftop solar and wind power industries each now employ more people than the coal industry?
\
The rooftop solar power industry is giving homeowners the ability to literally put a dent in mid-day peak energy demand, right where electricity is used - no additional power lines needed. While utilities lose electrical sales due to rooftop solar, it generally helps the grid by helping level off the mid-day usage peak. Since solar panels are semiconductors, affordable solar power keeps increasing the same way it does for other electronics.
\
The American Southwest's Green Tea Party understands rooftop solar can mean energy freedom, and fiercely battles local utilities for net metering to let them receive payment for helping the grid meet mid-day power demands.
\
Burlington, Vt., is now 100 percent renewables-powered, largely via windmills. Denmark and other largely island nations are also nearing 100 percent renewables-sourced generation, mostly via wind power.
\
Energy storage manufacturing has increased with renewables, helping more people transition from dying industries like printing to a 21st Century economy.
\
Broad geographic distribution of wind and solar power let it become a uniquely steady electrical supply, energy with zero refueling costs or serious maintenance shutdowns. That's the beauty of distributed generation - like the internet, various isolated nodes here and there can go down without really affecting the whole.
\
REMI and other groups have done thorough analyses of the economic impact of a rising carbon fee and dividend, a fully returned-to-households fee collected at fuels' entry into the economy. Each study has found the economy long-term would be helped by fee and dividend.
\
So it's not the environment vs. the economy, but rather what's good long-term for the environment is also good for the economy. They go hand in hand.

754,"Three years ago, the Allegheny County Airport Authority announced plans to live off the resources of its land - the natural gas below its Pittsburgh International campus and the sun shining from above.\On Wednesday, the vision was deemed realized.\Airport officials said the microgrid that routes power produced on-site to the airport's terminal and other buildings is active and protects it from the kinds of blackouts and power disruptions that have wreaked havoc at other airports across the country. The most cited example is the 2017 outage that stranded thousands of travelers at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, one of the world's busiest, a week before Christmas.\The Allegheny County Airport Authority launched its microgrid project a few months later. It was billed as a way to harness the natural gas that was already being pulled from below the airport's footprint by CNX Resources Corp., a Cecil-based oil and gas producer that leased land from the airport in a $500 million deal in 2013. Besides saving the airport money on electricity bills, the microgrid is a level of protection against disruptions on the transmission and utility grids.\In 2019, the airport authority awarded North Shore-based Peoples Natural Gas a 20-year contract to build and operate the microgrid, which would include a solar component and a gas-fired power plant. Construction began in July 2020.\Peoples said last year that the cost of the project is about $30 million.\Local airport officials, politicians and company representatives celebrated the completion of the project against the backdrop of more than 9,000 solar panels glistening under the occasional sun on Wednesday.\But it's the out-of-sight natural gas power plant that will be doing the heavy lifting for the microgrid.\The solar array has a full capacity of 3 megawatts ""on a full sunny day,"" said Mike Brady, CEO of IMG Energy Solutions, which will operate the project for Peoples. The company is in discussions with the airport about adding another 14,000 panels to the mix, he said.\Still, the gas engines have a capacity of 21 megawatts.\All the power generated by the natural gas power plant and the solar panels is managed by IMG and goes to meet the airport's needs, with the remainder sold into the regional electric grid. The airport authority signed a 20-year power purchase agreement with IMG, which Tom Woodrow, vice president of engineering for the airport authority, has said will save the facility $500,000 a year in electricity costs.\The project is novel for many of the players involved. For Peoples Natural Gas, it is only the second time that the gas company will be involved in power generation. It has another power plant that runs off its gas in a new hospital.\For IMG, this is its first solar project. The North Shore-based company typically installs small natural gas power plants to take advantage of cheap shale gas. So far, its six projects, each capable of generating about 20 megawatts of power, are all in the northeastern part of Pennsylvania.\IMG didn't build the power plant at the airport, but Mr. Brady said Peoples used IMG's plant designs as a basis for its facility.\The solar array, installed by Carnegie-based EIS Solar, isn't wired into the microgrid. Instead, it serves some 20 buildings outside the terminal and feeds its access energy into Duquesne Light's grid through net metering.\While other airports have microgrids for portions of their operations, Pittsburgh is the first to be ""completely powered by solar and natural gas,"" Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald said on Wednesday.\.\CAPTION: PHOTO: Andrew Rush/Post-Gazette: The 9,360-panel solar array installed at Pittsburgh International Airport is part of a new microgrid powering facility that uses natural gas and solar energy. Officials say Pittsburgh's is the first airport in the world to be completely powered in this way.

HUNTINGTON TWP. -- Halfway down a rocky, rural road, socks and T-shirts dry on a clothes line inside the garage of a two-story house. In the backyard 200 feet away from his house, Jon Grisham stops at a brick. It's here Grisham hopes to halve his energy costs.
\
Grisham and his family will add a non-commercial wind turbine to their 10-acre lot in the next few weeks -- the first of its kind in Luzerne County.
\
The turbine should generate a third to a half of the family's electricity needs. Deciding to add the 50-foot-high turbine was as much an economical decision for the Grishams as it was an environmental one, as rising energy costs, combined with decreasing costs for technology, have made such ventures more attractive to homeowners.
\
""I think everyone's more environmentally conscious, now, but if it doesn't make financial sense I'm not going to go broke trying to save the world,"" Grisham said. ""We should break even or better, and then there's the added bonus of helping the environment.""
\
Grisham and his wife, Jo, had toyed with the idea of adding a wind turbine to their house since the couple moved from Washington, D.C., in 1995 with their son, Aaron, 17. They also have another son, Adam, 9. The couple met in the Navy and moved back to Northeastern Pennsylvania because they loved the region's hilly and mountainous terrain.
\
""We live on the side of a mountain,"" Grisham said. ""Typically, it's pretty windy.""
\
Jon Grisham seriously investigated adding a turbine in the past three years. He works as a chief financial officer for a New York-based firm. He studied the internal rate of returns, or the long-term break-even point, for such a large investment. As long as energy costs stay at about 10 cents per kilowatt hour, the family will break even from a cost standpoint.
\
If, as Jon Grisham predicts, energy costs rise in the coming years, adding the turbine will save the family money. That's all assuming the family stays in the house for another couple of decades.
\
""Technology that cost about $60,000 10 years ago costs about [$15,000] to $18,000 all of a sudden,"" he said. ""It's worth a home equity loan for the investment.""
\
Once installed, the turbine will be connected to the power grid.
\
The family won't have a battery to store the electricity, so at times the turbine might create more energy than the family uses. In such cases, the Grishams will actually ""sell"" UGI Utilities energy electricity. It's called ""net metering,"" and in such cases the family's electric meter spins backward. At the end of the month, the family will pay a bill for the difference from energy used versus the energy sold back to the electric company.
\
This past month the county planning commission approved the Grishams' plans. It was the first time the planning commission had ever answered such a request, but there's a growing trend, planning consultant Jack Varaly said.
\
Varaly said community leaders in Harveys Lake and other municipalities he consults say residents expressed interest to add wind turbines to their properties.
\
He makes sure municipal zoning ordinances identify wind turbines as different from just a typical improvement to a property.
\
""You can't regulate something properly if it's not identified,"" Varaly said. The biggest impacts wind turbines have are visual annoyance and noise disturbance, he said.

756,"Solar enthusiasts might have spotted the issue first but when farmers found out their efforts to turn manure into energy might be at risk, they came out in force to oppose a new regulation proposed by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission. \The rules under debate could change who can sell alternative energy into the grid through net metering. \Net metering allows utility customers to apply electricity generated by their own alternative energy systems against their electric bills. It has allowed Cliff and Andrea Sensenig to save their dairy farm in Kirkwood, according to a letter Ms. Sensenig wrote to the PUC. \A few years ago the couple installed a methane digester to process food waste and manure into electricity. They did it as a way to generate money. The digester makes far more power than the farm uses and the revenue the couple generates by selling the excess to the utility has kept the facility afloat, she wrote. \If the PUC regulations are enacted as written, the electric checks would likely stop. The agency is proposing to cap electricity production from such sources at 110 percent of the owner's demand. \It is also looking to require customer generators to have something, such as a house or equipment, to power on the site where they are proposing to put an alternative energy system. In other words, if there's no pre-existing demand, there can be no net-metered alternative energy generation to offset it, the agency claims. \The PUC estimates about 100 alternative energy system development and installation companies would be impacted by the regulation, but that ""the costs and impacts on small businesses are expected to be minimal."" \Many of the costs and impacts will be offset by more regulatory certainty, which should reduce development costs, the PUC said in a supporting document for its proposal. \The agency has maintained it is not attempting to change the laws that established net-metering and mechanisms to promote small-scale alternative energy generation, but simply codifying the way it has been applying those laws for some time now. \But nearly all the comments submitted so far claim the PUC is overstepping its authority and disregarding both the letter and the intent of such laws. \""Is the intent of the PUC with this order to limit the amount of alternative energy produced and made available to the consumers when the rest of the world is looking for every kilowatt of alternative energy that can be created?"" asked the Professional Dairy Managers of Pennsylvania. ""Why does the PUC seek to limit the free market/income of dairy farm families?"" \The 110 percent proposal is particularly problematic because alternative energy systems such as digesters, solar panels and landfill-to-energy projects are expensive commitments, most of which would not be justified if the utility's payout was capped at 10 percent of the energy produced, commenters said. \The matter even rose to the attention of Christopher Abruzzo, the secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, who warned the PUC that ""any factor that deters Pennsylvania's farms from pursuing [anearobic digesters] as a means of manure management does a disservice to the farming community and the environment."" \The PUC has indicated it wants to set a limit to prevent merchant generators from masquerading as customer generators, but opponents note that the Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards law of 2007 already has limits on the size of systems that customers can net meter. For residential customers, it's 50 kilowatts or less. For small commercial is 3 megawatts, or, in some cases, 5. \""By increasing the burdens and barriers for using net metering, the commission is disregarding both the intent but also the clear language of the AEPS Act itself,"" wrote Granger Holdings, a company that develops landfill-to-energy projects and has two such projects at Pennsylvania landfills which it hopes to expand. \If the regulations are adopted, Granger and a number of other parties asked the PUC to grandfather all existing and pending net-metering facilities. \The Office of the Small Business Advocate has been a lonely voice of support for the regulations thus far. \The group welcomed the proposed rules saying they are necessary to protect small business customers from bearing the cost passed down by utilities that have to pay retail price for net-metered generation. \The PUC's public comment on the proposed rules closes Sept. 3."
757,"The Public Utility Commission, in its recent ruling limiting personal solar (""State's Net-Metering Caps Frustrate Solar Advocates,"" Feb. 23), has bought into FirstEnergy's and Duquesne Light's fiction that somehow paying owners of small solar arrays (under 50 kilowatts) the retail price as mandated by state law for any excess power they feed into the grid hurts other ratepayers. \FirstEnergy and Duquesne Light in their written comments to the PUC making this argument include zero economic data to back up their claims. The PUC in its ruling is ignoring the fact the personal solar arrays add capacity to the grid with no capital costs to nonsolar ratepayers. It also gets this power to the grid without costs to other ratepayers, whereas a new power plant would require expensive transmission lines, which can reach the grid only by taking the public's property through eminent domain. \The PUC ruling ignores the fact that personal solar arrays furnish their peak power on hot summer days when the grid is most stressed and electric providers often have to go out of grid to buy power at very high prices to avoid brown-outs. It ignores the fact that electric providers are required by law to purchase renewable energy credits, which go down in price if more solar credits are generated. It also ignores the greatest contribution of solar-generated power to all Pennsylvanians in that it has none of the staggering health and environmental impacts that mining and burning coal and fracking have on the health and environment of Pennsylvania's citizens. \The real reason the PUC wants to limit personal solar is not costs going up for other ratepayers; it is because the PUC has been lobbied heavily by the burners of fossil fuels. The fossil-fuel industry does not want personal solar power because it takes money out of the pockets of these giant polluters and power companies and puts green energy and green money into the hands of the people."

In what is shaping up as a crowded Democratic field for the spring gubernatorial primaries, it may come down to which entrant has the most skill, is diplomatic enough to move contentious issues in Harrisburg, and has a history of working across both sides of the aisle.
\
If that is the criteria voters are looking for, then they would not overlook the candidacy of John Hanger.
\
Hangar, in a Tribune Editorial Board meeting earlier this week, laid out the reasons why he should be elected governor, and shed light on his multi-point plans to reverse Pennsylvania's recent slippage, particularly in the education and job growth sectors.
\
""I'm running because I have the experience and background to do the job, and I'm running because I have specific plans that will in fact help working people in particular,"" said Hanger, an energy expert with a background in public law. ""I don't wake up in the morning worried about [Gov. Tom] Corbett and the very wealthy, but I have spent my whole life and career working on behalf of, and trying to find solutions for, poor people of all races and backgrounds.""
\
Hanger, an immigrant born in Nairobi, Kenya, recalled his father being politically active in calling for the end of apartheid, and that experience is partially responsible for Hanger's early career, which started at the local energy project at Community Legal Services. Hanger was the appointed Public Advocate representing customers of the Philadelphia Gas Works and the Philadelphia Water Department in rate cases and other proceedings.
\
Hanger has shown that he can get things done in Harrisburg, as Hangar served as under two former governors - Ed Rendell and Bob Casey.
\
Hanger served Casey from 1993 until 1998 in the role of Commissioner of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, and was one of the chief architects of the plan that abolished electric monopolies.
\
From 2008 to 2011 in the Rendell administration, Hanger served as Secretary of the Department of Environmental Protection, where Hanger instituted tougher regulations for the state's drilling industry - at a time when the Marcellus Shale lobby worked nonstop to kill those regulations.
\
In between appointments, Hanger launched a public interest organization, Citizens of Pennsylvania's Future, which worked to improve the environment and economy. Hanger's influence helped procure the $625 million Growing Greener environmental stewardship program, Pennsylvania's pioneering net-metering legislation, the 2004 Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards Act and Pennsylvania's Climate Action Plan.
\
That experience has helped Hanger craft an expansive 21-point energy plan, which is available on Hanger's website, www.hangerforgovernor. com.
\
But it was in Rendell's administration where Hanger truly had to work across the aisle an ability that Hanger said should be a crucial consideration when voting for the next governor.
\
""In that particular part of my life, the strength is, I frankly haven't spent my life climbing the political ladder,"" Hanger said, allowing that since he is not a career politician, he hasn't had to make truly hard compromises and doesn't have that sort of experience in the electoral sense. ""But you get with me at least is someone who has seven and a half years' experience as an officeholder. That's actually more than anyone else in the race. I have been travelling this state, living in Philadelphia, living in Hershey, speaking to media, politicians, lobbying for bills... I have a lot of experience you want and need.
\
""Frankly, I think I know more about how Harrisburg works and what gets done in Harrisburg, and how you get things done in Harrisburg more than anyone else in this race,"" Hanger continued. ""That's a strong statement, but I think that's backed up by my career.""
\
Hanger, who will likely face tough opposition from fellow Democrat entrants U.S. Congresswoman Allyson Schwartz and Tom Wolf, panned Corbett's education and job growth strategies.
\
On education, Hanger said it is virtually impossible to improve outcomes while gashing education funding, but as governor, Hanger would take a close look at the funding formula and pay particular attention to the cyber charter school industry which Hanger said receives $366 million annually from the state.
\
But Hanger took Corbett to task mostly for Corbett's contention that job growth has increased under Corbett's administration. Hanger contends that analysis shows the state to be in the lowest percentile of states generating new jobs - which flies in the face of Corbett's claims of producing thousands of jobs.
\
""I think one of the first responsibilities of a governor is to foster job creation. It starts with education, and there are direct jobs to be created in education as well,"" Hanger said, adding that he has crafted an eight-part job creation plan that could create nearly half a million jobs. ""My job plan includes transportation, health care, education, clean energy and water and sewer infrastructure; it all adds up to 382,000 jobs.
\
""Each part of the jobs program is footnoted to an independent thirst-party study that authenticates the claim; it's not me pulling numbers out of thin air,"" Hanger continued. ""The proposals range from very doable to a little harder, but none of them are pie-in-the sky. They are all things I know I could get done.""

Off a main drag outside of Somerset, 36 low-income housing units are going up. When they're move-in ready, the new residents of the Highland Hills housing development will have an advantage many of limited means do not: solar energy.
\
The rooftop solar panels glint on the tops of the duplexes, representing - above all - savings.
\
""When we look at trying to make the property affordable and sustainable for the residents long-term, the addition of solar is one of the solutions,"" said David Petroni, vice president of business development for the Buckeye Community Hope Foundation, the Ohio nonprofit behind the project. The household incomes at the Highland Hills development will range from $9,000 to $50,000, he added.
\
Each of the homes will boast its own rooftop solar array, which will generate energy to offset tenants' electric bills. Once the panels are paid for, they have the potential to supply energy to a home essentially for free.
\
It's not usually a priority - or a realistic financial option - for people on the lower end of the income spectrum. Although the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh is developing a low-interest loan for city residents to more readily access solar, solar energy is widely reserved for the middle and upper classes.
\
Petroni predicts each renter could save about $30 a month on electricity because of the solar installations, a roughly $450,000 project partially funded by a state grant.
\
In Pennsylvania, a residential rooftop solar system could conservatively save homeowners an estimated $811 every year, according to a PublicSource analysis of data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
\
Low-income households in Pittsburgh spend an average of almost 9.5 percent of their household incomes on energy bills, more than double the average rate citywide, according to an April report by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy and the Energy Efficiency for All coalition.
\
Even though the price of purchasing solar panels has dropped considerably in recent years, it still requires an upfront investment of tens of thousands of dollars without assistance, like a loan or grant.
\
The cost can be daunting for many homeowners, but Pennsylvania's solar policies and the resulting shortcomings in the solar industry here can make the financial hurdle seem practically insurmountable for low-income residents.
\
""People are either choosing to continue renting their electricity, or owning it,"" said Sharon Pillar, president of the Solar Unified Network of Western Pennsylvania, noting that residential rooftop solar panels are generally warrantied for about 25 to 30 years and their owners can save about $15,000 during that time.
\
""I always say, the cost of doing nothing is going to be more.""
\
Limited incentives
\
Some Pennsylvanians may not be able to get far enough ahead to ever stop buying their energy each month from power companies like Duquesne Light.
\
The government doesn't offer realistic incentives for low-income residents in the state to go solar. The federal government offers a 30 percent tax cedit for homeowners who install solar, although those with lower incomes may not be able to take full advantage of this immediately.
\
According to a federal database of renewable energy incentives, the only one that purports to benefit low-income people is the opportunity to sell credits earned through generating solar energy to companies and suppliers that need them to meet state solar production requirements.
\
Individuals receive one Solar Renewable Energy Credit, or SREC, for every mega-watt hour of electricity they produce through the rooftop panels. But Pennsylvania has an open border policy that permits companies to purchase SRECs from other states, unlike our neighbors in Maryland, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Washington, D.C., and elsewhere that allow SRECS to be bought and sold only within their borders.
\
Pennsylvania's open border policy has led to an oversupply and the SRECs' price plummeting into ""the gutter"" since 2013, said Ron Celentano, president of the Pennsylvania Solar Energy Industries Association. That's the same year that money ran out in a 4-year-old state grant program that was meant to fund solar projects in Pennsylvania, further depressing the market, he added.
\
SREC prices had been as high as $350, Celentano said. Now, they hover around $14. The level of solar development within a state and the resulting volume of supply can also affect how much or little SRECs are worth there.
\
It's a situation that Louise Taylor, whose family installed solar panels onto their Point Breeze home last year for $25,500, considers ""unfair."" Over the course of a year, her system produced five SRECs. The average home produces about eight SRECs per year.
\
""In some states, the value of those SRECs is enough to be factored into whether you buy the system or not,"" she said. ""You think about that as another potential economic consideration, whereas in Pennsylvania they're worth so little that you don't even bother adding them up.""
\
Selling energy back
\
The SREC pitfall could affect households where every dollar counts more significantly. In some states, those interested in going solar may opt to buy into a community solar arrangement instead.
\
Pennsylvania, though, does not have legislation to support most projects that would allow people who don't have rooftop solar to benefit from purchasing a share of a larger-scale project and having the savings credited back to their electricity bills. Fourteen states and Washington, D.C., do have shared renewables legislation, according to Shared Renewables HQ, a site dedicated to advancing renewable energy policy across the country.
\
Gov. Tom Wolf supports permitting community solar, said Sam Robinson, deputy secretary of policy and planning at the governor's office, adding that there has simply not been enthusiasm among politicians for passing the legislation this would require.
\
Net metering, a facet of the community solar strategy, makes it possible for owners of rooftop solar arrays to sell energy back to the established electric grid when they are producing more than they are consuming; they could also purchase electricity when the sun is not out and they aren't generating as much as they are using. For some people, net metering offsets the full electric bill over the course of a year.
\
But Pennsylvania rules prevent selling shares of a solar setup to offset home electric bills, said Rob Altenburg, director of the Energy Center at PennFuture, an environmental advocacy organization.
\
One roadblock to relaxed net metering rules is the belief that, because these customers are paid for the full retail value of the solar they sell back to the grid, they are essentially free riders.
\
""Those rooftop solar customers are, in effect, not having to pay for a lot of the infrastructure costs associated with the electric grid through the services that they use and other services that the utilities provide,"" said John Eick, director of the Energy, Environment and Agriculture task force at the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC, a conservative organization that writes model policies for legislators.
\
T)his position disregards the benefits that solar provides to the grid, Celentano said, like relieving congestion on the distribution lines and saving on distribution and transmission costs.
\
In May 2015, Maryland adopted legislation approving community solar, so the Baltimore Office of Sustainability is in the process of setting up projects in the city with a particular emphasis on low-income residents, sustainability coordinator Alice Kennedy said. Those who want to cut down on their electric bills through net metering will be able to ""subscribe"" to a project and essentially get paid for the energy the project produces.
\
""... Access to community solar (and) figuring out low-income financing for on-site generation and installation on a home ... open the door to broaden access to solar energy for low-income residents,"" she said. ""Both of those are basically mechanisms that continue to decrease the energy burden for low-income residents across the city.""
\
Pennsylvania homeowners do have the option to participate in a solar power purchasing agreement, which allows a developer to install solar onto their roofs for little or no cost, and sell them energy at a fixed rate that is generally lower than what they would have paid to the local utility. But, under this arrangement, the homeowner does not actually own the solar panels.
\
Long-term loan, long-term savings
\
Experts say that people living on lower incomes are more likely to employ much cheaper energy-saving techniques like LED lightbulbs and smart power strips that don't continuously draw power than to invest in solar.
\
Ben Towne of Greenfield nevertheless took his concept of an energy-efficient home to the next level in 2013 by having solar panels installed.
\
Because he's a graduate student, enrolled in Carnegie Mellon University's Societal Computing program, Towne doesn't have much federally taxable income and wasn't able to fully benefit from the 30 percent solar energy tax credit. To pay for the system, he used a loan.
\
The establishment of long-term, low-interest loans is the primary answer industry insiders have to increase access to solar.
\
Joe Morinville, president of EIS Solar, the Pittsburgh-based company that's installing the Highland Hills panels in Somerset, said he'd rather see the government establish a revolving loan fund instead of something like its previous grant program, which created a detrimental boom-and-bust scenario.
\
He said financing the loans out over longer terms would make it feasible for more people.
\
""If you can only finance over seven to 10 years, it's going to increase their electric bill 50 bucks a month to do it, so that's something a low-income person isn't going to be able to absorb,"" he said.
\
Even when they're offered for longer terms, these types of loans often require that homeowners submit credit scores, which may present a roadblock for low-income households.
\
State lawmakers in 2013 proposed an act to establish a Property Assessed Clean Energy, or PACE program, which would give townships and municipalities the ability to provide property owners loans to make energy-efficiency improvements. The low-interest loans would be paid through the property owner's tax bill. Pillar of the Solar Unified Network said the program is controversial because it could expose low-income households to debts on their property. It's been stalled in committee for years.
\
The Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh [URA] is in the process of setting up a $25,000 fixed-rate loan with a 20-year amortization period aimed at financing installation of residential solar panels--the first of its kind in Pittsburgh, said Tom Cummings, the URA director of housing. Although the fixed interest rate has not yet been finalized, the organization is aiming to have the loan available by the fall.
\
""People that have means can probably do this through lines of credit against their home...but for people that don't have much equity in their house, this would be a way to do that..."" Cummings said. ""It could be a pilot program that could grow into something more substantial.""

Numbers released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that income disparities among different ethnic groups in the U.S. remain pronounced. Median weekly earnings for Black males are just 75.6 percent of the median for white males, and Black females' earnings were 82.3 percent of the median for white females. Overall, African Americans are more than twice as likely to live in poverty as non-African Americans.
\
Those Americans - including many minority families - who remain below the poverty line face a sea of challenges, but one of the most important is the cost of household energy. This is a basic need - every family needs to heat and cool its home. So when we talk about energy policies in this country, we need to focus on the importance of affordability.
\
I recently had the opportunity to participate in a discussion in Charlotte, N.C. at the 2015 American Association of Blacks in Energy national conference, where we discussed some of the energy policy challenges of particular concern for the African American community. One such topic is renewable energy and how to foster its growth so that one day all consumers who want to make the choice to rely on clean fuels can. That we are fortunate enough to be at this point part of the energy policy debate is a testament to the innovation and cutting-edge technologies that this country is championing. Of course, any new opportunity brings challenges along with opportunities, and the dynamics behind the growth of rooftop solar panels specifically are no exception.
\
In fact, one rooftop solar policy that I spoke about at the conference is actually tipping the scales against minority and underserved communities like mine in favor of those who are more fortunate. That policy, called net metering, overcompensates rooftop solar users and essentially lets them bypass the cost of paying for the grid. This just does not work - the grid is something we all rely on to get our electricity. This includes those with rooftop solar panels that depend on the grid to get electricity when the sun doesn't shine. So when rooftop solar users cut and run from paying for the grid, everyone else has to pick up the slack.
\
Because of the economics of rooftop solar, ""everyone else"" in this case ends up being the less financially well-off. Just think about it - first and foremost, you've got to have a house. This automatically eliminates anyone who lives in community housing, rents an apartment, or lacks clear property rights. And, according to a 2008 study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, approximately 75 percent of all residential rooftop areas in the United States aren't suitable for rooftop solar panels, because of climate, trees and other constraints.
\
Finally, rooftop solar systems, which can run up to $40,000, are not financially feasible for many. Even to lease the panels, consumers must have a high credit score, which is yet another barrier.
\
So the cloudy reality with net metering is that it is a regressive policy, serving as a wealth transfer from the poor to the rich. Ultimately, this is an issue of social justice, especially if it leads to the creation of energy poverty zones. There are some bright spots when it comes to this issue, however. Arizona, for example, is leading the way by trying to institute a cost structure that ensures the fair integration of rooftop solar while also sufficiently supporting the grid.
\
The path forward is clear: through discussions like the one we had in Charlotte, and in various forums across the country, energy stakeholders have an opportunity to shape policies that are more inclusive of minority communities. The good news is that meaningful public policies changes really can smooth the economic outlook for Americans, and importantly, minority populations like ours. In today's economic environment, every fix counts.

In several states, people with windmills get a check from their power company every month. They don't in Pennsylvania, but they may soon.
\
Right now, people who produce more power than they consume -- by means of windmills or any other alternative source -- put the power back into the system without compensation.
\
Environmental groups, state officials and the Public Utility Commission have been discussing ""net metering"" for 18 months, hoping to find a compromise that power companies can deal with but at the same time encourages people like Tom Dennis to erect windmills in their backyards.
\
Environmental advocate Tom Tuffey, who has participated in the talks, predicted a deal will be worked out by fall.
\
As director of the center for energy, enterprise and environment at Penn Future, a state advocacy group, Mr. Tuffey has been touted wind energy for years.
\
The past three years have been vindicating for him, particularly the fall of 2004, when the Legislature passed the Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard. The law requires utilities get 18 percent of their power from alternate sources by 2020.
\
""I call things like wind energy clean energy,"" Mr. Tuffey said. ""We're not going to say that 10 years from now. We'll be calling it energy. There's no fuel. No dependence. No pollution. Once it's built, you know what the costs are. Wind energy is going to become more and more a part of the mix.""
\
Other environmentalists aren't as thrilled as Mr. Tuffey. Although national environmental lobby group Sierra Club likes the idea of clean alternative energy, the group is concerned about the threat windmills pose to natural habitats and migratory birds.
\
Jennifer Lavery, chairman of the Northeastern Group of the state Sierra Club chapter, conceded that windmills ""don't emit global warming gases or put mercury in the water,"" but said that windmill companies often have a ""bizarre"" lack of regard for the environment.
\
Done responsibly, Mr. Dennis's endeavour is a noble one, she said, but added that reducing to low-watt light bulbs and conservation efforts reduce electricity bills, too.
\
Alternative energy has come to encompass more than wind and sun, said Kurt Knaus, spokesman for Gov. Ed Rendell.
\
Until recently, it wasn't economical to burn the culm piled like tiny mountains along highways. Now, culm-powered generators burn more efficiently and cleaner than coal-fired plants.
\
In Lancaster County, a farmer powers his and his neighbors' homes using methane from animal manure.
\
""It's a time-consuming adjustment,"" Mr. Knaus said, but said that the state is fast making strides. ""America's energy past is grounded here ... The future is here, too.""

Pennsylvanians will be permitted to buy electricity from competing suppliers under legislation Gov. Ridge signed early this month. And early in the next century, they will face one of two very different futures.
\
In one, they will have the bleak prospect of selecting from among polluting and inefficient energy services companies. In another, they will be able to choose from a healthy mix of energy companies that offer to lower our electric bills and reduce pollution. The second scenario, however, will only occur if the law is constructively carried out by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission.
\
As the law is written, an important opportunity was missed to reap the economic and environmental benefits that have been made available through advances in energy technologies. Despite this, Pennsylvania still has the opportunity to cost-effectively save energy, lower the public's elecricity bills and reduce air pollution. To strengthen the state's economy and protect its environment, the Public Utility Commission should take the following steps:
\
* The commission should encourage Pennsylvania utilities to profit from investments made in energy conservation that will provide real benefits to residential and industrial customers as well as the environment by cutting expenditures on heating, cooling and other critically important uses of energy while simultaneously reducing carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions.
\
* The commission should require all companies to fully disclose the sources and pollution levels of the energy they seek to sell (solar, wind, biomass, hydro, nuclear, coal, gas or oil) so that customers have the opportunity to choose suppliers based on the ``greenness'' of their energy supply.
\
* The commission should work with the state Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to help the state's industries reduce their costs of meeting clean air standards. The proven way to do this is to ensure that getting the most out of every kilowatt of energy is properly recognized, and financially credited.
\
* The commission should reward energy innovators. One way is to require utilities to use ``net-metering'' tariffs. These would allow people who install renewable technologies in their homes, such as solar panels, to be paid for the excess energy they generate at home at the same rates their local utility is paid for the energy it produces.
\
* The commission should work with the DEP, neighboring states, and the federal government to ensure that in-state and out-of-state power plants reduce air pollution so that Pennsylvania can meet federal environmental standards.
\
Pennsylvania already suffers from the most acidic rainfall in the nation, which results in large part from power production from existing coal plants.
\
Hunters, anglers and tourists, who depend on thriving lakes, streams and forests, know too well the ravages of acid rain. And senior citizens, children and people with respiratory disease continue to suffer the heavy effect of polluted air resulting from energy production.
\
If the PUC implements the new law constructively, Pennsylvanians can have clean air, reasonsable energy bills and warm homes. If the commission turns its back on a clean energy future, Pennsylvanians will continue to pay some of the highest prices for some of the dirtiest energy in the nation.

If, as Brian F. Keane maintains, Americans' buying decisions are motivated by (a) I want and (b) I need, where does solar power fit in?
\
Keane, president of SmartPower, a national nonprofit organization that creates community programs for energy efficiency and clean energy, says 80 percent of Americans want solar power, but only 3 percent obtain it.
\
""That's because we don't think we need it, because our houses and offices already come with energy,"" Keane said.
\
He works with groups and neighborhoods to make solar more affordable for homeowners.
\
A lot of things have been working against solar power, he said, and one of the biggest is ""that for the last 30 years, we have been marketing it as being good for the environment.""
\
""Most of us don't base our purchasing decisions on whether something is good for us, but because of its value to us,"" he said.
\
Such good-for-the-environment marketing implies that solar energy involves a lifestyle change, something consumers typically are unwilling to do.
\
The chief argument against solar has long been, ""What do we do at night or when it rains?"" Keane said.
\
Since the output of a solar system is sold to the owner's utility, there's no risk of being left without power.
\
""People are generally suspicious of utility companies, so when you make the argument for solar,"" which provides 10 percent of the nation's power, ""they look for a gimmick,"" he said.
\
Consumers also are turned off by the costs of buying and installing solar panels, the perceived complexity of financing the work, and the length of time they believe it will take to recoup the cost of their investment, he said.
\
Yet, ""if consumers were really concerned about rates of return on investment, no one would buy cars,"" Keane said, ""since they lose value once you drive them off the lot.""
\
""We buy cars to get places, and no car dealership ever asks you to come up with the money up front - instead, they say, 'We can finance it for you.' ""
\
That's true these days of solar, as more banks are willing to provide low-interest loans for it, and states such as New Jersey continue to lead the way with incentives for residential and commercial renewable-energy installations.
\
New Jersey is second in the nation in total number of homes and businesses with solar panels installed, and it has one of the most favorable net-metering standards in the country, the Solar Energy Industries Association says.
\
In Pennsylvania, ""solar is a challenge,"" Keane said, and SmartPower is looking to bring its program to Pittsburgh as a starting point.
\
Solar installations in Pennsylvania in the second quarter of this year were pretty much all commercial, the solar industries group said - hardly noticeable compared with New Jersey's 75 megawatts of new systems for residential, commercial, and utilities.
\
Hard costs of solar installation - for photovoltaic panels - have dropped substantially in the last few years, thanks to a flood of products from Japan and China.
\
Soft costs - ""getting it on the roof,"" as Keane put it - remain high, so his group's goal is to go to cities and neighborhoods to get residents, five or 10 at a time, ""to leverage personnel and hard costs."" Group buying would cut costs by 20 percent.
\
Keane said solar power is a ""piece of a diversified energy portfolio,"" along with natural gas, wind, and hydroelectric power.
\
Houses and offices are more energy-efficient than ever, but ""our use has climbed and our capacity has fallen precipitously,"" he said. ""Every solar panel helps our capacity issue.""

765,"America's Energy Future Tour stopped off at City Hall yesterday to demonstrate fuel-efficient and alternative-energy vehicles and appliances.\The purpose of the tour is to help consumers understand energy choices and the effect they can have on the environment. It is billed as a counterpoint to President Bush's energy plan that would include new oil and gas exploration in the Alaskan National Wildlife Refuge and other federal lands, and expanded use of coal and nuclear energy.\Among the exhibits are hybrid-fuel vehicles, a solar-powered Airstream trailer, energy-efficient appliances, fuel cells, and demonstrations of wind power. There is even a solar-powered laptop computer.\The 27-city tour, which began July 10 in Maine and ends Sept. 10 in Albuquerque, N.M., continues today in Dover, Del. It is sponsored by the National Environmental Trust, a nonprofit organization that promotes public understanding of environmental issues.\""The problem with the Bush energy plan is that it takes us back to drilling for oil and digging for coal, 19th-century technologies,"" said John Flowers, director of the Energy Tour. ""We need to take a step forward to 21st-century technologies.""\The display includes a Toyota Prius, a gasoline/electric hybrid vehicle. Unlike electric-only cars, its power system never needs to be recharged from an outside source. The car has a fuel efficiency of 52 miles per gallon in the city and 48 on the highway. As Flowers explained it, the car runs mostly on electricity in the city. An onboard computer switches the car's energy source between gasoline and electricity. The car's battery is recharged using energy generated in braking, a system called ""regenerative braking.""\The Airstream trailer, in which the three members of the group traveling with the tour stay, has retractable solar panels on the roof that power the refrigerator, air conditioner and even a computer. The trailer also contains displays on ""net metering,"" through which excess power created by the solar panels can be stored or sent back to the electric grid, saving money for the consumer by ""rolling back"" the electric meter.\The tour features fuel cells, which convert the energy of a fuel (hydrogen, natural gas, methanol) and an oxidant (air or oxygen) into electricity.\Also on display yesterday were a number of human/electric-powered utility vehicles manufactured by Kronosport Inc., a Philadelphia company. Among the pedal-powered vehicles was a rickshawlike taxi, 10 of which were used at last summer's Republican National Convention. Edward A. Kron, president and chief executive officer of the company, noted that the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources had bought two of the company's nonpolluting cargo vans.\The tour also features a number of speakers. In Philadelphia yesterday, Joseph Otis Minott, executive director of the Clean Air Council, a nonprofit environmental organization, said, ""The answer to the United States' energy needs lies in energy-efficiency and clean renewable energy. Having an energy policy that relies on fossil fuel is a giant step backward for the United States.""\Beth McConnell, clean air and energy advocate with PennPirg, the Pennsylvania Public Interest Research Group, said that ""the examples of clean, efficient energy technologies around us are proof that we can meet our energy needs without drilling, spilling, polluting or meltdowns.""\Thomas J.

766,"If you'd like to green up your life and save a few bucks at the same time, you may be considering installing a solar system on your home. Just make sure you know what you're getting into because solar-related complaints recently were highlighted in a report about consumer problems.\Officials in several states cited issues with solar sales, installation and contracts when they were surveyed by the Consumer Federation of America and the North American Consumer Protection Investigators about the types of complaints they received last year.\""Solar energy is good for the environment and for consumers' pocketbooks, but there are starting to be complaints concerning misleading sales practices, confusing contracts and shoddy installation"" said Susan Grant, consumer protection director at the Consumer Federation of America. ""Consumers should check out the company and make sure they understand the terms of the agreement before they sign on the dotted line for solar contracts.""\Complaints about sales tactics for solar systems are not new, according to the survey report published last month. It said that in the late 1970s, federal tax credits for solar energy equipment fueled some aggressive and misleading sales practices. A new cycle of complaints appears to be starting as the costs of solar equipment has come down and the industry is growing, the report said.\I haven't heard from many people with beefs about solar issues. I've heard from a few who questioned whether they were getting the proper credit from their utilities for the power they supplied to the grid, a reconciliation process known as net metering. But authorities in other states have received complaints and they shared some in the survey report published last month to help guide other consumers.\Here are a few of those stories.\The Maryland attorney general's office heard from an 84-year-old man who was induced to sign a contract for solar panels with a 20-year lease to pay for them.\""Assuming that he does not outlive the lease, his heirs will be obliged to fulfill the contract, and if they choose to sell the house, the purchasers will have to agree to assume the lease, which could make the property much harder to sell,"" the report said.\The report said that leasing may seem attractive because you pay little or nothing upfront, but according to Consumer Reports, there can be serious disadvantages, including frightening off potential buyers if you decide to sell your home while the lease is still in effect.\The consumer protection office in Montgomery County, Md., said it received complaints about unlicensed contractors on solar jobs, and about damage to roofs caused by improper installations. In one case, a contractor's license was suspended after 14 complaints were filed. The consumer agency resolved some of the complaints by having the contracts rescinded and the roofs repaired.\Before you hire a solar contractor, or any contractor, in Pennsylvania, make sure they are registered with the state attorney general's office and that they have liability insurance that would cover any damage caused during installation.\The Utah Division of Consumer Protection warned about deceptive telemarketing calls that came from people who identified themselves as being from the ""Utah Public Utilities Commission,"" which sounds like the state agency that regulates utilities, the Utah Public Service Commission. The callers claimed there was a government deadline on special pricing on solar panels, and that consumers had to act immediately.\""Some of these types of calls may be outright fraudulent - scammers just trying to get people to send them money,"" the report said. ""Others may be attempts to lure people into inviting the companies to their homes, where the high-pressure sales tactics are likely to continue.""\Never agree to purchase any service or product over the phone. If what they're selling sounds like something you may be interested in, ask them to send details, including pricing and contract terms, in writing so you can review them. That also gives you time to check the company's reputation by looking them up online and consulting sources such as the Better Business Bureau.\The Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection investigated a situation in which a salesperson assured an elderly couple that their location was ideally suited for solar and that their energy savings would exceed the cost of financing the project, essentially making it free.\After they signed the contract, the salesperson returned with a new pitch, offering to make some of their payments if the couple purchased more, better quality solar panels, the report said. The couple signed an amended contract.\On the paperwork that was sent to the subcontractors and financing company, however, the money amounts were substantially more than what the couple had agreed to. After the work was done, according to the report, the couple's energy bills went up due to the inefficiency of the panels and their placement.\Get copies of all paperwork related to your project and make sure the figures and terms are consistent. If they aren't, pull the plug on the job until you straighten it out.\Contact me at watchdog@mcall.com, 610-841-2364 or The Morning Call, 101 N. Sixth St., Allentown, PA, 18101.

After 35 years of providing natural products for healthy living, the owners of Nature's Way market are now working to decrease the store's carbon footprint for the health of the planet by being the first to install solar panels in Greensburg.
\
""Nature's Way is the only one that came in and applied for the permit for a solar installation,"" said Les Harvey, building code official for Greensburg. ""They are the first that we are aware of in the city.
\
""Solar power is in its infancy,"" Harvey added. ""It's not a cheap thing to do.""
\
But costs have been coming down in recent years, and the owner of Nature's Way, Kitty Tuscano, said she wanted to make sure people are aware of the steps involved to better weigh the option of solar power for home or business.
\
""We did a solar installation first at home in March,"" Tuscano said. ""The electric bill right now is zero with a $200 credit.""
\
""It's a better investment than leaving money in the bank,"" said Kitty's husband Barry Tuscano, who is retired from his roofing company and takes care of all building issues.
\
""When we first put the system in at home, I spent hours watching that meter spin backwards,"" he said about the 11.2 kilowatt system.
\
Once the solar panels are installed, the system must be inspected by the power company before a bi-directional, or net meter, is scheduled for installation that measures the flow from both sources of energy.
\
The 21 kilowatt photovoltaic system at the business consists of panels covering the entire south-facing rooftop and will take about $200 a month off the electric bill for the three-story building that has a huge single-floor plan of 3,000 square feet.
\
The first step is to improve energy efficiency is to request an audit, or e-audit, through West Penn Power, Barry Tuscano said.
\
""We spent about $30,000 in upgrades by doing every suggestion from the e-audit that included furnace system upgrades, additional air duct returns, and foam insulation in the upstairs,"" Barry Tuscano said.
\
""You don't have to know anything about solar power, just call the contractor and sign the papers. Anytime you don't have to burn coal it's a good thing.""
\
The Tuscanos went to the Mother Earth alternative energy fair at Seven Springs Resort last September and talked to solar companies. They plan on going again this year.
\
They found their contractor, Real Earth Power of Duncansville, from talking to others using solar power.
\
""This system would have cost $200,000 three years ago, and this year the cost is under $100,000,"" said Mike Stoltz, of Real Earth Power. ""The payback will be eight years.""
\
There also is a 30 percent federal tax credit for solar power installs and a lottery for the state Sunshine Program, Stoltz said, and he hasn't yet heard of anyone being refused.
\
Germany is the number one country for solar use and that country's latitude is the same as Alaska, said Kerri Stoltz, wife of Mike Stoltz and owner of the company.
\
""There is plenty of sun in Pennsylvania,"" she added, with a four to one ratio of people installing ground versus rooftop units. ""Solar panels do work with up to one inch of snow on them.""
\
Statistics provided by Real Earth Power state that Nature's Way will decrease its carbon footprint over the life of the solar system by 475 tons of carbon dioxide, which is equivalent to planting 2,375 trees or reducing driving by 950,000 auto miles.
\
""We'd like to spread the word and have people stop and see the system,"" Barry Tuscano said. ""Solar power is doable. But call first to make sure we are here if you want to talk to us.""
\
The permit process needed through West Penn Power for solar energy installation is easily accessed through the company's web site, -www.firstenergycorp.com, and typing `net meter' in the search box.
\
Of West Penn Power's more than 700,000 customers, company spokesman Todd Meyers said there are currently 329 net meters in use and 38 are commercial, 287 are residential and 4 are industrial.
\
Of the 38 commercial meters, 29 are solar with the remainder using wind power. The majority of the residential homes with net meters use solar power, with 26 using wind. One industrial customer uses wind power.
\
""Using alternative energy is a personal choice that people need to make for themselves,"" Meyers said. ""We will help facilitate that choice.""
\
""May, June and July is the time to build up credits, but even on a cloudy day solar power is generated,"" Meyers said. ""The total power generated on net metering equals four megawatts, enough roughly - depending on the season - that one megawatt powers 1,000 homes.""
\
Meyers did add that there will never be a totally zero electric bill because of the basic costs of transmission and access.
\
The Tuscanos are serious about environmental causes.
\
Nature's Way has been participating in the 1 Percent For The Planet campaign since 2005 and, to date, has contributed more than $20,000 by carving out 1 percent of net sales to go toward protecting the natural environment.
\
In 2006, Nature's Way was a finalist for the Western Pennsylvania Environmental Award in the business category.
\
This distinction was sponsored by Dominion and the Pennsylvania Environmental Council.

769,"Trucking executive Daniel J. Sullivan came to Pittsburgh in August 1983 on a quiet mission: develop a plan to take on United Parcel Service, the big brown behemoth in the small- package delivery business.\Dispatched by Akron-based Roadway Services, Sullivan and engineer Steve Handy set up shop for several months in a Holiday Inn suite with two sleeping rooms separated by a work space equipped with a computer and a coffee pot.\RPS, the company they hatched in that hotel, today delivers an average 2.4 million packages a day and does $1.7 billion a year in business. In January it merged with Memphis-based Federal Express.\It started with 36 terminals east of the Mississippi River capable of serving 33 percent of the U.S. population and now has 365 facilities in the United States and Canada within delivery distance of every business address in North America. It has used partnerships to expand into Mexico and Europe.\Along the way RPS became a major Pittsburgh employer. More than 1,400 people work at its Moon headquarters, where the original hotel room door, a gift from employees, is on display. It operates terminals in Greensburg and Crafton and is building a new facility on Neville Island.\Sullivan, as chief executive of the business he helped conceive, is proud of what he has accomplished but would rather talk about plans to continue rapid growth at RPS.\""We probably don't step back enough to take a look or a deep breath, but the company has grown well according to plan,' ' he said. ""We are very profitable. We have the best margins in the industry and we do expect to continue our growth at double-digit rates.\""We've been able to create an environment that employs or contracts with over 30,000 people, and I think that's great. And beyond that we provide great value in the marketplace and the best service. So put it all together and it's positive.' '\Trucking was an accidental career for Sullivan, 52, who graduated from Amherst College in 1969 with a degree in psychology. After he served in the Army, a friend led him to Roadway Services, where he was hired as a management trainee in 1972.\After a few days on a loading dock, he found himself dispatching 30 drivers in his hometown of Waterbury, Conn., where he worried about pickups and deliveries and learned the nuts and bolts of the business.\""It's the best thing I did,' ' Sullivan said of joining the trucking industry. ""It got into my blood on day one and it excites me every day at 4:30 when the bell rings.""\By 1983, after deregulation of the trucking industry, Sullivan, then a district manager for Roadway, was chosen to lead a task force charged with seeing whether it made any sense to challenge UPS in small package delivery.\Sullivan did plenty of research. His team talked to truck drivers and visited warehouse companies and small-package delivery firms in the United States, Europe and Asia.\They decided to focus on business-to-business service. Those customers told him they wanted more than the expected economical pricing and dependable service. They needed more information about their packages as they were being shipped.\But how could this be accomplished? The RPS start-up team came up with the idea of using bar codes, a technology not then used in the industry, as sort of an individual license plate for each package.\They then needed a way to capture and make use of the bar code information. The solution was a patented automated warehouse system that sent packages down conveyor belts and over a scale to be weighed and scanned while in motion, with minimal human intervention. It gave RPS the ability to quickly trace packages, itemize billing and verify delivery.\""There was risk involved,' ' Sullivan recalled. ""Would the customer put the bar code on the box?

""When we considered building a headquarters we looked in this area because our employees have become used to their commuting patterns, and many of our people live in this area.""\ The exterior of the new building with its blue-green-colored windows is finished, landscaping is nearly complete, the parking lot with more than 1,300 spaces has been striped and the roadway system is finished.\ Inside, work is nearly finished on the four-story southeast wing -- the first of three sections. The five-story northeast and four-story northwest wings will be opened later this year.\ In the southeast wing, two 1,000-kilowatt generators on the first floor stand ready to provide electricity in the event of a power\ The generators, which are large enough to provide electrical power to 15 houses, will keep the RPS computers on line at all times.\ To muffle their noise, the concrete block walls have been slit in order to absorb their roar.\ The second floor will house the 15,000-square-foot data center -- the computer nerve center. The room is carpeted, and it has raised flooring so computer cables and electrical wiring can be fished beneath the equipment.\ The wing also will house offices on the third floor and the customer service department on the fourth floor. Windows are around the room, providing glimpses of wooded areas across the Parkway and Robinson Town Centre, which is about the same elevation to the east.\ ""It's going to be good for everyone to have a window where they work,"" Johnson said. ""We feel our customer representatives will have less eyestrain and will have a better working environment with natural light in the room.""\ Separating the southeast and the northeast wings is an atrium, which will serve as the employee entrance. The atrium has skylights on the ceiling, a set of elevators and a staircase.\ Visitors will enter beneath a canopy into the northeast wing, where they will be greeted by a receptionist.\ The executive offices will be on an upper level in this section of the complex. A balcony rings the building on the north and east sides.\ An atrium with skylights connects the northeast and northwest wings.\ The new complex has wide corridors and open stairs to encourage walking and fitness.\ The northwest wing has a fitness center on the bottom level and a cafeteria, which is next to a two-story picture window and beneath a four-story ceiling. There's a concrete patio outside.\ Adjacent is an auditorium with seating for more than 120 and a production studio where RPS officials can make training films for the terminals.\ The building's steel structural frame started rising on the hilltop in the spring.\ Earth-moving equipment worked day and night through last winter to prepare the 115-acre site between Hirshinger and Hookstown roads, where ground was broken in August 1993. The hillside was lowered nearly 50 feet.\ One of the most massive undertakings of the project was blasting and carving the entrance driveway through the hillside across from the entrance to Robinson Town Centre.\ The intersection of their driveway with the entrance to Robinson Town Centre and Montour Run Road has been widened to accommodate traffic into the new RPS complex.\ A majority of employees will be working daylight hours, but the complex will be operating 24 hours a day as various departments remain open to monitor package deliveries in different time zones."

Some students who graduate today already have landed human resource positions locally.
\
For some of the 620 York College students who graduate today, the degrees they walk off with are just icing on the cake.
\
A number of those walking to the podium in ceremonies today already have the jobs they hoped their degrees would land them.
\
The business administration department has been carving out a niche in human resource internships with local businesses.
\
Students accepting degrees today will head back to work Monday to jobs and internships at Drovers Bank, Harley-Davidson Inc., Tim-Bar Corp., the Lancaster YWCA and Voith Hydro Inc.
\
In the past year, the department also has landed internships and jobs for students at Shipley Energy, York Hospital, ESAB Welding and Cutting Products and RPS Inc., a FedEX subsidiary package carrier.
\
""About 15 years ago, we couldn't get a human resource internship if it were free or we paid for it,"" said Mary Meisenhelter, a business administration profes sor.
\
Three things happened over time to turn that tide. First, more and more York College grads did find their way into good local human resource jobs, rose into high-power ranks, and now they are willing to give fellow alumni a chance.
\
About 14 percent of the Local Society for Human Resource Management chapter are York College graduates, Meisenhelter said. The department started networking with these former students to arrange more internships.
\
But even these alumni couldn't have helped York College students if the economy hadn't boosted opportunities the way it has in the past three to four years. During leaner times, human resource employees are the first to be cut, Meisenhelter explained. During healthier periods, companies make room for these employees.
\
More importantly, she added, compa nies have changed their view of human resource contributions to worker productivity.
\
Rick Hotaling, human resource manager for Tim-Bar Corp. in Hanover, said employers value his department more. This is the first year his company has offered an internship in his field.
\
Terri Lehman, 24, who graduated from York College in December, said she was drawn to the field after working in retail. She was more intrigued by her co-workers and the work environment than by customers. Today she works at Shipley Energy.
\
She thinks the reason her college does so well in building the internship program is because professors match students individually with jobs, rather than posting them for everyone to apply. This individual attention acts as an incentive to work harder.
\
Holly Myers, 22, said she never ex pected to land a job like her position with Voith Hydro so quickly. The Hanover native, who is graduating today, also didn't expect to find a good job in the area, one that made her imagine staying near home for a while.
\
She is new to the workplace, but she said her classes at York College gave her enough practical experience. The jump to the workplace wasn't a shock. She thinks the eagerness of her youth makes her a good hire.

The WEF is an international, not-for-profit educational and technical organization of over 40,000 water experts. The article describes how BIA solved a major problem for the borough of Phoenixville, Chester County. The 60-ton, 50-foot diameter lid of a key part of the borough's sewer treatment system had tilted and wedged, putting an important portion of the sewage treatment plant out of operation. Estimates for repair went as high as $320,000. But a team of civil and structural engineers from BIA designed a plan that put the plant back in operation in a four-hour procedure that cost less than $10,000. The team placed air bags under the wedged lid and alternately raised and lowered liquid levels in the tank to jockey the lid free.

Some carriers are seeking dramatic premium increases and axing spousal discounts and lifetime benefits; others are coming out with new hybrid products; and still others are getting out of the product line altogether, citing its unprofitability and unpredictability.\One of the biggest changes is Genworth's announcement that it plans to ask state insurance departments to approve different premium rates for men and women -- rates that reflect women's higher likelihood of using the benefit.\The result is that women could be charged 40 percent more than men for a newly written policy.\""If you walk down the hall of an assisted living home, it's mostly ladies,"" said Rick Sabo, owner of RPS Financial Solutions in Gibsonia.

782,"
There couldn't be another strike in modern America that compares with the standoff now occurring between United Parcel Service and the Teamsters.
\
There isn't another such large, unionized company that could be shut down with effects so widely felt. There's not another union that could draw such attention to its fight.
\
And the stakes for all of organized labor are as big as the adversaries.
\
This strike is a battle over the role of part-time workers in the American workplace and the role of unions in the evolving, service-industry-driven national economy.
\
For those reasons, the AFL-CIO's new president, John Sweeney, is strongly backing the Teamsters. Sweeney's purpose is nothing less than ``trying to use the UPS dispute as a vehicle for showing the benefits of unions,'' said Charles Craver, a professor of labor law at George Washington University.
\
An outcome seen as positive for the Teamsters could help spur labor's fledgling attempts at a resurgence. A perceived defeat could do real damage.
\
``The issues on the bargaining table go to the heart of the economic anxiety so many Americans feel,'' said Harley Shaiken, a labor scholar at the University of California at Berkeley. ``We may well look back a decade from now and see the strike as a symbol of labor's resurgence.''
\
Or it may be seen as a sort of last stand by the labor movement, which has seen a steady decline in its share of the workforce - now down to about 10 percent in the private sector.
\
``The strike is only going to push the unions further downhill,'' said Leo Troy, a Rutgers University economist. Even a win for the Teamsters will be so marginal, he said, ``that workers involved will have to ask themselves at the end of the day, `Was it worth it?' ''
\
UPS is just the kind of service-oriented employer that unions must focus on if they are to survive.
\
In the past, when unions have tried to organize manufacturing companies, or demand a lot from them, those companies have sometimes responded by shutting down U.S. factories and opening new ones overseas. UPS, like many other service-oriented businesses, doesn't have that option. It can't go anywhere.
\
Beyond that, the part-time question is key. UPS has grown increasingly reliant upon part-timers - albeit relatively well-paid ones who receive some benefits - because the competitive environment dictates the flexibility that comes with using part-timers.
\
Nearly 60 percent of UPS workers are part-time, making an average of $11 an hour. In its last formal offer, the company proposed making about 11,000 of those workers full-time. But 90 percent of those jobs would come as other full-timers - who average nearly $20 an hour - retire or leave, meaning the structure of the workforce would be little changed.
\
Teamsters president Ron Carey, who began his career as a UPS driver in Queens, N.Y., has declared that American workers can't build a life on part-time work - even though surveys show that most part-time workers in the United States are part-time by choice - and that it's time to make a stand. He has called for a much larger increase in full-timers.
\
He has been joined by Sweeney, who has been championing a new, more militant union activism since his election two years ago.
\
``Because their fight is our fight, we are making this strike our strike,'' Sweeney said last week as he pledged $10 million a week in AFL-CIO loans to the Teamsters' strike fund. ``It's about part-time jobs and half-time pay. . . . And it's about a greedy, hugely profitable employer who wants to make even more money by shortchanging workers. . . .''
\
Company officials, for their part, say the strike has less to do with part-time jobs than with pension money.
\
In their view, the key issue is the union's resistance to the company's plan to create a new pension fund that would cover UPS employees alone - and take billions of dollars out of the Teamsters' control.
\
The strike also is, in some ways, a throwback to years past. Generations ago strikes shut down businesses and picket lines held firm. Companies did not hire replacement workers.
\
That changed in 1981, when the nation's air-traffic controllers walked out - and were fired by President Ronald Reagan.
\
With that strike, the etiquette of labor relations changed, with management realizing that replacement workers could be hired and that business, if not quite as usual, could go on. Strikes began to decline dramatically in both number and effect. In 1995, the number of strikes was the lowest it had been since the unions' heydays of the 1940s.
\
Thus far, at least, UPS seems to be playing by the old rules. While the company has said that as many as 15,000 jobs may have to be eliminated if the job action continues, it has not indicated - at least so far - that it will try to replace the 185,000 striking Teamsters.
\
UPS has generally enjoyed good relations with the Teamsters over the years, but in the last decade the company has seen increasing competition from rivals such as Federal Express Corp. and RPS Inc., which are nonunion. Those competitors have managed to stave off the unions, keeping their labor costs lower.
\
Labor's failure to organize those new companies is making the Teamsters' fight against UPS all the more difficult because there is credence for UPS's arguments that it needs flexibility to compete against nonunion companies.
\
But that has hardly dissuaded big labor. UPS's contract with the Teamsters has made for the biggest, most visible negotiations since Sweeney took over the AFL-CIO and attempted to reassert labor's influence. His allies, while acknowledging the risks in the UPS strike, see it as the perfect opportunity for the labor movement to go for a big victory.
\
``It's the right time and the right industry for the AFL to draw a line in the sand,'' said Michael Holland, a Chicago labor lawyer and former general counsel to the United Mineworkers Union. ``It's as good a chance as we'll see.''
\
Traditionally, unions have not had much success organizing service businesses. But some of labor's strongest efforts in recent years have been in organizing janitors and health-care workers - jobs that can't be moved away from where they're needed.
\
And success in the UPS strike could make the organizing efforts easier, some labor advocates said.
\
What's more, UPS is a company well-known among the public. Its brown trucks and brown-shirted drivers are familiar to nearly every American; in some offices that use UPS, the regular driver is virtually considered part of the staff.
\
For now, the Teamsters' arguments seem to be resonating with many Americans. Two polls last week showed the union getting more support than the company.
\
But that could easily change. If the strike should drag on, more and more small businesses that rely on UPS will suffer. Those businesses might have to lay off workers.
\
Such developments could swing public opinion toward UPS, said Thomas Kochan, a professor at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
\
``We're getting close to that,'' he warned late last week.
\
How it all plays out remains to be seen. But one thing is clear: UPS's huge share of the package-delivery business, its ample profits, its huge number of employees and its reliance on part-timers have made it the perfect target for labor's new militancy.

"
783," Michael Wozniak spends much of his work day at Federated Investors on the telephone, zipping from one sophisticated computer program to another as he answers questions from brokers about the mutual fund giant's investment products.\ ""With the technology we have here, everything is within a click,"" said Wozniak as he showed off the electronic tools he uses to quickly provide information on the markets and Federated's funds. ""It all goes very smoothly.""\ Wozniak, 33, may not realize it, but he is working in a growth industry for the Pittsburgh region: telephone- and computer-based customer service operations generically known as call centers.\ Many consumer product corporations have one or more of them. Some of the biggest are run by telephone and media companies, health insurers, banks and other financial institutions such as Federated.\ Like the factories of Pittsburgh's industrial heyday, the main allure of call centers to a community is jobs, lots of them. While exact figures are hard to come by, there are at least 12,000 call center employees in Pittsburgh and six surrounding counties.\ Customer service representatives who man telephones and computer stations represent the bulk of the hires. There is work, too, for supervisors and professionals in computer hardware and software and telecommunication equipment and services.\ ""You can have careers. You can have true careers,"" said Barry Reese, co-founder and president of Reese Brothers, one of the region's first successful telemarketing firms. ""The industry is quite a bit different than most people's perceptions.""\ The work and office environment varies depending on the center, but one constant is the use of computer technologies to distribute incoming calls and other work to the employees and to manage information about customers and products.\ The technology promotes efficiency and gives management great capacity to set the pace of work, to listen in, collect and analyze detailed records of performance and productivity.\ Supervisor checks and pacing, of course, are nothing new. Employers have manipulated the speed of work since Henry Ford revolutionized manufacturing with a conveyor-belt assembly line in 1913. The difference now is that computers and technology allow an employer to measure output down to the individual worker -- a recipe in some cases for on-the-job stress.\ ""You're being measured constantly,"" said Edith Harper, a veteran airline reservations agent who describes sitting in a cubbyhole, always tethered to the telephone except for lunch and two short breaks. ""You have to be on the ball 100 percent all day. It's very stressful.""\ Ed DiGamgi, who manages the EchoStar Communications call center in McKeesport, describes work in call centers as emotional labor rather than the physical labor common to the blue-collar jobs of yesteryear.\ ""This is work that engages the mind, and some people find it's not for them,"" he said.\ While Federated says it paces work to allow agents time to develop relationships with clients and maintain accuracy in big-dollar transactions, some centers push hard for on-the-phone productivity to moderate employee costs.\ When they're off the phone, Wozniak and others at Federated handle customer requests or queries that are scanned into the computer system and distributed. ""It is pretty manageable,"" he said.\ FedEx Ground, where 200 service representatives in Pittsburgh may each handle an average of 165 calls a day, has reinvented its system with technology that recognizes repeat callers and handles many routine tasks automatically.\ Savings as small as one second a day on every representative's call volume can quickly add up to the equivalent of a starting salary, perhaps $27,000 plus benefits, said Howard Schmid, senior manager of customer service.\ Although the technology speeds transactions, Schmid said his operators are expected to be sensitive to customers, whose livelihood may depend on FedEx deliveries, and are given authority to make service decisions on the spot.\ ""Customers today want to have that touchy-feely feeling,"" he said.\ Stress and call centers were highly publicized this summer during the strike against Verizon Communications, formerly Bell Atlantic. Customer service workers complained of forced overtime, sales quotas and constant monitoring by supervisors. The settlement with the Communications Workers of America capped overtime, limited monitoring for highly rated employees and set aside time each day for employees to complete paperwork.\ Typically, call center agents must account for all of their time and can risk suspension and firing if they are not productive enough or if they do not properly handle a customer and take every opportunity to make a sale.\ ""Literally, your career can end on one call,"" said John Vignovic, a Verizon sales agent who contends he loves his job. ""That's not the norm. But not everyone is perfect. You can make a flaw that is fatal.""\ Outbound centers, those that make unsolicited calls trying to sell aluminum siding, credit cards, insurance and cemetery plots, are rated by most observers as less attractive places to work than inbound centers, which typically handle customer queries or sales orders.\ The difficulty in the outbound business, of course, is that the job involves calling people and trying to sell them stuff when they may not want you to call them at all.\ People who aren't put off by making unsolicited sales calls, however, can excel at the challenge. Top performers at Time-Life Libraries Inc., Downtown, can earn $50,000 a year selling books, music and videos over the telephone.\ ""I think it's a very hard job to be nice on the phone all day, particularly on the outbound side, to get rejected so frequently,"" said Roger Kingsland, managing partner of KSBA Architects, a Pittsburgh firm that specializes in designing call centers. ""There's a high level of stress, a very high level of stress.""\ Barry Reese, the telemarketing entrepreneur, argues that stress is relative depending on the particular project and those involved. What may be seen as a stressful job to one person may be an attractive challenge for another.\ ""It's probably no more stressful than anybody [else's] job,"" he said.\ A call center boom\ There's no way of knowing exactly how many call centers there are since they vary in size, type and industry served.\ But everyone who pays attention to them agrees that the number is expanding -- both locally and nationally.\ Purdue University, which produces a respected annual benchmark report on the industry, estimates that there are between 50,000 and 75,000 call centers in the United States and another 50,000 in other countries.\ ""It's really hard to get a grasp, but there are a lot of them, and it's growing,"" said Richard Feinberg, a consumer science professor at Purdue's Center for Customer Driven Quality.\ The Pittsburgh Regional Alliance, a local economic development clearinghouse that has targeted call centers as a local growth industry, keeps an informal tally of about 30 that together employ more than 12,000 in the six-county metropolitan area.\ Several big operators have chosen Western Pennsylvania in the last few years, including EchoStar, the satellite television company, Denver-based Teletech Holdings and CallTech Communications of Columbus, Ohio.\ The newest is Precision Response Corp., a Florida company that specializes in telephone and e-mail customer service relations for American Express, AT&T, British Airways and other corporate clients. It set up shop in August in a former Service Merchandise store in West Mifflin, where it expects to employ 1,200.\ The region is ""starting to get more and more notice"" from call center operators, said Bernie McShea, senior vice president of business development for the Pittsburgh Regional Alliance.\ A few companies currently are considering the region as a site for new facilities or expansion, said Steve Morgan, regional director of the Governor's Action Team. He said word of employee productivity and employer loyalty in Pittsburgh is spreading around the industry.\ Pittsburgh's work ethic is usually noted as a plus. Precision Response cited the work force and educational attainment as reasons why it chose West Mifflin over about 100 other locations for its first center outside of Florida.\ ""We have a good population and a good base skill set for this type of job,"" Morgan said. ""They give Pittsburgh a serious look.""\ McShea, who came to Pittsburgh from the New York office of Deloitte & Touche/Fantus Consulting, a site-consulting firm, said call centers typically look for lower-cost office space or converted retail locations with lots of parking. He described the industry as rapidly evolving and driven by the trend toward outsourcing work considered to fall outside a corporation's core expertise.\ ""We've got a good balance between labor supply and demand,"" McShea said, noting that Virginia Beach, Va.; Tampa, Fla.; Phoenix Ariz.; and Charlotte, N.C., where call centers proliferate, are faced with more significant employee turnover.\ Pittsburgh-based Reese is building a new call center in Indiana, Pa., in the refurbished headquarters of the defunct Rochester & Pittsburgh Coal Co. Hiring is under way for an opening this month, with a target of 800 employees.\ ""There's a lot of planning to build a center right. It's like building a plant,"" Reese said. ""This is a substantial commitment. ... We expect to be there for the duration.""\ Although the investment in space and equipment is substantial, call centers can depart quickly.\ On Oct. 15, AT&T Wireless Services told employees it would shutter a national call center it developed in the Strip District two years ago, eliminating 385 jobs. The company will expand another center in Harrisburg.\ Other call centers, including EchoStar and AT&T Broadband, the separate cable and Internet business, quickly contacted AT&T Wireless to express interest in the employees who will lose their jobs.\ Moving up the pay chain\ EchoStar, which two years ago moved into a renovated former U.S. Steel pipe mill in McKeesport and quickly hired about 1,000 workers - - the first mass hiring for that old steel city in decades -- has not reached its goal of 2,000 yet. DiGamgi, the company's vice president of customer service and sales operations, blamed work force availability in a ""wonderful economy,"" another sign that the tight labor market is having an effect here too.\ Turnover is a crisis in the industry and is higher at EchoStar than DiGamgi would like. The company, he confirmed, has lost workers to Precision Response, although he said some had returned.\ Generally, call center jobs are not all that glamorous or high paying. Starting wages are usually above minimum wage yet relatively low. Specific earnings depend on the center, the type of business it does and the employee's experience.\ EchoStar pays $8 an hour to start, with annual merit reviews. Wages start at about $7 to $9 an hour in Fayette County, which has attracted Teletech Holdings and CallTech Communications. The call center industry now accounts for 1,200 jobs in the largely rural county, said Mike Krajovic, executive vice president of the nonprofit Fay-Penn Economic Development Council.\ He said the jobs included benefits and were a step up for many. Wages, he said, can go up to $20 for those with computer or other technical expertise.\ ""We're very pleased to have them in the area. We've been distressed for so long that there's a large number of people who are underemployed.""\ The Pittsburgh Regional Alliance, on the advice of a consultant, is targeting its call center efforts on the financial services and information technology industries. Those industries often require a college degree and pay better than other, less sophisticated centers.\ Federated Investors, for example, employs about 300 Downtown and in the North Hills and Rockland, Mass., at centers that service brokers, financial planners, registered investment advisers and corporate officers who buy the company's various investment products.\ A new recruit is expected to progress through three ""zones,"" or levels of competency, after a six-week training program that covers the company's products and computer systems. A new employee in the first zone can expect to earn about $24,000 to $31,000 a year. Top pay for the third zone is about $42,000. After that, pay is based on a merit system.\ Federated looks for people who can explain its products and accurately handle complex computer programs and financial transactions while maintaining a pleasant telephone personality. Managers know that one bad experience on the telephone can send a big- money customer elsewhere.\ ""We want our associates to learn the system, the process and responsibilities and move through those zones,"" said Philip Heltzel, senior vice president of client services. ""The sooner they're proficient, and they can move through as quickly as they want, the better off they are and the better off we are.""\ Because call centers are often the heart of a company's interaction with its customers, they can be a training ground where new employees learn a business, a company's products and its culture.\ FedEx Ground, formerly RPS, over the years has promoted hundreds of people from its 200-person call center in Moon to ""every department imaginable"" in the package delivery company, said Schmid, adding, ""We do use this as a stepping stone for other positions.""\ At EchoStar, DiGamgi estimated that 85 percent of the managers were internally promoted. EchoStar hires a coach for every 15 telephone workers and a manager for every 100.\ While there is a broad range of employers in the call center industry, from ""bottom suckers"" to ""high quality international companies,"" the best are spending more to make centers better places to work, said Kingsland, the architect.\ That means things such as indirect glare-free lighting, improved air quality and ergonomically designed furniture. Some consultants suggest break rooms, child care facilities and workout areas.\ Coupled with this drive for nice workplaces are continuous advancements in technology that are broadening the tasks that call centers perform.\ Some centers -- Precision Response and the new Reese Brothers center under construction in Indiana, for example -- are adding e- mail and the Internet to traditional telephone services.\ ""The feeling is we're at the beginning,"" Reese said. ""The Internet and the newfangled technology are just going to increase the potential business of the telemarketing industry."""
784,"Concept Sciences began as an entrepreneur's dream to break into an\questions it has yet to answer publicly. Now, however, there are theories about what happened that tragic night. The product's profit potential lured Irl Ward, but in his zeal, he had overlooked his workers' safety, according to the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

Sidebar `HYDROXLYAMINE BUSINESS PLAYERS' by THE MORNING CALL whicha ppeasred on A04, EIGHTH edition appended to end of text.\The explosion took five lives and one man's dreams. It bellowed beyond Lehigh County's borders and belched an ominous white cloud over much of Allentown. And when the dust settled, one man was left to face grieving families, government investigators and a gawking public.\Irl ""Chip"" Ward, a respected scientist and ambitious entrepreneur, had taken Concept Sciences Inc. from inception to operation in about two years. The infant Lehigh County company was created to produce a chemical that was profitable, but dangerous.\At the beginning of the year, Ward was just another Lehigh County businessman trying to make his mark in an industry dominated by chemical titans.\Now, at year's end, his name is connected with one of the Lehigh Valley's worst disasters and his company is reduced to a ditch in an overgrown lot.\With the one-year anniversary of the Feb. 19 blast little more than a month away, what went wrong is still under investigation by county, state and federal authorities.\Ward has refused to talk publicly about the explosion. But documents and interviews with other companies show the blast capped a two-year race to market a profitable chemical that was inherently dangerous. The explosion killed Ward's chances and scared off another competitor.\In the 10 months since, chemists have tried to figure out what could have caused such a catastrophic blast.\Ward wasn't alone in his quest to create the specialty chemical. Another American company and an international giant also were trying to produce higher concentrations of hydroxylamine, an old compound that had found new demand in the computer industry.\In his zeal, Ward had overlooked his workers' safety, according to the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration. He made his company competitive, but put his workers in jeopardy, OSHA found.\Ward convinced employees and investors that he had found a way to stabilize hydroxylamine, a chemical that is explosive under heat and at high concentrations.\Until then, only one company in the world made a 50 percent hydroxylamine, 50 percent water solution that was used to make nylon and pharmaceuticals, and was gaining popularity as a computer chip cleaner. Other companies steered clear of the product because its profit potential was linked to danger.\For 16 years, Nissin Chemical Co., Ltd., was the sole manufacturer of the chemical, which can explode if it gets too hot or left to crystalize at room temperature.\A small company in a rural area a few hours northeast of Tokyo, Nissin built its business foundation on highly concentrated hydroxylamine known as free base. In 1982, the product made up 5 percent of Nissin's sales. Last year, it accounted for 70 percent as demand for the chemical grew in all its markets, and especially in the computer industry, said Masaru Imai, Nissin president. The new demand enabled the company of 23 employees to increase sales by more than 200 percent between 1993 and 1998 to nearly $3.2 billion yen (about $31 million), according to Teikoku Databank in New York, which monitors the Japanese chemical industry.\Ward, who has a doctorate in organic chemistry, was familiar with hydroxylamine through his association with Ashland Chemical Co., a large chemical company in Dublin, Ohio, that made a hydroxylamine- based computer chip cleaner. The product's profit potential lured him and other entrepreneurs into a market that several companies had tried but failed to enter over the years.\While Ward was pitching a business plan for hydroxylamine production to Ben Franklin Technology Center in 1996, BASF, a German chemical giant, was preparing a pilot process. And Sachem Inc., a small Austin, Texas, company, also was considering the venture.\Because it takes only a drop of hydroxylamine to clean chips, the market for free base was tiny compared to that of petroleum or silicon, for example. But it was big enough for a small operation, such as Concept Sciences, to handle. In a 1997-1998 proposal for funding to Bethlehem-based Ben Franklin, a state-funded program that helps technology-related businesses grow, Ward listed total worldwide market value for free base at $30 million. He projected market growth at more than 25 percent a year.\Sales were bound to increase for a product that was considered a godsend by computer makers and users. The semi-conductor industry had been having problems effectively removing residues left on chips after the dry-etching process. Hydroxylamine solved the problem, said Jerry Koder, president of EKC Technology Inc., of Hayward, Calif. Like Ashland, EKC uses hydroxylamine to make a computer chip cleaner.\""It is a significant product for us,"" Koder said. ""It is not something that I would want to walk away from.""\To capture a piece of the market, Ward knew, Concept Sciences would have to undersell Nissin. To price the product competitively, he would have to cut production costs.\In a 1996-1997 proposal for Ben Franklin grants, Ward wrote, ""Concept Sciences will develop a unique, but simple two-three-step manufacturing process based on new concepts of ion-exchange and distillation technology to produce a low-cost superior purity domestic source for 50-HA ... ""\Seeking more Ben Franklin money the following year, Ward proposed developing ""a simplified, low-cost manufacturing process."" He wrote, ""Concept Sciences' simplified process for 50-HA manufacture will result in a superior quality product relative to trace metal contamination, at a very competitive price.""\The process would be a novel one, launched on the patents of Ward and Francis Michelotti. The two scientists had worked together at JT Baker in Phillipsburg before teaming up with businessman Shahri Naghshineh to open their own chemical company, Advanced Chemical Technologies, in 1987.\They sold the company to Ashland seven years later and the partnership dissolved.\Ashland, which was looking for a cheaper source of hydroxylamine, provided Ward with the means and motivation to make the concentrated chemical. Ashland lent Concept Sciences $200,000 for equipment purchases and agreed to buy all of its hydroxylamine -- which amounted to $4.5 million in purchases in 1997 -- from the new company.\Ward and Michelotti initiated the plan by applying for patents on an ion-exchange process that would stabilize hydroxylamine and a purification process aimed at making it cleaner. They launched a pilot project in a test lab at the company's offices at 450 Allentown Drive in the Allentown Business Park.\The company had experienced problems then that signalled the potential for catastrophe, OSHA noted in an August report that cited Concept Sciences for 20 violations and levied a $641,200 fine, a record in the Lehigh Valley.\In September 1997, heat and pressure built up in a cylinder, causing it to rupture, according to an OSHA report in August. The small explosion sounded fire alarms in the building. In November 1998, after Michelotti had retired, a glass vessel imploded. No one was injured in either event.\Concept Sciences forged ahead with full-scale production in a newly-rented 42,000-square-foot building at 749 Roble Road in Lehigh Valley Industrial Park III, Hanover Township.\While Concept Sciences was trying to perfect its process in 1997 and 1998, BASF, a German company with $30 billion in sales worldwide, patented a hydroxylamine production process and launched a pilot project at its Ludwigshafen headquarters. In a September 1997 news release, BASF announced it was jumping into the hydroxylamine market where most sales were in the United States.\""BASF claims there is rapidly growing demand which requires extensive know-how,"" the release said.\By 1998, after Ward had received nearly $200,000 in funding from Ben Franklin, BASF announced it would build a ""world scale hydroxylamine plant"" in Germany that would open in early 1999. In a news release, the company noted that ""output will be destined for the U.S. market.""\Concept Sciences had its eye on that same market and continued in its effort to become the ""first and only domestic supplier of 50-HA (hydroxylamine) serving multiple niche markets,"" as stated in a Ben Franklin grant proposal.\Ward drew 14 investors to the company, including his father, Irl E. Ward Sr. of Venice, Fla., who held significant shares, and Michelotti. Ben Franklin bought into it too, providing the company with $270,000 in grants over three years.\But another small American company was on Concept Sciences' heels. Sachem had given up its exclusive contract as Nissin's hydroxylamine distributor in the United States to take a crack at production.\""The market is sizable for a small company. It was attractive to Sachem because they market ultra-pure chemicals, that's their specialty,"" said Scott McCoy, who heads the company's market development department.\But Sachem was having trouble stabilizing the compound. Several other companies had run into the same problem over the years and had given up, Imai, of Nissin, said through a translator.\Hydroxylamine explodes when heated above 265 degrees, which is slightly higher than the boiling point of water. It can be explosive at concentrations greater than 70 percent, especially in the presence of heavy metals -- even traces found in water. At 50 percent, the compound is stable, but distillation, which requires heat, presents the potential for a rapid chemical reaction that can trigger an explosion.\In the lab, Sachem, the Texas company that once distributed hydroxylamine for Nissin, was able to keep the product stable. But the company couldn't figure out how to stabilize it during full- scale production.\""There was always a concern about stabilizing this product,"" McCoy said. ""In the lab, you can use things to stabilize that a customer wouldn't want in the commercial product.""\After Concept Sciences exploded on Feb. 19, Sachem quickly folded its hydroxylamine pilot project, leaving no American companies in a competitive position to produce the chemical.\""We were working on a way, but when the plant exploded in Allentown, we thought it wasn't worth the risk,"" McCoy, of Sachem, said.\With Concept Sciences and Sachem out of the picture, BASF became the only hydroxylamine maker to muscle in on Nissin's market. In mid- February, at about the time Concept Sciences exploded, BASF started full-scale hydroxylamine production. The company has had no mishaps with the new product line, said John Gilardi, a spokesman at BASF headquarters.\BASF had expected to hire seven workers to work the new hydroxylamine product line. The set-up is a minute part of the colossal company, which employs 44,000 people and 200 firefighters at the Ludwigshafen complex that covers about five miles.\BLAST THEORIES\Chemist Mary Gail Hutchins lives more than 50 miles from Concept Sciences and didn't hear the blast but has become intrigued by it. The Philadelphia University chemistry professor has been attending seminars, reading information on the Internet and devising theories of what could have caused the explosion.\She, like other experts, thinks the chemical boiled dry, meaning water boiled off and left high and dangerous concentrations of hydroxylamine still being heated.\""Once you have hydroxylamine with little water and a heat source, it will go. If the pump stopped and heat continued, you would boil off water and be left with pure hydroxylamine,"" she said.\Concept Sciences, which employed 14 at the time of the blast, said its explosion had nothing to do with the process Ward put into place. Without revealing the findings of an internal investigation, company spokeswoman Rosemarie Carr said what happened was ""an instantaneous and unanticipated event"" that occurred after the distillation process was completed.\She said the explosion was ""an industrial accident"" that the company could not have foreseen or avoided.\Imai, of Nissin, said the magnitude of the blast was consistent with what would happen if the hydroxylamine wasn't properly purified before distillation. The key is to keep heavy metal content low in the mother liquor, the liquid from which chemists distill, he said.\""We do not know what occurred at Concept Sciences,"" Imai said. ""We guess that the heavy metal content in the distillation mother liquor was so high.""\Ward acknowledged such a risk in a 1998 patent application. He and Michelotti wrote, ""It is a still further object of the invention to provide a purification system with a reduced hazard of explosion from rapid decomposition of hydroxylamine within the ion exchange cylinder.""\Heavy metals would have sped up a chemical reaction. Something else would have to have touched off an explosion. The evidence that would be needed to figure out exactly what happened, probably was destroyed in the blast, said Hutchins, who also is a member of the Lincoln Fire Company hazardous materials team in Montgomery County.\Hutchins said a number of things could have happened: The hydroxylamine could have heated beyond the capacity of the cooling system or the cooling system could have failed.\Perhaps the pump stopped delivering hydroxylamine and water in incremental amounts to the distillation tank, she said. Or maybe a runaway heater caused the water to boil off.\If metal ions were present, she said, they could be a catalyst for a rapid reaction -- an explosion.\One employee told OSHA that white crystals formed during the distillation and that the concentration of hydroxylamine was up to 86 percent. Crystals would signal trouble, Hutchins said.\""The fact that you see crystals at the top of the distillation vessel means your process is out of control,"" she said.\David Lesak, chief of Lehigh County's Hazardous Materials team, said, ""When it starts to dry out and crystals start to form, any breakage of those crystals can cause a detonation.""\Hydroxylamine's blast power is well documented. The U.S. Army tried to use a form of hydroxylamine as a liquid gun propellant between 1986-1996, but had trouble stabilizing the chemical.\""The reason that was abandoned was because the Army wanted to use 80 percent solutions, so you had to have an extremely controlled environment ... they could never find out how to to it exactly,"" said Steve Agnew, a physical chemist from San Diego who investigated a hydroxylamine-related explosion at the Hanford nuclear plant in eastern Washington five years ago.\While chemists say hydroxylamine becomes dangerously explosive at concentrations greater than 80 percent, Concept Sciences workers told OSHA they didn't know concentrations of that level were alarming. Workers understood hydroxylamine was corrosive and harmful if it came into contact with their eyes, but they were not informed the chemical has ""more energy than TNT,"" OSHA area director George J. Tomchick of Allentown said after releasing the August report. Tomchick would not be interviewed for this story under advice of the U.S. Attorney.\As part of the $641,200 OSHA fine, Concept Sciences was cited for not providing an indicator on the glass distillation unit to warn employees when dangerous crystals formed. Other citations addressed the company's failure to ready workers for things that could have gone wrong. Concept Sciences has denied the allegations and appealed the fine.\After reviewing OSHA's report and conducting his own research, Agnew said the cause of the blast went beyond a lack of training.\""Rather, there was some kind of extreme ignorance about explosive hazards in general and about the explosive hazards of hydroxylamine in particular,"" he said.\Agnew was surprised by several notes in the OSHA report. The Concept Sciences production system had no pressure-relief vent, according to the report.\""I simply do not understand how anyone would run a process with hydroxylamine without pressure relief venting all over the place,"" he said.\Agnew was also surprised that, according to OSHA, Concept Sciences had no written procedures for using a quench system to control a runaway reaction.\""What seems to be lacking in the citation note, though,"" Agnew said, ""is the reason why this quench was not performed at the first sign of trouble.""\Competitor Nissin did have such a procedure. Nissin is prepared to dump the chemical into a pool of water if a reaction gets out of hand. In 17 years of hydroxylamine production, the company has never had to do it, said Imai, Nissin's president.\Concept Sciences wasn't as prepared. An explosion leveled the plant, leaving in its place, a 12-by-20-foot crater big enough to swallow a compact car.\THE EXPLOSION\By nightfall on a frigid Feb. 19, Ward expected to see his dream realized. Concept Sciences was making its first big batch of commercial product and he was roaming the plant with video camera in hand, capturing the launch on a tape he planned to use in a sales pitch to European companies.\Ward left the plant about 7:45 p.m. At about the same time, Paul Wanamaker, a supervisor and trouble-shooter, was called in to work to address an unknown problem. A Concept Sciences employee so urgently wanted Wanamaker that two more calls were made to the supervisor's house while he drove to the plant.\After Wanamaker's arrival, the process, which employees had run through dozens of times, proceeded as chemist Amy Heller left the distillation area to take a phone call. Deliang Ding, another chemist who was working on distillation, went to the lunchroom to eat a pretzel. Three other night shift employees -- none degreed chemists - - were in the distillation area with Wanamaker when the plant imploded in a roar that rattled the Lehigh Valley at 8:15 p.m.\Four employees died in the blast: Wanamaker, Ruben Soto, Anthony Mondello and his son Paul. A fifth man, Terry Bowers, was killed by falling debris while working in an adjoining business. The explosion was so powerful, it ripped the shirt off one of the dead workers, leaving only the cuffs.\""This looks like it could have been a terrorist bombing scene,"" thought Lesak, the HazMat chief, upon seeing the site.\Heller and Ding, the only survivors, wouldn't be found for hours.\Heller was covered by boards and cement -- except for an arm. She was rescued by firefighters who saw her making a pointing gesture with her hand.\Ward remained on the site overnight, identifying the bodies of workers who had helped him build his company. He waited three days before appearing teary-eyed on television to answer press questions about the blast.\Ward, 50, of Lower Saucon Township, might be the only one with the answers, but he has refused to discuss the case publicly; he invoked his Fifth Amendment right so as not to incriminate himself rather than provide testimony to OSHA.\The only clue to the company's position came earlier this month when Concept Sciences added a pump dealer and pump maker as defendants to the lawsuit filed by a woman who was injured in a neighboring business.\Bill Shoemaker, a plumber who installed piping in the distillation system, dismissed the suggestion that distilling hydroxylamine put employees in danger.\""It wasn't dangerous,"" he said in July, three months after being hired as a full-time Concept Sciences employee.\Ward's employees have stood by him. Concept Sciences chemists Broadway, Heller and Danielle Wright issued a statement supporting him in August.\""`We do not believe he deliberately put us in harm's way,`' Broadway said. ""I never believed that, ever.`'\They described the atmosphere at the plant as family-like and said Ward was not to blame for what happened.\Heller and Ding went back to work for Concept Sciences after recovering from their injuries. Most of the company's other workers did the same. Employees of Concept Sciences have since formed a new company, PPT Research, to make and market a liquid grit to cut silicon computer wafers.\Ward, his vision reduced to a horrible memory, remains connected to Concept Sciences. He spent the night of the blast sifting through rubble with the county coroner. He spent the next 10 months sorting out lawsuits, fines and worker compensation claims.\* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\HYDROXYLAMINE BUSINESS PLAYERS\Concept Sciences Inc. -- Fledging Allentown chemical company was ready to carve its niche as the only American maker of a higher concentration of hydroxylamine, used in the making of pharmaceuticals and nylon and the cleaning of computer chips.
