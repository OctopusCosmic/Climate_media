0," Washington --- A group of senators introduced a resolution Wednesday to block a Bush administration plan that environmentalists say coddles industries responsible for mercury pollution.\ At issue is an Environmental Protection Agency move to install an industry-backed ""cap-and-trade"" plan in which power companies could buy and sell allowances for releasing mercury into the air from coal- burning power plants.\ Alarmed at evidence of fetal brain damage caused when pregnant women are exposed to mercury, more than 600,000 Americans have contacted the EPA in recent years, objecting to plans to set up the pollution-swapping system.\ Although supporters of the Senate resolution acknowledged that it may never pass, the measure has more than enough sponsors --- 32 --- to force a vote by the full Senate.\ An identical resolution was introduced late Wednesday in the House, with five co-sponsors, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California.\ ""It will be an uphill fight, but this is our best opportunity to hold senators accountable on this very important issue,"" said Felice Stadler, a mercury specialist at the National Wildlife Federation.\ Spokesmen for electric power interests that lobbied hard for the cap-and-trade plan ridiculed the resolution.\ Scott Segal, head of a lobbying organization that represents Southern Co. and other coal-burning utilities, called it ""yet another attempt to gum up the works of mercury regulation in the United States.""\ ""Even though the senators argue for faster regulation of mercury emissions, today's petition is a recipe for delay and uncertainty in federal mercury policy, much to the detriment of the American people,"" said Segal, director of the Electric Reliability Coordinating Council.\ Dan Riedinger, spokesman for the Edison Electric Institute, a trade group for the electric power industry, said the stringent regulation anticipated in the Clinton administration declaration would not have held up in court.\ ""Had the agency adhered to this plan as critics of the current rule would have preferred, the resulting regulation would have fallen in the courts like a house of cards in a hurricane,"" he said.\ EPA spokeswoman Eryn Witcher said the resolution ""threatens to delay the world's first mercury regulation on power plants --- a regulation that will cut harmful emissions by 70 percent nationwide.\ ""EPA and the Bush administration continue to feel strongly that we must act now to effectively reduce mercury emissions from power plants,"" she said.\ If passed by both the House and Senate, the resolution would overturn a regulation that the EPA used to rescind a Clinton administration declaration requiring reduction of mercury emissions from coal-burning electric power plants.\ The Senate ""resolution of disapproval"" was introduced Wednesday under the Congressional Review Act, a law passed as part of the Republican Contract with America to give Congress a simple means of vetoing regulations imposed by federal agencies.\ Chief sponsors were Sens. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Susan Collins (R- Maine) and James Jeffords, a Vermont independent. Senators from California, Hawaii, Oregon, Minnesota and other states signed on as co-sponsors.\ Complaining that Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Chairman James Inhofe (R-Okla.) had refused to hold ""a single hearing"" on the EPA mercury rule, Leahy said the administration and Senate Republican leaders had tried ""to avoid any public daylight"" on the matter.\ ""Their aim is to keep the public in the dark, and I would guess that most Americans in fact do not know what EPA and the big polluters have been up to with this rule.""\ Senate rules require a floor vote on the resolution if 30 senators request it.\ CAPTION: KEN CEDENO / Bloomberg News Sen.

2," Washington --- President Bush outlined a collection of energy efficiency measures Thursday that he said will deal with global warming and result in a lower rate of increase of ""greenhouse gases"" that are released.\ Under the Kyoto Protocol, which was negotiated by more than 100 nations in Japan in 1997, the United States would be required to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to 7 percent below 1990 levels.\ The Kyoto treaty, negotiated by the Clinton administration, was never ratified by the Senate. After taking office last year, Bush rejected the agreement.\ Under Bush's plan, the United States would increase its greenhouse gas emissions by about 14 percent during the next decade --- roughly the same amount that emissions increased during the past decade.\ Bush said his plan called for a reduction of ""greenhouse gas intensity,"" or the quantity of carbon dioxide, methane and other atmosphere-warming gases.\ If the president's targets are met, for each dollar in economic growth the country achieves during the next decade, the amount of greenhouse gas going into the air will go up by 72 percent as much as it would if there were no efficiency improvements.\ The heart of the plan is to encourage companies to voluntarily slow the growth in their greenhouse gas emissions by giving them ""credits"" that could be cashed in at some time in the future if the government decided to impose mandatory reductions.\ Bush's other proposal Thursday, a ""cap-and-trade"" plan for controlling air pollution by power plants, has been promoted by the industry since before Bush took office in January 2001. Utilities want such a system to replace a provision of the Clean Air Act known as ""new-source review.""\ The Clean Air Act exempted hundreds of older power plants and other industries from the tightest controls on sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. However, the new source review provision states that if significant modifications are made to those older facilities, they become subject to the reduction requirements.\ In lawsuits filed during the Clinton administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and representatives of several Northeastern states accused power companies of disguising modernization as routine maintenance to evade the rules.\ The companies have chafed under the lawsuits, and a White House energy task force chaired by Vice President Dick Cheney recommended last year that the policy be reviewed. The administration did not disclose its plans for the new-source review provision Thursday. An announcement is expected next week.\ A senior administration official who described the cap-and-trade plan to reporters said the electric power industry would be put on notice that by 2018, national emissions of three pollutants --- nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide and mercury --- must be below specified limits.\ The White House said the plan will reduce sulfur dioxide emissions to about 3 million tons a year by 2018, from about 11 million tons this year. Nitrogen oxide emissions would go from 5 million tons this year to 1.7 million tons in 2018; mercury pollution would drop from 48 tons to 15 tons.\ Information from Scripps-Howard News Service was used in this article.\ Credit: COX WASHINGTON BUREAU"
3,"Yes: Tough caps would likely curb pollution and cool warming\By William Buzbee and Victor B. Flatt\Congress is beginning to grapple with climate change. Reps. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) and Ed Markey (D-Mass.) have introduced a bill that would establish a cap-and-trade mechanism for significant reductions in U.S. global warming emissions. The bill is smart and comprehensive, covering energy, fuels, cars and more. Despite some shortcomings, it's a good place to start the discussion about how to fix the most serious environmental problem the planet has ever faced.\Polluting industries have mounted a scare campaign to persuade us that it's too severe, will cost jobs, choke the economy --- the same complaints we hear every time industry worries about being inconvenienced. But the truth is that in important ways, the bill doesn't go far enough.\The core of the bill is a cap-and-trade system, under which big polluters will acquire allowances that would permit them to emit greenhouse gases --- carbon dioxide, for example. If polluters emit less than anticipated, they can sell excess ""credits"" to other polluters, who can use them to effectively raise their own caps. The question is where the caps are set, and the bill ultimately sets the cap considerably above the levels recommended by scientists and international negotiators. The effort will be for naught if developing countries such as China balk at emissions targets because they believe the United States isn't shouldering its fair share.\The bill also embraces the sorts of offsets we've already seen in the markets, where a product's associated greenhouse gases are ""offset"" by carbon absorption from say, planting trees. Polluters could buy carbon offsets --- from wind farms, for example --- and use the saved emissions as a credit against their own emissions. The bill also discounts offset-created pollution rights with respect to ordinary allowances. This gives polluters sound incentives to cut their own emissions, and it adjusts offset credits to account for risks that offsets aren't as beneficial as hoped. But the bill needs to do better to ensure that environmental harms associated with offsets can be addressed.\Industry is hoping that a federal bill will have a generous cap and that it will preempt state efforts. Waxman-Markey would indeed require states to surrender their own cap-and-trade markets for five years, but otherwise preserves the possibility of state legislation. In addition, the draft bill's language needs to be strengthened to ensure states retain their usual powers to otherwise protect their citizens and the environment. Without such clarification, wasteful litigation over retained state power is likely.\One reason a cap-and-trade scheme makes sense is that it doesn't really matter where carbon emissions occur; it's the cumulative effect that matters. Unfortunately, the co-pollutants that go up the smokestack with carbon dioxide can have a severe impact on nearby communities, and those communities are usually poor. And since some polluters will accumulate credits or offsets allowing them to burn more fuel, there's good reason to worry about ""hot spots"" where co-pollutants get out of control.\April brought news that climate change has brought a major ice shelf in the Antarctic to the verge of collapse, while a six-year-long study by NASA concludes that Arctic ice is melting faster than thought. Climate change is upon us, and Waxman-Markey could be the vehicle by which the United States finally takes action.\William Buzbee, a law professor at Emory, and Victor B. Flatt, University of Houston Law Center, are scholars with the Center for Progressive Reform.\No: Caps could hinder jobs, energy sector in U.S. economy\By Donald Hertzmark\Congress is about to debate a bill that promises to remake the most fundamental resource in the U.S. economy: energy. In this, we might learn a few things:\> Energy is the largest sector of the U.S. economy, even greater than the primary energy output of the Middle East, including the Persian Gulf oil producers.\> Jobs that leave the U.S. because of cap and trade will result in more pollution worldwide than if those jobs remained here.\> The revenue base for cap and trade is only temporary, as the bill promises to kill the industries that fund the permits.\> The replacement jobs in renewable energy pay far less than do the jobs in primary energy and manufacturing that will be lost.\As California has shown, premature zeal about carbon dioxide reductions can be a big job killer. For states with a lot of heavy industry and power generation, cap-and-trade legislation, in which climate costs would be distributed across regions and income groups, is likely to force wholesale shifts in economic activity. But where will these jobs go? And will the world's environment be better or worse off?\All indications are that cap-and-trade will lead to wholesale shifts in jobs to nonparticipating countries that decline to sign a climate-change treaty. China is a nonparticipant. When industry moves to China, its carbon dioxide emissions will go up compared to the U.S. China's economy as a whole uses about twice as much energy per dollar of GDP as the U.S. manufacturing sector. This means that energy-related emissions will double or more due to this shift in activity. Moreover, since China relies on coal for almost 70 percent of its primary energy, compared to 32 percent in the United States, not only carbon dioxide, but many other emissions will more than double.\A skilled U.S. workforce will eventually find something else to make. Unfortunately, as a recent University of Massachusetts study found, the average wage in ""green energy"" jobs is about 65 percent of that in the industrial and energy jobs that are lost.\Alas, only the lawyers will do well, for cap-and-trade promises to ignite a global trade war, one already promised by Secretary of Energy Steven Chu. The cap-and-trade bill specifically permits the government to levy carbon fees on imports from non-complying countries, such as China. Such duties are contrary to world trade agreements and will lead to endless litigation and, possibly, a trade war with China, our country's largest creditor.\Europe tried cap-and-trade for its carbon dioxide program a few years back, allocating permits by firm and industry. For a few years there was a thriving market in these tradable permits, mostly to sell excess carbon dioxide permits, purchased from firms that had not used up their allowances, or to ""offset"" emissions in Europe with reductions in other countries, by investing in various clean energy projects elsewhere. When it was discovered that the initial allocation of permits had been far higher than Europe's industries actually generated, the price of permits collapsed.\Proponents in the U.S. claim that they have learned these lessons. Perhaps, but are we really serious about tacking on new costs to already struggling industries such as autos and primary metals? Or will we find a way to make special considerations for weak industries, and regions, and states? And pretty soon we will be back to the European system that reduced carbon dioxide by not one bit, but produced a whirlwind of regulations and trading activity.\Donald Hertzmark, an energy economist, consults for government and oil, gas and power businesses.\CAPTION: Donald Hertzmark, an energy economist, consults for government and oil, gas and power businesses.

4," At long last, President Bush is acknowledging air pollution and global warming as very real threats to the environment and human health. It's disappointing then, if not surprising, that his plan for fixing these problems may make matters worse.\ In a Valentine's Day speech that set the hearts of power industry executives aflutter, the president announced his ""Clear Skies"" initiative to reduce pollutants linked to thousands of premature deaths and respiratory ailments in the United States. These pollutants also have contributed to intractable air and water quality problems in metro Atlanta and other smog-choked communities.\ Bush's incentive system would give operators of coal-fired power plants and other regulated facilities permits for each ton of pollution they emit. If a company reduces emissions below its permit level (by installing better equipment, for example), it would rack up transferrable credits that could be traded to another company that exceeded its quota.\ By 2018, Bush says, this cap-and-trade system would significantly lower emissions of the most harmful smokestack pollutants: nitrogen oxides, sodium dioxide and mercury. Left unsaid is that Bush's pollution targets are far higher than benchmarks already set forth in the federal Clean Air Act.\ Just last September, the Environmental Protection Agency found that ""business-as-usual"" enforcement of the CAA would result in a 1.25 million-ton cap on nitrogen oxide, a 2 million ton cap on sulfur dioxide and a 7.5-ton cap on mercury by 2012. Bush's plan would raise those caps to 1.7 million tons, 3 million tons and 15 tons, respectively --- and take six years longer to achieve.\ On the global warming front, Bush wants to reduce ""greenhouse gases"" that are slowly heating the planet like a Crock-Pot. But Bush has rejected the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which would have committed the United States and other industrialized nations to mandatory reductions of greenhouse emissions. Instead, he's proposed a voluntary approach that would provide no enforcement mechanism. Even in the unlikely event that Bush's reduction targets were met, we would still be releasing far more greenhouse gases than a decade ago. That's not real progress, and the president must know that.\ While Bush was dubbed a hero on the anti-terrorism front, he's taken a drubbing as a defender of the environment. It doesn't help that his vice president is stubbornly refusing to divulge information about utility companies he met with last year while formulating energy policy.\ It's unfortunate that Bush has chosen to reward his old buddies in the business when he could have called for stricter enforcement of the Clean Air Act, advocated for higher fuel efficiency standards for passenger vehicles and boldly led the nation toward cleaner, more sustainable sources of energy.\ Credit: STAFF"

President Obama's cap and trade legislation is a scam. He says carbon dioxide (CO2) destroys the environment. Yet we all exhale CO2. Does this mean we're causing pollution with every breath we take?
\
But Obama's legislation doesn't suggest we stop breathing ... at least not yet.
\
The cap and trade bill permits private businesses to continue emitting CO2 if they buy something called ""carbon credits"" to offset the so-called pollution. So, the government is selling air.
\
Not to be left out, the commodities markets jumped on board and will list carbon credits along with oil, wheat, cattle and other commodities. Traders will happily be buying, selling and trading air.
\
Carbon credits, air, might just be the only intangible on the commodities market. We can't see or touch a unit of CO2. But the government created it and will determine the prices. However, demand in the commodities market may drive prices up, sort of a nightmare scenario for private businesses forced to buy the carbon credits.
\
I never thought I'd see the day when a U.S. president could convince Congress that they could make money by selling air. Has he also convinced the people that this is somehow legitimate? If so, we are witnessing the biggest scam ever perpetrated on the nation.

How kind of Tom Barton to credit Amnesty International with the U.S. Supreme Court decision to order an evidentiary hearing for Troy Davis (""Merry-go-round still spins in cop killing,"" Aug. 22).
\
It is flattering, yet troubling, to think the nation's highest court would be persuaded by ""smoke and mirrors"" rather than the legal principles and compelling facts that are the backbone of this case.
\
Seven of the nine original witnesses have changed their testimony in sworn affidavits. One of the two has been implicated as the actual shooter. This principal alternative suspect admitted to possessing a .38 caliber handgun. Someone swore to seeing him frantically hide a gun shortly after Officer MacPhail's murder. As for the shell casings that Mr. Barton references, these merit reexamination given that the murder weapon was never found and significant testimony discredits their link to Davis.
\
While it's true that Davis has had access to the legal process, no court has ever examined the witnesses themselves. At each stage the courts have deferred to technicalities and procedures.
\
Far from giving Davis a Get Out of Jail Free Card, the U.S. Supreme Court has set an incredibly high bar for Davis to prove his innocence. Still, the evidentiary hearing could finally provide a fair legal venue to scrutinize the evidence. Amnesty International will remain vigilant. After all, a man's life and the reputation of the justice system itself are on the line.

LEFTISTS DISDAIN DISSENT FROM RIGHT

David Nagle expresses consternation about concerned citizens actually yelling and gesturing at politicians during town hall meetings. He believes that they are immature and out of control. (""Republicans are tantrum-throwing babies,"" Aug. 24)
\
I wonder if Mr. Nagle is old enough to recall a radical left group in the late 1960s and '70s calling themselves The Weathermen? Leaders of the group, Bill Ayers and Bernadette Dohrn, were pals of our current president. They were against our nation's involvement in halting the spread of communism in Vietnam. They yelled and gesticulated, but went well beyond that when they bombed the United States Capitol building and the Pentagon.
\
Personally, I hope this national dissension doesn't reach that level. However, our national leaders must realize that the majority of the citizenry is fed up with elite politicians telling us what we really need. Our country was founded on individual rights and our citizens have profited over the years by individual efforts. The current government is trying to take those rights away from us and wants to install a system of governance that has been proven not to work anywhere in the world.

It was for this reason a court of law is one of three branches of government established to base judgments on constitutional law in preventing the executive branch from overstepping its boundaries.

Twice, Judge Turner had the opportunity to get it right.
\
His ruling that the city could continue construction during a property dispute indicates government is not held accountable by law.

Therein lies the problem.
\
In a democracy, government cannot rule outside or above law while citizens are subject to law. Constitutional rights are to be protected by government, not taken; courts of law are charged with the responsibility to ensure freedom from tyranny.

New state restrictions on power plants' mercury emissions are expected to gain approval today from the Board of Natural Resources.
\
And while they go further than federal standards, they are still too weak in the eyes of some environmental groups.
\
Georgia is one of several states moving to pass rules tougher than those adopted by the federal Environmental Protection Agency.
\
Under the regulations approved Tuesday by the board's Environmental Protection Committee, the state would require the use of specific air-cleaning equipment at new power plants and nearly half of the 32 existing coal-fired utility boilers in Georgia by 2015. The hope is that the technology would slice emissions of mercury, a powerful neurotoxin, by 75 to 85 percent.
\
""We have succeeded in doing what we needed to do in Georgia in protecting our environment from the mercury emissions,"" said Heather Abrams, chief of the air protection branch of the state Environmental Protection Division.
\
Committee chairman Tom Wheeler also praised the rule.
\
""This is certainly a great improvement (over) where we are now,"" he said.
\
Some environmental groups, however, said the rules should be tougher still.
\
While conceding that ""the environmental community in Georgia is somewhat divided over this rule,"" Ogeechee-Canoochee Riverkeeper Executive Director Chandra Brown decried the fact that the rule doesn't limit emissions from individual smokestacks. Instead, it sets up a ""cap-and-trade system"" where total emissions are capped but individual plants with higher emissions can trade or buy credits issued to plants that beat the standards.
\
Abrams acknowledged the environmental complaints.
\
""Instead, we elected to go with a technology standard and not set emissions limits,"" she said.
\
Under a cap-and-trade system, power plants can use credits to legally put more mercury into the air as long as there were cuts elsewhere.
\
That could lead to ""hot spots,"" environmentalists argue, where emissions would be too high even though the overall industry was technically meeting the standards. Mercury collected in the air often makes its way into rivers and other bodies of water, then into fish. People who eat the fish then absorb the mercury.
\
The problem could be especially acute in the slow-moving rivers of south Georgia, environmentalists say, where the waters more easily absorb the mercury and where many of the plants exempted from the rules are located.
\
""We want to be able to eat all the fish we regularly catch from all waters at all times,"" Brown said. ""Nothing less is acceptable.""
\
Environmental groups also said the rule doesn't provide a robust enough system for tracking how much mercury is being absorbed into the atmosphere, something that will make it difficult to determine whether the rules are working.
\
""We would like to know how much mercury is actually being reduced,"" said Alexandra Adams, policy director for the Upper Chattahoochee Riverkeeper.

""If you dispute the overwhelming scientific understanding that we humans are significantly exacerbating climate change, evidence is unlikely to change your opinion."" - Laura Tyson, dean of the College of Business, University of California.
\
If you accept the scientific consensus, you should know that economists of all political persuasions agree a carbon tax is the most efficient way to reduce carbon combustion.
\
Fossil fuel combustion causes ground level ozone accumulation, acid rain, global warming and other problems. Economists have found two market-based ways to reduce the emissions: the carbon tax and a cap-and-trade system.
\
In a carbon tax application, a tax is levied on how much carbon is released through fossil-fuel combustion. This enables the price of the fuel to reflect the full cost of its impact on the environment.
\
Normal market pricing allows buyers and sellers to negotiate a price based on the private costs and the private benefits. In the normal market, costs imposed on society (called negative externalities) are ignored.
\
As a society, we do understand this concept. For example, when we purchase a new battery for an automobile, we are charged for the proper disposal of the old one. We place an extra tax on cigarettes to reduce their consumption and to pay for the negative health impact of smokers on health care costs.
\
Raising the price of fossil-fuel combustion has several benefits. It encourages efficient use by everyone (utilities, businesses and consumers).
\
A recent study found that people in Sweden use half the energy per capita compared to Americans. Why? Because higher energy prices in Sweden causes its more efficient use.
\
This is basic economics. We humans waste what is cheap but economize on what costs us more. Making carbon combustion more expensive assures more competitive options for alternative energy sources, thereby causing less environmental harm.
\
The cap-and-trade system is more complex. First, government decides how much carbon effluents may be omitted in a region. Then, it auctions the right to omit carbon pollution during the year.
\
Firms that emit the pollution bid against each other for the right to pollute. Economists like this method because it allows firms to decide whether to pay to pollute or to clean up their process in order to omit less pollution.
\
Firms with the most expensive clean-up costs would most likely purchase the pollution permits. Those with lower clean-up costs would rather avoid the costs of the permits and reduce their emissions.
\
The total actual costs would therefore be minimized. Expensive ones would be avoided, and the cheap ones would be financed to avoid the permit costs. The implementation of this process, however, requires constant government monitoring of pollution emissions (to eliminate cheating) and annual operation of the permit auctions.
\
The argument against both options is clear. Higher costs for energy would decimate the economy. Some of the pessimistic projections ignore the ability of our economy to transform itself into a more energy efficient mode.
\
The potential economic costs have swung political momentum against both the carbon tax and the cap-and-trade system.
\
Economists have proposed ways to reduce or eliminate the negative impacts of the carbon tax on the economy. The key is what to do with revenue collected from the tax on carbon emissions.
\
Adele Morris of the Brookings Institute has proposed that 15 percent of a $16 per ton tax on carbon emissions could be used to make lower income households whole. Another idea is to use the carbon tax revenue to cut corporate income tax rates from 35 to 28 percent.
\
Conservative economist Gary Becker advocates returning the revenue directly to taxpayers by lump sum or per capita rebates.
\
The simplest proposal comes from Henry Jacoby and John Riley from the MIT Business School. They say the revenue from the carbon tax should be used to reduce the tax rates for all tax payers.
\
By lowering these tax rates, all consumers would be able to pay the higher prices for goods and services without losing any actual purchasing power. In this way, there would not be economic losses, but there would be substantial environmental improvements.
\
Economic policy debates in Congress are being hijacked by ideological blinders. We all suffer from decisions driven by dogma. Economists rarely find consensus on big questions. Here we have one: the carbon tax.
\
We recently learned that China, a growing source of carbon emissions, will impose a carbon tax on their producers. We cannot afford to be behind them on this. Their firms will have a head start adjusting to the new reality. \ Kenneth Zapp, PhD, is a professor emeritus at Metropolitan State University, an adjunct professor at Savannah State University and a mentor for SCORE Savannah.

More than two dozen parents and their children showed up for the rides and to hear the group's underlying message of opposition to future legislation aimed at reducing emissions too quickly and haphazardly.
\
""We are concerned about the environment,"" said Tim Phillips, president of the non-profit. ""But we want to make sure that while we are protecting the environment, we are not hurting families with higher gasoline prices and home energy prices and other necessities.""
\
Phillips said more drilling for oil in the U.S. is one way to reduce prices at the pump.
\
Economics and environmental experts said the so-called cap-and-trade legislation, which both presumptive presidential candidates have said they would support, undoubtedly will increase prices.
\
Cap-and-trade is a system in which polluters could meet limits on greenhouse gases by either reducing emissions on their own or buying credits from efficient producers.
\
But one observer indicated higher prices might not be a bad thing if their effect is to achieve a cleaner environment.
\
""Charging a carbon tax will make things more expensive,"" said Dr. Richard McGrath, an associate professor of economics at Armstrong Atlantic State University. ""If it doesn't, it won't have any effect.""
\
McGrath said that in the long run, when all industries make the switch to more environment-friendly production processes, the prices of goods and services for both consumers and businesses will begin to level off.
\
Phillips and his entourage are traveling to about 40 locations - including Marietta; Jacksonville, Fla.; Birmingham, Ala., and Nashville, Tenn. Members plan to stage a protest at former vice president Al Gore's home.
\
""We are saying that the legislation they want to pass, their remedy, is going to cause great alarm for the average Americans and the economy at large,"" Phillips said. ""We need to not hurt the prosperity we have here in America.""
\
Patrick DeMouy, a lecturer at the Moore School of Business at the University of South Carolina, said carbon dioxide is just one of the greenhouse gases that needs to be dealt with, and that methane is another gas that deserves a closer look.
\
""At the end of the day, it's going to be a little more expensive,"" DeMouy said, ""But hopefully, we can produce less waste.""

Believers in man-made global warming consider anathema from Gore anyone who dares question basic assumptions of their faith, or to point out the inconvenient truths revealed by those Climategate emails. (Collusion among scientists to doctor numbers and muscle any dissension out of scientific journals.)
\
That such researchers rely on government funding to pay rent and buy Saabs - and that funding might dry up if the Warmers' decibel level decreased - is absent from the Left's discussions on the environment. It's a curious oversight, considering Obama Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel's statement of doctrine: Never let a good crisis go to waste.
\
The taxpayer-funded scientists, as natural allies of the big-government Left, are simply following Rahm's playbook.
\
That the global warming scare nicely dovetails into Democrats' desire to loop tentacles around an expanding array of industry and aspects of Americans' lives further solidifies the Left's support for government-driven solutions to this dubious problem.
\
Envisioned in the Democratic ""solutions"" are intrusions into individual liberties such as those included in the Waxman-Markey bill passed out of the House last June (like how high to set your hot tub).
\
But the incestuous embrace between global warming alarmists and the statists now in power will mean more than the sprouting of a stink-blossom garden of government busybodies. It will mean a real, hurtful impact on Georgians.
\
The cap-and-trade portion of the Waxman-Markey bill aims to slash greenhouse gas emissions to 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 and by 80 percent by 2050. It would attempt this by selling emission credits to industries, which could then resell the credits to others if they fall below emission limits.
\
Here's the problem: Americans rely on fossil fuels for 85 percent of their energy. Everything you buy will become more expensive should cap-and-trade be signed into law.
\
According to a study headlined by Dr. David Kreutzer, research fellow in energy economics and climate change at the Heritage Foundation, energy prices would immediately increase upon such a measure's passage. By the year 2035, the average family in Georgia would be paying about $3,200 in electricity costs per year. That's $1,200 more than they'd pay without the Democrats' tax on energy.
\
And they could really use that money to buy their more-expensive gasoline.
\
According to the foundation's data analysis, gas prices would remain just under $3 a gallon without cap-and-trade. Should the measure pass, expect costs to hurtle past $4 a gallon by 2035.
\
These higher energy prices will drag down the state economy: An average of 38,389 Georgia jobs lost per year for the study period between 2012 and 2035. And the impact gets worse over time. According to Heritage Foundation estimates, cap-and-tax would kill 80,000 Georgia jobs in 2035 alone.
\
What will those sacrificed livelihoods buy us? Not much.
\
When factored into the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's future emissions scenarios, Waxman-Markey reduces global temps by a whopping 0.09 degrees Fahrenheit.
\
For Georgia and the rest of the nation, cap-and-trade schemes are too expensive and too intrusive to enshrine this bad idea into law.

11," My candidate for the most difficult story in America to decipher is anything related to the environment.\ Because the issues are complex, because the science often relies on models and assumptions and because the debate occurs at the extremes, it is virtually impossible to know the truth.\ And most stories intended for a general audience, regardless of the medium, rarely contain enough information for readers or listeners to assess the threat.\ The information commonly comes in two parts. First, a fact is declared. Usually it is some planned government action or some environmental event. The fact is followed, then, by the screeches of professional ready-by-the-phone activists asserting doomsday or corruption.\ Next comes the target's obligatory denial that he, his company or his administration is a scoundrel, liar and cheat --- though of course the presentation suggests otherwise.\ One of those scoundrels, Environmental Protection Agency administrator Michael Leavitt, came to town Tuesday, the day after signing what he declared to be the nation's ""first-ever regulations addressing mercury emissions from power plants.""\ As he explained here, the question of whether to brand mercury a toxin was mandated under the Clean Air Act to be made by 1994. ""Mercury is clearly a toxin and a dangerous one,"" he said, but no decision was made by 1994. Six years later and ""10 days before they [the Clinton administration] left office, they signed a proposed finding that it was and said the next administration can decide the standard,"" Leavitt said.\ When the Bush administration announced a cap-and-trade approach to reduce mercury emissions by 70 percent over the next 11 years, it was routinely cast as a sellout to the power industry. The first sentence of one wire service story declared that the administration ""is proposing to abandon the idea of treating mercury as a toxic substance requiring maximum pollution controls, favoring instead a plan that . . . ""\ The casual reader can be forgiven for thinking the administration ""is proposing to abandon the idea of treating mercury as a toxic substance."" No such proposal existed.\ At issue, specifically, is whether new technology is capable of reducing mercury emissions from power plants by 90 percent by 2007. Leavitt says no; activists say yes. The first full-scale testing at a power plant by the Department of Energy started in 2000 at Southern Co.'s Plant Gaston in Alabama. First phase testing achieved an 80 percent reduction. The second is under way.\ Similarly, the conflict between activists and regulators is which approach is best. As ratepayers who will ultimately absorb the cost, we should want risk and cost analysis applied to every threat and every proposed solution.\ No question mercury poses risk. But some perspective is in order. As is often the case, it's Harold Brown, author of ""The Greening of Georgia,"" who provides it. Brown is a retired University of Georgia professor who spent six years gathering environmental data, attempting to provide some context for the steady diet of environmental sensationalism.\ He had no preconceived agenda --- except that what he was hearing seemed inconsistent with what he observed or thought to be true. The result was the book published by Mercer University Press. Southern children of my generation doused themselves in mercurochrome and Merthiolate, which are up to 25 percent mercury, for cuts and scrapes. Dentists filled teeth with it and it was used to treat syphilis, as a laxative and for other health-related treatment.\ Children took the elemental mercury from broken thermometers to turn pennies silver. ""One of the odd ironies of mercury use is that an element now taken so seriously as an environmental pollutant was, for more than a thousand years, valued as a medicine,"" Brown said.\ His bottom line: It's a poisonous heavy metal that causes damage to the central nervous system and the kidneys. But because of industrial controls, domestic use fell by 70 percent from 1980 to 1993, environmental release probably more. He's not Pollyanna. He's a scientist lumbering through the evidence to paint a whole picture. His report is available at www.gppf.org.\ Before we jump off the deep end, a dose of Brown is always warranted. In fact, on most environmental issues about which alarmists scream, a dose of Brown is necessary to put what we're reading and hearing into context.\ Jim Wooten is the associate editorial page editor. His column appears Sundays, Tuesdays and Fridays.\ jwooten@ajc.com\ Credit: STAFF"
12,"
Environmentalists are citing approval last month by the Public Service Commission of a Georgia Power Co.'s long-range plan as a turning point.
\
In it, the commission approved the giant utility's intention to rely less on coal and more on other energy sources, including conservation, as the way to prepare for electricity demands over the next 10-20 years. Two-thirds of the company's power currently comes from coal.
\
The company's plan calls for it to begin its first large-scale operation of solar energy generation and the exploration of wind energy off the coast of Georgia. It will also launch seven campaigns designed to encourage greater consumer conservation.
\
""It's a huge deal,"" said Justine Thompson, with GreenLaw in Atlanta, an organization that takes on legal fights for environmental issues. ""Southern Company (Georgia Power's parent) is the largest energy producer in the country. The fact that they're moving away from coal is the end of an era.""
\
Southern Co., which also operates subsidiaries in Florida, Mississippi and Alabama, consistently ranks near the top of annual lists of major polluters because of the number of coal-fired plants it runs. Elected state regulators have traditionally OK'd reliance on coal because it is plentiful and cheap, helping Southern electric rates hover about 15 percent below national averages.
\
Nuclear plant construction stalled for 30 years following the Three Mile Island reactor accident. Today, the regulatory environment has changed, and Georgia Power is building the nation's first two reactors in three decades.
\
For years, solar and wind were described as unsuited for the South's weather conditions and geography, although Georgia Power is taking another look in this year's version of its integrated-resource plan, a document it updates every three years.
\
Natural gas has been a growing factor in power generation, but it is subject to competing demand from large factories and possible interruptions due to storms in the Gulf of Mexico. But pipeline capacity has increased in recent years, and Georgia Power is converting one of its older coal plants to a bigger natural-gas unit.
\
Stricter environmental regulations are also changing the economics of coal. Even without a ""carbon tax"" or ""cap and trade"" passing in Congress, the federal government is stepping up its authority over power plants.
\
And an ongoing court case related to a proposed power plant owned by an independent company, Longleaf, could open the door in Georgia to regulation of carbon dioxide emissions. Any combination of those factors could lead regulators to force Georgia Power to shut down more of its older coal plants.
\
""The financial outlook for coal is grim,"" Thompson said.
\
Plus, the market price of coal has swung more in recent years than it had, creating more challenges for the company.
\
""With fuel prices being very volatile, we want to bring more natural gas as well as nuclear into the mix,"" said spokeswoman Lynn Wallace.
\
Even as Georgia Power goes on a coal-reduction diet, other utilities are still trying to build new coal plants. Power4Georgians, a consortium of electric-membership cooperatives led by Cobb EMC, is seeking environmental permits to build a coal plant near Sandersville.
\
Why coal if the largest utility is going in other directions?
\
""It's not an 'or.' It's an 'and.' We need it all,"" said consortium spokesman Dean Alford.

13,"
Four Republicans and two Democrats are vying in the July 15 primary for a shot at two seats on the Public Service Commission, which sets rates on electricity and telecommunications, and oversees the delivery of natural gas to homes and businesses.
\
Two Republicans seek the nomination in the PSC's first district, which encompasses most of the state's southern end, and two Democrats and two Republicans are campaigning for their party's nod to run for the fourth district, spanning some 20 northern counties.
\
Two Libertarians are also in the race, but they will only be on the November ballot because there is no primary for that party.
\
While they represent districts, commissioners are elected statewide. They earn $117,452 a year.
\
Here is a list of candidates and their biographical information, as well as their responses to pertinent questions facing the future of energy in Georgia.
\
Candidate John Monds did not respond to interview requests.
\
Q: What does this week's court ruling invalidating permits for a coal-fired electrical plant over carbon dioxide emissions say about the future of power generation in Georgia?
\
DISTRICT 1
\
COLLUM: Basically, since the Supreme Court ruling that carbon dioxide is a pollutant, that played heavily into the judges' decision to stop the plant in Early County. All the plant has to do is meet the proper requirements to get the permit, and then they can proceed.
\
EVERETT: In my opinion, coal-fired plants with new technology are a safe and cheap form of energy, but it underscores the problems we have with coal-fired plants placing more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. That underscores the need for safer and cheaper energy, which is nuclear power.
\
DISTRICT 4
\
POWELL: I think it will probably slow it down. Coal is still the most cost-effective source of energy we have. I hope it will make Georgia think about diversifying the fuel mix.
\
INDECH: The major thing it says is let's just take a step back and reconsider what we're doing. For an out-of-state company to have a contract to construct a major power facility without a true concern for the environment of Georgia is unconscionable.
\
DAVIDSON: I think that was a prudent ruling, because soon we're going to have some carbon legislation, and most likely that will be a cap and trade, and we'll be on a carbon diet because we already have more coal and more carbon liability than most states. There will be a premium or tax on the utility company for violating the law, and that will be passed on to ratepayers.
\
MCDONALD: My gut feeling is that it will be overturned. I am very pro-nuclear. It is more expensive in the initial construction process, but over time, in my opinion, you have cleaner production.
\
GIVENS: It's a good decision in the end because the price of coal is going up, and we need to be looking for alternatives. They like to build these plants because they are relatively cheap to get going, but they are not the best as far as carbon emissions.
\
Q: Critics say building new nuclear power plants is a costly solution to reduce greenhouse gasses and that new plants will take too long to build to be effective. What do you think?
\
DISTRICT 1
\
EVERETT: I do not believe that it isn't too costly when you consider the carbon tax coming down on coal. Coal has tripled in value. We have the highest cost ever in natural gas, and it is continuing to rise. It will be 2016 until we can actually start depending on the nuclear plant, but it is an option we must take.
\
Collum: Right now we have to think in the long term, as well as in the present day. Nuclear power plants are a large piece of the overall puzzle. But today, we have the technology to incorporate biomass energy and other renewable that we can use today while we're waiting for the new power plants and the nuclear power plants to come online.
\
DISTRICT 4
\
DAVIDSON: We must consider nuclear, but it is a long-term solution that has an undetermined price tag. We need to maximize our energy efficiency and renewable energy potential in the meantime.
\
MCDONALD: I disagree with that. We know the time frame that we've got to have as far as a plant is concerned. If a nuclear plant is authorized by the state of Georgia in the next few months it will be online by 2016.
\
GIVENS: I'm not against building nuclear power plants. What I'm more concerned about is the intention of charging the Georgia ratepayers before they are built.
\
POWELL: It's a long, lengthy, drawn-out process. I don't think we should take any fuel off the table, including nuclear. I think we need to plan for the long term, and if nuclear is part of the mix, that's fine.
\
INDECH: In the very long-term, nuclear plants are probably the answer. I can't say definitely because the pace of technology is accelerating so fast that it's very difficult for people to plan in the very long term.
\
Q: Gas prices aside, what is the most pressing issue facing consumers in today's energy market? What will you do about it if elected?
\
DISTRICT 1
\
COLLUM: If elected, I am going to make sure that everyone is treated fairly. That means the consumer will be charged a reasonable rate. That has to be balanced with the company making a reasonable profit for its investors.
\
EVERETT: If I am elected, I will continue to do what I've done in the past and that is to strike a balance between the consumer and the provider. We have continually made sure rates were affordable to the consumer while at the same time making the providers financially viable.
\
DISTRICT 4
\
DAVIDSON: I think a federal mandate on mandating a percent of renewable energy, because we have virtually no renewable energy and we have a huge potential for it.
\
MCDONALD: In my opinion, the most pressing issue is getting a nuclear plant going in the state to meet the demands for tomorrow - tomorrow being the next 15 years.
\
INDECH: The most pressing issue in today's energy market is the loss of control America has over its energy supplies. We are fighting a war and losing lives of our good youth to pursue an energy policy in the Middle East. We don't need that. We need to bring it back home.
\
POWELL: We need to make sure we keep quality sources of energy and low and affordable rates for Georgia, but I think we also need to realize that investor-owned utilities need to make a profit, so there needs to be balance.
\
GIVENS: The most pressing concern for Georgia is the lack of competition among energy providers. We need to find more ways for energy producers to enter the market, as well as find new ways to allow ratepayers to generate power themselves.

14," At a time when America needs sober leadership to address the herculean challenge of global climate change, U.S. Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.) is instead trafficking in petty scare tactics --- and ought to be ashamed.\ Dingell, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said he would soon introduce legislation proposing a ""carbon tax"" that would affect industries as well as consumers. The overarching principle behind the tax is to wean America from its costly addiction to oil while promoting the development of alternatives to fossil fuels that have been linked to global warming.\ But Dingell wasn't being a statesman. As a longtime champion and chief enabler of the Detroit auto industry, he was making a veiled threat.\ ""I sincerely doubt that the American people are willing to pay what this is really going to cost them,"" Dingell said during an interview that aired Sunday on C-SPAN.\ Dingell is cynically betting that Americans are too spoiled by their own affluence and so unconcerned about the environment future generations will inherit that they won't make sacrifices needed to confront climate change head-on. For everyone's sake, let's hope he's wrong.\ As understanding of climate change continues to deepen, the next 18 months will prove critical. Congress is expected to take up comprehensive legislation in the fall, and the issue will likely be at the forefront of the 2008 presidential campaign. Serious voters, and politicians, must begin educating themselves about two key proposals:\ > A carbon tax would be levied every time motorists filled their gas tanks and whenever companies emit carbon dioxide while conducting business. The tax might be phased in over time; rebates could be offered to low-income households that would be unduly burdened.\ > A cap-and-trade system would assign permits to polluting industries that would limit their annual carbon dioxide emissions. Affected companies could buy and sell ""credits"" from each other depending on whether they had exceeded or reduced their emission limits.\ Both approaches have pros and cons. A carbon tax would be far less complex to administer and send a direct price signal that more accurately reflected the true cost of carbon emissions. A cap-and- trade program might be more flexible and creates a powerful profit motive for companies to pollute less.\ Either way, controlling man-made carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases won't come easy, quick or cheap. Doing so will be almost impossible, however, if elected officials pander to America's deepest fears instead of appealing to our highest aspirations.\ --- Lyle V. Harris, for the editorial board (lharris@ajc.com)\ Credit: STAFF"
15," This year, President Bush unveiled an aggressive plan to address air pollution --- his Clear Skies Initiative. The plan is the most significant step America has ever taken to cut power plant emissions. It will protect our environment and improve public health. Unfortunately, there has been a great deal of misinformation and inaccuracies used to discuss the plan. I would like to tell you how the initiative really works and what it means for the environment and public health.\ Bush's Clear Skies Initiative will, over the next decade, achieve substantially greater reductions in air pollution from power plants than are attainable under current law. Clear Skies will reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide by 73 percent, nitrogen oxides by 67 percent and mercury by 69 percent over today's levels. The president's plan will, over the next decade, remove a total of 35 million more tons of those harmful pollutants from the air than will be eliminated under the current Clean Air Act.\ Clear Skies' mandatory cap and trade approach is modeled on the Acid Rain Trading Program, one of the most successful clean air programs in history. One needs to look at the success of this program to recognize the benefits and proven track record of such an approach.\ Compliance with the Acid Rain program has been nearly 100 percent, and emissions of sulfur dioxide have been reduced more quickly than the program requires. In addition, the costs of the program are 75 percent lower than originally predicted. Independent analysis of the Acid Rain Program has demonstrated that trading has not created ""hot spots.""\ What do all these numbers mean and what does the plan do for you? Bush's Clear Skies Initiative is a clear winner for all Americans. We've done more than just ""ponder"" health benefits. Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide are both major contributors to respiratory diseases, especially asthma and bronchitis, and also contribute to heart disease. We've come up with a major solution for reducing pollution-caused illnesses. The Bush administration's Clear Skies initiative is a mandatory program that will eliminate tens of thousands of cases of asthma and other chronic respiratory afflictions and prevent thousands of premature deaths. To the millions of children who end up in the emergency room each year and miss school because of asthma, as well as their families, these benefits are significant. An additional benefit is results in clearing up the scenic vistas in our national parks.\ It's also important to note, the Clear Skies' cap and trade approach will not harm air quality in your city or in any other part of the country. In fact, the Clear Skies' stringent caps will improve air quality in every region affected by pollution from power plants.\ Clear Skies also recognizes that we don't have to stop progress to stop pollution. Given advances in pollution-controlling technologies, we can protect the health of our environment while also protecting America's economic health.\ I am confident that Congress --- and the public --- will see the wisdom in the President's Clear Skies Initiative. The simple truth is that America's air will be cleaner, sooner and at less cost to consumers under Clear Skies than under the current Clean Air Act. What's at stake is nothing less than a healthy future for us and for our children and grandchildren.\ Christine Todd Whitman is administrator for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\ Credit: FOR THE JOURNAL-CONSTITUTION"
16,"Republicans may make Blue Dogs an endangered species in Georgia this year.\With battles over issues such as health care, as well as a recession whose effects have lingered, Republican candidates in Georgia have seen fresh opportunities to unseat congressional Democrats this year.\The two strongest GOP candidates in competitive races --- Austin Scott and Mike Keown --- aren't new to politics, yet they can offer themselves to voters as figures who don't represent the Washington political establishment. Both have a knack for fundraising that makes them solid contenders.\Scott, who is giving U.S. Rep. Jim Marshall of Macon the political fight of his life in the 8th District, has served in the Georgia House for nearly 14 years. Keown, who is taking on longtime U.S. Rep. Sanford Bishop of Albany in the 2nd District, is a former deputy majority whip in the Legislature.\Republican strategists have targeted both congressmen for elimination, which if successful would erase the ""blue belt"" that stretches across Georgia from Savannah to Columbus and help return the U.S. House to GOP control.\Evidence of GOP hopes for the state can be seen in who's campaigning for Scott and Keown this week and how much the national party is willing to spend.\U.S. Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, who would likely become the new speaker if Republicans take back the House, campaigned for Keown on Wednesday after flying to Georgia for a fundraiser for Scott on Tuesday.\Marshall is used to battles because his elongated district in the center of the state tends to vote Republican. Marshall, one of the state's most conservative Democrats, has voted with Republicans in party fights over health care and global-warming legislation. He recently promised not to vote to reseat Nancy Pelosi as House speaker if he's elected to a fifth term --- a promise the GOP's rising national tide might make irrelevant.\""They've all been tough, but it is a tougher environment for us this time,"" said campaign spokesman Doug Moore. ""People are real upset because the economy is hurting and that means they're hurting.""\Bishop, who has held his seat since 1993, has been able to coast in past elections in his southwest Georgia district until some recent controversies and a GOP challenger with fundraising ability suddenly made him appear vulnerable.\""In this political environment, a lot of races are in play that a lot of people didn't think would be,"" said Andy Sere, spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee. ""We've reserved $200,000 of advertising time in Sanford Bishop's district and $300,000 in Jim Marshall's district. We are invested in both of these races, and they are ones that we think we can win.""\Ned Sanders of Warner Robins believes that to be the case. As the chairman of the Perry County Commission, he has worked with Marshall for years, and he considers him a good man.\Sanders, 79, said when he looks out his commission office window, he can see a long line of early voters waiting to cast ballots in heavily Republican Houston County, which he suspects bodes poorly for Marshall.\""A lot of people don't want to vote for Jim Marshall because of his ties to the Democratic Party and Nancy Pelosi,"" Sanders said, ""but he is not necessarily one of Nancy Pelosi's favorite stepchildren.""\Asked whether he'll vote for the Democrat he considers a friend and asset to the district or for the Republican to help his party take back the House, Sanders, who retires from the commission this year, demurred. ""I'm not blabbing about that,"" he said.\Two political handicapping sites have moved both Bishop and Marshall more into Republican sights.\The Cook Political Report, which in early September had Bishop as having a distinct advantage, has moved his district to the ""toss-up"" category, with Bishop only slightly favored. It also rated the Marshall-Scott race as a ""toss-up"" but favoring the Republican. On Sept. 30, the University of Virginia's Center for Politics changed its rating on Bishop's district from ""likely Democrat"" to ""leans Democrat"" and Marshall's race from ""leans"" to ""toss-up.""\Right now for Democrats outside metro Atlanta, the only possibly safe congressional seat is U.S. Rep. John Barrow of Savannah. His 12th District seat had seemed vulnerable but drew only weak Republican opposition, said University of Georgia professor Charles Bullock, an expert on Peach State politics. In federal campaign finance filings, challenger Ray McKinney reported raising nearly $200,000 by Sept. 30, compared with $1.7 million raised by Barrow.\As a sign of what a dangerous year it is for Democrats, Barrow reported spending $1.3 million by Sept. 30 in campaign funds against McKinney, a nuclear power plant manager with little national Republican support. Tharon Johnson, a Democratic strategist, said President Barack Obama has a radio ad running in Savannah specifically for Barrow.\The others are running from the president; they have the cash to fight. Bishop reported raising $1.2 million and having $597,374 cash on hand as of Sept. 30, and Marshall reported raising $1.1 million and having $837,899 on hand.\The three congressmen are considered conservative Democrats --- ""Blue Dogs."" Marshall and Barrow both voted against the Democratic-backed Affordable Health Care for American Act and the American Clean Energy and Security Act, also known as cap-and-trade for a global-warming legislation, both of which Bishop backed.\Keown showed his fund-raising prowess early and reported $868,330 by Sept. 30. The GOP in September started pouring money into the district after a Keown-commissioned poll showed him within striking distance of upsetting Bishop, whose campaign was rocked by two controversies this year. One involved federal funds and another involved Congressional Black Caucus scholarship money he controlled going to family members.\Keown, who trounced two opponents in the Republican primary by winning 80.8 percent of the vote, is capitalizing on the anti-incumbency mood, unemployment, and on Bishop's support of Pelosi-pushed cap-and-trade and the national health care legislation, campaign spokesman Andrew O'Shea said.\""Sanford Bishop ignored the voices in southwest Georgia of, 'Please vote no on health care and please vote no on cap-and-trade,' "" O'Shea said. ""What used to be a safe Democratic seat is all of the sudden a toss-up.""\Babafemi Elufiede, political science professor at Albany State University, said the GOP was pounding Bishop with TV ads highlighting the scholarship controversy, and Bishop has responded by ducking the media. Attempts to reach the Bishop campaign for comment were unsuccessful.\The scholarship controversy surfaced in late summer, coming on the tails of a GBI investigation over possible misuse of federal funds acquired by Bishop. The GBI announced it found no criminal wrongdoing with the federal funds in which Bishop's stepdaughter and son-in-law reportedly got about $15,000 for part-time jobs at a federally funded program in Columbus while working in metro Atlanta.\""The commercial about the money from the scholarship fund that was given to his family members is very, very damaging and, I would say, making a lot of voters think twice,"" Elufiede said. ""His incumbency may save him. He will probably win, but it will be very, very close.""\Matt Towery, head of pollster InsiderAdvantage, said Bishop's fate still likely rested in his own campaign, but Marshall may be powerless to stop Scott.\""I'm not saying he is toast, but he has a really tough situation,"" Towery said.\Towery said if African-Americans turn out in extra large numbers to vote for Democrat Roy Barnes in the governor's race, that would help Marshall fend off Scott. Bullock noted Marshall's district is only about 30 percent black compared with 45 percent in Bishop's district. He discounted Barnes as an asset to the Blue Dogs.\""I think all three of them [Marshall, Bishop and Barrow] run ahead of Barnes,"" Bullock said. ""I see no indication he has the coattails to help any of these folks.""\Chris Grant, a political scientist at Mercer University in Macon, said Scott is the strongest candidate Marshall has faced since he beat Mac Collins by 1 percentage point in 2006.\He described Scott as an appealing and well-established legislator from the Tifton area who also reported raising $711,789 by Sept. 30. But Grant cautioned that Marshall is a tenacious campaigner who has won Republican votes. He never takes a political position that antagonizes South Georgia, and he strongly supports the Air Force base in Warner Robins --- the area's biggest employer --- in Houston County, Grant said.\""He has worked hard to establish deep roots in Republican areas --- I even know Republican office holders who say I never vote for any Democrat except Jim Marshall,"" Grant said. ""I don't know if those deep roots will hold this year. They worked in 2004, 2006 and 2008, but Austin Scott is a better candidate.""\Bullock, however, noted there is a wild card that could change the dynamic of the campaign. On Oct. 26, there is a Superior Court hearing to decide whether to open Scott's divorce records, which a Democratic blogger contends were improperly sealed in 2001.\""That doesn't give Scott much time to explain his side,"" Bullock said. ""That is going to be new news. Old news doesn't hurt you. New news can hurt you.""\Sere, the Republican congressional committee spokesman, is betting that the court case will work against Marshall, whose campaign has denied any involvement in the lawsuit. ""It is very risky to go into the personal stuff like that close to the election,"" Sere said.\Staff writer Aaron Gould Sheinin contributed to this article.\Credit: STAFF"

I don't condemn nationalized health care outright, but the sheer cost and magnitude of government involvement is daunting.
\
I have a suggestion to help show health care providers and patients that it can really work. Since our Congress is disproportionately populated by individuals with law degrees, it seems our legal system is the perfect place to demonstrate the advantages of nationalization of a profession, and the sense of satisfaction that comes with service to the entire community, not just those who can afford it. And since our legal rights are guaranteed under the Constitution, I can think of few areas better suited to nationalization.
\
Congress already has a template for implementation --- just sign up all U.S. attorneys for LegalCare and establish a payment schedule for services, similar to Medicare. The system could be funded by a national sales tax. A budget would be established for legal services, and all citizens would have equal access to those services, regardless of ability to pay. When the money runs out for the year, pending cases are merely postponed to the next fiscal year.
\
The lawyers of this country who, more than any other group of citizens, determine our legislative fate, could prove to us that a bureaucratic endeavor similar in scope to nationalized health care could work to the betterment of all Americans.
\
And attorneys eager to provide high-quality legal representation to their clients would no longer have to worry about the client's financial status. It is an idea whose time has come. Assure universal access to high quality legal representation for all Americans, then we can attack the issue of health care. It's time for the legal profession to stand up and demonstrate their commitment to this vision; public defenders and selective pro bono work are just not the answer to America's legal needs.

OBAMA WORSE THAN EXPECTED
\
While I didn't vote for Obama, I hoped he would be better than expected --- but he's worse.
\
He is: Pushing an agenda that will destroy the American economy, take control of the automobile industry to pay off the UAW and push the mythical ""global warming"" agenda, spinning a taxing policy which boggles the mind (income tax increases for only the rich, decreases for everybody else except that cap and trade, increased gasoline taxes, taxing company-provided healthcare and innumerable other ideas will result in a cleverly disguised severe increase in the cost of living for everybody.) Universal healthcare is going to save us money?
\
At the same time, he is traveling the world stating mealy-mouthed, unjustified apologies for our country's sacrifices in trying to provide military support, aid and financial relief to innumerable less fortunate countries.
\
Geithner in charge of Treasury and the IRS, Napolitano in charge of Homeland Security, Biden as VP, and the totally inexperienced guy as automobile industry czar? Give me a break!

OBAMA SHOULD END OIL SPECULATION
\
Again, I read that oil and gas prices are going up and the reasoning is ""The economy is showing signs of recovery.""
\
Am I the only person who feels this is an oxymoron? There are thousands of people out of work, many in the Savannah area, who can't afford their homes or food, yet speculators now feel that the price can be increased on oil and the economy can support it.
\
I don't get it, there have been all sorts of theories about why the economy tanked as fast as it did. Well here is another, $4+ a gallon price of gas to the consumer made people wary of spending money and buying anything but the necessities.
\
When people stop traveling, moving, improving and changing their conception of how much things cost, they quit buying. This is not all-encompassing and I realize that other economic factors come into play, like the banking bozos.
\
This becomes a vicious circle and everything stops when consumers stop spending. Therefore, I ask everyone to start calling for Obama to repeal the deregulation of oil speculation. Do all the oil companies need record profits again this year?

TILLER A VICTIM OF CULTURE OF DEATH

It's easy to explain why abortion doctor George Tiller was murdered.
\
White babies are murdered by abortion and we call it ""a woman's reproductive rights."" Expectant African American mothers are targeted by abortionists and we call it ""creating a sustainable society."" Abortion doctors like Tiller are murdered and we call it ""justice.""
\
Poor people in Asia and Africa are starved to death and we call it ""growing corn for ethanol fuel"" or ""reducing our dependence on foreign oil.""
\
Eight thousand black poor people die of malaria each day because DDT is not available in Third World countries and we call it ""cleansing the environment."" We let China and Mexico kill us by selling poisoned food, drugs and toys and call it ""free trade.""
\
We created this culture of death with Roe v Wade, which legalized murder. We justified this act not by the Constitution but by a Nazi Germany legal custom.

We let poorly educated, incompetent college professors rewrite school textbooks to take out all reference to God, and we enact Roe v Wade and then wonder why there is complete moral decay in the US.

18," Washington --- Two weeks before a court-ordered deadline for writing rules controlling mercury pollution from power plants, the Bush administration is considering abandoning the rules in favor of a new plan that would allow electric companies to swap pollution credits.\ The agency had been working for three years to meet a Dec. 15 deadline for setting standards that would require industry to install the best available technology for scrubbing the toxic metal from power plant smoke. But the White House Office of Management and Budget is circulating documents saying the EPA erred when, in the closing days of the Clinton administration, it declared that mercury is the kind of toxic substance for which the Clean Air Act requires strict pollution controls.\ The documents, made public by environmental organizations, state that instead of requiring specific controls, the agency should set overall mercury limits and allow individual power companies to meet the limits however they wish. Companies that exceed the goals would be issued credits, which they could sell to those which do not.\ ""This would be a slam-dunk victory for the dirty electric power industry,"" said Frank O'Donnell, executive director of the Clean Air Trust. ""It shows that [EPA Administrator Michael] Leavitt is taking orders from the White House, which is influenced by the power companies that want to gut the mercury requirements.""\ Scrapping Clinton rule\ The strict mercury controls are being resisted by coal-burning power companies, including Southern Co. in Atlanta.\ At a speech to EPA employees Tuesday, Leavitt said the agency would soon ""move forward with the first-ever regulations addressing mercury emissions from power plants."" He gave no details.\ Jeffrey Holmstead, head of the EPA's air office, told The Associated Press that the proposed system for swapping pollution credits is ""our favored approach because it gets us greater [emission] reductions.""\ The proposed policy revision would rescind a legal document signed by Carol Browner, EPA administrator under President Clinton, on Dec. 20, 2000, a month before President Bush took office.\ In that document, Browner said the EPA had concluded that mercury should be regulated under a Clean Air Act provision that requires ""maximum achievable control technologies"" for dealing with toxic substances in the air.\ After she signed the document, a federal judge approved an agreement between the EPA and environmental groups establishing Dec. 15 as the date the agency had to propose the new control standards. The judge's order also sets Dec. 15, 2004, as the date the standards must go into effect.\ The revised plan under consideration would reduce the annual output of mercury pollution from power plants from the current 48 tons to about 34 tons. The amount of reduction is even less than the power companies had proposed.\ Felice Stadler, a mercury expert with the National Wildlife Federation, said the looser mercury standards would satisfy the court order requiring the EPA to propose mercury controls by Dec. 15, but at no real cost to industry.\ ""It's a dream come true for energy companies and a nightmare for children's health,"" Stadler said.\ 'Insult to public health'\ The National Academy of Sciences has declared that mercury, when consumed, usually in fish, by pregnant women, disrupts the development of brain cells in their babies.\ The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 8 percent of women of childbearing age had mercury in their blood exceeding levels considered safe by the EPA.\ Most states, including Georgia, have issued advisories against eating fish from rivers and lakes known to be polluted with mercury.\ ""EPA's proposal is an insult to public health and the environment,"" said Bill Becker, executive director of the Association of Local Air Pollution Control Officials. ""At a time when 41 states have fish consumption advisories due to mercury poisoning, it is unconscionable that EPA is proposing to postpone and weaken regulatory protection,"" he said.\ Utilities question cost\ The largest single source of mercury pollution in the United States is smoke from coal burned at power plants, according to the EPA.\ Once released from smokestacks, a portion of the mercury falls back to the ground and washes into streams and builds up in the tissues of fish, scientists say.\ Stadler said that even if the EPA policy ""revision"" is thrown out by the courts, years of litigation would give the power companies additional time to avoid compliance with Clean Air Act provisions against toxic air pollution.\ While environmental groups have been pressing the EPA to write a tough set of rules controlling mercury pollution, the power industry and its supporters in Congress have questioned whether the cost can be justified.\ Frank Maisano, a spokesman for the Electric Reliability Coordinating Council, a group of utilities that have lobbied against existing air pollution regulations and in favor of Bush's Clear Skies Initiative, said that if the EPA reversed its policy on mercury, it would regulate the metal under a different section of the Clean Air Act.\ The other section, he said, would allow control under a ""cap-and- trade"" plan in which companies that do not wish to reduce mercury pollution would be allowed to buy credits that others receive for exceeding the requirements.\ Staff writer Charles Seabrook contributed to this article.\ Credit: COX WASHINGTON BUREAU"

About Obama's address to Notre Dame, I've heard people say, ""Let him speak, he's the president.""

Well, Pontius Pilate was then governor, yet I doubt he received a lot of invitations to speak at Christian events. What Mr. Obama did at Notre Dame was pander to a handcuffed assembly.
\
Speaking in platitudes, he artfully juggles daggers while spinelessly taking no personal responsibility for his stance on late-term abortion.

I want substance in a speech, not fluff.

As for Notre Dame, it ignored the bishop and decided to look accepting in the face of what they should stand for.

PRIVATE SECTOR HAS FAILED US ON ENERGY
\
We attended a recent gathering of ""clean energy"" conscious folks invited to participate in the opening of the state headquarters of Repower America (or more specifically, Repower Georgia). Enthusiastic presentations by Rita Kirkpatrick (Southern Alliance for Clean Energy), Tommy Linstroth (head of sustainable initiatives at Melaver Inc.) and Julian Smith (president of Solar Smith) encouraged a lively and varied discussion.
\
Initially, Savannah was chosen because U.S. Rep. John Barrow, D-Savannah, serves on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which reviews energy legislation. It became apparent, however, that numerous clean energy businesses operating here, or wishing to, could also benefit by the local influence of Repower America.
\
Personally, I've been in the ""conservative thinking"" camp before, believing that the private sector was capable of implementing the public will. With regard to clean energy and energy independence, this approach has failed miserably in the past 30 years.
\
Many environmentalists, conservationists and clean energy specialists realize that only a comprehensive strategy and plan will get us where we need to go. Limping along with ever-changing policies and incentives will not be enough.
\
If we are wrong about climate change and go ahead with a strong national energy policy, we will have a stronger economy with the creation of new businesses and jobs, freedom from dependence on foreign oil and a powerful oil industry and a cleaner environment.
\
But if opponents are wrong in denying the climate crisis, and we continue with the status quo, the future is uncertain at best, with possible catastrophic consequences.

SUPPORT CLEAN ENERGY ACT
\
The American Clean Energy and Security Act represents a strong answer to some of the most pressing issues in our country. The legislation would create millions of jobs building America's clean energy infrastructure, as well as making major strides toward our country's energy independence. I am disappointed with Rep. John Barrow's lack of foresight in this matter. He did not support the bill in the Committee for Energy and Commerce, in spite of his voiced commitment to protecting the environment. I hope he advances his position and becomes a real firm advocate for the act when the bill hits the house floor.

JOHN BARROW'S ANTI-ENVIRONMENT STANCE
\
According to his Web site, Congressman John Barrow ""believes that one of his prime responsibilities in Congress is to preserve - for ourselves and for our children - the rural heritage and quality of life that we enjoy today."" Yet Mr. Barrow voted against the American Clean Energy & Security Act last week in committee. Now that strikes me as counterintuitive at best, and disingenuous at worst. The bill provides for a drastic decrease in greenhouse gas emissions over the next half century as well as a shifting of America's energy dependency from fossil fuels to renewable energy. This sounds pro-preservation to me.
\
Barrow's official platform also states that he ""believes polluters should pay for the mess they create."" But once again, a look at the legislation in question shows it establishes a cap-and-trade system for carbon dioxide emissions. Now isn't that curious?
\
So then, what's his excuse? That depends on the day you ask him.
\
Stating a stance on an issue generally means you're expected to vote that way by your constituency, Mr. Barrow; otherwise you're just another hypocritical politician who's forgotten who he works for.

PRESIDENT BUSH last year took a justifiable, principled stand in rejecting U.S. participation in the Kyoto Protocol, the international agreement that would severely limit signatory nations' emissions of carbon dioxide and other ""greenhouse gases"" that are blamed for global warming.
\
Mr. Bush cited the lack of conclusive scientific data on global warming and the enormous economic costs associated with the emissions controls as reasons for putting the kibosh on Kyoto.
\
So why has he revived a dead issue with his own plan to control emissions?
\
The president last week unveiled a ""voluntary"" cap-and-trade system to reduce carbon dioxide ""intensity"" by 18 percent over the next 10 years. Companies would be able to trade emission rights to other companies for government credits. These credits could be worth billions of dollars -- but only if Washington imposes a mandatory cap on greenhouse-gas emissions.
\
The White House declared this a ""new"" approach to reducing emissions (er, ""intensity""), but actually it's quite similar to a scheme advocated several years ago by Vice President Al Gore (and Enron CEO Ken Lay, among others) to comply with the Kyoto standards.
\
This market-based solution is preferable to rigid government controls, if only because it would have a far less draconian impact on the nation's economy. But it's really a toothless idea that does next to nothing to effect climate change. Carbon ""intensity"" in America already has fallen 15 percent in the last decade, and nearly 50 percent since 1970. That suggests industry won't be doing anything it isn't already doing.
\
The plan does, however, set up a business constituency to lobby for mandatory emissions caps down the road that will make those accumulated government credits worth something. And that puts us right back to Kyoto square one.
\
What's truly disappointing about the Bush proposal is its implicit reversal of the administration's previous, well-founded skepticism of global warming theory, and its apparent craven political underpinnings.
\
By advocating some kind of emissions control, the president is all but acknowledging that 1) radical climate change is afoot, and 2) that it is being caused by greenhouse gases produced by human industrial activity. Neither, however, are supported by hard science.
\
Computer models used to predict the climate 50 or 100 years into the future often fail to correlate even observed climate data. (The Times of London reported last week that ""computer climate models could be overestimating the likely effects of global warming because they do not take sufficient account of cooling caused by tiny pollutant particles in the atmosphere."") Temperature data from the upper atmosphere does not support the warming trend shown by surface temperatures.
\
Indeed, if anything the science is even less supportive than it was when the president nixed Kyoto. Two recently published studies have showed that, contrary to claims made by global-warming enthusiasts, Antarctica has been cooling, not warming, and its ice sheet is expanding rather than shrinking.
\
With so much uncertainty (if not outright refutation) surrounding global warming theory, why did Mr. Bush trot out some wet-noodle plan to combat it? Politics.
\
By offering an alternative to Kyoto, the president is hoping to inoculate himself against charges that he doesn't take the issue seriously. If he hoped that would gain him favor with environmentalists, he was sadly, if also predictably, mistaken.
\
None had a good word to say about the cap-and-trade plan, which was criticized for being too lenient on business and industry. Most critics of his Kyoto policy used the latest Bush announcement as an opportunity to blast his record on the environment and renew calls for tougher, Kyoto-like measures.
\
By unearthing an issue he had effectively buried last year the president scored a dubious hat trick with his misguided policy: It's bad science, bad economics and bad politics. Mr. Bush should be guided by hard data, not mushy posturing.
"
21,"First, our overall electricity prices are currently sitting at 15
percent below the national average, according to power company
comparisons using Energy Information Administration data. Our
competitive electricity prices have been good for both consumers
and businesses.\Under our leadership, we are just less than three years away from
starting up advanced technology nuclear units that together will
reduce CO2 by about 10 million metric tons per year! And when
combined with the existing two units - the total will be 20 million
tons per year. In fact, Vogtle is slated to become the largest
nuclear station in the U.S.\The Green New Deal leaves nuclear out of the mix. In fact, it calls
for a complete phase-out of nuclear energy in 10 years. That is a
mistake because nuclear plants allow for carbon-free
uninterruptible baseload generation of electricity for possibly 80
years. This is especially important since we in Georgia have closed
or fuel-switched over 4800 megawatts of coal-fired generation -
plants that could run 24/7. In 2018, nuclear energy provided for
over 56 percent of our nation's emissions-free zero carbon
electricity, according to Nuclear Energy Institute.\These actions coupled with significant environmental investments
have yielded results. SO2, NOx, and mercury emissions are down over
90 percent and CO2 emissions are down over 50 percent. Georgia's
Integrated Resource Planning, mandated by the 1991 Legislature, has
helped us chart an orderly transition from a predominantly
coal-based generation fleet to one of the most diverse fleets in
the country including nuclear energy, natural gas, hydro, coal and
massive amounts of solar.\When I was elected in 2010, we had virtually no solar energy on the
grid. Today, Georgia is a national leader, and we have more solar
on military bases than any other state does. We have created
massive solar fields in Middle and South Georgia. Companies like
Target, Walmart, Johnson & Johnson, and Google have participated in
our forward-looking ""commercial and industrial program"" to help
achieve their corporate renewable goals.\There is a reason that Georgia was named the top state to do
business in by Site Selection magazine for a fifth straight year.
We have competitive labor environments and leading workforce
development programs, low taxes and utility costs, favorable
regulatory environments, and a cooperative state government. And we
have a Public Service Commission and investor-owned utilities,
including our electric cooperatives and municipal utilities, who
work hard to help businesses meet their energy and environmental
goals.\The Green New Deal plans for a carbon tax and carbon regulation
through a ""cap and trade"" program. The Green New Deal claims to
make fossil fuel plants, including clean natural gas, irrelevant.
The Green New Deal prescribes national mobilization of our economy
through 14 mega-expensive infrastructure and industrial projects.
The Green New Deal will, in short, send energy prices spiraling
upward in our state.\Names like ""Green New Deal"" and ""Clean Power Plan"" sound harmless
enough, but both of these massive federal programs steal power away
from states and give it to bureaucrats in Washington, D.C., and
they raise prices in the process. They are both a raw deal for
Georgians. No, thank you.\Tim Echols is the vice chairman of the Georgia
Public Service Commission."
22," Washington --- President Bush's plan for sweeping changes in the Clean Air Act is set to go before a deadlocked Senate Environment and Public Works Committee today, with nine members for it and nine against.\ A tie vote would kill the bill, known as the Clear Skies Act of 2005.\ The measure's two sponsors, Sen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.), chairman of the committee, and Sen. George Voinovich (R-Ohio), were still lobbying late Tuesday for the one additional vote necessary for approval.\ Inhofe says the Clear Skies plan, proposed by Bush in February 2002, is the most aggressive air pollution control measure that any president has ever asked Congress to pass.\ But opponents say the air would be cleaned more quickly under existing air pollution controls.\ All seven Democrats on the committee have announced their opposition to the bill, along with independent James Jeffords of Vermont and Republican Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island.\ Inhofe, Voinovich and the remaining seven Republicans, including freshman member Johnny Isakson of Georgia, are on record in favor of recommending the bill for passage by the full Senate.\ Without the committee's approval, it would take difficult parliamentary maneuvering to bring the measure before the full Senate, and members of the staffs of Jeffords and several Democrats appeared confident Tuesday that the bill was dead.\ The measure would repeal existing Clean Air Act provisions that require owners of power plants to install the best available equipment for removing mercury and nitrogen oxides from power plant smoke.\ In their place, it would install ""cap-and-trade"" systems in which operators of coal-burning power plants that meet pollution standards would earn allowances they could sell to those that do not.\ Proponents, including Bush, say such systems are more efficient and remove more pollution faster than existing control requirements.\ A 1990 cap-and-trade law for sulfur dioxide, which is generally regarded as successful, would be broadened and extended.\ The bill also contains a ""transitional"" provision that would give states and metropolitan areas now under federal mandate to reduce ozone pollution until 2018 to come into conformity with federal standards.\ Jeffords has authored his own Clean Air Act amendment, which would set more stringent limits for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and mercury and create a regulatory regime for carbon dioxide, believed by most scientists to be the major cause of global warming. A third bill was introduced by Chafee and Sen. Thomas Carper (D- Del.)\ Jeffords and the seven Democrats last week appealed to Inhofe to ""work with all of us to develop multipollutant legislation that will improve our nation's air quality faster than current law.""\ But Inhofe says that over the past three years, the president's Clear Skies plan ""has been debated and re-debated and was the subject of over 20 committee hearings.""\ And Voinovich, chairman of the subcommittee with jurisdiction over Clean Air Act legislation, has said Congress must act early this year if it is going to pass changes in the law.\ Voinovich warned at a subcommittee hearing last month that the existing law is forcing electric utilities to switch from coal to natural gas.\ That drives up the price of gas and forces jobs and air pollution to other countries, he said.\ CAPTION: Sen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.) is seeking one more vote to move his bill out of committee."
23," Washington --- The heads of 10 major U.S. corporations Monday urged Congress to require mandatory reductions in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, declaring that action is needed ""as soon as possible.""\ ""We know enough to act now and we must act now,"" said Jim Rogers, chairman of Duke Energy.\ The companies announced they were joining several large environmental organizations in forming the U.S. Climate Action Partnership to lobby for a cap-and-trade program to achieve mandatory reductions.\ In this system, emission caps are assigned to individual companies, and those that reduce emissions below their caps receive ""credits."" Companies that fail to meet assigned reduction requirements can make up the difference by purchasing credits from others.\ Many business interests would prefer to see such a system rather than a less flexible one that simply puts a limit on greenhouse gas emissions.\ Rogers and the other business leaders said the United States should take the lead in the cap-and-trade effort.\ In a report titled ""Call to Action,"" the group called for government steps to hold greenhouse gas emissions to: No more than 105 percent of current levels within five years. 90 percent to 100 percent of today's levels within 10 years. 70 percent to 90 percent in 15 years. 20 percent to 40 percent by 2050.\ Several greenhouse gas reduction bills have been introduced in the new Congress, and others are reportedly being drafted.\ Although the new coalition's letter to Congress did not make specific recommendations to President Bush, the group sent him a copy.\ The president's spokesman said Monday that Bush will address global climate change in his State of the Union address tonight, but reiterated that the president opposes mandatory limits on the heat- trapping emissions.\ ""I'm not going to go and announce to you what the president's proposal is,"" press secretary Tony Snow said when asked at his daily press briefing about the industry leaders' recommendation.\ ""But it's worth saying that the president has always believed, when it comes to climate change, that the best way to achieve reductions is through innovation and to figure out ways to come up with energy sources that are going to meet our economy's constant demand for energy and at the same time do it in a way that's going to be friendly for the environment,"" Snow added.\ In addition to Duke Energy, companies signing the letter and joining the new climate action group were Alcoa, PG&E Corp., Lehman Brothers, FPL Group, General Electric, BP-America, DuPont, Caterpillar and PNM Resources.\ Environmental organizations that joined the group were the World Resources Institute, the Natural Resources Defense Council, Environmental Defense and the Pew Center for Global Climate Change.\ At a news conference announcing formation of the group, members said they planned to continue to push for the reductions and expected to be joined by other industries.\ But the reaction from business leaders was not uniformly supportive.\ ""We view [climate change] as a global issue that requires a long- term, global approach,"" said Jason Cuevas, a spokesman for the Atlanta-based Southern Co., which operates coal-burning electric power plants in Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and Florida.\ Cuevas said that without proven technology, mandatory carbon caps would ""do nothing more than shift the cost to our customers without producing meaningful results.""\ Southern has considered the prospects of operating in a carbon- constrained world. That's one of the reasons it's pushing nuclear so hard, Cuevas said.\ Plans are on the table to build two nuclear reactor units at Plant Vogtle near Waynesboro, doubling the size of that facility on the Savannah River.\ The announcement came at a time when advocates of U.S. government action on global warming have said they believe the political landscape is changing rapidly in their favor.\ While the coalition's news conference was under way, World Bank President Paul Wolfowitz was holding a lunch in the same building to announce plans to bring legislators from Europe, Japan and other countries to Washington next month and have them meet with members of Congress on climate change problems.\ Staff reporter Stacy Shelton contributed to this article.\ Credit: COX WASHINGTON BUREAU"
24,"ENVIRONMENT\Responses to ""Tree-saving plan has credibility questions."" AJC online, May 24.\Forest program worthy\I think the article took something of a cheap shot at the Keeping Forests in Forests program that has been proposed as a way of keeping carbon sequestration dollars in Georgia. Organizations like the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy appear to oppose this effort just because Power4Georgians thought of it first in connection with their proposed Plant Washington, and the likely event that some carbon cap and trade program would be mandated by Congress.\The science of the issue has been well thrashed out by forestry experts from both the University of Georgia and Duke University. The potential for providing some economic benefits to Georgia timber owners is certainly there at a time when almost all sections of the national economy are struggling. The program would also be voluntary. What's not to like about it?\William Hovey Smith, Sandersville\Research shows results\The writer ignores the fact that Keeping Forests in Forests is based on the sound science of programs at Duke University and the University of Georgia. Research conducted at those institutions is among the most advanced in the world, and shows that pine trees are extremely effective in sequestering carbon, and forests are a viable answer to climate change. It's putting an existing system to work to offset a greenhouse gas. You don't have to pump carbon into caverns or into the oceans, or worry about the uncertainties of those sequestration methods.\I find it ironic that program critics quoted in the article have been silent on other carbon programs, many of which have no science behind them. The results of our program will be verified by an independent third party, with outcomes made available to participating electric customers, so they may see how their contributions are helping preserve Georgia's natural resources. I challenge the critics of Keeping Forests in Forests to show comparable science or accountability in other carbon sequestration programs.\Dean Alford, Power4Georgians\Preserve resources\Providing landowners with monetary incentives to practice sustainable forestry will help preserve one of Georgia's most valuable resources: its forests. If we lose these forests to development, one of the greatest carbon sequestration sources will be lost. The importance of Georgia's managed forests and the carbon bank they represent cannot be ignored.\I agree with some of the points of dissension about the Power4Georgians program but a managed forest, if managed in accordance with accepted managed forest protocol for carbon offset projects, is environmentally and scientifically sound.\As an offset aggregator of managed forest carbon sequestration projects that follow the protocols established by the Chicago Climate Exchange, we are working diligently to ensure sustainable forestry in Georgia and the Southeast will be a major player in upcoming environmental, and cap and trade programs.\John Ramey, Valley Wood, Inc.\Standards are valid\Keeping Forests in Forests should be applauded for developing a way to help fund forest conservation. Each day a forest grows, it removes carbon from the atmosphere. Privately owned forests, like those in this program, help maintain clean air and water, biodiversity and other benefits. These working tree farms are struggling to break even because of declining values for timber products. Many owners are selling or developing their land. The AJC chose to take a negative view of this program, which is using a similar approach to the standards for the Chicago Climate Exchange. There are various ""protocols,"" or standards, for these projects and the more stringent standards fail to entice forest carbon sequestration and forest conservation in any significant amount. The AJC recently stated the ""Keeping Forests project does not even follow the Georgia protocol."" The current Georgia protocol is voluntary, and currently under revision. Keeping Forests simply used other standards. I also suspect that their forests will grow and provide ecosystem services many years into the future.\Nathan McClure, Georgia Forestry Commission\POLITICS\Give talk radio a chance\Thank you for publishing Mary Grabar's defense of talk radio, (""We need insights, wit from Limbaugh,"" Opinion, June 2). She speaks for the millions of us conservatives, moderates, independents and even some liberals who listen every day and are informed, entertained, inspired and engaged by the energetic public discourse. She mentions my favorite, Dennis Prager, who prefers ""clarity over agreement"" and talks about everything under the sun.\Keep an open mind and listen for a while, instead of dismissing the entire medium --- because after all, it's just hate talk, isn't it?\Becky Orrison, Atlanta\ELECTIONS\Handel needs to change\I was dismayed to see that Secretary of State Karen Handel is still defiant about criticism of her woefully defective screening techniques for voters (""Feds rip Georgia voter system,"" News, June 2). Where does this attitude come from? A 50 percent error rate is not acceptable when it affects voting rights. If Handel thinks it is justifiable to unnecessarily hamper, and perhaps disenfranchise, thousands of otherwise qualified voters so that she can rest assured that not one illegal vote was cast, then she needs to re-examine her priorities. It is not too much to expect that her office be effective in doing its job without disenfranchising those entitled to vote.\Riccarda Heising, Atlanta\GOVERNMENT\While state agencies having to reduce spending by an additional 25 percent is challenging, and probably difficult to implement, it is encouraging that our Georgia government is willing to take the same steps that we as individuals have had to take, rather than just raise taxes.\Jim Parkman, Cumming\Credit: FOR THE JOURNAL-CONSTITUTION"
25,"ENVIRONMENT\Save Georgia forests first\Shelly Lakly's ""Saving our forests will reduce global warming"" (Opinion, June 24) was right about the need to protect forests as they work to reduce greenhouse gases and protect the environment. While a project in Bolivia or outside the United States may be scientifically based and environmentally valuable, we need to conserve Georgia's forests first. Georgia has about 24 million acres of forests that are providing great environmental benefits to our state. However, we are losing forests at an alarming rate. According to the Georgia Forestry Commission, increased population and loss of traditional markets for wood products is causing at least 106 acres of Georgia's forests to disappear daily.\J. Blake Sullivan, Carbon TreeBank\Clean up coal emissions\In ""U.S. technology key to China and climate"" (ajc online, June 19), the importance of capturing carbon dioxide from coal-burning power plants in the U.S. is stressed. I agree that by harnessing this major contributing factor to global warming, the U.S. can and should spread this knowledge to China and other countries. More research should be funded into carbon capture, and that it should be mandatory for all coal plants over the next few years to have this technology or new efficiency standards. This would diminish the need for building any new plants. The report quoted from MIT said, ""Together, the U.S. and China account for 20 percent of the world's carbon dioxide from coal-burning power plants."" These emissions can be greatly lessened by stronger legislation, and help from the EPA.\Christina Mosley, Acworth\ECONOMY\The heart of foreclosure\I agree with Thomas Oliver that unemployment is one of the primary factors driving Georgia's foreclosure rate (""New rules frustrate recovery,"" Business, June 28). However, he goes too far in his assertion that ""Unemployment, not predatory lending, is at the heart of our foreclosure crisis."" If this were true, counties with high unemployment would also have high foreclosure rates. But this is generally not the case. When you look at a county map of the state's unemployment and compare that to foreclosure rates, you see very different pictures. The foreclosure crisis is primarily in central and north Georgia, whereas the unemployment hot spots are mainly rural.\Dan McAdam, Atlanta\MEDIA\Celebrities are not news\America is lulled into passivity by a media that simply won't report the news. The media dwells on philandering politicians, and dead rock stars, rather than writing about a cap and trade bill that will cause every household substantially increased energy costs to dissuade the use of traditional forms of energy --- when in fact, there is no viable alternative to that energy. Our values stink if we are more interested in celeb news than real news.\Joan L. Dillon, Atlatna\Credit: FOR THE JOURNAL-CONSTITUTION"
26," Clearly, CDC dropped the ball\ For once I agree with Cynthia Tucker (""TB case lands in bureaucracy web,"" @issue, June 3). The media have been so busy sensationalizing Andrew Speaker that they have lost sight of their reason for being. Is the media afraid to take on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention?\ I have been a fan of (CDC chief) Dr. Julie Gerberding, but listening to her explain what happened was the most blatant example of dereliction of duty I have ever heard. The same for the Fulton County Health Department.\ If this is all that we have to depend on, how can we feel safe? How can you let these people off the hook?\ ALMA FREEDMAN, Atlanta\ Call for higher gas prices an unfair solution\ Recent cries from conservationists for gas prices to increase to the point where we will be forced to change our habits are a bit elitist.\ I, too, am a conservationist and dutifully recycle, turn lights off and worry about the environment. However, a little bit of thought would reveal that gas-price increases will hurt the poor and not change the habits of the rich.\ The cost of real estate in Atlanta, as in many city centers, has been skyrocketing forcing the lower income earners to move to the distant suburbs where housing is a little more affordable. Most of the lower income earners do not have access to flexible work hours or telecommuting options. Due to lack of public transportation, it is these people who have no choice but to commute to work. It is these people who are hit the hardest by high gas prices.\ The debate should be focused around investment in the mass transit infrastructure that offers commuters alternatives so they actually can make changes in driving habits. Any solution that unfairly burdens a particular segment of people is not a good solution.\ SID HASAN, Atlanta\ Water woes: Make leaders accountable, too\ A recent letter placing the blame for the water restrictions on the county commissioners' unbridled growth policies was right on the money.\ Allowing acre after acre of high density growth without providing infrastructure --- water, roads, schools, etc. --- defies all common sense.\ The ""water restrictions"" have been in place for years --- without any plan to provide the capacity to remove them. People recognize them for what they are, a farce. The ""rules"" were established to facilitate automatic lawn sprinkling but impose an undue burden on people with limited means.\ I once lived in an area in another state that had a problem with sewer capacity. A building ban was enacted until the problem was remedied.\ It got fixed real quick.\ RICHARD CAMPOLMI, Marietta\ 'Emissions reduction' a cherry-picked claim\ In their June 5 Equal Time essay ""Warming: U.S. can't fall for cap-and-trade risks,"" authors Sally McNamara and Thomas A. Roe claim that the United States has shown ""superior performance in emissions reduction [of greenhouse gases] so far.""\ I am sure that many readers were puzzled by these words. It would be nice if they were true; we could pat ourselves on the back and smile at how well the approach of denying the problem worked to solve it.\ Unfortunately, the claim is only true if the definition of ""emissions reduction"" is rigged in such a way as to make it completely meaningless. The origins of the claim of ""superior performance"" are carefully analyzed in ""The Political and Selective Use of Data: Cherry-Picking Climate Information in the White House,"" a report released by the Pacific Institute.\ The report shows how climate skeptics picked one of six greenhouse gases and used a narrow and arbitrary range of time to substantiate their claims. McNamara and Roe merely repeat the results of this ""research.""\ On the other hand, the report says calculations that are based on aggregate greenhouse gas emissions between 1990 and 2004 ""show that U.S. greenhouse gas emissions grew more than 15 percent while emissions from the 15 countries of the European Union declined by around 1 percent.""\ Superior performance? I think not.\ JEFF KERR\ Kerr is an intern at Environment Georgia, which calls itself ""a statewide, citizen-based environmental advocacy organization.""\ MARTA experience is not so daunting\ With respect to guest columnist Gary Kolar (""Don't try to sugarcoat MARTA,"" @issue, June 5), he has over-dramatized the MARTA experience. He characterizes the daily commute as ""full of aggressive predators"" who ""haunt"" stations and trains and ""shout hostilities at women."" Kolar has never feared for his safety, he explains, because he is ""a tough, mean-looking urban guy.""\ My experience has been different. I am a ""sheltered intellectual"" (Kolar's term), who commutes daily on MARTA from East Point to the Five Points station. I have never been menaced, and rarely have to deal with ""annoying mendicants"" or any of the other ills that pepper Kolar's account.

\
If there was one winner from Sunday's debate between the two major-party candidates for South Carolina's 2nd Congressional District, it was probably the U.S. Department of Energy's Savannah River Site.
\
During an SCETV debate Sunday, both Republican Rep. Joe Wilson and Democratic challenger Rob Miller agreed the facility should be used for recycling and reprocessing nuclear waste, and that it should play a role in moving South Carolina toward clean, renewable energy.
\
""The Savannah River Site is such a prime location for us to really create our own version of a research triangle here in South Carolina, working with Georgia,"" said Miller.
\
""We can create an environment that will, with the extension of research and development credits moving forward, really provide an environment with dynamic study and research ? whether it be hydrogen, whether it be biomass and nuclear technology. ... We just need to be out there fighting for it every day.""
\
Wilson said the facility is a safe place around which people raise families and retire.
\
""We're very fortunate to have it here in South Carolina,"" said the Republican lawmaker.
\
""I also see it as a place where we could actually build nuclear reactors to provide commercial power to the people of South Carolina and throughout the Southeast. So I see a great future for the Savannah River Site.""
\
The rivals parted ways on offshore drilling ? sticking to their positions from the 2008 race when they faced one another and Wilson defeated Miller 56-54 percent.
\
Miller called drilling for oil and natural gas a states' issue and said industry incentives should be used instead to shift South Carolina away from fossil fuels and reduce the country's dependency on hostile nations like Iran.
\
In contrast, Wilson advocated for offshore drilling from the South Carolina coast in order to apply royalties toward beach renourishment projects at Beaufort County's Hunting Island State Park, adding that any drilling operations should have safeguards to protect against crises like the Gulf oil spill.
\
""There should be multiple cutoff valves that are remotely controlled in the event of any bizarre circumstance,"" said Wilson.
\
Both candidates eagerly shot down a divisive proposal to limit greenhouse gases called ""cap and trade,"" which called for requiring companies to buy and sell permits to pollute. The proposal had become a lightening rod among conservatives who warned it would increase energy rates. Federal lawmakers and energy leaders have pronounced the idea dead.
\
Also during the one-hour debate, Wilson invoked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's name repeatedly in an effort to link Miller to the chamber's top Democrat, while Miller tried to cast Wilson as a Washington insider, reminding voters that the congressman rented an SUV at taxpayers' expense.
\
Miller also attacked Wilson for his support of the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA), the bailout of the banking industry, and a series of bloated federal budgets. Wilson responded by defending his actions and arguing that he took each in the best interest of the country.
\
Wilson, an attorney and former state lawmaker who served 31 years in the S.C. Army National Guard, was elected to Congress in 2001. Miller is a businessman and a retired Marine, has been deployed to Albania, Djibouti, Liberia, Yugoslavia and twice to Iraq.
\
Also running are Marc Beaman of the Constitution Party and Libertarian Eddie McCain.

Look for cap and trade to be passed on the eve of July 4.""
\
""Are Republicans going to be weak on national defense or weak on supporting our seniors? The GOP's threat to allow a 21 percent cut in Medicare payments to doctors occur, unless they are offsetting budget cuts to keep doctor payments at current levels means cutting military spending.

OBAMA
\
""President Obama is turning out to be nothing more than an arrogant and totally ineffective leader. Everything he touches, he ruins and people think it's because he doesn't have any successful managerial experiences, to the contrary, it's because his logic is based on the study and advice of his mentors, Rev. Wright, Bill Ayers, Farrakhan, George Soros and his favorite, Saul Alinsky. Notice the pattern. He adores Marxists and Marxist theory. And he is not ashamed of it. That's right. He Hopes to change America into a communist-type government where only the elite people in government are revered.""
\
""President Obama made a Jimmy Carter speech on Tuesday evening because it was shallow and totally empty. However, what should we expect from a lawyer who has surrounded himself with lawyers? The main thrust of his speech was to sue BP. Obama has always had one real objective, which is to redistribute wealth and the best way to do that is to tax the achievers into submission. His goal has never wavered and that is to turn America into a land of unionized government workers that produce nothing while destroying the achiever base. If he is successful, we will look like France when he is done, or even worse, Cuba.""
\
""I think this oil spill is exactly what Obama needed. It has kept the country occupied for a couple of months so nobody noticed that he hasn't been doing anything.""
\
""We're branded as racists if we disagree with Obama's policies. Now, we won't be welcomed at the local Catholic church if we disagree with Obama. Today the Catholics are racists. Tomorrow, will it be the Baptists?""
\
""President Obama has never been overly modest about his own powers. In fact, two years ago, he declared that history would mark his ascent to the presidency as the moment 'our planet began to heal and the rise of the oceans began to slow.' Mr. President, a little humility, please.""
\
""You are asking why the president will not make a waiver to the Jones Act to allow more skimming ships. I have an answer to that. It's very simple. Our president is a closet, card-carrying union man himself and he is also owned and operated by our unions. He is a president that only will work for union contractors and union people and not non-union workers. Think about that when you go to the polls, folks. He's a one-term president and he's a phony.""

OIL DISASTER
\
""When has the government ever done anything in a fair and timely manner? Yet, those are the exact words President Obama used to BP for the reason that the government will handle the $20 billion in funds that are to go to the little people. Unbelievable. It's a shame President Obama is not as concerned with the environment.""
\
""It seems like, to the news media anyway, BP has become the Bush of today. There's nothing that BP can say or do that's not going to be scrutinized and they come up on the short end every time. When they gave the $20 billion, well, that's not the end of it, that doesn't mean we won't have lawsuits. And, of course, the comment about small people, in no way was that a put down. English was not his mother tongue. He was talking about big companies and small people. How should he have said it? Big companies and big people? Hmmm, think about it. Wonder what the press would have done with that.""
\
""I'm an independent and though I firmly disagree with many of President Obama's policies, I have always respected the office of the presidency. President Obama has recently made a visit to Florida, Louisisana, etc.,to convince them that he is sincerely trying to assist these devastated coastal states, which included two hours of a televised speech to the country. However, it's been reported in the news that 13 countries have offered skimmers that may not solve the problem completely but at least it would have had an impact on this catastrophic disaster. It was also reported that the unions objected to these skimmers. It is beyond my comprehension that a sitting president would allow unions to dictate to him when we're in the midst of a national crisis. Our coastal states will suffer for months if not years to recover from this unimaginable destruction. It can only make one believe that this president cannot be trusted and is far from being honest with the coastal states and the American public.""

Would you please investigate that and let the public know?""
\
""Do you realize BP has twice as many American employees as it does British? That means, with all these jobs being cut, it's just hurting more Americans. Oh well, we don't need jobs.""
\
""It's more than a little frustrating to listen to the drilling of this BP CEO when one of the questioning senators just made the comment that it's disheartening to see their company put costs above safety, that that's not the way things are done. Hello, real world? I have worked for many major companies and every single one of them puts cost in front of safety. This is nothing new. BP didn't invent it. This is not a UK invention, it is world-wide, I'm sure.""
\
""Please don't be so foolish as to boycott BP gas stations and products. We need them to make all the money they can to stand by their commitment in the Gulf region and for the Gulf workers. Also, the barrier islands that Bobby Jindal is advocating have a lot of problems. Many scientists have said they're just not feasible. If you make them with a space between, the oil can run right through. If you make them continuously, they affect the tides of that area, which has definite effect on the birds, wildlife, etc. So, think about all these things when people come up with these ideas. There's lots of reasons why some times they're not used.""
\
""After watching Congress interrogate Tony Hayward from BP, I listened while they asked him many hypothetical questions. You can't give an accurate answer on a hypothetical, who knows what they're going to do in the future. Yet, the congressmen would get very upset because he wouldn't answer their hypothetical questions and it was like they were trying to railroad him.

If Mr. Greene didn't fit the requirements to run on the Democratic ticket, then why did they accept his money for the filing fee?

Note: HOW TO APPLY FOR WEATHERIZATION HELP The Economic Opportunity Authority for Savannah-Chatham County offers weatherization, including insulation, caulking, vents, carbon monoxide monitors and other items to low-income Savannah residents. Homeowners or renters can apply. There is never a cost for this service. Call 238-2960 ext. 122 or 115 for more information.

\
To figure out how much energy Elizabeth Murchison's 1950's-built brick house loses, the Economic Opportunity Authority for Savannah-Chatham County on Thursday set up a Big-Bad-Wolf-style test.
\
A fan sealed in her door frame sucked air out of the house while technicians checked for internal breezes.
\
They found plenty: leaky duct work, a flue-less chimney and cracks in the floor, for a start. One leak was big enough to make wind chimes tinkle in the living room.
\
Murchinson's house will be weatherized soon, and economic authority deputy administrator Terry Tolbert expects it to save about 35 percent on her energy bills.
\
Even more weatherization is likely on the way for Savannah, courtesy of the federal stimulus package.
\
The Georgia Environmental Facilities Authority has submitted applications to the U.S. Department of Energy for funds through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. If approved, the grants would provide about $82.5 million for statewide energy efficiency and renewable energy projects and $124.8 million for low-income home weatherization.
\
In Savannah, Tolbert expects the funds will allow economic authority to weatherize 350 homes in each of the next two years. The authority averages about 50 homes a year now.
\
The EOA will also hire eight to 10 new technicians - at about $24,000 to $30,000 a year - to do the work.
\
""It'll help the local economy, and it'll help needy families,"" Tolbert said.
\
Currently, weatherization is available to tenants or homeowners at 150 percent of the federal poverty level, about $34,000 a year for a family of four. That criterion is expected to widen to include those up to 200 percent of the poverty level, about $44,500 for a family of four, for the economic stimulus money.
\
Murchison's house is typical of many in Savannah and around the nation, said Jennette Gayer, of the nonprofit group Environment Georgia. It released a report Thursday highlighting how more-efficient homes could be key to battling climate change.
\
""The big picture is that 40 percent of our energy use is to cool and heat buildings,"" she said. ""If we could put a dent in that, we could change the course of global warming.""
\
To that end, Environment Georgia and other green groups are pushing U.S. Rep. John Barrow to support the American Clean Energy and Security Act. The proposal includes a controversial cap and trade measure to regulate greenhouse gases as well as provisions for improving the energy efficiency requirements in building codes.
\
Barrow sits on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which is slated to begin considering the proposed legislation today.
\
""He's a fence-sitting Democrat we can't afford to lose,"" Gayer said.
\
Barrow is undecided.
\
""Congressman Barrow hasn't seen the language of the bill yet and won't be able to take a position on it either way until he has,"" said Jane Brodsky, his communications director.
\
""He needs to make sure that whatever solutions are in the bill are going to make a real difference and are good for his district and the nation as a whole.""
\
Like many homeowners on a tight budget, Murchison - who's lived in her home 38 years, raising two sons there and caring for an aging father in the year before his death - is more focused on saving money than saving the planet.
\
She learned about the weatherization project when she requested help from the economic authority with her water heater. Now she's eager to see how the effort will pare her air conditioning bills this summer.
\
""With the cracks all sealed up, I'll see a big difference,"" she said.

30,"CORRECTION: A chart that appeared in Tuesday's paper on Page A4 with a story about carbon emissions rules contained erroneous information. Here is the chart with updated data: LEADING GENERATING PLANTS Generating capacity is expressed in kilowatts.

Nathan Deal said he had directed the state Environmental Protection Division ""to develop the best approach to this rule for Georgia.""\After Georgia officials beseeched the Environmental Protection Agency, the state got more breathing room under the standards that were first proposed more than a year ago. As a result, Georgia Power's massive investment in nuclear energy at Plant Vogtle near Augusta will help the state meet the requirements.\Georgia Public Service Commissioner Chuck Eaton said he ""appreciated"" the EPA's shifts, but he still thinks the agency is overstepping its bounds and electric rates will go up.\""Some of these folks in Washington are trying to put the word out there that somehow this is going to decrease electric rates, which is really just a bunch of phooey,"" said Eaton, a Republican.\Jennette Gayer, the director of Environment Georgia, said the plan is feasible and state leaders should embrace it.\""If you look at our wind resources, our solar resources and the potential for energy efficiency, we could knock this thing out of the park,"" Gayer said.\At the White House, President Barack Obama dismissed ""scaremongering"" by the fossil fuel industry, business groups and Republicans. He said the plan is the best chance for the U.S. to show leadership, ahead of a possible United Nations climate agreement to be negotiated by mid-December.\He called the Clean Power Plan ""the single most important step America has ever taken in the fight against global climate change.""\Overall, EPA estimates the plan will result in a 32 percent reduction in carbon emissions from 2005 levels. The mandates phase in from 2022 to 2030, and states are to come up with their own strategy for meeting the targets. Georgia's target --- a reduction of 16 million tons of carbon from 2012 levels --- is in the middle range of states, as the state already uses a fairly diverse mix of electricity.\U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., whose state is almost completely dependent on coal-generated power, has urged states to ignore the rule. Janet McCabe, acting assistant administrator for EPA's Office of Air and Radiation, said the federal government would impose its own plan on states that fail to produce one, but ""we're quite a long time away from that event.""\More than a dozen states sued the EPA based on the proposed rule, but Georgia was not among them. Now that the plan is final, Georgia is expected to challenge it in court.\For a president who said during his first campaign that future generations will look back and say ""this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal,"" Obama's climate policy has had its ups and downs.\Congress, even under Democratic control, stymied Obama's first-term plans for a cap-and-trade system to reduce carbon emissions. So Obama has pushed the limits of EPA's powers under the Clean Air Act to regulate power plants and the heat-trapping gases scientists say threaten the planet's future. He has been met with resistance at every turn.\Critics argue that restricting power generation harms the economy, that renewable energy is not reliable enough and that Obama's efforts will have little practical effect on climate change --- particularly with China surpassing the U.S. as the world's top emitter.\The White House and environmental groups paint a dirty picture of Georgia's carbon-damaged environment. Asthma, for example, harms 8 percent of adult Georgians and 11 percent of its children, according to the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\Nearly 60 million metric tons of carbon pollution were emitted into the atmosphere by Georgia power plants in 2013. That's equivalent to the amount of pollution caused annually by 12 million cars.\Georgia politicians have done little to mitigate climate change. Deal, unlike his predecessor, has no energy strategy. A 2006 carbon registry proposal, intended to inventory the state's greenhouse gases, is dead.\Atlanta corporate bigwigs Coca-Cola and UPS joined Fortune 500 companies across the country last week in support of Obama's efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and invest in clean energy. The dozen or so companies pledged to spend $140 billion to reduce carbon emissions and create 1.6 gigawatts of new clean energy projects.\But Southern Company, the parent company of Georgia Power, has repeatedly battled with the Obama administration on its power plant regulations.\""The implications of the overreaching rules directly impact national energy policy and impede states' authority to act in the best interests of customers,"" Georgia Power spokesman Jacob Hawkins said.\Hawkins pointed to moves Georgia Power has taken to reduce emissions.\Coal accounts for 41 percent of Georgia Power's energy portfolio, down from 62 percent in 2011. The state's largest electricity supplier has shuttered coal-burning plants and modernized others to increase efficiency. Natural gas --- plentiful, cheap and cleaner than coal --- is increasingly added to Georgia's energy mix.\And more reductions are on the way. Georgia Power plans to eliminate 15 coal- and oil-fired units and is spending $6 billion to retrofit coal plants to reduce CO2, sulfur dioxide and mercury.\The environmental construction program comes as the company has also begun increasing, albeit slowly, its renewable energy portfolio, including solar power. The White House credits Georgia with a 55 percent increase in renewable energy since 2008.\Georgia Power's power sources\Coal 41% Oil and gas 35%\Nuclear 22% Hydro 2%\Coming Sunday\Georgia officials acknowledge the reality of climate change yet have done little to combat the threat. Coastal communities, however, are preparing for a future of warmer temperatures, higher sea levels and the possibility of large-scale damage.\Decline of coal\Alpha Natural Resources Inc., one of the country's biggest coal producers and a major Southeastern U.S. operator, became the latest in a string of coal companies to seek bankruptcy protection amid a shift brought on by cheap natural gas prices and pollution regulations.

31,"Yes\Targeted jobs programs will boost employment.\By Christina D. Romer\There is no question that the U.S. faces a severe jobs deficit. We have lost 7.2 million jobs since the recession began more than two years ago and the unemployment rate is currently near 10 percent. The Recovery Act and other rescue actions have played a key role in greatly improving the trajectory of the economy. But even so, forecasts indicate that unemployment is likely to remain high for an extended period.\It is for this reason that the president has called for action on jobs legislation. Jump-starting private-sector job creation has to be everyone's top priority. This commitment is shown in the president's budget released last week. At the same time that the president is committed to reining in the budget deficit over the medium and long run, he is committed to taking further emergency actions to help put unemployed Americans back to work. The budget includes $100 billion for targeted jobs initiatives. It includes another $167 billion for additional temporary relief measures to aid those directly harmed by the recession.\The president has made a number of concrete proposals. He's announced the Small Business Jobs and Wages Tax Cut. This proposal gives firms a substantial tax cut if they increase their number of employees and payrolls. This is the right policy for this point in the recovery. Real GDP grew strongly in the fourth quarter of 2009. When output and demand are growing, firms surely expect to be hiring again in the next year or two. A targeted tax cut may be just what they need to take the plunge and hire right now. We believe this will be a cost-effective policy with potentially big job creation benefits.\The president has also discussed some concrete proposals for encouraging the transition to cleaner energy. One involves incentives for homeowners to retrofit their homes for energy efficiency. Such a program could save homeowners money over the long run, improve the environment and generate jobs in both construction and manufacturing, two industries that have been particularly hit hard by the recession.\A third priority for targeted job creation is infrastructure investment. The experience of the Recovery Act suggests that spending on infrastructure is an effective way to put people back to work while creating lasting investments that raise future productivity. The administration is supporting an additional investment in roads, bridges, airports, transit, rail and water projects. Funneling some of these funds through programs such as the Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) program at the Department of Transportation, which is a competitive grant program, could offer a way to ensure that the projects with the highest returns receive top priority.\The president welcomes input and new ideas from Congress. But what is not acceptable is inaction on further jobs legislation or a weakening of the key priorities that should be included. Unemployed Americans need an effective targeted jobs bill --- now.\It is critical to maintain our support for those most affected by the recession by extending the emergency funding for such programs as unemployment insurance and health insurance subsidies for the unemployed. This support not only cushions the worst effects of the downturn, but also boosts spending and so spurs job creation. Continuing the state fiscal relief will help to keep teachers, firefighters and police employed, and help maintain vital public services.\And the Making Work Pay Tax Credit, which has put as much as $800 into the pockets of 95 percent of working families, needs to be continued to help families make ends meet and enable them to buy the goods and services that support employment in the economy.\Christina D. Romer chairs the President's Council of Economic Advisers.\No\Policies that alter after-tax incentives for business kill jobs.\By Don Sabbarese\President Barack Obama was right on target when he said in the State of the Union address in late January that ""jobs must be our No. 1 focus in 2010.""\But the Obama administration has got it all wrong when it comes to how. Raising taxes on banks and other big businesses, as Obama proposes in his new $3.8 trillion budget, may help with the budget deficit, but is not going to result in the creation of many new private-sector jobs or induce companies to invest.\If the government wants to use fiscal policy to help the economy, then the most effective approach is implementing permanent tax cuts.\In fact, what we need is for the government to stay out of the business of regulating the private sector and creating jobs. Increased spending by the government, including the administration's new jobs bill, will not lead to sustainable job creation.\These well-intentioned measures will ultimately increase the cost of doing business for the private sector by eating into their after-tax profits.\What the private sector lacks and needs more than anything is renewed confidence in the economy. Businesses need as clear a view as possible of an economy that is on the mend and that is not changing the rules.\Policymakers must resist the temptation to pass any policy changes that may impair the willingness of businesses to invest in more capital and labor. At this moment, businesses would welcome less uncertainty.\Once the economy reaches a sustainable level of growth, then policymakers could revisit the more drastic policies the administration proposes --- such as the EPA proposal on taxing carbon, cap-and-trade, health insurance reform and a new tax on large banks. Delaying these policies would prove to be less destabilizing.\For the time being, the federal government should concentrate on fiscal and monetary policy solutions that enhance long-term economic growth.\One necessary condition for a recession to end, and for a recovery to take hold, is for businesses to have renewed confidence in the economy. And right now we do not have that.\As long as consumers and businesses have any lingering doubts about the sustainability of economic growth, they will remain cautious toward increased spending on capital and labor.\In tough economic times, as businesses switch to a ""survival mode"" of cutting capital and labor costs, an inertia sets in that is hard to reverse when things start to improve. The same holds true for consumers.\Although GDP growth is a positive sign that the worst is behind us, it is still far removed from the everyday decisions that small and large businesses make. Businesses are constantly monitoring and weighing the signals from their particular markets against the distant signals of the overall economy.\As a consequence, increased spending on their part will only come when they are convinced that the improvement in the broader economy is synchronized with their particular markets.\So the message to policymakers is to minimize policy changes that complicate business and consumer decision making. The economy will be better served by policymakers simplifying the regulatory and tax environment that the private sector must navigate through.\Massive stimulus spending financed with debt creates the expectations of higher taxes in the long term, which also begs the question of who is going to pay for this debt.\Major policy changes should remain on the back burner until they can be fully debated on their merits and when their passage will not prolong an already long recession and slow recovery.\Don Sabbarese directs the Econometric Center at the Coles College of Business at Kennesaw State University.\CAPTION: Christina D.

32,"You'll soon be living in a country with more electric-powered cars and more biofuels. Wind turbines and solar arrays may not become as numerous as cellphone towers, but you will see many more of them. The U.S. will be pulling away from its dependency on the Middle East even as it tries to arrest climate change. Here are 10 changes you're likely to experience during the next 10 years.\Two of the most urgent challenges facing the U.S. --- climate change and our dependence on foreign oil --- intersect in Barack Obama's energy plan. The president-elect would invest billions of dollars to develop electric-powered cars, a move that would not only reduce tailpipe emissions but also would help the nation control its voracious appetite for gasoline. Obama also foresees massive investments in renewable energy sources: wind, solar, hydro, biomass, with two key objectives: significantly reducing carbon emissions that contribute to global warming and creating millions of new ""green collar"" jobs.\1. CARS, PART 1. Obama promises to put 1 million plug-in hybrid electric cars on the road within six years. That's a lot of cars, but still less than 1 percent of the nation's registered passenger cars, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. These vehicles would get up to 150 mpg and, he says, would be made in America. General Motors, maker of the Volt, and Toyota, which is creating a plug-in version of its Prius hybrid, both intend to go into production soon, with the Volt coming out in 2010. GM says its car plugs into a standard home outlet and uses less electricity annually than a refrigerator. The Volt has a small gas-powered motor for when the batteries run dry. One problem may be price: GM is struggling to keep the rather cool-looking Volt under $40,000. Obama's answer is to offer a $7,000 tax credit to consumers who buy such vehicles. He also pledges that, one year into his term, he will have replaced all White House vehicles, ""as security permits,"" with plug-in hybrids and that half of the cars the government buys will be all-electric or plug-in hybrids by 2012.\2. CARS, PART 2. The government first set gas-mileage standards (known as CAFE, for Corporate Average Fuel Economy) in 1978 at 18 mpg for passenger cars. They rose to 27.5 mpg by 1990, and there they stayed until last year, when Congress passed an energy bill raising the CAFE standard to 35 mpg by 2020. Obama would accelerate that by raising CAFE 4 percent per year, putting the standard at about 32 mpg by the end of his first term. The president-elect has said he would ""partner with domestic automakers"" to help them retool from making big, low-mileage cars to making smaller, high-mileage cars. He has suggested $4 billion in loan guarantees to help Detroit convert its factories. That's not nearly enough, according to the automakers and the United Autoworkers, who went to Congress to plead for $25 billion for the same purpose. The prize, Obama says, is that within 10 years, the United States would save more oil than it currently imports from the Middle East or Venezuela.\3. NEXT FOR NUCLEAR. The biggest threat to Atlanta-based Southern Co.'s nuclear ambitions to build two more reactors may be the economy and not the president-elect. Obama, after all, hails from Illinois, the nation's No. 1 nuclear power producer. He's said the energy source is a vital key to the nation's clean-energy future because it does not emit greenhouse gases. The more likely stopper is a tapped-out federal government, which may not be willing to hand out promised tax credits and loan guarantees to fast-track new nuclear plants. It's unlikely Southern can build two proposed reactors at Plant Vogtle on the Savannah River without the subsidies, which Obama voted for. As it stands, the company could net up to $125 million per year for eight years in tax credits to construct the reactors by 2021. But Obama has set a high bar for expansion. He says the nation must first find a safe, permanent place to store the nuclear waste, and it won't be Yucca Mountain. The Nevada site was originally scheduled to start accepting commercial nuclear waste in 1998. Going back to the drawing board will mean spending more years --- and money --- looking for an alternative.\4. CLEAN COAL TECHNOLOGY. Obama acknowledges that coal is the nation's most abundant energy source and will continue to be a major source of electricity. But he wants to figure out a way to burn it without emitting greenhouse gases. To that end, he plans to invest some of his proposed $150 billion energy plan into reaching the coal industry's most elusive goal. He wants to help the private sector build five viable coal-fired plants that capture carbon emissions and inject them into storage areas. So far, the technology is unproven. Southern Co. has worked for more than a decade without commercial success on a more modest effort to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from burning coal by turning the coal into a synthetic gas. If perfected, that technology would reduce carbon emissions by 20 percent to 25 percent over traditional plants with pollution controls.\5. CAP AND TRADE. Obama told the San Francisco Chronicle in January that ""electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket"" under his economywide cap-and-trade system that would require power companies and other industries to pay for each ton of greenhouse gas emitted. Coal-fired power plants, which produce the majority of Georgia's electricity and emit the most carbon, would pay the most. Obama also said companies that try to build new coal-fired power plants ""will be bankrupted"" under his system. That's bad news for the energy companies and electric co-ops that want to build two more coal plants in Georgia. Under Obama's proposal, the federal government would sell companies pollution permits through an auction. Some of the money --- $15 billion a year --- would be spent on developing clean energy and energy efficiencies. The rest would be rebated directly to communities and families to soften the increased energy prices. Each year, greenhouse gases would be capped at lower levels, down to 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050. Companies that cut their emissions the most could sell --- or trade --- the unused portion of their permit, creating a market for cleaner technologies.\6. THE DRIVE TO GREEN, PART 1. The centerpiece of Obama's energy plan is his investment of $150 billion over 10 years in the development of an energy future that is unlike anything we have seen. Obama would pour money into plug-in hybrid cars (see Cars 1, above), wind and solar and other renewable forms of energy, low-emission coal plants and biofuels. Obama's plan would require that the U.S. derive 10 percent of its energy from clean, renewable sources such as water, wind, solar and biomass, by 2012. That goal jumps to 25 percent by 2025. Renewables accounted for 8.4 percent of total power generation in the U.S. in 2007, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Biomass and hydropower account for most of the renewable energy generated in the U.S. The fastest growth has been in wind, which has quadrupled in capacity in recent years, largely because the government offered a tax credit for renewable energy production. The tax credit, set to expire at the end of this year, has now been extended for an additional year, and Obama has pledged to renew it for five more years.\7. THE DRIVE TO GREEN, PART 2. Obama's 10 percent renewables requirement will have less of an impact on states that have a ""renewable portfolio standard"" --- a program that mandates a certain level of power generation from renewable sources. Georgia is among the half of states that have not imposed a renewable portfolio standard. North Carolina, meanwhile, mandates that its major utilities derive at least 12.5 percent of the electricity sold by 2021 from renewable sources. Energy efficiency can help meet the target. Georgia Power opposes both state and federal mandates because they would force the company to use more expensive electricity sources that would in turn increase rates. Instead, the utility offers a green energy program in which customers may volunteer to pay an additional $3.50 or $4.50 a month to help the company produce electricity from renewable sources. The cheaper price is for landfill gases; the higher price is for solar power and a proposed wood-burning plant.\8. 5 MILLION 'GREEN COLLAR' JOBS. Obama looks upon the green-energy sector not just as a way to cut greenhouse emissions and cleanse the environment, but as a powerful job generator. He believes the new ""green energy economy"" will create 5 million jobs --- ""good jobs that can't be outsourced."" The president-elect is also promising a ""Green Vet Initiative"" to offer counseling and job placement to some of the more than 800,000 veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. ""I won't pretend this will be easy or come without cost,"" Obama said in October. ""We'll have to set priorities as never before and stick to them."" Jacob Sullum at reason.com complains that Obama sees climate change as an opportunity to create jobs with taxpayer money. ""By the same logic, Obama should view war, crime and hurricanes as opportunities to create jobs,"" Sullum writes.\9. $1,000 'EMERGENCY' TAX REBATES. Obama would hit up Big Oil for some big money, slapping on a windfall profits tax that he would use to fund ""emergency energy rebates"" to Americans. He proposes to issue checks of $500 per worker or $1,000 per household to help families keep up with high energy prices and rising food prices. ""So the question is, does it make more sense for the oil companies to pay for it or does it make more sense for the struggling waitress who is barely getting by to pay for it?"" he said to The Washington Post in August. ""And the answer is, I'm going to fight for the waitress, not because I hate the oil companies but because I think it's more fair."" Five days before Obama was elected, Exxon Mobil reported its highest quarterly profits ever: $14.8 billion. That was on the heels of its $11.7 billion net income in the second quarter --- also a record. ConocoPhillips reported a third-quarter profit of $5.1 billion, up 41 percent. But the price of oil has plummeted by more than half from its peak during the summer; gasoline prices, and probably oil company profits, are headed down.\10. BIOFUELS. The University of Georgia and Georgia Tech stand to attract new federal dollars to continue research on the next generation of biofuels, including cellulosic ethanol made from pine trees, which are in abundant supply in Georgia. Obama's plan would also boost subsidies for biofuels. That's good news for First United Ethanol LLC (FUEL), which started operations at a corn-based ethanol plant last month in southwest Georgia, and two pine-based ethanol plants in development here. Obama also wants to mandate that the nation produce at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030, going beyond Congress' quota of 36 billion gallons by 2022. In 2007, the nation consumed 7.3 billion gallons of ethanol and biodiesel, or 4 percent of the total motor fuels consumed, according to the Energy Information Administration.\--- STACY SHELTON and RICHARD HALICKS\---\WHAT HE SAID\""We can't drill our way out of the problem.

33,"TAXES\Throwing money at problem is no solution\Ever notice how the government solution for all of our problems is always to increase taxes?\Childhood obesity? Not a problem. Tax the candy and soda pop. Too many carbon emissions? Not to worry. Tax it, cap and trade it. People dying and leaving all of their hard-earned money to their families? No problem. We'll take most of it in taxes. Too much oil spewing from the Gulf of Mexico? Don't worry. We'll quadruple the taxes on oil. Too many people getting sick? More taxes will solve that.\And so on and so forth, for every conceivable problem, both real and imagined.\In the meantime, our commander in chief (who has never run a business, never had to meet a payroll and never had a real job) wonders why the private sector is not creating jobs.\SY RICHARDS, ATLANTA\POLITICAL SYSTEMS\Capitalism will survive, but socialism will fail\No doubt that big business can and will corrupt. Any institution that gains power in finance or legislation endangers the individual. Power is control.\What is happening to our society is that government and corporations are growing in power. This government is spending resources that do not exist, and legislating regulation to the point we will be tied and gagged. When we see a billboard that asks, ""Obama where are the jobs?"" why not ask what you are doing to create jobs?\We used to be a republic of individuals who strived for success, prosperity and motivation to compete against competition. We did not ask for a government to do this for us in the past.\The recession proved that capitalism failed? Read history. Socialism has failed all through history.

Simple: Do not drill\People who respect water life have warned for years of a possible oil well disaster, but only token attention was given to the warnings.\Even if the oil kings cared about anything except money, and spent as much on preventing accidents as they do on producing oil, an accident would still have happened. There is only one way to prevent an oil accident in delicate environments.\Do not drill. This means no more off-shore or Arctic drilling. In these habitats, one accident can affect all life forms for decades, and beyond.\The U.S. could also encourage the use of alcohol as a major energy source. The method would be to encourage the growth of alcohol-producing, fast-growing crops like sugar cane.\The U.S. encouraged the growth of one of the most lethal drugs in the world: tobacco. Why not place tobacco on the illegal drug list, and grow sugar cane where deadly tobacco used to grow? Then, allow only vehicles to guzzle alcohol.\Save people.

34,"INDEPENDENCE DAY\Proud to be American\We recently went to Stone Mountain for the laser show and fireworks. There were many types of people coming in with us. I don't know if they were there for a uniquely American experience or to celebrate the Fourth of July or if it was just a coincidence. In the middle of the show, they played the ""Star-Spangled Banner."" Everyone stood up and put their hands on their hearts, and many people sang. Images of our great country were displayed on the mountain during the song --- images like the signing the Declaration of Independence and of everyday people doing their jobs: firemen, policemen, health care workers and such. This simple display and the response of the crowd made me incredibly proud to be an American! During this time when people hear so much bad news, in our hearts we know that this truly is the best country in the world. As a nation, community and individuals, we need to show pride in who we are, because we are good.\Jean Jones, Grayson\PARKS\Public mission missing\I love Piedmont Park. However, it is impossible to compare it with Chicago's Millennium Park, as Dianne Harnell Cohen does in ""Piedmont group pays off"" (News, June 28). Ten years ago, the building of Millennium Park became Chicago's most ambitious public project in its history. It began (and ended) in the mayor's office. Millennium Park is not merely the bold example of public architecture, sculpture and landscape design. The park hosts a free music concert nightly this summer. There is free dance, theater and fitness. Chicago is a city with a mission to connect its residents to its public space through architecture and the performing arts. Atlanta lacks the political will to do the same, and so the Piedmont Park Conservancy steps in. Public parks should be tax supported. An unintended consequence of a group like the conservancy is that, in spite of its efforts to manage the park through private funding, it actually undermines growth and a public mission by taking the city off the table. Without the leadership of the mayor's office and a commitment of tax dollars, it is unlikely Piedmont Park will ever become the world-class gathering place Atlanta deserves.\Marcy McCall, Atlanta\COLUMNISTS\Tucker misses mark\In reference to ""Promote racial diversity fairly"" (Opinion, July 1): I was with Cynthia Tucker until the end of her column, where she proposes New Haven go back to the drawing board and design a test that's fair to everyone.

It seems rather insulting to imply that black firefighters can't intellectually compete on written tests.\Nancy Sharpe, Marietta\Support sexual diversity\Cynthia Tucker's piece, ""Promote racial diversity fairly"" (Opinion, July 1) states, ""Race still matters, and efforts to overcome the legacy of discrimination will be necessary for some time to come."" Few would disagree. Shouldn't it be equally important to promote sexual diversity fairly? Our Georgia culture has demonized gays and lesbians for too long. By doing so, bigoted voices have created bullies of youth under their care. A few of these youngsters have made school environments unsafe for classmates who are perceived to be different, particularly if they are assumed to be gay or lesbian. Overcoming this legacy of discrimination ought to be as important as overcoming discrimination based on the color of one's skin! I urge Tucker and others who put their views in the AJC to tackle the issue of sexual discrimination with the same enthusiasm that they show for what we have been taught to call ""racial discrimination."" In truth, there is only one race: the human race.\Dale G. Merkle, Atlanta\Wingfield appreciated\I would like to thank you for the opinion piece, ""Cap and trade will be tax and fail"" (Opinion, July 2). Kyle Wingfield wrote an excellent article, and I will be looking for his articles in the future. I think if you have more of these articles, you will have an increase in subscribers.\Carol Bertner, Marietta\HEALTH CARE\Plan has problems\In reference to ""Market won't fix Rx care"" (Opinion, June 21): Cynthia Tucker's column actually mentions two significant problems with a proposed government-run health care system, the kind that is favored by President Barack Obama and the Democrats in Congress. First, in a government system, she as a patient may be told that she is not eligible for potentially helpful tests. This policy would help to hold down the cost of the system. Second, even if the service is available, she might have to wait months to receive the tests. These delays are common in countries such as Canada and Great Britain, which have government-sponsored health care.\Jim LaBarr, Johns Creek\TRANSPORTATION\New vision needed\I was recently trapped on I-85 heading north to Gainesville in stop-and-go traffic, occasionally driving at a blazing 20 miles an hour. Earlier in the day, I had been riding MARTA as their trains were doing over 40 miles an hour into the heart of the downtown area. So why doesn't MARTA go to Gainesville? The solution to Atlanta's transportation problem is not another plan, nor a reworking of existing plans. The solution is a leader who recognizes the importance of a viable transportation system to the life of a world-class city. This leader obviously wasn't Gov. Sonny Perdue. Only the Democrats have shown the leadership to solve Atlanta's gridlock. We may have to find a 21st century equivalent of Tom Murphy or Maynard Jackson to get the job done, and we need to start looking now.\Howard A. Stacy, Atlanta\Credit: FOR THE JOURNAL-CONSTITUTION"

Because of his actions, Miller was the first African American awarded the Navy Cross by Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, the Commander in Chief, Pacific Fleet. There were more than 125,000 African Americans serving overseas in World War II. Just because they were assigned below decks doesn't mean they weren't serving and capable of manning the guns, and after the attack, blacks became a growing and integral part of the U.S. Armed Forces.

Capacity is dictated by load requirements, which are figured using the Air Conditioning Contractors of America Manual J, 8th edition. Load requirements may vary greatly from 400 sq. ft. per ton to 900 or 1000 sq. ft. per ton. An accurate Manual J is essential to proper sizing, and if your current HVAC contractor refuses to do a Manual J, find another contractor; it's that important. All HVAC work, either in new construction or retrofit complete change outs in Bluffton proper, the contractor must do a Manual J. If you have any more questions about the topic, just Google ACCA Manual J and it will give you more information.""

""Mr. Wolfe's editorial is just another example of the far left's ranting about people in their own homes having the right to own a weapon to defend themselves. He talks about way back when guns only had one bullet. Doesn't he realize that one bullet is all it takes to kill someone? I ask him this one question, and I guarantee you won't hear from him: how many children have died as a result of coming home in the evening by either their mother or father as a result of being shot?""

IMMIGRATION

Does he not know what our immigration laws are? All he has to do is enforce them. Stop discussing them; enforce them.""

\
""Why would Medicare papers and Medicaid papers and insurance be in Spanish? We've got to stop aiding and abetting illegal aliens in this country. The next thing you know the voter registration will be in Spanish. This is not right. This country is based on the English language. People come to this country need to assimilate into our country. How many times do I have to tell you that? If you don't want to assimilate into the U.S., then get out!""
\
""July 1, e-verify is mandatory for all new and old employees. You can turn in any company that you suspect of hiring illegals to the Department of Labor or you can call the county administrator, Gary Kubic. Please do so.""
\
""Finally, July 1, mandatory e-verify in all work places. Let the job race begin! If you suspect anyone of hiring illegal aliens, you can call the Office of Investigation 745-9290. The secretary will give you to the officer on duty for your complaints.... ""

The EEOC, when my husband called them, specifically states that this language or any other language should not be used in the workplace unless working with a client or in the back room. 209,000 complaints at the EEOC since Jan. 1 in South Carolina. This only goes to show you that this is an unfair business practice for American citizens. Call your state legislators after July 4 and tell them to get on it immediately. If I remember correctly, Joe Wilson had already made South Carolina an English-speaking state. Do your research.""
\
""Reagan gave amnesty to illegal aliens in the 80's. Big mistake. Obama is trying to give amnesty to illegal aliens now. Big mistake. Notice I named both a Republican and a Democrat. Regarding criminal behavior, no matter who does it, is idiotic and destructive to this country. There is nothing racist about that statement, because illegal aliens come in every color and creed. Enter this country legally; we will welcome you. Enter this country illegally, and we should not reward you. How simple is that?""
\
""I'm listening to a speech that President Obama is giving on comprehensive immigration reform, which is a fancy term for amnesty for criminals. He just made the statement that our border is more secure that it has ever been. Is the President ignorant or is he a liar? You make the call.""

""My name is Larry. I wasn't born in America, but I snuck across the Canadian border. The persistent chest cough I have, it might be tuberculosis, but we didn't have doctors in the village where I came from. I bought somebody's ID for $150. I had a job for a while, but then I found out I could get 99 weeks of unemployment and you folks would pay me to do nothing. So I am. But, that's about to run out because of the selfish Republicans.

But, it's for the environment; it's for the environment.""
\
""Obama economics, a lesson: when Friday's federal unemployment results show a net loss of jobs, it will be distorted and not indicative of the current economic structure because it will include the loss of jobs by temporary Census workers. Yet, when these jobs were created in the spring, the jobs were hailed as a sign that the economy was in an upward spiral because jobs were gained. Obama and his advisors think that we are real stupid to buy this nonsense. No wonder the Congressional Budget Office has said we're on a path to financial ruin under this administration.""

This is a reply to Sunday's letter from James Roney. I agree that man's activities have added to atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, but the effect that CO2 has on global warming is in much dispute.
\
There is no scientific consensus, as suggested by Mr. Roney. For example, one source of scientific analysis shows that anthropogenic (manmade) CO2 contributions cause only about 0.117 percent of Earth's greenhouse effect, factoring in water vapor (reference: www.geocraft.com/WVFossils/ice_ages.html ).
\
In my original letter, I expressed my opinion that it would be futile for mankind to try to reverse global warming by limiting manmade CO2 emissions. My opinion is backed up by many experts, including Dr. S. Fred Singer, an atmospheric physicist and professor emeritus of environmental sciences at the University of Virginia, and a former director of the U.S. Weather Satellite Service. He said, ""There is no dispute at all about the fact that the Kyoto Protocol (to control CO2 emissions) would have an imperceptible effect on future temperatures - one-twentieth of a degree by year 2050.""
\
If we can expect so little benefit from limiting CO2 emissions, why wreck our economy and reduce America to a Third World country with cap-and-trade policies?
\
In fact, higher CO2 levels may actually benefit the environment. Research has shown that doubling CO2 levels will greatly increase crop production with lower water use (reference: www.co2science.org/).

One of the major allures of recycling for environmentally conscious folks is it avoids the pollution-producing activities required to mine bauxite for aluminum, for instance.
\
But researchers presented findings this week on a nifty new technology that recycles air pollution itself for use in plastics.
\
The idea, presented by two teams of researchers at a meeting of the American Chemical Society in New Orleans, calls for removing carbon dioxide from smokestacks.
\
The CO2 would then be used as a raw material to produce polycarbonates. Carbon dioxide has the twin benefits of being less expensive and less toxic than other starting materials typically used to make plastics.
\
According to a story on the Web site LiveScience, polycarbonates are used to make an array of transparent materials, including CDs and DVDs, eyeglasses and drinking bottles.
\
Using air pollution to produce such items would bind carbon dioxide molecules - a major contributor to global warming - in solid form.
\
The leader of one of the research teams, Thomas Muller of the German Institut fur Technishe und Makromolekulare Chemie, told LiveScience that ""Using CO2 to create polycarbonates might not solve the total carbon dioxide problem, but it could be a significant contribution.""
\
Using air pollution to create plastics may sound pie-in-the-sky, but Mr. Muller indicated the technology could be put to use in the near term.
\
""I would say it's a matter of a few years"" before the public could be watching DVDs printed on CO2-based plastics, the scientist said.
\
Such innovation goes beyond novelty. It points to a mode of thought that stands a good chance of addressing environmental concerns while avoiding crippling regulation on America's already teetering manufacturing base.
\
Ideas that place value on what was previously considered valueless - such as pulp wood waste now used to produce ethanol - offer real motivating factors that will spur market-based solutions to some of our most perplexing environmental issues.
\
Combined with a cap and trade system - in which industries that cut their emissions could then sell credits to industries that have not yet met standards - these initiatives provide a financial incentive for companies to be better stewards of the environment.
\
Because businesses exist mainly to make their owners profit, it makes sense to entwine the profit motive with social concerns over issues such as air quality and global warming.

My passion is to foster economic development and a positive environment for private business to thrive.\Fortunately, the South has pro-business, fiscally conservative leadership, which is why it is the economic engine of the nation.\Because Georgia is under intense competition with our neighbors, I continue to work with state leaders to develop long-term energy and water supply projects (including asserting our historic riparian rights to the Tennessee River), improve our transportation infrastructure, improve education by promoting school choice, and reform Fulton County by making it more business- and taxpayer-friendly.\These policies are essential for our future.\However, Georgia is only as good as the United States. We must adopt globally competitive policies, especially to compete with China and India.\Our nation is at a crossroads and the 2012 election is pivotal.\I was the 5th Congressional District chairman for Congressman John McCain. Although my candidate lost, I appreciated President Barack Obama's message of bipartisan leadership. He committed to balancing our budget and creating jobs.\Instead, however, he promoted big government, Keynesian policies and overly burdensome regulations that continue to harm our economy, hamper private sector hiring and balloon our deficit via financial reform (Dodd-Frank), health care reform (ObamaCare), climate change (Cap and Trade), and the granting of unfair advantages (Card Check).\In 2008, young voters flocked to candidate Obama's message of hope and change. Polls show they are now fleeing.\I am a member of the Atlanta Young Republicans and the Buckhead Young Republicans. Attendance is skyrocketing.\Contrary to what has been widely reported, we have great diversity of races, ethnicities, economic levels and sexual orientations. No matter where we stand on social or foreign policy issues, we are strongly united fiscal conservatives.\The tea party shifted the conversation to fiscal conservatism and debt relief. Now we are fighting for a brighter future. Even Obama recognizes the shift.\Just recently, he finally advocated for Social Security and Medicare reform in his speech to Congress. To remain competitive with China and India, we have to do much more.\It starts with the next election. As a Young Republican leader, my top priority is to elect our candidate next November.\Brad Carver is the senior managing director of government affairs at Hall Booth Smith & Slover, P.C.\CAPTION: Brad Carver is the senior managing director of government affairs at Hall Booth Smith & Slover, P.C.\Credit: For the AJC"
39," Within the next week, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will issue its proposed rule for reducing mercury emissions from the nation's power plants.\ Mercury in the environment is an important issue and one that should be addressed. Mercury is produced from many natural and industrial sources. About half of the mercury emitted into the air each year comes from human activities and half comes from natural sources such as the ocean, volcanoes and soil erosion.\ Much of the mercury emitted into the atmosphere --- including emissions from power plants --- enters a ""global pool"" that circles the planet for one to two years before gradually falling to Earth. About 1 percent of the mercury emissions worldwide in this global pool are from power plants in the United States.\ While there are no commercially available technologies for controlling mercury specifically, controls of other emissions, such as sulfur dioxide, will help reduce mercury emissions from power plants. Southern Co. is engaged in research to efficiently and effectively continue to provide affordable energy.\ Over the next several months, EPA will take comment and input on its proposed mercury rule. We welcome the opportunity to comment on several options the agency plans to put forth. We understand that one of the options being considered is a cap-and-trade program similar to the successful Clean Air Act acid rain program. This type of program would offer the opportunity to obtain substantial reductions of mercury emissions at a much lower cost to industry and consumers.\ We also hope the agency takes into consideration the mercury reductions from power plants that will occur over the next decade as generating plants, such as those at Southern Co., install additional environmental controls to further lower other emissions such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. These controls are already expected to come at a high cost --- as much as $4 billion or more for our company alone, and ultimately for our customers.\ The challenges to addressing reductions of mercury emissions from power plants are many. We look forward to working with EPA and others in finding the right solutions.\ Vicky Sullivan is environmental issues manager for the Southern Co.\ This column is solicited to provide another viewpoint to an AJC editorial published today.

40," Clear Skies, the White House initiative that would eviscerate the nation's clean air laws, is dead --- for now.\ Industrial polluters may wish to observe a moment of silence. Everyone else should be tap dancing on its grave.\ After weeks of negotiations and arm-twisting, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee deadlocked Wednesday over Clear Skies. The panel's 9-9 vote means that it's unlikely the measure will reach the full Senate anytime soon.\ Despite its attractive title, there was never much to recommend Clear Skies to anybody except electric power companies and their lobbyists. Many large electric utilities, particularly those owned or operated by Atlanta-based Southern Co., face strict and longstanding deadlines under the current Clean Air Act to clean up their dirtiest plants.\ The president's Clear Skies proposal would grant those plants more time and latitude to reduce emissions of certain pollutants, leaving Americans to choke on the consequences in the meantime.\ The bill would also establish a ""cap-and-trade"" system granting ""pollution credits"" to companies that reduced their emissions below the required level. Those credits could then be sold to companies that had failed to meet the standard. While that idea has merit, the bill's other failings surely doomed it.\ Perhaps the most harmful provision in the bill inappropriately lumps mercury emissions in the same trading scheme as other pollutants. Because mercury poses far more serious human health risks --- including birth defects, brain damage and learning disabilities --- it must be regulated much more stringently.\ The Clear Skies bill would have stood a better chance of survival if it had included man-made sources of carbon dioxide, the key ""greenhouse gas"" that climate scientists have linked to global warming.\ ""It just seems a shame to me that Congress is the last bastion of denial when it comes to climate change,"" said Sen. Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island, the lone committee Republican to vote against Clear Skies.\ Chafee is only half right; Congress has a partner in the Bush administration in avoiding the growing problem of carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels in coal-fired power plants and gas-powered cars.\ Having suffered a legislative defeat, the administration threatens to resurrect parts of the bill by regulatory fiat. Instead of planning another coming-out party for Clear Skies, a funeral would be more appropriate.\ > EQUAL TIME: For another perspective on this issue, see the next page, A23"

The plot to ""make President Obama a one-term president"", no matter the harm to America, is documented - never disputed by any named conspirator, in Robert Draper's, ""Do Not Ask What Good We Do: Inside the U.S. House of Representatives"". The expose unmasks Republican lawmakers and strategists plotting the ruination of Obama's presidency within hours of his 2009 inauguration oath.
\
That January cabal of House of Representatives: Eric Cantor (Va.), Kevin McCarthy (Calf.), Paul Ryan (Wisc.), Pete Sessions (Texas), Jeb Hensarling (Texas), Pete Hoekstra (Mich.), Dan Lungren (Calif.), plus senators: Jim DeMint (S.C.), Jon Kyl (Ariz.), Tom Coburn (Okla.), John Ensign (Nev.), Bob Corker (Tenn.), also included Newt Gingrich and talking points tactician Frank Luntz.
\
Draper reveals their strategy to thwart Obama's policies by ardently opposing cabinet nominees, coercing House GOP to block all economic stimulus legislation, and unrelenting negative attacks. Tea Party political terrorism, combined with the Democrats' limited Congressional power to pass legislation, has proven successful for the Party of ""no"" and disastrous for the ""general welfare"" of America.
\
Conservative pundits and Republican lawmakers label President Obama as ""ineffective"", with incessant misrepresentation about Obama's wasted Congressional super-majority advantage during his first two years.
\
The 2009 U.S. House functioned under a 256 of 493 Democrat majority until January 2011, when 87 Tea Party freshmen were sworn in, creating a GOP House majority. However, the reality is Obama's Senate was filibuster-proof (60-40), assuming two Independents join the Democratic caucus, for barely six months of 2009.
\
The 'revolving door' of coming and going senators - from Arlen Specter's party switch in April and Al Franken's (Minn.-D) delayed seating in July to Ted Kennedy's appointed replacement in September, ending with Scott Brown's (Mass.-R) oath in February 2010 - was anything but advantageous.
\
Taking into account all the Senate recesses and breaks, Obama's presidency enjoyed a sporadically brief super-majority and he's been severely handicapped by the onslaught of every procedural obstruction the Republicans can put in his path.
\
President Obama, against advice from many advisors, invested his short-lived political advantage on the health care reform bill - now law. Unfortunately, Republican Senators have employed historic filibuster impediments - more than 300 times - successfully killing 90 percent of his legislation to create jobs and stimulate our economy. Result? We live in a Republican economy forced upon us by intentional gridlock.
\
President Obama pledged to close the camps at Guantanamo Bay within one year of taking office - he accordingly ordered closure. Why are the camps still open? Much of the blame falls on Congress as it bars the 168 remaining detainees (July 2012 total) - even those considered low-risk - to resettle in the U.S., and other countries won't accept them.
\
Congress and the administration, facing election-year politics and a litany of legal and security concerns, remain at an impasse about what to do with those detainees cleared for release abroad, those slated for prosecution in military or civilian courts, and others being held indefinitely without charge.
\
""Numerically speaking, the Obama administration has made some progress toward closing Guantanamo,"" admitted Matthew Waxman, detainee affairs expert in Bush/Cheney Defense Department. ""Legislatively, they've been losing ground and are now worse off than when they started because of congressional restrictions.""
\
President Obama's positions have often mirrored moderate Republicans of the early 1990s, however he faces a GOP which has abandoned many of its best ideas, simply to oppose him. Health care mandate, cap and trade environment protection, tax rate adjustments to reduce the deficit, even the Bowles-Simpson budget plan became divisive when it appeared President Obama would endorse it.
\
Barack Obama was disrespected during his September 2009 health care address, rudely interrupted during a Rose Garden speech, and suffered the wagging finger of Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, yet he exhibits composure and grace in each instance.
\
Logically, administrators expect teamwork not sabotage from coworkers when rebuilding and maintaining a mutually beneficial enterprise. Our pragmatic president struggles to propel this nation up a steep hill yet he's consistently stifled by a GOP, childishly applying the brakes, thirsting for Obama's failure, not America's revival.

To illustrate the silliness of the comparison, I note the number of post offices and oil change stations within four miles of my home in Marietta: one post office, and at least a dozen oil change stations.

It would be interesting to see if the lottery would continue to ""set records"" if it was forced to compete with other forms of gambling. The state Legislature should either eliminate these bonuses, or let private industry compete with the state-sponsored monopoly.\George C.

The more pressing dilemma, however, is whether business-as-usual will kill the planet. We have already passed the threshold of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that scientists tell us is safe and sustainable.\There's an alternative solution to climate change that can reduce CO2, with minimal impact on our economy: Place a steadily increasing fee on carbon and return the revenue to all households to offset higher energy costs. Raising the price of carbon will level the energy playing field, and make clean power competitive with fossil fuels. Giving the revenue back to consumers takes the sting out of increased utility bills. It may not be the best thing for Southern Company's bottom line, but at this point, I'm more concerned with coastal Georgia's water line.\Leigh Ann Ledbetter, Decatur\SOCIETY\Same-sex families deserve equal rights\Re: ""Unequal rights for a model citizen"" (Opinion, Nov. 11): I totally agree with the opinions expressed by Ellen Taylor.

Downtown Savannah is alive with historic sites, museums, shops, eateries, and live music. However, the city is doing a dire disservice to the downtown region by allowing valet parking on the street. First Corleone's, then Il Pasticcio, and now Saya have valet parking in front of their establishments, thus taking away several spaces that were once free during the evenings and on the weekend.
\
What is to stop other businesses from doing the same and further contributing to the shortage of parking?
\
It is increasingly problematic that any proprietor should be able to commandeer public street spaces simply because he or she pays the city for the privilege.
\
If a business owner is convinced that valet parking is essential for success, there are several garages that can accommodate these cars. A decrease in the amount of street parking, combined with the high prices of parking garages, does not foster a welcoming environment for those who want to enjoy what Downtown Savannah has to offer.
\
A vibrant downtown is one of our city's best selling points, and an important step towards getting locals and tourists to come (and return) to that area would be to make parking more available and less expensive.

GREEN POWER WILL COST JOBS
\
George Will's column ""Tilting at green windmills"" confirmed my opinion of the failure of President Obama's new direction for green energy use in this country.
\
I feel that my previous 25 years of working as a mechanical engineer in the electrical generation industry makes me qualified.
\
Neither wind nor solar are base loaded sources of electrical power generation: They do not produce power continuously, around the clock. Because of this, so-called smart transmission and distribution metering systems have to be developed which continually adjust the cost of power that you will pay - and worsen Big Brother monitoring and control of how your home uses this power.
\
To make both solar and wind successful generators of electrical power will require a new efficient method of storing large quantities of power.
\
Where are our independent scientists to evaluate the effectiveness and cost of this new green source of energy? We cannot rely on the environmental zealots and the liberal government socialists leading this nation to total fiscal failure.
\
Further proof comes from Spanish economic professor Gabriel Calzada's report on that country's 18 percent unemployment, caused by creation of the new green jobs.
\
President Obama refuses to respond to this report because he cannot refute it.
\
The report concludes that each new green job costs $750,000 to $800,000 and eliminates 2.2 other jobs.
\
All businesses in the electric utility industry are guaranteed to make profits by President Obama, so they surely cannot be relied on to do a creditable evaluation. President Obama and his liberal socialist democrats have to be stopped - starting in the Senate's vote on the energy bill that would set up cap and trade of carbon dioxide, which is naturally occurring in our atmosphere when we exhale our breath.

BRIDGE PROGRESS GOOD NEWS
\
As a Skidaway Island resident, I am pleased that the advertisement for bids to design and build the new ""high"" bridge to the island has finally been placed. While I do not live in ""fear"" as Sam Eskew suggests (""Skidaway bridge 'to almost nowhere' inappropriate,"" July 6), I will nonetheless be happier when the ""high"" bridge has been completed. Why?
\
One of these days the old, difficult to repair moveable bridge will become stuck in an open position, making it difficult for anyone to get on or off of Skidaway Island (the many doctors at St. Joseph's/Candler and Memorial included).
\
When, not if, that occurs, we all hope it does not occur coincident with an emergency such as a hurricane evacuation.
\
Mr. Eskew should talk to the thousands of people who are his neighbors to find out how the populace feels about the ""high"" bridge project. Our issue is not of a short delay of minutes, maybe even an hour or two, but a couple of days in a crisis.
\
While we residents of Skidaway Island are acutely aware we are not the majority of the population of Chatham County, we are residents and large tax payers pro rata of the county. I believe it is appropriate to fix the access bridge problem to Skidaway Island before there is a major crisis.
\
As to the Route 80 problem from Wilmington Island out to Tybee Island, I would agree with Mr. Eskew and many others who have recently noted the obvious safety issues of a) lack of ""California"" style road dividers, b) lack of an ability to bypass any serious event, such as an auto accident and c) possibly even the inadequate capacity for evacuation from east of Wilmington Island in case of an emergency, such as a hurricane.
\
As a frequent traveler to Tybee, I support an effort to fix the limited access problem out to the island.

In a room full of Republican lawmakers and conservative activists, Perry never mentioned fellow White House hopeful Mitt Romney by name, but he made clear he disagreed with the former Massachusetts governor's policies.\""As Republican voters decide who is going to be best suited for this country and take it in a new direction by stopping the spending spree and the scrapping of 'Obama-care,' I'm confident we're going to choose a nominee that governed with conservative principles,"" Perry said.

As an engineer and advocate of coastal sustainability in Georgia, I'm astounded at the misinformation and wrong-headedness in the editorial about controlling carbon dioxide. (""Carrots, not sticks,"" April 27)
\
I wonder what motivated it and where it originated. Surely it comes from either profound ignorance or cynical preoccupation with the short-term profit-making of narrow vested interests.
\
Controlling CO2 is urgently needed, no matter what the price, but the economics actually favor doing as much as possible as soon as possible. Delaying capping and reducing greenhouse gases will cost us all dearly, making the inflated per-household estimates in the Congressional Budget Office analysis seem trivial by comparison.
\
This crisis of climate change is too serious to allow it to be driven by partisan politics. Envision coastal Georgia's property damage and the cost of replacing it with even a moderate rise in sea level, which is already underway.
\
Given the flat landscape in the region, on average, one foot of sea level rise translates to 200 feet of flood encroachment along shorelines and marshes. Such effects may be decades off, but the more we delay the greater the total impact.
\
We already know there's plenty of reliable wind offshore to support rapid conversion to wind energy along Georgia's coast. According to estimates by the federal Department of Energy and Georgia Tech, the total available here is about the same as 30 power plants - with free fuel and no CO2.
\
By making this conversion, we could reap huge economic benefits from the jobs created while also serving our shared environmental interests.
\
Instead of fighting the change in the use of our environment that is so urgently needed, let's use our talent to help make it happen as soon as possible.

NO EXCUSE FOR SUPER SPEEDING
\
As a father and commuter, I was shocked to see the recent article by the Sheriff of Emanuel County about the super speeder law.
\
How else should we prevent this dangerous and deadly behavior and fund trauma centers that are needed, in large part, because of super speeders?
\
Having lived in both rural and metropolitan areas, I have experienced both driving scenarios and seen the devastation thrust upon unsuspecting families as a result of speeding.
\
Running late is not an excuse for speeding. Super speeders endanger everyone around them. Their actions are immature and hazardous. If not held accountable, what do we say to the parents of children killed in school zones, or to the children whose parents were killed because someone was running late for work?
\
And why should we tax everyone for the few who choose to break the law? We all run late. Many of us are financially strapped, but should this alleviate our burden as responsible drivers? As economic times have shown, the pocketbook is a superb way to elicit motorists' compliance with the law.

CO2 BILL DANGEROUS

\
The Clean Energy Act of 2009 is another example of our powerful ""political class"" attempting to foist a well-intended, but hugely punitive cap-and-trade system on us.
\
The adverse economic consequences are towering, and we need not inflict any more pain on our already fragile economy.
\
I have a disaffection for the endless displays of the arrogance of ignorance from our elected officials. Apparently, it takes a crisis to drive change in our society. We can no longer allow ""political science"" to trump sound science and economics.
\
The alleged evidence that man-made carbon dioxide is the leading cause of global warming is at best highly suspect. In fact, even assertions about global warming are suspect.
\
Dramatic climate change has been around far longer than man has populated Earth. It's time to demand elected officials be informed and not fall prey to junk science and poor economic analysis. We must no longer allow the focused blather of the minority to prevail over the traditionally unfocused response of the majority.

CHILD EDUCATION SHOULD COME FIRST
\
As recently demonstrated by our elected officials, both national and local, we have mortgaged our children's future through unprecedented federal spending.
\
This is but one part of our children's future that is now on the line. It has come to my attention that our local officials have determined that education for our children is on the chopping block as well.
\
In the article, ""Teachers facing salary freeze"" (April 25), it is brought to the reader's attention that mandated step raises may not be given, and increased class sizes are coming. Are we not far enough behind in the national school rankings?
\
Does anyone think this will improve our school ranking? What are our officials thinking?
\
Our teachers are some of the hardest working, underpaid professionals employed by the state.
\
Our schools are just now showing improvement; this will only be a setback due to losing teachers to other counties who stand by their promised raise schedules, keep class sizes low and give teachers the support needed to promote successful learning.
\
Our children are going to need the best education available in order to overcome the trillions of dollars in debt they have inherited.
\
I realize that our officials are restricted by budget constraints. I would, however, like to see budgetary priority shown to the education of our children, even if it means redirecting money from other areas in order to provide a better education.

It's jobs stupid! Bill Clinton got it with his ""It's the economy stupid"" mantra but Obama doesn't have a clue. Unemployment is pushing 10 percent and the president thinks we have a jobless recovery. That's an oxymoron.
\
The stimulus package has done nothing for jobs and the administration thinks anything that helps business is ""corporate welfare.""
\
Jobs pay mortgages, buy stuff and even support government largess. Small businesses produce two-thirds of new jobs and half the gross domestic product, but business is being strangled by our government.
\
The U.S. has world record business taxes, massive regulatory burdens, a stifling litigious environment, big medical taxes coming, vanishing tax deductions and imminent inflationary woes. The administration has plans to make things even worse.

I certainly agree with the premise put forth in the Oct. 24 letter, ""No money for billions more spending."" But I must speak for the ""seniors"" and this constant attack on Social Security/Medicare.
\
I am about to turn 70, and I have been employed continuously since I was 14, including my college years.
\
I have paid into the Social Security system for all of my working years, and I paid the maximum every year when there was a limit. I remember that usually I paid my maximum by mid-November, meaning that 13 percent of my income went directly to the government before taxes. In the years since, I have paid into the system the full 12 months of every year, and since I retired last year I now pay into Medicare only. But that will probably change for this year, meaning I will once again be paying Social Security ""dues.""
\
I, like millions of other Americans, paid into the ""system,"" built equity into their homes, saved their money, established 401K, SEP plans, created investments, prudent fiscal management, etc. I was not looking to live on SS only, but when you look at the program, it was supposed to be our investment for the future.
\
Several years ago, when I looked at the amount of ""my"" money that I had contributed to Social Security it totaled in excess of $250,000. I thought that with that amount of money in hand in my retirement years I would be in good shape.
\
I asked the government for my $250,000 in one lump payment, since there was no ""growth"" attached to this amount, and I would go away and not be a ""burden"" to them for as long as I lived. You can imagine their answer.
\
Since the government, along with our ""economy,"" has devastated the living plans of many of us seniors, please leave our measly SS payments alone. Go slay bigger dragons.

EFFICIENCY INVESTMENTS YIELD MORE JOBS
\
In Mary Landers' Oct. 14 article, ""Energy for Atlanta, mercury for coast,"" Plant Washington supporters estimate that the coal plant will create 130 jobs. The Georgia Conservancy believes that many more new jobs could be created through investment in energy efficiency - without the pollution and financial risk of a coal plant.
\
We have a great example of how energy efficiency investments generate jobs right next door in North Carolina, where an energy-efficient LED lighting manufacturer recently announced it would add 575 jobs to meet increased demand.
\
Recent research supports this. The number of U.S. jobs created per million-dollar investment in making homes and businesses more energy efficient far outnumbers jobs created in the coal industry - by eight to one.
\
Georgia's leaders, including businesses such as Power4Georgians, are missing a huge opportunity by investing in old technology instead of energy efficiency. The Georgia Conservancy supports energy efficiency as good business sense because it creates more jobs, and it saves families money on their energy bills.

WORLD WAR II MONUMENT NEEDS FINANCIAL SUPPORT
\
Approximately 64 years ago, the veterans of World War II returned home to Savannah. At that time, the mayor of Savannah proposed a monument to honor the accomplishments of this group. From time to time, spotty attempts were made to make the World War II monument a reality with little success.
\
However, recently the plans and location of the monument finally became a reality. This was accomplished due to the dedication and hard work of a group of non-World War II veterans. This group of individuals such as Chairman Bill Quinnan, Committee members Jimmy Ray, Doug Andrews, Jim VeJar, Joe Cetti and architect Joe Meyerhof (who donated his services) all worked to make this monument come true. Good job gentlemen: Mission accomplished!
\
I would especially like to thank First District County Commissioner Helen Stone for her additional help and support to all veterans. She is a loyal and dedicated community servant who believes, and embraces the sacrifices that were made by all those who gave up time with family and friends to fight this war. Some of them made the ""ultimate sacrifice,"" so that we can enjoy the freedoms we have.
\
As a World War II veteran, I ask that citizens of Savannah and Chatham County give whenever possible to help the monument be built and completed with no money being owed on the day of dedication. And even though these are hard times financially, I ask that you give whenever possible. Please do this before the last of the WW II veterans are all gone.

I read the proposed cap and trade program being developed by Congress will only reduce global warming by 0.1 of a degree. It is insanity to implement a program that will cost trillions of dollars to the citizens of this country to appease the Al Gore group of environmental zealots.
\
Where is the open scientific debate of Congress's program effectiveness before President Obama and his liberal Democrats rush to pass this program this year, in order to finance his national health care?
\
In my opinion, this new liberal socialism is worse than communism. Is this the change that President Obama is to bring us? I am retired, living on a fixed income and can ill afford these changes. Today, I would advise young professionals to look at career opportunities in other countries. Where has our democracy gone?

ENERGY BILL DOES NOT GO FAR ENOUGH
\
I have been following the Congressional action on the American Clean Energy and Security Act.
\
I was hoping we would have a real change to a clean energy future if this bill is enacted, but I am concerned that unless there are some key changes to the bill, that we will not reduce our dependence on fossil fuels or improve energy efficiency.
\
We need a real break from polluting fuels and we must move to clean home grown fuels like biomass, wind and solar. I am hoping the bill gets better before it gets to the Senate. We need to say yes to clean jobs and clean energy. Our congressional representatives should work to strengthen the American Clean Energy and Security Act by including a meaningful renewable electricity standard and energy efficiency resource standard.

PARKWAY PINHEADS A HAZARD
\
Stuart Herrick's June 6 letter (""Speed limits? What speed limits?"") matched my thoughts exactly.
\
The older I get, the more I am inclined to stay in the sanctuary of my home and yard, rather than deal with the Indy 500 wannabes that abound on the roads. I can easier deal with a snake in my garden, than a pinhead on a parkway.
\
After several recent very close encounters with irresponsible drivers, I am convinced that if all the cars in Savannah were lined up, some dunce would attempt to pass them all, in a thunderstorm, on a bridge, while texting.
\
As for turn signals, I guess many cars are now sold without them: Sigh.

48,"In a July 14 column, Jay Bookman questions how a Fulton County judge could possibly attempt to regulate carbon dioxide emissions when state and federal authorities are still trying to figure out whether and how to do so (""Georgia judge makes a clean choice for Planet Earth,"" @issue, July 14).\We couldn't agree more.\Neither the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency nor the Georgia Environmental Protection Division has ever ruled that CO2 is currently regulated under the federal Clean Air Act. Nor has Congress. Nor has the U.S. Supreme Court, or any other court anywhere in the country.\But Fulton Superior Court Judge Thelma Wyatt Cummings Moore has decided that she knows better.\On June 30, she sided with radical environmental activists who oppose the construction of a coal-fired power plant in rural Early County --- denying, for now, the 100 or so high-paying jobs and the $2 billion-plus investment the plant would bring to that corner of southwest Georgia, one of the poorest counties in the state.\Georgia regulators had already approved a stringent environmental permit for the facility after a lengthy review. They ensured it would be the cleanest coal-burning plant ever built in Georgia, with some of the lowest emissions in the nation.\For Moore, that wasn't enough. She invalidated the permit and told state regulators to limit the plant's CO2 output.\But CO2 is completely different from other emissions that can be controlled by add-on technology. Although researchers are exploring options for capturing CO2 from power plants and storing it permanently underground, these options are not commercially available today. That's why Congress is considering a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade system to offset the impact of CO2 instead.\Moore's unprecedented decision illustrates exactly why the complex technical issues surrounding global climate change are better undertaken by policymakers --- whom she has just pre-empted.\The plant's developers intend to appeal her ruling later this month. The Georgia Chamber of Commerce, along with many of our state's leading businesses, will be lending them our full support.\Here's why: If Moore's decision is allowed to stand, it will severely hamper our state's ability to meet the growing demand for reliable and affordable power. And it will impose an incredible regulatory burden on businesses in all sectors of our economy that will choke development across Georgia.\Coal provides the lion's share of the thousands of megawatts that Georgians depend on every day. It offers an affordable, domestic solution to our energy needs while alternatives such as wind and solar power are brought online. It's also more environmentally friendly than ever, thanks to the development of new and cleaner technologies.\But no coal-fired plants have been built in Georgia in more than 20 years --- even though our state's population has since jumped 60 percent and demand for energy has soared. And with our population expected to continue climbing over the next 20 years, conservation efforts --- while important --- can only accomplish so much.\If Georgians want to avoid the rolling blackouts and skyrocketing energy costs that have plagued California and other Western states in recent years, we must lay the groundwork for additional capacity now.\Beyond crippling our energy supply, Moore's ruling would also subject thousands of new commercial and public-sector projects to cumbersome, costly Clean Air permitting requirements that could tie up development for months or years.\We're not just talking about power plants or large industrial facilities that produce their own power. Any sizable new building that relies on natural gas for heat would be susceptible to regulatory delay --- from office buildings and shopping malls to churches, schools and hospitals.\Even replacing the heating system at an existing building could trigger a visit from the Clean Air police.\Through judicial fiat, Moore has single-handedly subjected Georgia to a set of laws that no other U.S. jurisdiction is required to follow, putting us at a serious competitive disadvantage with every state in the nation.\Responsible stewardship of the environment is a vital part of our state's long-term energy strategy --- but the level of judicial activism and government intrusion on display here is unacceptable.\We trust the Georgia Court of Appeals will set things right.\> George Israel, former mayor of Macon, is president and CEO of the Georgia Chamber of Commerce.\CAPTION: PAUL FOY / Associated Press A Fulton County Superior Court judge has denied a permit for a coal-fired power plant in southwest Georgia.

49," Washington --- A proposed federal rule to control mercury pollution by electric power plants is so biased in favor of industry that it threatens to undermine enforcement of the Clean Air Act, senators charged Monday.\ Six Democrats and one independent called for an investigation by the Environmental Protection Agency inspector general of the agency's procedures in writing the rule.\ They said the proposed regulation contains verbatim language written by industry lawyers and false information inserted by the White House. There was no immediate response from the EPA.\ When mercury is consumed by a pregnant woman, most often when she eats fish, it can cause her baby to be born with brain damage.\ Although the effect can be severe in individual cases, a report by the National Academy of Sciences warned in 2000 that mercury poisoning of unborn babies in America probably results in an overall increase in the number of children ""who have to struggle to keep up in school.""\ The EPA has estimated that each year 630,000 newborns in the United States, or nearly one in six, have dangerous levels of mercury in their blood.\ The new rule would require owners of power plants that burn coal or oil to install the ""maximum available control technology"" for removing mercury gases from their smokestacks. The agency was under a court order to issue the rule.\ However, power plant owners, led by Southern Co. in Atlanta, have argued against strict mercury controls, saying reliable technology does not yet exist for removing the toxic metal from smoke. Environmentalists challenge this assertion.\ The seven senators charged that the regulation was written to meet such weak standards that it ""subverts the [Clean Air] Act's requirements in favor of industry arguments and outcomes.""\ ""Congress and the public need to know whether EPA's rule-making process can be trusted to put the public's health first,"" said Sen. James Jeffords (I-Vt.), former chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.\ Joining Jeffords in signing the letter were Democratic Sens. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, Barbara Boxer of California, Tom Carper of Delaware and Ron Wyden of Oregon.\ ""I think it's absolutely necessary to have this kind of investigation,"" said Felice Stadler, a mercury pollution specialist with the National Wildlife Federation who served on an expert advisory committee convened by the EPA when it started drafting the mercury rule during the Clinton administration.\ The committee, chaired by Dayton, Ohio, regional air pollution control director John Paul, included representatives of power companies, environmental groups and health advocacy organizations. It held 14 meetings and submitted four separate recommendations, ranging from stringent controls advocated by environmentalists to far less stringent controls proposed by industry representatives.\ Agency officials announced they would analyze the proposals and reveal the results at an April 2003 meeting of the panel, according to Paul and others. That meeting was canceled.\ EPA ultimately issued a proposed rule that would result in the removal of even less mercury than power company representatives had recommended.\ Later, leaked internal memorandums showed the proposed rule incorporated language that power company lobbyists had submitted on the side, without going through the advisory panel.\ Before the proposed rule was made public, it was reviewed by the White House Office of Management and Budget. The seven senators charged that during this review, OMB officials deleted language that showed that the EPA had not evaluated the effect the rule would have on the safety of children, a federally required study. In its place, the White House agency inserted the untrue assertion that such a study had been conducted, the senators said.\ In addition to proposing a rule requiring specific mercury control technologies, the agency proposed an alternative ""cap-and- trade"" plan that would set overall limits on particular pollutants, then leave it up to individual companies either to meet their own targets or to buy ""credits"" from other companies that exceed theirs.\ Credit: COX WASHINGTON BUREAU"
50,"From the very beginning of our national history, Americans have been arguing about the proper role of government. Put succinctly, the dispute is between those who regard government as ""them"" and those who see it as ""us.""\Our two founding documents embody the tension in its classical form. The Declaration of Independence locates sovereignty in the individual citizen, who possesses the rights of ""life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,"" as Thomas Jefferson so lyrically put it, and the power of government is described as an alien force that must be put on the permanent defensive.\The Constitution enshrines ""the people"" as the sovereign agent, with a Bill of Rights that defines a protected region where government cannot intrude, but otherwise identifies a collective interest best managed by a federal government empowered to make decisions for the society as a whole.\All of U.S. political history can be understood as a perpetual debate between these two competing perspectives, symbolized at the start in the clash between Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton.\The Jeffersonian position, with its emphasis on a minimalist government, prevailed throughout the 19th century and imprinted itself on the DNA of American culture as a quasi-sacred political creed.\By the start of the 20th century, as the United States became a more densely populated, ethnically diverse society with an industrial economy dominated by large corporations, the Jeffersonian perspective grew increasingly anachronistic. It became abundantly clear that government power was necessary to regulate the swoonish swings of the marketplace, provide a safety net for poor and elderly citizens and protect the environment. Thus the Federal Reserve Board, Social Security, Medicare and the EPA.\But despite these projections of the Hamiltonian ethos, which presumes that there is a collective public interest that only government can serve, the Jeffersonian ethos remains a potent force and not just in the right wing of the Republican Party. It colors the conversation about all the major domestic problems facing the Obama administration in ways that stigmatize as socialistic what we might ironically describe as the self-evident solutions.\In the health-care debate, for example, there is a national consensus that we have a broken and bloated system. But instead of replacing it with the kind of single-payer government-run system adopted by most of the developed countries on the planet, that option is ruled out of order at the start of the debate. As a result, the best we can hope for is modest reform of an inherently flawed and expensive system.\To take another example, in the ongoing banking crisis, the removal of government regulations permitted major banks to assume unconscionable amounts of debt, much of it in the form of toxic investments that still remain on the books. It has been obvious that the banks needed to be temporarily nationalized to force them to purge bad debts from their portfolios. But fear that the stock market would interpret this course as creeping socialism has prevented such straightforward action. So we are still waiting for many of the same self-described financial wizards who created our fiscal mess to get us the rest of the way out of it.\Our response to global warming is likely to meet the same fate. If there was ever a problem that demanded a coherent public response by government in the ""us"" mode, the threat to life on Earth as we know it would seem to be it. But ""cap-and-trade"" legislation, designed to reduce carbon in the atmosphere through government-created emission ""allowances"" that can be traded for money, is currently on life support in Congress, another victim of the deep-seated aversion to Washington's intrusion in the marketplace.\For much of our history, the Jeffersonian hostility to an energetic federal government served us well. But with the end of the frontier and the shift from an agrarian to an industrial economy, the expanding role of government in protecting and assuring our ""life, liberty and pursuit of happiness"" has become utterly essential.\All the major problems now befuddling us --- the destructive excesses of finance capitalism, a profit-based health-care system, an increasingly contaminated atmosphere --- are only soluble if we regard government as the chosen representative of our collective interests as a people and a nation.\No less an American hero than George Washington put it rather defiantly in 1785: ""We are either a united people, or we are not. If the former, let us, in all matters of general concern act as a nation. ... If we are not, let us no longer act a farce by pretending it.""\And even Jefferson acknowledged that his antigovernment vision would become irrelevant once we ceased being an agricultural society and that future generations --- meaning us --- would at some point need to throw off what he called ""the dead hand of the past.""\Joseph J. Ellis is the author of ""American Creation: Triumphs and Tragedies in the Founding of the Republic.""\CAPTION: Dean Rohrer NewsArt\Credit: For the AJC"
51,"Georgia filed a lawsuit Friday to block President Barack Obama's ambitious climate change agenda, joining two dozen states in opposing a forced reduction of carbon emissions.\But the state is also quietly working on a plan that officials said will improve on the federal policy in case the legal challenge fails.\The Environmental Protection Agency regulations announced in August were softer on Georgia than originally proposed, and the state has already put in motion plans to reduce its power plant emissions by 25 percent by 2030. Still, the state's Republican leaders accused the Obama administration of economy-damaging overreach that will drive up energy costs.\Georgia Attorney General Sam Olens said the new regulations were a ""classic example of the Obama administration's pattern of attempting to accomplish with regulation what it cannot achieve with legislation.""\The Clean Power Plan is the White House's most forceful effort yet to combat climate change, with the goal of moving away from coal-fired power and reduce planet-warming carbon emissions.\It lets states and utilities determine how to generate electricity under the new guidelines, and Georgia Power is already reducing its reliance on coal, particularly with the nuclear facilities at Plant Vogtle under construction.\The Obama administration and other supporters say the plan will help blunt the impact of carbon pollution, jump-start the creation of new jobs in the wind, solar and nuclear fields, and shut down the hundreds of coal-fired power plants that emit the most carbon pollution.\""We expect polluters and their allies to throw everything they've got at the Clean Power Plan, and we expect them to fail,"" said Michael Brune, the Sierra Club's executive director. ""The Clean Power Plan is based on a law passed by Congress, upheld by the Supreme Court and demanded by the American people.""\Critics, though, say that restricting power generation hampers economic growth, that renewable energy is not reliable enough and that Obama's efforts will have little practical effect on climate change --- particularly with China surpassing the U.S. as the world's top carbon emitter.\""We worry it will be harmful to Georgia's economy,"" said Judson Turner, the head of Georgia's Environmental Protection Division. ""If we're going to do this, let's do it in the best way that's mindful to Georgia's business climate.""\Regulation option followed block by Congress\During his first term, when Congress was in Democratic hands, Obama tried and failed to pass a cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions. Since then, he has gone around Congress and tested the limits of the EPA's powers to regulate heat-trapping gases most scientists say lead to rising temperatures.\Most of the 24 states filing the legal challenges are led by Republicans, but four states governed by Democrats joined in contending that Obama's move is an unprecedented power grab.\""Petitioners will show the final rule is in excess of the agency's statutory authority, goes beyond the bounds set by the United States Constitution, and otherwise is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion and not in accordance with the law,"" the states wrote in a short filing.\The legal battle is widely expected to wind up in the U.S. Supreme Court. The EPA has laid the groundwork for years, first by establishing that greenhouse gas emissions are harmful to human health, and thus fall under the purview of the Clean Air Act. (That finding was upheld in court.)\""We are confident we will again prevail against these challenges and will be able to work with states to successfully implement these first-ever national standards to limit carbon pollution, the largest source of carbon emissions in the United States,"" EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy said.\The administration has said the regulation is not only legal but vital. World leaders will gather in Paris later this year for a climate summit, and the U.S. plan could help encourage other big nations to band together on a climate pact with the goal of preventing what many scientists predict will be devastating sea level rise and other global warming fallout.\The White House and environmental groups paint a dirty picture of Georgia's carbon-damaged environment. Asthma, for example, harms 8 percent of adult Georgians and 11 percent of the state's children, according to the Atlanta-based U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\Amid fierce opposition, though, the Obama administration scaled back the sharp reduction of greenhouse gases it first required for Georgia.\That plan would have restricted Georgia to release no more than 834 pounds of carbon per megawatt hour by 2030. A later draft allowed Georgia to release 1,049 pounds per megawatt hour, a more readily achievable goal. It also delayed the start of the new emissions targets from 2020 to 2022.\Georgia leaders, who have unsuccessfully challenged key tenets of the Affordable Care Act and other Obama policies in similar multistate suits, are readying a contingency in case the courts dismiss the lawsuit. Turner, the head of the EPD, said the agency is working with utilities, politicians, local governments and others on what he calls a ""delicate"" dual-track strategy.\""These are big decisions, and they're still in front of us,"" he said. ""Georgia is going to be very deliberate moving forward, and we're going to take the time we've got to be deliberate and thoughtful about the outcome.""\Story highlights\> Georgia has joined two dozen states in opposing a forced reduction of carbon emissions, a key part of President Barack Obama's climate change agenda.\> But the state is also working on a plan that officials said will improve on the federal policy in case the legal challenge fails.\> The Environmental Protection Agency announced the regulations in August, when it eased the original proposal for Georgia, which has already put in motion plans to reduce its power plant emissions by 25 percent by 2030.\> The Obama administration and other supporters say the plan will help blunt the impact of carbon pollution and jump-start the creation of new jobs in the wind, solar and nuclear fields.\> Critics of the plan say that restricting power generation hampers economic growth, that renewable energy is not reliable enough and that Obama's efforts will have little practical effect on climate change.\Credit: STAFF"
52," Washington --- Southern Co.'s Bowen electric plant is the nation's biggest producer of sulfur dioxide gas, a study released Thursday by an environmental advocacy group reported.\ The second-largest power plant in Georgia and one of the largest in the nation, the Cartersville plant is one of the busiest, but not one of the dirtiest: According to the study, it ranks 50th in the nation for its rate of release of sulfur dioxide gas. The plant emits 16.7 pounds of sulfur dioxide per megawatt-hour of power it produces, far below the worst plant, which emits 40.64 pounds per megawatt-hour.\ Bowen is one of many plants that have not fully converted to using modern equipment to reduce sulfur dioxide from their emissions.\ The study, produced by the Environmental Integrity Project, named the country's top 50 ""dirtiest power plants."" The study found the worst plants have a disproportionate effect on the environment, accounting for 45 percent of collective pollution output while only producing 4 percent of plant-generated electricity.\ Every year, U.S. power plants create millions of tons of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide --- gases contributing to asthma attacks and cardiovascular disease. Many on the list are coal-burning plants built in the 1970s or earlier.\ ""We all want the lights to stay on, but we are paying a high price for dirty electricity,"" said Ilan Levin, primary study author and counsel with the Environmental Integrity Project.\ In addition to sulfur dioxide, power plants also account for one- third of all mercury emitted. Mercury is a neurotoxic pollutant that can harm developing children and fetuses.\ Stephen Smith, executive director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy in Knoxville, said the federal government has ""failed to protect us from greenhouse gases,"" believed to be a factor in the development of intense hurricanes and other inclement weather. He added that state governments must work harder to restrict carbon dioxide emissions.\ Levin said the technologies to reduce air pollution are ""widely available"" and are being implemented at many plants. ""But, until the public and policy-makers hold the electric utility industry to its promised cleanup of the nation's oldest and dirtiest power plants, Americans will continue to bear unnecessary health and environmental costs,"" Levin said.\ However, one piece of good news surfaced in the study's findings, Levin said. Because more power plants have been able to cut back on sulfur dioxide pollution, emissions for that gas have ""leveled off"" and are predicted to eventually decrease in the next several years.\ Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide gases react in the air to form the sulfuric and nitric acids in acid rain. Besides causing environmental and property damage, the chemical residues pollute the air we breathe, potentially causing asthma and other respiratory ailments.\ Electric power plants are the largest generator of sulfur dioxide pollution in the country and account for about two-thirds of sulfur dioxide emissions nationwide.\ About half of the power plants listed in the 50 dirtiest have committed to installing ""scrubber technology"" by 2010 to decrease sulfur dioxide.\ Units called ""scrubbers"" can remove up to 90 percent of sulfur dioxide emitted at a typical power plant, according to the Center for Energy and Economic Development.\ Georgia Power plans to spend $2 billion in the next five years to install four scrubbers at Plant Bowen, four at Plant Hammond in Coosa and two at Plant Wansley in Roopville. Plant Bowen is constructing scrubbers in each of its coal-burning units and is to complete the project in phases starting in 2008. When the project is completed, the company expects to reduce sulfur dioxide emission by as much as 95 percent.\ Lynn Wallace, a spokeswoman for Southern Co., Georgia Power's parent company, said it has started a 10-year, $6 billion plan to further reduce emissions for all plants in the system.\ Scott Segal, director of the Electric Reliability Coordinating Council, a group that represents power companies, said in a statement that the study seems to be ""working the numbers to make an improving situation look bad.""\ ""My beef with what the [Environmental Integrity Project] is trying to do is that they only look at data from individual plants and not the overall air quality in the area. When you look at that, it's a much brighter picture,"" Segal said in an interview.\ Citing air quality data from the Environmental Protection Agency, the power company group noted that in Atlanta, the number of poor air quality days dropped by 79 percent from 42 days in 1990 to nine days in 2004.\ Segal added that since 1990, the federal government has offered ""cap and trade"" programs that offer incentives for energy companies to greatly reduce their emissions.\ Power plants generating at least 2 million megawatt-hours per year were ranked under four categories according to pounds per megawatt-hour output of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, mercury and carbon dioxide. The ""top 50 dirtiest"" rankings were a composite score of the four separate rankings.\ The states with the highest concentration of ""dirty"" power plants were Indiana with five, and Alabama, Kentucky and North Dakota, each with four power plants on the list. Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and Iowa followed with three power plants each. Georgia had no plants on the overall dirtiest ranking.\ The rankings were based on the most current available data primarily from the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Energy.\ The nonprofit Environmental Integrity Project is a non-partisan group that advocates stronger enforcement environmental laws, concentrating on public health issues.\ CAPTION: BITA HONARVAR / Staff Georgia Power plans to install four ""scrubbers"" to cut down sulfur dioxide emissions at Plant Bowen, which burns coal.

53,"Yes.\Small cuts will snowball into larger ones that will reduce the deficit.\By David A. Ridenour\Republicans' initial steps to trim the deficit have been dismissed as mere symbolic gestures, but they are based on a time-tested debt reduction model.\House Republicans vowed to cut $100 billion in non-defense discretionary spending from President Barack Obama's budget this year. Compared to the $3.5 trillion federal budget, a cut of $100 billion is rather tiny.\But there's more than just symbolism here.\Republicans are using the snowball debt reduction method --- a debt counselor-preferred means of reducing debt that has helped many thousands of Americans restore their solvency.\This procedure calls for debtors to pay off the smallest debts first and the larger ones over time. The strategy works in part because it provides constant feedback, building confidence that gives people the courage to tackle larger debts as they go along.\The greatest difficulty we have in cutting federal spending and the deficit is our lack of experience with it. Without successfully making smaller cuts, we'll never be able to make the large ones needed for substantial progress.\Congress' new Republican leaders know they need to get the snowball rolling or, like snow plows following a New York blizzard, support for their party will be hard to find.\The message of the 2010 election, unlike the last Republican wave election in 1994, is clear: Americans believe government is too large.\A recent poll of conservatives and tea party activists conducted by my organization and FreedomWorks reveals the kind of trouble politicians may find themselves in if they ignore the message of 2010.\The survey found that corporate support for big-government programs --- including health reform, cap-and-trade legislation, and the $787 billion federal stimulus package --- harms them among conservatives.\Though the survey measured attitudes toward corporations, the implication for politicians is obvious. If tea party activists are ready to campaign against big-spending politicians' corporate enablers, just imagine what they're willing to do to politicians who break their promises of fiscal responsibility? Congressional Republicans seem to be getting it. They imposed an earmark ban and rejected the Senate's $1.2 trillion stimulus package even though its author, Sen. Daniel Inouye of Hawaii, loaded it with $1 billion in earmarks for Republicans, offering shots of spending to recovering spendaholics.\To make real progress in reducing the federal deficit, however, they'll also have to cut mandatory programs, as they account for 60 percent of total federal outlays.\Conventional wisdom holds that cutting such mandatory programs as Social Security and Medicare is political suicide. Poll after poll shows that, given the choice between changing the programs and keeping them as they are, more than 60 percent choose the status quo. But that's not a realistic choice and the public is coming to realize this.\A Rasmussen poll last October found that only 41 percent of Americans believe taxpayers can continue funding Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid at their current levels. A Gallup survey the same month found that 77 percent of Americans believe Social Security and Medicare eventually will create major economic problems. Americans know what must be done, even if they don't prefer it. They need to see solid evidence that the new Congress is up to the task.\David A. Ridenour is vice president of the National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank in Washington.\No.\A robust economy will fix the deficit; cuts will harm working families.\By Michael J. Wilson\The unfounded, yet enduring confidence of the American people in conservative budget dogma reminds me of Charlie Brown's equally misplaced trust that Lucy will someday hold the football for him to kick instead of yanking it away.\Good grief! Has history taught us nothing? In the past half century, six federal budgets have been in balance or surplus, two in the 1960s and four at the end of the last century. What connects those two decades is a pattern of sustained and balanced economic growth. In other words, if you want a strong federal budget, you need a strong economy.\Deficits occur when the economy drags: think of the Reagan Recession of the early 1980s and today's Great Recession. That's because federal revenue falls at the same time that vital safety net programs such as unemployment compensation and food stamps increases.\Repairing our budget really starts by repairing our economy. And that repair begins with increased demand. But consumers are unable to spend if they are burdened by debt and millions are out of work --- or worried they soon will be. Companies are unwilling to hire or invest in this uncertain economic environment. There's only one entity left to prime the pump: the federal government.\The seeming paradox of the government needing to spend more to balance the budget is not really all that strange. Short-term and long-term prescriptions are often at odds.\Think about it: Exercise is generally a good idea, but not when you're flat on your back with a broken leg. Once the economy is back on its feet again, spending can be addressed as part of the effort to control deficits --- deficits which, not so incidentally, will be lower because of the tax revenue being generated by a robust economy.\But even when we consider federal spending, we shouldn't accept a false equivalence of budget benefit and pain. That erroneous theory --- pushed hard by conservative zealots --- imagines everyone has gained equally from the spending and tax policies of the past 30 years, so all should suffer equally from deficit reduction. Nothing could be farther from the truth.\Wealthy investors, international corporations and defense contractors have been the big winners since budgets got out of whack in the Reagan administration. Rates on upper incomes have fallen precipitously, and unearned income --- dividends, interest and capital gains --- have been taxed more lightly than earned income, which results from working for a living.\Tax and trade policy has encouraged shipping jobs overseas, and a ballooning Pentagon budget has swelled the coffers of the Haliburtons and Blackwaters of the world.\Meanwhile, working families --- who derive much more benefit from rising wages than from tax cuts --- have seen their income stagnate in real terms. And unlike the defense budget, spending on social services is always viewed with suspicion and has been the frequent target of budget cutters.\So a deficit reduction package that demands more of the hard-pressed middle and working classes and relatively little of the economic elite should be rejected out of hand.\Flat on his back is where Charlie Brown always winds up when he buys what Lucy is selling. And that's the position the American people will continue to find themselves if they accept the bait-and-switch plan to cure the recession by federal budget-cutting. We might as well wait for the Great Pumpkin.\Michael J. Wilson is the national director of the progressive Americans for Democratic Action.\Credit: For the AJC"
54,"Cost-benefit\Of course, there's another side to this argument. The same OMB analysis that found the EPA was the largest source of regulatory costs also found it was the largest source of regulatory benefits. It calculated that saved health and conservation expenditures amounted to at least $1.28 trillion over the 10-year period. Even among the Republican candidates, not everyone believes the baby should be thrown out with its bath water.\""I believe we should keep our air and our water clean,"" former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney said at an August event in New Hampshire. ""Do I support the EPA? In much of its mission, yes; but in some of its mission, no.""\For almost all of the candidates, the ""no"" part has three major components, familiar to anyone who has seen the interest-group-sponsored issue ads on the morning news programs: Emissions regulations. New EPA rules are aimed at curbing air pollution that blows across state lines, making it impossible for downwind states to meet air quality standards. The rule primarily affects power plants, and the EPA estimates the cost of compliance at less than $1 billion. But Republicans contend it could cause the country to fall short of its energy needs --- costing jobs not only at utilities but at companies forced to pay higher rates for scarcer electricity. A Dallas-based electric utility last week fueled that argument by saying it would have to close two generating units, reducing its capacity, and lay off 500 workers because of the rule.\Another rule the GOP is fighting would cut emissions of toxic chemicals from facilities such as industrial boilers and cement kilns, which it contends could hurt the struggling construction industry.\Fracking. This funny word describes a technique by which water, sand and chemicals are injected into deep layers of shale to force out pockets of natural gas. It holds the potential to greatly expand U.S. gas supplies and provide an alternative to imported oil. But it likewise holds the potential to generate huge amounts of polluted and even mildly radioactive water as a byproduct, which is why the EPA is considering regulating the practice. Gas producers contend the water poses no long-term health risk and that putting limits on its disposal would harm Americans economically and strategically.\Greenhouse gases. With cap-and-trade dead, the EPA is set to directly regulate carbon dioxide emissions from stationary sources such as power plants. But the industry and Republicans are fighting the move, which is caught in the hyperpoliticized debate about wherther humans contribute to global warming.\Regulatory burden\The most consistent GOP argument is that EPA regulations, both current and pending, are holding back business expansion and job growth at a time when the economy is at a standstill.\""EPA regulations are killing jobs all across America,"" says Texas governor Rick Perry, the front-runner.\They also accuse the EPA of standing in the way of American energy independence. Former Atlanta radio host Herman Cain in Monday's Republican candidate debate in Tampa said his first step in bolstering U.S. energy production would be reining in ""an EPA that's gone wild.""\The criticism of the EPA is part of a central plank of the Republican platform for 2012, as articulated by Rep. Eric Cantor of Virginia, the House majority leader: ""a legislative agenda that boosts economic growth through reducing the regulatory and tax burden.""\The Office of Management and Budget in a 2010 report found that more than half of the estimated costs --- $258 billion to $292 billion --- imposed by major federal rules between 1999 and 2009 was attributable to the EPA, which also was responsible for the largest number of major rules: 80.\Thus the candidates' calls to either shut down the agency (Bachmann), place a moratorium on its rules (Perry and former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman), reorganize it with a new goal of helping industries create jobs (former House Speaker Newt Gingrich) or put it under the control of a board made up of the businesses it regulates (Cain).\Cut and streamline\The candidates' platforms offer some hints of what a Republican approach would look like.\Gingrich, for instance, speaks of having the agency --- he'd rename it the Department of Environmental Solutions --- work ""collaboratively"" with local governments. That hints at a popular suggestion to allow states to experiment with their own approaches for achieving mandated goals, just as they did during the 1990s welfare reforms that Gingrich helped push through Congress.\Romney proposes streamlining regulations for energy production in particular to avoid what he described as ""self-inflicted wounds"" on the nation's energy security. Above all, he calls for giving Congress the final say over major regulations --- a controversial idea for those who think politics would hamstring necessary regulation, but a popular proposal among those who believe agencies such as the EPA have too much power.\Romney, Cain and other candidates also call for imposing more stringent cost-benefit requirements. Critics warn such an approach is likely to underestimate the cost of failing to regulate enough. They point to China, where environmental disasters have demonstrated the dark side of unbridled economic growth.\But, with the possible exception of Bachmann and libertarian-leaning Texas Rep. Ron Paul, none of the candidates is calling for outright abandonment of regulation.\""No one is arguing for lead-based paint in toys for kids or unsafe food,"" Cain's platform says. ""We just want reasonable regulations that cut down on bureaucracy and help businesses succeed.""\'Doors locked'\Campaign rhetoric always contains its share of hyperbole, and most of the candidates are holding little back when it come to the EPA.\Rep. Michele Bachmann, consistently the fieriest, has pledged that if elected, ""I guarantee you the EPA will have doors locked and lights turned off and they will only be about conservation,"" She has also declared that the EPA ""should really be renamed the job-killing organization of America.""\What underlies heated rhetoric about the EPA, and what is the Republican prescription?\Backing down\The campaign against the EPA, propelled by the tea party and --- environmentalists charge --- industrialists who help bankroll the movement, such as David and Charles Koch of Koch Industries, owner of Atlanta-based Georgia Pacific, has already had an effect.\President Barack Obama, under intense lobbying pressure, this month put on hold an EPA move to tighten the standards for ground-level emissions of ozone, the primary component of smog.\The standards weren't due for review until 2013, but the EPA was preparing to make an early adjustment because of what it said was evidence that the standard imposed in 2008, weakened at the last minute, was insufficient to protect the health of smog-sensitive people, such as asthmatics.\Government observers suggest more such retrenching on environmental regulation is likely as Obama fights perceptions that his administration has been weak on job creation.\Ideas for change\If Obama loses to one of the Republicans in 2012, will the EPA face elimination?\Experts say that's unlikely, pointing to the circumstances of the creation of the agency under a Republican president, Richard Nixon, in 1970. At the time, environmental regulations were left mainly to the states, which, in a competition to attract manufacturers, were in what one lawmaker described as a ""race to the bottom"" on regulations.\The result was disasters such as a river so polluted it caught on fire, a plague of unsafe drinking water and major cities regularly enveloped in clouds of smog.\At least initially, the consolidation of regulation under a single federal agency had a positive effect on business, eliminating confusion. And in general, studies have found EPA regulations rarely have as severe an economic effect as industries claim they will, and that, on balance, improving the environment saves more money than it costs.\But amid tough times and a global market where U.S. businesses can find themselves facing competitors who operate with little environmental regulation, the call to moderate the EPA is gaining ground.\Sources: Candidates' web sites, New York Times, Wall Street Journal, POLITICO, Office of Management and Budget, bnet.com, the Hill, junkscience.com, thinkprogress.org, National Journal, Time, Boston Herald, Guardian\CAPTION: White House, NOAA and EPA officials tour the Delta National Wildlife Refuge on the Louisiana coast after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010.

""An earlier Vox caller stated that President Obama had the oil field sabotaged. (Laugh). Truly, I ask anybody out there, isn't there a special hospital out there for people like that, who make those kinds of suggestions. There has to be a special hospital. They should go seek one out.""
\
""Well, folks, now we have a school teacher who chastises a child because they drew a picture of the American flag. The teacher had told the class, prior to the drawing lesson, to draw anything they wish. After the child drew the American flag, the teacher came by and told her that it was offensive. Folks, even you people on the left, if you're satisfied with this, then you must hate the United States. Those of us in the middle and the conservatives had better wake up in these coming elections. Our country is being demolished by the left wing. It's deteriorating day by day. Our children are being taught by teachers who are so far left and they're protected by a union that could care less about the country. It's about time the right wing and independents spoke out and made their presence felt in the November and the 2012 elections. If we fail to do that, we deserve everything we get and we're throwing our children and grandchildren down the drain.""
\
""What is happening to our country? Day by day the Democrats are completing the secret agenda that they formulated. They have been caught in one lie after another. They are methodically destroying our way of life in the United States of America. They and the teachers' unions protect teachers who, from kindergarten through college, are teaching that the flag of our country is offensive, among other things. The innocent children are never taught how much blood has been spilt for many countries besides the country they live in. They have taken over some major companies and banks. They are spending us into bankruptcy and lending billions to other countries while we borrow billions from China. Liberal judges have removed God from all public schools and even rest homes for the elderly, even though God and family are the only things left in their remaining days. They have already jammed the health care bill down our throats. They are planning a cap and trade bill which is predicted to raise utility bills enormously. They have stifled oil drilling in Anwar, Alaska, even though it would be less dangerous to the environment and would greatly reduce the billions we send to the Middle East which buys more weapons for those who want to kill us. They refuse to seal the borders and will attempt to make millions of people who have violated our laws legal, just to guarantee their support during elections and bring us to a one party system.""

First of all, he is not 'this guy,' he is your president and he should be recognized as such, even if he is black, even if he is a Democrat. Show some respect and grow up. Got it? Okay, your question. President Obama went down to the Gulf region a few weeks ago to speak to the local residents and to show his support and concern for the tragedy and to let the residents know that the government will support all efforts to repair the problem. He does not work for BP; he does not work for Transocean. So sorry Vox caller, he is not on a boat working to fix the problem himself. He is our president. He is black. He is a Democrat.

\
""This is to Dr. Truesdale and the board members of Beaufort County. Regarding the Office of Civil Rights, when you separate these children we have to tell them why we're separating them because they don't understand. There's no real way to tell them other than to tell them because there are children of different color or race or ethnicity. We are putting it right in front of them and telling them they are different, and there are consequences for being different. Why don't we just leave them alone and not stress the issue of race? Our country has gotten so far trying to ensure that everyone is treated equally, and now, here we are separating these children who are fine where they are. The only reason we're separating is because they look different; they're from a different background.""

How are parents supposed to be able to communicate with teachers? Where is the blackboard that was put in place? That way we don't have to keep e-mailing you and trying to get answers about our children. The majority of us really would like to know. We can't just go by what the kids say. So, please, take the summer months, get the school together, and figure out what rules are going to be in place, that way the last three weeks of schools we're not imposing rules that haven't been abided by all year. That just does not make any sense, as the grading system, as the school system. Figure out how our kids are going to be able to learn. I don't want to hear the budget. I don't want to hear the economy. We need to educate these kids no matter what, or our country will be in more travesty than it already is. So, Bluffton, you are the school of Beaufort County. Get it together, do what you have to do over the summer, and let's make a better year next year.""

VOX RESPONSES
\
""A Vox caller used some revised history of the United States to provide some dumb comment about 'one if the darkest days in American history.' He was referring to the detention of Japanese citizens on Dec. 8, 1941. I don't know the Vox caller's age or where he was on the Day of Infamy but I was a young teenager when this happened. The mindset of the American people was far different than today. I don't think there were thousands of Japanese in the entire country in 1940. California was a mecca for Japanese 'tourists' and they were camera buffs photographing all of the Navy installations and ships on the West Coast. They provided invaluable information on the Pacific Fleet. The main reason these people were placed in detention camps was to protect them from harm. The American government offered reparations for their detention and these people refused them. Maybe the Vox caller should read 'Adolf Hitler' and 'The Rising Sun.' Both books are well-written and provide two different views on WWII.""

They can experience TSA security just as the traveling public does or as Katie Couric calls us, the unwashed masses. They will have to take off their shoes, their jackets or coats, their watches, their cell phones, Blackberries, computers, toiletries, and so on and place them in a plastic bin to be scanned.

LOCAL SPORTS TALK
\
""Congratulations to the girls' lacrosse team on their first win this season. We hope they have many more. Great job, girls.""
\
""Bluffton Today, keep putting in the wrestling. It's excellent; it's a great sport and builds tremendous character. I'd like to congratulate all the state finalists from Bluffton and Hilton Head. You guys had a great season.""
\
""I am just calling because of my disappointment in Bluffton Today. Often I hear things regarding the sports coverage for all of the schools but I must say that it is interesting how some particular sports get complete coverage and others get nothing. The most recent example was the girls' and boys' lacrosse team games that were held. It was their first season game and there wasn't one thing written, not one person mentioned, not one play covered. All that's listed is 'lacrosse' and the score. That shows the lack of a full perspective of Bluffton Today and it's disappointing since I do subscribe to your paper.""
\
Editor's note: Thanks for subscribing, but please have patience with us as Tim Wood hits the ground running - again - as BT's sports editor.
\
""I'm calling regarding the person who called in asking why Bob Anderson did not attend the black history celebration at Bluffton High School. They must have been at a different event than I was because Bob Anderson was there in the lobby, on the side. I spoke with him. They need to get their facts straight before calling in saying he wasn't there. One administrator is on paid administrative leave, another administrator was at a state wrestling tournament and another administrator lives in Beaufort, so please get your facts straight about the principal not being at the event.""
\
""To the person who recently moved here complaining about the lack of coverage of Black History Month, we the people of Bluffton celebrate history year-round regardless of it being black or white. There is no room for your racism here. Please take it back wherever you came from. History is history, regardless of race.""
\
MAY RIVER
\
""Citizens, keep the letters and Vox calls coming about the failure on the May River because until our elected officials make our environment and way of life their No. 1 priority, it will not get fixed.""
\
""Does the town think poop is what makes the May River oysters so good? It just seems that way since they've made sure it gets a steady supply through retention ponds and poor drainage systems. Oh yeah, leaving a few trees might help, also.""
\
""Jean Tanner's letter to the editor (Saturday) says it all. Greed and poor planning equals doom for the May River.""
\
""Way to hit the nail on the head, Jean Tanner. So simple, so true. Thank you.""
\
""Normally it's not necessary to give your name, but this is Vicky Randall. I am calling in reference to Jean Tanner's letter on Friday. I have to say 'amen' to the entire letter she wrote. It was well written and well thought out. My husband and I have been here quite long enough to see all the development that has taken place - which does directly relate to the decline of the whole area, not just our beautiful May River. So ladies and gentlemen of Bluffton, take pride of what you have. Try to avoid any more new growth that may cause even more decline.""
\
""I was one of the many who went to Beaufort for the council meeting the other day to express concerns for the May River. Our mayor also attended and heard the problems and steps we were going to take to stem the pollution. (On Friday) in Bluffton Today (in) Jim Croley's article, he said for every foot of pavement, that equals three times the runoff. Also on Monty Jett's program on Thursday, he said, 'Why didn't Bluffton use impervious pavements for the new sidewalks?' A good question because 25,000 square feet will be paved with other impervious materials. Why is it everyone else gets it, but not our town officials?""

GOOD SAMARITANS
\
""While my husband and I were struggling to maneuver a grill we bought from Lowe's into our trunk, we realized that a square peg does not fit into a round hole. Fortunately for us, a gentleman was passing by and made the generous offer to drive our purchase home to Sun City in his Honda minivan, even though he lived in Moss Creek, which was just a hop, skip and jump from where we were. The kind gentleman turned out to be the Rev. Dr. Gerry Kramer, pastor of the Lowcountry Presbyterian Church. We thank him for being our good Samaritan.""
\
""This is Saturday afternoon and I just wanted to call and let people know that kindness is still alive and well in Bluffton. I got stranded at the Cancer Thrift Store with some friends after doing some shopping and a very nice gentleman stopped by but he did not have any jumper cables so he drove all the way home and came back with cables and helped us get our car going so we could be on our way. Thank you so much and may God bless you.""

IMMIGRATION
\
""What does Self Help have, a relative who works at Bluffton Today? Enough already with the stories in there. Yes, they do a good deed even though they cater solely to the illegals, but there are plenty of other charities and organization in the area who do just as good and get no recognition. I'm sick of reading about Self Help. Jenny doesn't know what she wants. About two years ago, they helped me and I wanted to return the favor so I asked Jenny if I could volunteer. She flat out told me 'no, we're all set.' I'm not kidding.""
\
Editor's note: It is simply untrue that Self Help caters only to illegal immigrants. We're not kidding.
\
""We need to get the immigrants out of Beaufort County.""
\
""This comment is in reference to the comment that was made about the Mexican little boy who was told by his mother to go outside and pee on the ground. The caller indicated that a lot of illegals really need to learn how to use restrooms. My question to whoever wrote that is, had a white or black person done that or told their child to pee on the sidewalk, would you have said they need to learn how to use the restrooms? I think that individual is being very stereotypical and that person is being very ignorant when it comes to associating all Mexicans (with) not being able to use the bathroom.""
\
""For all you President Obama supporters, maybe you can get this message to him: If he really wants to help the stimulus package to get moving, because apparently no one believes it's going to work because the stock market is still going down, try having him get a hold of law enforcement and ICE and all the rest of the companies who handle illegal immigration and get rid of 11 million illegal immigrants so then you'll create 11 million legal jobs. Try that one on for size.""

That was a fabulous picture you printed. It's exactly the smile he walked around with. If you were in a bad mood and you saw him and he said, 'hey, how are you doing?' you just felt better. Thank you for the article.""
\
""Thanks Tim Wood for that article about Jay Shanks and his family. I didn't even know him but it made me cry.""
\
""I just want to thank Tim Wood for the (column) on Jay Shanks. He was a great guy who made an impact on everyone. We moved here 13 years ago when I was 8 years old and Jay was cool enough to hang out with the rest of the neighborhood kids. He was the only adult who got to our level. He will be missed and his family is loved.""

""Everyone in South Carolina knows that you can make a right turn after stopping at a red light. Why is it then, on Simmonsville Road, we have a yellow and right turn signal hanging to the right side of the green light where you can turn right on Bluffton Parkway heading toward S.C. 46? Evidently the DOT crews put the light in the wrong place. The turn signal needs to be put in the right place, as you are heading on Simmonsville toward S.C. 46 to make a left-hand turn signal. All arrows and arrow lights are always hung on the left side. Why is this one hung on the right side? Will someone please tell me the answer?""

Afghanistan has only one revenue-producing industry and that is the cultivation of poppy fields that supply the heroin trade.

""If you dispute the overwhelming scientific understanding that we humans are significantly exacerbating climate change, evidence is unlikely to change your opinion."" - Laura Tyson, dean of the College of Business, University of California.
\
If you accept the scientific consensus, you should know that economists of all political persuasions agree a carbon tax is the most efficient way to reduce carbon combustion.
\
Fossil fuel combustion causes ground level ozone accumulation, acid rain, global warming and other problems. Economists have found two market-based ways to reduce the emissions: the carbon tax and a cap-and-trade system.
\
In a carbon tax application, a tax is levied on how much carbon is released through fossil-fuel combustion. This enables the price of the fuel to reflect the full cost of its impact on the environment.
\
Normal market pricing allows buyers and sellers to negotiate a price based on the private costs and the private benefits. In the normal market, costs imposed on society (called negative externalities) are ignored.
\
As a society, we do understand this concept. For example, when we purchase a new battery for an automobile, we are charged for the proper disposal of the old one. We place an extra tax on cigarettes to reduce their consumption and to pay for the negative health impact of smokers on health care costs.
\
Raising the price of fossil-fuel combustion has several benefits. It encourages efficient use by everyone (utilities, businesses and consumers).
\
A recent study found that people in Sweden use half the energy per capita compared to Americans. Why? Because higher energy prices in Sweden causes its more efficient use.
\
This is basic economics. We humans waste what is cheap but economize on what costs us more. Making carbon combustion more expensive assures more competitive options for alternative energy sources, thereby causing less environmental harm.
\
The cap-and-trade system is more complex. First, government decides how much carbon effluents may be omitted in a region. Then, it auctions the right to omit carbon pollution during the year.
\
Firms that emit the pollution bid against each other for the right to pollute. Economists like this method because it allows firms to decide whether to pay to pollute or to clean up their process in order to omit less pollution.
\
Firms with the most expensive clean-up costs would most likely purchase the pollution permits. Those with lower clean-up costs would rather avoid the costs of the permits and reduce their emissions.
\
The total actual costs would therefore be minimized. Expensive ones would be avoided, and the cheap ones would be financed to avoid the permit costs. The implementation of this process, however, requires constant government monitoring of pollution emissions (to eliminate cheating) and annual operation of the permit auctions.
\
The argument against both options is clear. Higher costs for energy would decimate the economy. Some of the pessimistic projections ignore the ability of our economy to transform itself into a more energy efficient mode.
\
The potential economic costs have swung political momentum against both the carbon tax and the cap-and-trade system.
\
Economists have proposed ways to reduce or eliminate the negative impacts of the carbon tax on the economy. The key is what to do with revenue collected from the tax on carbon emissions.
\
Adele Morris of the Brookings Institute has proposed that 15 percent of a $16 per ton tax on carbon emissions could be used to make lower income households whole. Another idea is to use the carbon tax revenue to cut corporate income tax rates from 35 to 28 percent.
\
Conservative economist Gary Becker advocates returning the revenue directly to taxpayers by lump sum or per capita rebates.
\
The simplest proposal comes from Henry Jacoby and John Riley from the MIT Business School. They say the revenue from the carbon tax should be used to reduce the tax rates for all tax payers.
\
By lowering these tax rates, all consumers would be able to pay the higher prices for goods and services without losing any actual purchasing power. In this way, there would not be economic losses, but there would be substantial environmental improvements.
\
Economic policy debates in Congress are being hijacked by ideological blinders. We all suffer from decisions driven by dogma. Economists rarely find consensus on big questions. Here we have one: the carbon tax.
\
We recently learned that China, a growing source of carbon emissions, will impose a carbon tax on their producers. We cannot afford to be behind them on this. Their firms will have a head start adjusting to the new reality. \ Kenneth Zapp, PhD, is a professor emeritus at Metropolitan State University, an adjunct professor at Savannah State University and a mentor for SCORE Savannah.

59,"'THUG' UNIFORM\Response to ""This 'thug' could save your life,"" Opinion, Feb. 23\I am an airline pilot. Like doctors, we hold the lives of innocent citizens in our hands. Flying requires extensive education, critical thinking skills, attention to detail, and personal discipline --- as does medicine. Our uniform, properly worn, is a statement of adherence to the highest standard, methodical attention to detail, and personal self-discipline. It is immediately indicative of who we are as practitioners of our art. I have no doubt that if I showed up on the aircraft in Jordans, open shirt, jeans, and a hoodie, that Dr. Osborne in first class would insist on being let off the airplane. If a surgeon showed up in my treatment room in like attire, I would also insist on being ""let off the airplane."" BRIAN WILSON, ATLANTA\GLOBAL WARMING\Carbon tax is simple and effective\Recent letters have mentioned a revenue-neutral carbon tax as the best solution to making a smooth transition from fossil fuels. The idea is simple. Burning fossil fuels is causing serious harm to the environment. This is well-supported scientifically and there is more than enough risk to deserve a concerted effort to address the problem. The situation will continue to get worse as long as fossil fuels are cheap.\What is needed is a way to send a clear signal to the market that the cost of fossil fuels is going to increase and that investment in alternative energy sources is likely to pay off. The only way to do this is with a carbon tax imposed at the source. It is made revenue-neutral by returning all the proceeds to households. The tax is increased gradually to a level that accounts for the cost of carbon to society. TERRY WELSHER, SUWANEE\CONFEDERATE FLAG\Issue brings harm to state of Georgia\The flag controversy has raised its ugly head again, this time in the form of the Confederate battle flag on car tags. Why would we inflict such hurt on a large minority of our population? I'm told it's for the sake of our heritage. Really? Why do we want to memorialize our ancestors who engaged in the reprehensible practice of slavery and who dragged the nation into a bloody Civil War to defend that ""peculiar institution""? The proceeds from sale of these tags are used to maintain memorials to the Confederacy. We should be tearing them down instead.\I find this part of our Southern heritage shameful, not glorious. I expect there are some national events, like NCAA tournaments, that will agree with me and boycott our state because of this ignominious symbol of hate.\Southern heritage worth preserving\I respect the Confederate battle flag under which dozens of my ancestors fought and all too often died. They believed they were fighting, as did their Revolutionary ancestors, to free themselves from an oppressive, overbearing central government increasingly intent on suppressing them with heavy taxation.\I condemn the pointy-headed white racists of the 1950-60 time frame because they hijacked ""my"" flag for their own selfish, misguided purposes. I likewise disdain today's black racists for their self-serving, profiteering attacks on my Confederate heritage.\I lament the ignorance of those who obviously lack knowledge of the multitude of reasons that impelled my Confederate ancestors to declare their separation from a nation that they had conditionally joined.\Unfortunately, all too many Americans have become so ""dumbed-down"" that they are incapable of, or afraid of, understanding certain truths of history.\LLOYD FLEMING, DULUTH\ERNEST WADE, LOGANVILLE\Credit: for the AJC"

\
Americans for Prosperity, an anti-tax group with a Georgia chapter, offered free hot-air balloon rides Wednesday at Forsyth Park to call attention to what the group says might be dire economic consequences of the fight to stop global warming.
\
More than two dozen parents and their children showed up for the rides and to hear the group's underlying message of opposition to future legislation aimed at reducing emissions too quickly and haphazardly.
\
""We are concerned about the environment,"" said Tim Phillips, president of the non-profit. ""But we want to make sure that while we are protecting the environment, we are not hurting families with higher gasoline prices and home energy prices and other necessities.""
\
Phillips said more drilling for oil in the U.S. is one way to reduce prices at the pump.
\
Economics and environmental experts said the so-called cap-and-trade legislation, which both presumptive presidential candidates have said they would support, undoubtedly will increase prices.
\
Cap-and-trade is a system in which polluters could meet limits on greenhouse gases by either reducing emissions on their own or buying credits from efficient producers.
\
But one observer indicated higher prices might not be a bad thing if their effect is to achieve a cleaner environment.
\
""Charging a carbon tax will make things more expensive,"" said Dr. Richard McGrath, an associate professor of economics at Armstrong Atlantic State University. ""If it doesn't, it won't have any effect.""
\
McGrath said that in the long run, when all industries make the switch to more environment-friendly production processes, the prices of goods and services for both consumers and businesses will begin to level off.
\
Phillips and his entourage are traveling to about 40 locations - including Marietta; Jacksonville, Fla.; Birmingham, Ala., and Nashville, Tenn. Members plan to stage a protest at former vice president Al Gore's home.
\
""We are saying that the legislation they want to pass, their remedy, is going to cause great alarm for the average Americans and the economy at large,"" Phillips said. ""We need to not hurt the prosperity we have here in America.""
\
Patrick DeMouy, a lecturer at the Moore School of Business at the University of South Carolina, said carbon dioxide is just one of the greenhouse gases that needs to be dealt with, and that methane is another gas that deserves a closer look.
\
""At the end of the day, it's going to be a little more expensive,"" DeMouy said, ""But hopefully, we can produce less waste.""

The overarching principle behind the tax is to wean America from its costly addiction to oil while promoting the development of alternatives to fossil fuels that have been linked to global warming.\ But Dingell wasn't being a statesman. As a longtime champion and chief enabler of the Detroit auto industry, he was making a veiled threat.\ ""I sincerely doubt that the American people are willing to pay what this is really going to cost them,"" Dingell said during an interview that aired Sunday on C-SPAN.\ Dingell is cynically betting that Americans are too spoiled by their own affluence and so unconcerned about the environment future generations will inherit that they won't make sacrifices needed to confront climate change head-on. For everyone's sake, let's hope he's wrong.\ As understanding of climate change continues to deepen, the next 18 months will prove critical. Congress is expected to take up comprehensive legislation in the fall, and the issue will likely be at the forefront of the 2008 presidential campaign. Serious voters, and politicians, must begin educating themselves about two key proposals:\ > A carbon tax would be levied every time motorists filled their gas tanks and whenever companies emit carbon dioxide while conducting business. The tax might be phased in over time; rebates could be offered to low-income households that would be unduly burdened.\ > A cap-and-trade system would assign permits to polluting industries that would limit their annual carbon dioxide emissions. Affected companies could buy and sell ""credits"" from each other depending on whether they had exceeded or reduced their emission limits.\ Both approaches have pros and cons. A carbon tax would be far less complex to administer and send a direct price signal that more accurately reflected the true cost of carbon emissions. A cap-and- trade program might be more flexible and creates a powerful profit motive for companies to pollute less.\ Either way, controlling man-made carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases won't come easy, quick or cheap. Doing so will be almost impossible, however, if elected officials pander to America's deepest fears instead of appealing to our highest aspirations.\ --- Lyle V.

63,"KING DAY\Warm welcome gives\lesson to youngsters\My children and I decided to celebrate Martin Luther King Jr. Day at the King Center.\We later decided to walk by Ebenezer Baptist Church so that we could see where the day's service was taking place. Though we had on casual clothes and told the ushers we were dressed inappropriately, they escorted us inside and encouraged us to sit. We snuck up to the balcony --- and immediately felt the passion in the room. The speakers were powerful, and the music was transcendent.\After the service, my children commented that Dr. King would have been proud that the ushers welcomed us. It was a simple gesture, but it made a huge impact on my children, who were able to experience Dr. King's legacy firsthand.\ALLYSON GEVERTZ, ATLANTA\ENVIRONMENT\Climate change calls\for simple solution\Your Jan. 22 article, ""Obama signals climate change push"" (News), suggests President Obama, having faced legislative gridlock on climate change, may use tools at his disposal --- for example, the EPA. Legislative gridlock is nothing new, but it grows worse as Congress chronically abuses rules like the filibuster to warp clear constitutional intent. Our government was meant to move slowly, but not this slowly.\New ideas, however, do stand a chance of passage, given shifting popular attitudes. A revenue-neutral carbon tax is a simple, market-based solution that puts immediate pressure on our abuse of oil and natural gas. A carbon tax also offers a simple way to begin charging oil companies for damage to the environment.\KYLE SAGER, CUMMING\STUDENT SAFETY\Seriously --- how could\teachers bear arms?\David Kopel promotes arming teachers (""Let teachers carry guns to protect their students,"" Opinion, Jan. 19) but fails to expound on how teachers might pack heat with any subtlety. Should they wear a belt holster? A shoulder holster? Should they stick a pistol in their stocking? Back pocket? Should they leave it in the desk drawer (locked up, of course, because you can't leave a loaded pistol available for grabs in a room full of kids)? Or maybe should they just hang it on a hook by the door? Just managing a gat in a classroom would seem to take the edge off of the real reason you're there: teaching.\As a former teacher, I can't imagine any of this. Few teachers are realistically prepared to engage in a standoff with a psycho. None of this says much for a civilized society.\BOB EBERWEIN, ATLANTA\PLAYOFFS\49er fan says thanks\for Atlanta hospitality\Thank you, Atlanta, for your hospitality toward 49er fans during the playoff game, a tough-fought battle that could have gone either way.\The Falcon fans gave great support to their team --- yet exhibited fine sportsmanship toward visiting fans throughout.

64,"Readers commented on our Atlanta Forward blog about two recent columns on a proposed carbon tax:\Nelson: Rather than encouraging a large utility like Georgia Power to involve itself more in clean energy, individual homeowners should be encouraged to have their own energy source. A wind turbine can be very unobtrusive installed on the roof of a house. They sell for around $10,000 and depending on the size of the house the owner can recoup his expenditure in as little as three years. Once Georgia Power sees their sales drying up, they would be eager to get involved in a clean-energy program without an inducement from government or any place else. Utility companies think the populace is shackled to them. That's not the case at all.\Diann Poore: Carbon tax is an outrage, another black hole for more revenue. Sounds like a Democrat scam to me. No more taxes in Georgia.\Christopher Sanchez: Why is the liberal answer to everything more taxes?\Brandon Sutton: It's interesting that the word tax sends many with conservative views into orbit seemingly before the actual proposal is fully considered. Each of us pays hidden costs of the fossil-fuel economy, whether we drive an SUV or a Prius or even if we ride a bike, and whether we live in a huge energy-intensive house or a Platinum LEED development with a focus on resource efficiency. We pay these costs in many ways, including in insurance premiums and other taxes that go to mitigate the harm that is done by the pollution and public health impacts of burning fossil fuels.\The proposed consumer-friendly carbon tax addresses these hidden costs, and acknowledges that rates will certainly go up in the future, as the market corrects the long-held distortion that has kept fossil fuel costs falsely ""cheap."" The principle is simple --- we discourage the things we don't want (fuel sources that pollute the air, water, and land we depend on and that contribute to climate instability) and level the playing field so the things we do want (zero-emission renewable energy that's clean and sustainable and doesn't pollute the environment that we live in) have a chance to succeed.\Costs of renewables have already come down and in some cases are already competing with fossil fuels. If we correct the long-standing market failure by accounting for the true cost of carbon by taxing carbon-based fuels and give the money right back to U.S. citizens to cover any increase in costs, the pace of innovation, job creation and the move toward a healthier environment for everyone will increase dramatically.\Why don't we let the market do what it does best by correcting the long-standing yet perverse incentives for fossil fuel-based energy production and see just how profitable the system can be for everyone involved, including ordinary citizens like you and me?\Credit: For the AJC"
65,"Some small cars do well in crash tests\Regarding the size of vehicles, crashworthiness, gas mileage numbers and impact on the environment in ""Choose the vehicle you want; the planet will be OK"" (Opinion, Feb. 4), first, I will acknowledge that in any given accident, bigger usually wins. However the writer neglects to explore that some small vehicles perform better in crash tests than larger ones.\The article is dismissive of the impact our choices play in selecting and purchasing a vehicle. If we are to take the article to heart, then by using the writer's logic, we should all drive tractor-trailers that can weigh up to 80,000 pounds. No automobile or SUV/pick-up will ""win"" a collision with a tractor-trailer. If we are unfortunate and end up in a collision, speeds too fast for conditions, the safety design of our vehicle, use of safety belts and harnesses and whether we collided with a larger or smaller vehicle are more indicative of the outcome.\MAX EPLING, WOODSTOCK\Carbon tax can fix emissions problem\In ""Choose the vehicle you want,"" H. Sterling Burnett actually makes an excellent case for a carbon tax, although I doubt that was his aim. He correctly points out that U.S. car and light truck emissions contribute a relatively small part of worldwide human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. But that is no excuse for inaction. The emissions problem isn't about cars or trucks or even power plants. The problem is carbon, and it's a well-understood problem.\Carbon dioxide is heating the planet, so if we want to cool things down, we need to reduce our use of carbon-intensive energy across the economy. A carbon tax that rebates all the money to the public would provide a broad solution to the emissions problem without complex and ever-changing regulations per sector or economic harm to average Americans.\BRANDON SUTTON, ATLANTA\Parents can't treat kids like property\Regarding measles, the libertarian view that parents have the unfettered right to treat their children like private property misses the point that there are societal duties that take precedence over individual rights. A parent must educate them, regardless of their own views about the importance of education. Parents cannot beat them, endanger them, must use seat belts, cannot subject them to child labor, etc.\GENE GRIESSMAN, ATLANTA\Credit: For the AJC"
66,"Former U.S. Congressman Bob Inglis, one of the country's most
prominent advocates for green conservatism and climate change
action, returned to his hometown of Bluffton on Wednesday to rally
support for his RepublicEn movement.\Savannah-born and Bluffton-raised, Inglis was the representative
for South Carolina's 4th Congressional District in the Greenville
area from 1993-99 and 2005-11. He was unseated in a Republican
primary runoff in 2010, which he says was largely a result of his
support for a carbon tax during the Great Recession.\Shortly thereafter, Inglis launched the Energy and Enterprise
Initiative (E&EI) at George Mason University in July 2012. He has
since rebranded it as ""RepublicEN,"" a grassroots group of about
5,000 educating the country about free-enterprise solutions to
climate change.\RepublicEN.org describes the group as ""energy optimists and climate
realists.""\""Members of RepublicEn are conservatives, libertarians, and
pragmatists of diverse political opinion,"" the website says. ""We
stand together because climate change is real, and we believe it's
our duty and opportunity to reduce the risks. We believe in the
power of American free enterprise to deliver the innovation to
solve climate change.""\Inglis said the group tried out a number of recruiting slogans
before settling on ""Conservative and concerned about the
environment? You're not alone.""\""What we've found out is people don't want to be the lone wolf,""
Inglis said\Wednesday at Lowcountry Presbyterian Church. ""Human beings want to
be part of a tribe, so to know that you're not alone is important.""\The group advocates for a carbon tax, which he believes
conservatives eventually could support because it would
""internalize negative externalities,"" or ""reveal the hidden cost""
of fossil fuels.\""Due to subsidies, fossil fuels are artificially cheap, obstructing
the market and preventing a level playing field,"" Inglis said on
his website.\""A carbon tax would internalize negative externalities by adding
health and climate damages to the price of fossil fuels. This
accountability would shatter the illusion that energy from fossil
fuels is cheap. Given the correct price signals, consumers and
producers would be incentivized to switch, quickly, to cleaner
energy alternatives.""\Inglis said his transition from a mostly party-line Republican to
an ""environmental conservative"" began shortly before his second
term. It began in 2004 when his son returned from his first
semester at college, haven taken some classes that covered
environmental issues.\""He's the eldest of our five kids and he's voting for the first
time; he just turned 18. He said to me, 'I'll vote for you, Dad,
but you're going to clean up your act on the environment.' That was
the first of a three-step metamorphosis for me,"" he said.\The second step occurred when he traveled to Antarctica with other
members of Congress, who were there to gather insight on how
scientists there were using millions of tax dollars.\""The south pole is a desert,"" he said. ""It gets a quarter of an
inch of precipitation per year. (Scientists) told us it's basically
a mile of ice and a couple inches of powder (under the surface). In
that mile of ice is an amazing record of the earth's atmosphere.""\Inglis said scientists carve large samples of ice and ship them to
Ohio State University for analysis. During his time studying the
data, he said, he became mostly convinced that mankind has caused
rising carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere.\""One of the things they see in the ice is (carbon dioxide) levels
that were stable and then they start rising, coincident with the
industrial revolution,"" he said.\The third step came during a trip to the Great Barrier Reef, where
he saw evidence of shrinking coral reefs and algae populations.\""That was somewhat of a spiritual awakening for me,"" he said.\Inglis travels the country speaking at events like Wednesday's at
Lowcountry Presbyterian. He visits college campuses, where he
prefers to speak to groups like Republican clubs.\He said the key to sparking effective government action on climate
change lies in educating and convincing conservatives, particularly
young ones.\On Wednesday, he spoke to a room of about 60. The group
participated in a poll that revealed about 66 percent of the
attendees identified as left of center, while the remaining third
identified as right of center. A second poll showed that 100
percent of the room believes the climate is warming.\""If you're among that 33 percent that are (right of center) and
believes climate change is real, I'd like to come shake your hand
because you are the most important people in the world,"" Inglis
said.\""The progressives here that believe in climate change, you're
wonderful. But you're not as powerful as the conservative that
cares about the climate. If you're conservative and care about the
climate, you're the most important people in the world because
you're the ones that will make it happen in Washington.""\CREDIT:

67,"
Environmentalists are citing approval last month by the Public Service Commission of a Georgia Power Co.'s long-range plan as a turning point.
\
In it, the commission approved the giant utility's intention to rely less on coal and more on other energy sources, including conservation, as the way to prepare for electricity demands over the next 10-20 years. Two-thirds of the company's power currently comes from coal.
\
The company's plan calls for it to begin its first large-scale operation of solar energy generation and the exploration of wind energy off the coast of Georgia. It will also launch seven campaigns designed to encourage greater consumer conservation.
\
""It's a huge deal,"" said Justine Thompson, with GreenLaw in Atlanta, an organization that takes on legal fights for environmental issues. ""Southern Company (Georgia Power's parent) is the largest energy producer in the country. The fact that they're moving away from coal is the end of an era.""
\
Southern Co., which also operates subsidiaries in Florida, Mississippi and Alabama, consistently ranks near the top of annual lists of major polluters because of the number of coal-fired plants it runs. Elected state regulators have traditionally OK'd reliance on coal because it is plentiful and cheap, helping Southern electric rates hover about 15 percent below national averages.
\
Nuclear plant construction stalled for 30 years following the Three Mile Island reactor accident. Today, the regulatory environment has changed, and Georgia Power is building the nation's first two reactors in three decades.
\
For years, solar and wind were described as unsuited for the South's weather conditions and geography, although Georgia Power is taking another look in this year's version of its integrated-resource plan, a document it updates every three years.
\
Natural gas has been a growing factor in power generation, but it is subject to competing demand from large factories and possible interruptions due to storms in the Gulf of Mexico. But pipeline capacity has increased in recent years, and Georgia Power is converting one of its older coal plants to a bigger natural-gas unit.
\
Stricter environmental regulations are also changing the economics of coal. Even without a ""carbon tax"" or ""cap and trade"" passing in Congress, the federal government is stepping up its authority over power plants.
\
And an ongoing court case related to a proposed power plant owned by an independent company, Longleaf, could open the door in Georgia to regulation of carbon dioxide emissions. Any combination of those factors could lead regulators to force Georgia Power to shut down more of its older coal plants.
\
""The financial outlook for coal is grim,"" Thompson said.
\
Plus, the market price of coal has swung more in recent years than it had, creating more challenges for the company.
\
""With fuel prices being very volatile, we want to bring more natural gas as well as nuclear into the mix,"" said spokeswoman Lynn Wallace.
\
Even as Georgia Power goes on a coal-reduction diet, other utilities are still trying to build new coal plants. Power4Georgians, a consortium of electric-membership cooperatives led by Cobb EMC, is seeking environmental permits to build a coal plant near Sandersville.
\
Why coal if the largest utility is going in other directions?
\
""It's not an 'or.' It's an 'and.' We need it all,"" said consortium spokesman Dean Alford.

68,"
Democrats and Republicans seeking public office came together to express their views and answer questions June 19 at the New Covenant Church in downtown Savannah.
\
The candidate forum focused mainly on the primary races which will be decided on July 20, and was sponsored by the Savannah Coffee Party. This newly formed group of progressive citizens is seeking cooperation and positive solutions to our nation's current problems, and is willing to listen to every candidate.
\
Beginning the session were four of the six candidates running for the 12th District U.S. House Congressional seat, currently held by Democrat John Barrow. Three Republicans, Mike Horner, Jeanne Seaver and Carl Smith, along with Democrat and former State Sen. Regina Thomas briefly explained why they decided to run for office, answered questions submitted by Coffee Party members, and then took questions from the audience.
\
Next up were Republican Joe Welch, who is in a three-way race for State House seat 163; Democrats Tony Mathews and Monifa Johnson, running for a seat on the county Board of Elections; and Democrat R.J. Hadley, who began his campaign 10 months ago to unseat Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson in the U.S. Senate.
\
The candidates all spoke generally of the economy and jobs as their Number One priority. However, the questions posed by voters attempted to dig deeper for actual solutions to problems in the areas of alternative energy, environment, immigration and fair elections.
\
After this three-hour session, the general election candidates were given the opportunity to introduce themselves and answer questions from the audience.
\
These included Democrats Carry Smith, running for District 1 State Senate seat, Jeremy Scheinbart for District 163 State House seat, and State Rep. Georgianna Sinkfield, who just happened to drop by and is running for Georgia Secretary of State.
\
Also in attendance and asking voter questions were State Sen. Lester Jackson and the Rev. Andrew Young, who hosted the event at New Covenant. In all, 25 primary election candidates and 16 general election candidates were invited to participate.
\

69,"Climate change is real, human activity is contributing to it, and
it's a crisis, Coastal Georgia Congressman Buddy Carter said Monday
after his recent appointment to a bipartisan climate committee.\Carter is among six Republicans joining the House Select Committee
on the Climate Crisis formed by Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., in
January. The other Republicans joining the committee are Reps.
Garret Graves (La.), Morgan Griffith (Va.), Gary Palmer (Ala.),
Carol Miller (W.Va.) and Kelly Armstrong (N.D.). House Minority
Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) announced the appointments
Thursday.\""As the representative for the entire coast of Georgia, Buddy is
already at the forefront of this issue,"" McCarthy said in a news
release. ""Buddy also serves on the Subcommittee on Environment and
Climate Change, and I am confident he will provide a knowledgeable
voice to the committee.""\'It has to be addressed'\In a phone interview Monday, Carter said he accepts the scientific
conclusion that climate change is real and that industrial activity
contributes to it, though he sidestepped a question about how much
humans are to blame.\""Regardless of whether it's mostly or not, it has to be addressed,""
Carter said. ""We know that we've got to address climate change, so
it's just one of those things that has to be addressed regardless
of whether it is the primary reason for it or not. Everything is on
the table and everything has got to be addressed.""\Climate scientists say most climate change can be attributed to
humans. The Fourth National Climate Assessment, a document to which
13 federal agencies contributed, including NASA, the Department of
Defense and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,
made this attribution clear in its first volume released in late
2017.\The Select Committee on the Climate Crisis is a bipartisan panel
tasked with examining the causes and impacts of climate change.
Pelosi formed it as a response to calls from progressives to form a
panel designed to focus specifically on mitigating the effects of
climate change, the Hill reported.\Freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who has championed
a nonbinding resolution on a Green New Deal that outlines a goal of
having the country running on 100 percent renewable energy by 2030,
declined a seat on the select committee. The climate crisis
committee has no subpoena or legislative authority.\Changing position\Carter has a lifetime score of zero from the League of Conservation
Voters, including 25 ""anti-environment"" votes on proposed
legislation to address climate change specifically. But on Feb. 26,
he made his first vote deemed ""pro-environment"" on the Natural
Resources Management Act, a public lands package to protect more
than 2 million acres of public lands and waters.\And like the climate itself, Carter's position on it has been
changing. Here's Carter in 2016:\""You know of all the things we can do in the world, we still can't
control the weather,"" he said. ""And I've never bought into the
climate change. I'm not naive enough to believe that we don't have
some impact on it, but to think that we have enough of an impact to
really change what is happening naturally, I'm not one of those who
has really bought into that.""\During the 2018 campaign, he repeatedly hewed to Republican talking
points, expressing more certainty that the climate is changing but
still raising doubts about the impact of burning fossil fuels. At a
public forum in August, he said, ""I believe in climate change. I
just don't know how much of it is man-made."" Carter said at the
time he was ""just not convinced of it yet.""\On Monday, Carter said he's learned from his time on the House
Energy and Commerce Committee and its Environment Subcommittee. He
hinted that the increased intensity of recent hurricanes was
persuasive. So were the people of the 1st District.\""I want to do the very best that I can and I've heard from
constituents and this is real and this concerns them and it's
something we need to address,"" he said. ""It's important to us in
Coastal Georgia and I get it and I understand that. Climate change
is real and the need to address it is real. So I'm all in.""\Opportunity for America\How to address climate change is the crux of the committee's
mission. Carter said he'll advocate for mitigation strategies like
using FEMA grants to elevate houses in flood-prone areas, but he'll
also promote ways to slow the pace at which we pump greenhouse
gases into the atmosphere.\""In order to succeed, we've got to have a broad area of
technologies that are brought to the market and they've got to
include renewable and cleaner energy,"" he said. ""I view our
responsibility in Congress is making sure we incentivize clean
energy and technology and promote clean energy and the research and
development.\""Listen, America has led the way. We led the world\with coal and oil and gas development. Now we need to do it with
growing clean energy markets. America is the innovator and this is
the opportunity for us to step up and a responsibility for us to
step up.""\He's ""withholding judgment"" on a carbon tax.\""I will tell you that I'm obviously not in favor of taxes, but we
need to incentivize renewable and clean energy,"" he said. ""It needs
to be affordable. It needs to be dependable. And we need to do that
in such a way that it's not going to destroy our economy.""\Carter, a pharmacist, agreed that ignoring climate change was akin
to a patient ignoring signs of an illness. He sighed when asked if
we've waited too long on climate.\""You know, I guess that's debatable,"" he said. ""Regardless of
whether we have or not, this is where we're at and this is what we
have to deal with.""\CREDIT:

Pelosi formed it as a response to calls from progressives to form a
panel designed to focus specifically on mitigating the effects of
climate change, reported The Hill. Freshman Rep. Alexandria
Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), who has championed a nonbinding resolution
on a Green New Deal that outlines a goal of having the country
running on 100 percent renewable energy by 2030, declined a seat on
the select committee. The climate crisis committee has no subpoena
or legislative authority.\Changing position\Carter has a lifetime score of zero from the League of Conservation
Voters, including 25 ""anti-environment"" votes on proposed
legislation to address climate change specifically. But on Feb. 26,
he made his first vote deemed ""pro-environment"" on the Natural
Resources Management Act, a public lands package to protect over 2
million acres of public lands and waters.\And like the climate itself, Carter's position on it has been
changing. Here's Carter in 2016:\""You know of all the things we can do in the world, we still can't
control the weather,"" he said. ""And I've never bought into the
climate change. I'm not naive enough to believe that we don't have
some impact on it, but to think that we have enough of an impact to
really change what is happening naturally, I'm not one of those who
has really bought into that.""\During the 2018 campaign, he repeatedly hewed to the Republican
talking points, expressing more certainty that the climate is
changing but still raising doubts about the impact of burning
fossil fuels. At a public forum in August, he said, ""I believe in
climate change. I just don't know how much of it is man-made.""
Carter said at the time he was ""just not convinced of it yet.""\On Monday, Carter said he's learned from his time on the House
Energy and Commerce Committee and its Environment Subcommittee. He
hinted that the increased intensity of recent hurricanes was
persuasive. So were the people of the 1st District.\""I want to do the very best that I can and I've heard from
constituents and this is real and this concerns them and it's
something we need to address,"" he said. ""It's important to us in
Coastal Georgia and I get it and I understand that. Climate change
is real and the need to address it is real. So I'm all in.""\Opportunity for America\How to address climate change is the crux of the committee's
mission. Carter said he'll advocate for mitigation strategies like
using FEMA grants to elevate houses in flood-prone areas but he'll
also promote ways to slow the pace at which we pump greenhouse
gases into the atmosphere.\""In order to succeed, we've got to have a broad area of
technologies that are brought to the market and they've got to
include renewable and cleaner energy,"" he said. ""I view our
responsibility in Congress is making sure we incentivize clean
energy and technology and promote clean energy and the research and
development.\""Listen, America has led the way. We led the world with coal and
oil and gas development. Now we need to do it with growing clean
energy markets. America is the innovator and this is the
opportunity for us to step up and a responsibility for us to step
up.""\He's ""withholding judgment"" on a carbon tax.\""I will tell you that I'm obviously not in favor of taxes, but we
need to incentivize renewable and clean energy,"" he said. ""It needs
to be affordable. It needs to be dependable. And we need to do that
in such a way that it's not going to destroy our economy.""\Carter, a pharmacist, agreed that ignoring climate change was akin
to a patient ignoring signs of an illness. He sighed when asked if
we've waited too long on climate.\""You know, I guess that's debatable,"" he said. ""Regardless of
whether we have or not, this is where we're at and this is what we
have to deal with.""\CREDIT:

71,"First, our overall electricity prices are currently sitting at 15
percent below the national average, according to power company
comparisons using Energy Information Administration data. Our
competitive electricity prices have been good for both consumers
and businesses.\Under our leadership, we are just less than three years away from
starting up advanced technology nuclear units that together will
reduce CO2 by about 10 million metric tons per year! And when
combined with the existing two units - the total will be 20 million
tons per year. In fact, Vogtle is slated to become the largest
nuclear station in the U.S.\The Green New Deal leaves nuclear out of the mix. In fact, it calls
for a complete phase-out of nuclear energy in 10 years. That is a
mistake because nuclear plants allow for carbon-free
uninterruptible baseload generation of electricity for possibly 80
years. This is especially important since we in Georgia have closed
or fuel-switched over 4800 megawatts of coal-fired generation -
plants that could run 24/7. In 2018, nuclear energy provided for
over 56 percent of our nation's emissions-free zero carbon
electricity, according to Nuclear Energy Institute.\These actions coupled with significant environmental investments
have yielded results. SO2, NOx, and mercury emissions are down over
90 percent and CO2 emissions are down over 50 percent. Georgia's
Integrated Resource Planning, mandated by the 1991 Legislature, has
helped us chart an orderly transition from a predominantly
coal-based generation fleet to one of the most diverse fleets in
the country including nuclear energy, natural gas, hydro, coal and
massive amounts of solar.\When I was elected in 2010, we had virtually no solar energy on the
grid. Today, Georgia is a national leader, and we have more solar
on military bases than any other state does. We have created
massive solar fields in Middle and South Georgia. Companies like
Target, Walmart, Johnson & Johnson, and Google have participated in
our forward-looking ""commercial and industrial program"" to help
achieve their corporate renewable goals.\There is a reason that Georgia was named the top state to do
business in by Site Selection magazine for a fifth straight year.
We have competitive labor environments and leading workforce
development programs, low taxes and utility costs, favorable
regulatory environments, and a cooperative state government. And we
have a Public Service Commission and investor-owned utilities,
including our electric cooperatives and municipal utilities, who
work hard to help businesses meet their energy and environmental
goals.\The Green New Deal plans for a carbon tax and carbon regulation
through a ""cap and trade"" program. The Green New Deal claims to
make fossil fuel plants, including clean natural gas, irrelevant.
The Green New Deal prescribes national mobilization of our economy
through 14 mega-expensive infrastructure and industrial projects.
The Green New Deal will, in short, send energy prices spiraling
upward in our state.\Names like ""Green New Deal"" and ""Clean Power Plan"" sound harmless
enough, but both of these massive federal programs steal power away
from states and give it to bureaucrats in Washington, D.C., and
they raise prices in the process. They are both a raw deal for
Georgians. No, thank you.\Tim Echols is the vice chairman of the Georgia
Public Service Commission."
72," Last month, Public Utilities Fortnightly -- a riveting national publication if ever there was one -- dipped ever so slightly into Georgia history.\The magazine featured a piece by Tim Echols, a Republican member of the state Public Service Commission. He pointed to the debate in Washington over whether the current $7,500 tax credit on electric vehicle purchases should be expanded or eliminated.\Echols warned Congress not to make the same mistake that our GOP-controlled Legislature did in 2015. State lawmakers erased the state's $5,000 tax credit on electric vehicle purchases and hit buyers with a tax instead.\""The move led to a nearly 90% drop in new electric car registrations and cost Georgia income, jobs and cleaner air,"" Echols wrote.\Several years ago, Echols successfully teamed with fellow PSC member Lauren ""Bubba"" McDonald to persuade Georgia Power, and fellow Republicans, to take solar power seriously. Echols is now on another crusade -- to revive the electric vehicle market in Georgia.\On Tuesday, the state Public Service Commission approved a Georgia Power rate increase that could begin increasing residential bills as early as next month. One of the overlooked aspects of the package was a requirement that Georgia Power spend $8 million a year, over three years -- on new charging stations for vehicles, and for infrastructure to provide the current.\Inclusion of the provision wasn't fought by the utility. ""They're not dragging their feet on this like they did on solar,"" Echols said in an interview.\No, the people Echols needs to persuade are his fellow Republicans, particularly those in the state Capitol. In fact, remember that November reference he made to the ""cleaner air"" that comes with electric vehicles? You may not see it again.\""We've talked about the environment. We talk about climate change and how (the cars) help with pollution. We haven't gone after the economics. I think the messaging needs to change on this,"" Echols said.\And the messenger needs to be a Republican.\Here's the pitch Echols is making: On a per-person basis, residential customers are using much less electricity than they once did. ""Because people are getting more efficient things, like LED bulbs. They use 90% less power,"" he said. Then there are smart thermostats, and better-insulated homes.\Bottom line: The per-house-hold demand for electricity is dropping, but the cost for generating that power remains static.\""The only thing that's causing any kind of personal growth out there, in terms of appliances or home power is electric cars. Electric cars use a fair amount of power when you're charging at home. And most people do charge at home,"" said Echols, who is on his fourth electric vehicle, a Chevy Bolt.\Echols pointed to Cobb EMC, which has a program that allows consumers ""free"" electricity from 12 to 6 a.m. ""They're doing it to get electric vehicles,"" he said. ""You program your car to start charging at midnight.""\An emphasis on electric vehicles also strengthens the justification for Republican support of the continued construction of those two new nuclear reactors at Plant Vogtle in east Georgia, Echols said -- despite those busted deadlines and cost overruns.\Like it or not, the PSC commissioner said, Washington is ultimately likely to levy some sort of carbon tax to discourage the use of fossil fuels. A friendly local environment for electric vehicles would ease any economic discomfort that transition creates.\But Echols isn't just in a defensive posture. He heads up an electric vehicle ""brain trust"" that gathers once a month -- to share new information and chart out the future course of EVs in Georgia. That future includes autonomous vehicles. A Mercedes Benz representative was there for Monday's meeting. So was one from Porsche, too. And the Southern Co., parent company of Georgia power.\The ""brain trust"" meets on the premises of Cox Automotive property on Metropolitan Avenue in south Atlanta. (Cox Automotive is a division of Cox Enterprises, which also owns The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.)\Echols would like to see the area -- located between downtown Atlanta and Harts-field-Jackson International Airport -- become a center for electric vehicle development.\Echols has suggested to Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms that the main thoroughfare, once known as Stewart Avenue, be renamed once again -- this time as ""Electric Avenue.""\Another member of the EV study group is state Rep. Todd Jones, R-Cumming. He is the author of House Bill 732, introduced last year, which would claw back $2,500 of the $5,000 tax credit for electric vehicles that was erased four years ago.\The measure would also offer a $500 tax credit for homeowners who install vehicle chargers. Introduced last April, the bill has yet to get a hearing.\Given that Gov. Brian Kemp, anticipating hard months ahead, has ordered two years' worth of budget cuts, Echols said that the time may not be ripe to push for more tax credits that would eat into state revenue.\Nonetheless, Echols will be one of the participants in a two-day policy forum on the future of electric transportation held on the Georgia Tech campus in January, just as state lawmakers gather for the 2020 session. Vehicles will be available for test drives.\Forty-eight different models of vehicles sold in the U.S. use plugs. Within 20 years, it's predicted half of all vehicles will be electric. The situation reminded Echols of the 2013 fight over solar energy.\""There were a lot of angry Republicans over that thing. They thought we had gone over to the dark side,"" Echols said. ""But eventually, as those solar farms wound up in poor counties across south Georgia, raising their tax digest, letting them get ambulances and libraries and softball fields, Republicans eventually said -- you know, this is a good thing.""\It could happen again. But it will take work, even in Washington. In a budget compromise reached this week, Congress didn't scrap the federal tax credit on electric vehicles outright, as the White House had threatened.\But they didn't expand the 200,000 vehicle-per-carmaker cap, which Tesla and General Motors have already exceeded. Other companies will quickly do the same -- which means the federal tax credit will soon be no more.\CREDIT: Staff"
73,"Canada announced Monday it plans phase out the use of coal-fired electricity by 2030. The move is in stark contrast to President-elect Donald Trump's vow to revive the American coal industry. Environment Minister Kathleen McKenna said the goal is to make sure 90 percent of Canada's electricity comes from sustainable sources by that time -- up from 80 percent today. The announcement is one of a series of measures Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal government is rolling out as part of a broader climate change plan. Trudeau also has plans to implement a carbon tax. Trump, in contrast, has also said he would ""cancel"" the Paris Agreement. Trudeau told President Barack Obama this past weekend he would miss working with him because he shared so many values.\GERMANY\Merkel plans to seek 4th chancellor term\German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced Sunday that she would seek re-election next year, a step that could provide a powerful counterpoint to the anti-globalization, anti-immigration narrative put forth by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Merkel, facing a backlash against asylum seekers, ended months of speculation about whether she would seek a fourth term and again take up her party's standard as a populist tide rises across Europe. Polls have shown she still enjoys strong support, if less so than before Germany, a country of about 80 million people, opened its doors to nearly 1 million new arrivals last year.

There were a great many over the last four years in many parts of the western U.S.\This spring, we also had large snowfalls in May. We have also seen high flooding after bad droughts in the recent past, and other extreme storms.\When will we take strong steps to address these global-warming climate events? There are ways. One is to establish a carbon tax on fossil-fuel production, and then return that revenue to the American people equally. This would allow market forces to help alternative energy production to develop much more rapidly.\With fast-increasing carbon pollution in Earth's atmosphere, let's try everything we can!\KATHY JOHNSON, DECATUR\Credit: For the AJC"
75,"If I were tax czar, I'd do away with Georgia's corporate income tax and replace it with a series of ""green"" taxes companies could avoid by not polluting the air and water.\If you're feeling the pocketbook pain of this week's tax deadline, it may not make you feel any better to learn that individual income taxes contribute 48 percent of state revenues, while corporate income taxes contribute 6.8 percent. Despite a 19 percent increase in the number of corporate filings in the past five years, the corporate percentage contribution hasn't increased. Georgia's population growth rate was up 9.8 percent for the same period of time.\One of the fringe benefits of dumping the Georgia corporate income tax would be fewer high-powered lobbyists at the Statehouse trying to guard the state's eight corporate income tax credits.\Those include such interesting reductions as ""the rapidly growing company tax credit"" and the ""port authority activity credit."" The port credit piggybacks onto jobs and investment tax credits. For example, a company can get a $3,500 job tax credit instead of half that amount by increasing its use of Georgia ports. Makes sense, huh?\Georgia offers no corporate tax credits for pollution prevention --- except a small one approved this year to encourage transit and car pool use. The Legislature didn't renew the solar energy tax credit, and the low emission vehicle tax credit applies strictly to individuals. There's a nice-sounding ""credit for water conservation"" that only applies to companies near the Savannah River.\In other words, Georgia hasn't considered giving corporations credit for being good stewards of our natural resources. But other states have.\At least five states are studying shifting taxes from income onto polluters. Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber presented tax recommendations last year that would reduce business and personal incomes taxes from 46 percent of state revenues to 14 percent and eliminate all property taxes. Taxes on pollution, carbon and traffic would be added to the 12 percent of state revenues already raised by environ-mentally conscious levies. Vermont, which added four cents to its state gasoline tax in 1996, produced a comprehensive energy plan last summer that proposes a carbon tax with revenues returned to taxpayers in other offsetting tax cuts. In Michigan, Maine and Minnesota, legislative committees are examining so-called green taxes.\The federal tax code contains a few corporate environmental credits, but they are far outweighed by subsidies to energy and timber industries. According to a report issued this month by a national environmental group, American Lands, 15 such subsidies amount to $2.6 billion annually, hurting individual taxpayers and the environment. Endorsed by a dozen environmental groups, the report claims federal fiscal policies reward waste and hurt local recycling and conservation efforts.\One of the issues on Gov. Roy Barnes' agenda next legislative session is water pollution. He ought to approach it with the general philosophy of rewarding companies that don't pollute and punishing those that do. That would be only a first step to a possible trade-off businesses could come to love --- no corporate income tax in exchange for pollution fees --- and rewards for being clean.\Martha Ezzard is a member of the Journals editorial board. Her column runs on Monday and Saturday.\Credit: STAFF"
76,"In a July 14 column, Jay Bookman questions how a Fulton County judge could possibly attempt to regulate carbon dioxide emissions when state and federal authorities are still trying to figure out whether and how to do so (""Georgia judge makes a clean choice for Planet Earth,"" @issue, July 14).\We couldn't agree more.\Neither the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency nor the Georgia Environmental Protection Division has ever ruled that CO2 is currently regulated under the federal Clean Air Act. Nor has Congress. Nor has the U.S. Supreme Court, or any other court anywhere in the country.\But Fulton Superior Court Judge Thelma Wyatt Cummings Moore has decided that she knows better.\On June 30, she sided with radical environmental activists who oppose the construction of a coal-fired power plant in rural Early County --- denying, for now, the 100 or so high-paying jobs and the $2 billion-plus investment the plant would bring to that corner of southwest Georgia, one of the poorest counties in the state.\Georgia regulators had already approved a stringent environmental permit for the facility after a lengthy review. They ensured it would be the cleanest coal-burning plant ever built in Georgia, with some of the lowest emissions in the nation.\For Moore, that wasn't enough. She invalidated the permit and told state regulators to limit the plant's CO2 output.\But CO2 is completely different from other emissions that can be controlled by add-on technology. Although researchers are exploring options for capturing CO2 from power plants and storing it permanently underground, these options are not commercially available today. That's why Congress is considering a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade system to offset the impact of CO2 instead.\Moore's unprecedented decision illustrates exactly why the complex technical issues surrounding global climate change are better undertaken by policymakers --- whom she has just pre-empted.\The plant's developers intend to appeal her ruling later this month. The Georgia Chamber of Commerce, along with many of our state's leading businesses, will be lending them our full support.\Here's why: If Moore's decision is allowed to stand, it will severely hamper our state's ability to meet the growing demand for reliable and affordable power. And it will impose an incredible regulatory burden on businesses in all sectors of our economy that will choke development across Georgia.\Coal provides the lion's share of the thousands of megawatts that Georgians depend on every day. It offers an affordable, domestic solution to our energy needs while alternatives such as wind and solar power are brought online. It's also more environmentally friendly than ever, thanks to the development of new and cleaner technologies.\But no coal-fired plants have been built in Georgia in more than 20 years --- even though our state's population has since jumped 60 percent and demand for energy has soared. And with our population expected to continue climbing over the next 20 years, conservation efforts --- while important --- can only accomplish so much.\If Georgians want to avoid the rolling blackouts and skyrocketing energy costs that have plagued California and other Western states in recent years, we must lay the groundwork for additional capacity now.\Beyond crippling our energy supply, Moore's ruling would also subject thousands of new commercial and public-sector projects to cumbersome, costly Clean Air permitting requirements that could tie up development for months or years.\We're not just talking about power plants or large industrial facilities that produce their own power. Any sizable new building that relies on natural gas for heat would be susceptible to regulatory delay --- from office buildings and shopping malls to churches, schools and hospitals.\Even replacing the heating system at an existing building could trigger a visit from the Clean Air police.\Through judicial fiat, Moore has single-handedly subjected Georgia to a set of laws that no other U.S. jurisdiction is required to follow, putting us at a serious competitive disadvantage with every state in the nation.\Responsible stewardship of the environment is a vital part of our state's long-term energy strategy --- but the level of judicial activism and government intrusion on display here is unacceptable.\We trust the Georgia Court of Appeals will set things right.\> George Israel, former mayor of Macon, is president and CEO of the Georgia Chamber of Commerce.\CAPTION: PAUL FOY / Associated Press A Fulton County Superior Court judge has denied a permit for a coal-fired power plant in southwest Georgia.

When a mass shooting begins, one of these four conditions will bring about its end.
\
1. The killer runs out of victims.
\
2. The killer runs out of ammunition.
\
3. The killer kills himself.
\
4. Another person kills or subdues him.
\
Surely the police will be summoned, but they must assess the situation before taking any action, all the while the killer has free rein.
\
How many will perish while awaiting their arrival? There are several examples where a mass shooting was thwarted, because of the presence of an armed citizen. Mr. Harris (""Life is more important than bearing arms,"" May 2) wants to know what can be done about violence.
\
The best defense is a good offense. People who bear arms take a proactive stance concerning their safety.
\
Bearing arms distances one from victimhood. I would like to remind Mr. Harris that there are already severe consequences for threatening, shooting or killing with a weapon.
\
The Second Amendment affirms the right to bear arms. Owning firearms is not contradictory to the Sixth Commandment. But medical malpractice kills almost 10 times as many people as firearms per year, so which should prevail, the Sixth Commandment or hospitals?

CLEAN ENERGY ACT WILL DESTROY ECONOMY
\
The United States and most of the world's poor people will experience a disaster of unprecedented magnitude if the American Clean Energy and Security Act is passed.
\
Your editorial (April 24) disclosed some, but not all the consequences. I know the ads being run by environmentalists are blatantly false.
\
This act is driven only by money and the desire for dictatorial political power.
\
According to civil rights leader Roy Innis, environmentalists have a long history of destroying human life, mostly black poor people to achieve their political goals.
\
The U.S. ethanol industry is causing massive starvation worldwide (in addition to poisoning the air with lethal amounts of formaldehyde).
\
We no longer have truly affordable food and the poor are being punished for it. The ACESA will be much worse because the enormous energy cost increases will literally destroy the U.S. economy and all other economies linked to it.
\
The claim that the ACESA is needed to save the earth from global warming has been shown to be false. Claims that global warming (which might not even be occurring) is caused by man made greenhouse gas emissions have never been substantiated.
\
The highly acclaimed research of professors Richard Lindzen, Eli Tziperman, Dorian Abbott, the Singer panel report and astrophysicist Willie Soon refute these claims. Specific claims have been disproved or shown to be fraudulent.

REPUBLICANS NEED TO STICK TO THEIR PRINCIPLES
\
After reading coverage of the ""tea parties"" across the country, I noticed there were a few groups that helped organize them that had supported the Bush/Paulson bailout last year.
\
I find it interesting that Newt Gingrich and Americans for Prosperity supported the Wall Street bailout when there was a Republican in the White House, but now they are helping to protest the wasteful spending and bailouts that President Obama is pushing.
\
I oppose all of the bailouts and wasteful spending, regardless of who is in charge of Congress or the White House. For conservative groups to be taken seriously they need to stick to their principles instead of going along with Republicans when they act like Democrats.
\
By supporting the Wall Street bailout last year, Newt and Americans for Prosperity lost credibility with those of us who are mad at the fiscal irresponsibility of both parties.

78," Buying clothes is easier than ever, but what you put in your shopping cart today can impact the planet for seasons to come. Fortunately, a growing number of designers and scientists are joining forces to green up your wardrobe. Learn how to outfit yourself more mindfully, and support brands that are as eco-conscious as they are cool.\When it comes to finding that new favorite dress -- or perfect pair of jeans -- fit and style are usually the key metrics to making a purchase. However, where and how items are manufactured matter more than ever. The average global consumer bought 60% more clothing in 2014 than in 2000, and kept each garment about half as long. Plus, we sent three-fifths of these purchases (many of them made from petroleum-based polyester, nylon and acrylic -- in other words, plastic -- per U.K.-and-China-based consultancy group Tecnon OrbiChem) to a landfill or incinerator within a few years of being made. There are painful realities on the production end, too: chemical fertilizers used to grow cotton, rainforest trees pulped to create rayon fabric, coal burned to power garment factories and fuel burned to ship garments across the world to our doors. All told, the fashion industry is responsible for an estimated 8% of global carbon emissions.\Stylish strategies\You don't need a Ph.D. to help the cause. Simply shop smartly, and hold businesses accountable.\1. Think fewer and better. ""It's not about never buying anything again,"" says Be´dat, who launched the New Standard Institute, a New York City-based information platform and advocacy group focused on greening the apparel business. ""It's an invitation to purchase only things you really love."" Use Eco-Age's #30wears rule: Before pulling out your credit card, ""ask yourself if you are going to wear it at least 30 times,"" Vocking says. ""You will be surprised how many times the answer is no."" Invest in high-quality, long-lasting pieces. Be a clothing mender (not a tosser), and when you need a refresh, consider vintage and secondhand designer finds (they abound on sites like The RealReal and ThredUp), or try a service like Rent the Runway. It isn't just for weddings and proms; you can choose an Ulla Johnson dress or Loeffler Randall handbag and rock it for a whole season.\2. Seek out green companies. And ""beware of gimmicks,"" warns Linda Greer, the senior global fellow at the Institute for Public and Environmental Affairs. (Installing LED bulbs in the corporate offices and doing a one-off capsule collection isn't enough.) Look for ones that integrate sustainable fabrics, like recycled polyester or organic cotton, into all their collections; are certified free of toxic chemicals by Bluesign; use recycled or compostable packaging; and invest in making their factories more energy-- and water-efficient. A great resource: the Good on You website or app, which rates companies on a number of criteria, including their impact on the environment (goodonyou.eco).\3. Lobby your favorite labels. If a brand you love isn't up to speed, tweet, direct-message or email the company asking for change. Yes, your voice can really get results. Or make it a group effort: The New Standard Institute has created a petition that calls on businesses to be transparent about their supply chain, set targets and report on their progress to the public. Join the movement at newstandardinstitute.org/sign-up.\Companies that care These brands are making big strides.\Allbirds sources the greenest materials available for its sneakers, including natural merino wool and laces made from recycled bottles. When it couldn't find an eco EVA (the rubberlike material in the soles), it invented the first carbon-negative version, SweetFoam, made from sustainably sourced sugar cane.

79," Buying clothes is easier than ever, but what you put in your shopping cart today can impact the planet for seasons to come. Fortunately, a growing number of designers and scientists are joining forces to green up your wardrobe. Learn how to outfit yourself more mindfully, and support brands that are as eco-conscious as they are cool.\When it comes to finding that new favorite dress -- or perfect pair of jeans -- fit and style are usually the key metrics to making a purchase. However, where and how items are manufactured matter more than ever. The average global consumer bought 60% more clothing in 2014 than in 2000, and kept each garment about half as long. Plus, we sent three-fifths of these purchases (many of them made from petroleum-based polyester, nylon and acrylic -- in other words, plastic -- per U.K.-and-China-based consultancy group Tecnon OrbiChem) to a landfill or incinerator within a few years of being made.\Stylish strategies\You don't need a Ph.D. to help the cause. Simply shop smartly, and hold businesses accountable.\1. Think fewer and better. ""It's not about never buying anything again,"" says Bédat, who launched the New Standard Institute, a New York City-based information platform and advocacy group focused on greening the apparel business. ""It's an invitation to purchase only things you really love."" Use Eco-Age's #30wears rule: Before pulling out your credit card, ""ask yourself if you are going to wear it at least 30 times,"" Vocking says. ""You will be surprised how many times the answer is no."" Invest in high-quality, long-lasting pieces. Be a clothing mender (not a tosser), and when you need a refresh, consider vintage and secondhand designer finds (they abound on sites like The RealReal and ThredUp), or try a service like Rent the Runway. It isn't just for weddings and proms; you can choose an Ulla Johnson dress or Loeffler Randall handbag and rock it for a whole season.\2. Seek out green companies. And ""beware of gimmicks,"" warns Linda Greer, the senior global fellow at the Institute for Public and Environmental Affairs. (Installing LED bulbs in the corporate offices and doing a one-off capsule collection isn't enough.) Look for ones that integrate sustainable fabrics, like recycled polyester or organic cotton, into all their collections; are certified free of toxic chemicals by Blue-sign; use recycled or compostable packaging; and invest in making their factories more energy--and water-efficient. A great resource: the Good on You website or app, which rates companies on a number of criteria, including their impact on the environment (goodonyou.eco).\3. Lobby your favorite labels. If a brand you love isn't up to speed, tweet, direct-message or email the company asking for change. Yes, your voice can really get results. Or make it a group effort: The New Standard Institute has created a petition that calls on businesses to be transparent about their supply chain, set targets and report on their progress to the public. Join the movement at newstandardinstitute.org/sign-up.\Companies that care\These brands are making big strides.\Allbirds sources the greenest materials available for its sneakers, including natural merino wool and laces made from recycled bottles. When it couldn't find an eco EVA (the rubberlike material in the soles), it invented the first carbon-negative version, Sweet-Foam, made from sustainably sourced sugar cane. This spring, the brand announced it has imposed a carbon tax on itself by contributing to decarbonization projects.\Amour Vert plants a tree with every T-shirt purchase (220,000 to date).

80,"
Four Republicans and two Democrats are vying in the July 15 primary for a shot at two seats on the Public Service Commission, which sets rates on electricity and telecommunications, and oversees the delivery of natural gas to homes and businesses.
\
Two Republicans seek the nomination in the PSC's first district, which encompasses most of the state's southern end, and two Democrats and two Republicans are campaigning for their party's nod to run for the fourth district, spanning some 20 northern counties.
\
Two Libertarians are also in the race, but they will only be on the November ballot because there is no primary for that party.
\
While they represent districts, commissioners are elected statewide. They earn $117,452 a year.
\
Here is a list of candidates and their biographical information, as well as their responses to pertinent questions facing the future of energy in Georgia.
\
Candidate John Monds did not respond to interview requests.
\
Q: What does this week's court ruling invalidating permits for a coal-fired electrical plant over carbon dioxide emissions say about the future of power generation in Georgia?
\
DISTRICT 1
\
COLLUM: Basically, since the Supreme Court ruling that carbon dioxide is a pollutant, that played heavily into the judges' decision to stop the plant in Early County. All the plant has to do is meet the proper requirements to get the permit, and then they can proceed.
\
EVERETT: In my opinion, coal-fired plants with new technology are a safe and cheap form of energy, but it underscores the problems we have with coal-fired plants placing more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. That underscores the need for safer and cheaper energy, which is nuclear power.
\
DISTRICT 4
\
POWELL: I think it will probably slow it down. Coal is still the most cost-effective source of energy we have. I hope it will make Georgia think about diversifying the fuel mix.
\
INDECH: The major thing it says is let's just take a step back and reconsider what we're doing. For an out-of-state company to have a contract to construct a major power facility without a true concern for the environment of Georgia is unconscionable.
\
DAVIDSON: I think that was a prudent ruling, because soon we're going to have some carbon legislation, and most likely that will be a cap and trade, and we'll be on a carbon diet because we already have more coal and more carbon liability than most states. There will be a premium or tax on the utility company for violating the law, and that will be passed on to ratepayers.
\
MCDONALD: My gut feeling is that it will be overturned. I am very pro-nuclear. It is more expensive in the initial construction process, but over time, in my opinion, you have cleaner production.
\
GIVENS: It's a good decision in the end because the price of coal is going up, and we need to be looking for alternatives. They like to build these plants because they are relatively cheap to get going, but they are not the best as far as carbon emissions.
\
Q: Critics say building new nuclear power plants is a costly solution to reduce greenhouse gasses and that new plants will take too long to build to be effective. What do you think?
\
DISTRICT 1
\
EVERETT: I do not believe that it isn't too costly when you consider the carbon tax coming down on coal. Coal has tripled in value. We have the highest cost ever in natural gas, and it is continuing to rise. It will be 2016 until we can actually start depending on the nuclear plant, but it is an option we must take.
\
Collum: Right now we have to think in the long term, as well as in the present day. Nuclear power plants are a large piece of the overall puzzle. But today, we have the technology to incorporate biomass energy and other renewable that we can use today while we're waiting for the new power plants and the nuclear power plants to come online.
\
DISTRICT 4
\
DAVIDSON: We must consider nuclear, but it is a long-term solution that has an undetermined price tag. We need to maximize our energy efficiency and renewable energy potential in the meantime.
\
MCDONALD: I disagree with that. We know the time frame that we've got to have as far as a plant is concerned. If a nuclear plant is authorized by the state of Georgia in the next few months it will be online by 2016.
\
GIVENS: I'm not against building nuclear power plants. What I'm more concerned about is the intention of charging the Georgia ratepayers before they are built.
\
POWELL: It's a long, lengthy, drawn-out process. I don't think we should take any fuel off the table, including nuclear. I think we need to plan for the long term, and if nuclear is part of the mix, that's fine.
\
INDECH: In the very long-term, nuclear plants are probably the answer. I can't say definitely because the pace of technology is accelerating so fast that it's very difficult for people to plan in the very long term.
\
Q: Gas prices aside, what is the most pressing issue facing consumers in today's energy market? What will you do about it if elected?
\
DISTRICT 1
\
COLLUM: If elected, I am going to make sure that everyone is treated fairly. That means the consumer will be charged a reasonable rate. That has to be balanced with the company making a reasonable profit for its investors.
\
EVERETT: If I am elected, I will continue to do what I've done in the past and that is to strike a balance between the consumer and the provider. We have continually made sure rates were affordable to the consumer while at the same time making the providers financially viable.
\
DISTRICT 4
\
DAVIDSON: I think a federal mandate on mandating a percent of renewable energy, because we have virtually no renewable energy and we have a huge potential for it.
\
MCDONALD: In my opinion, the most pressing issue is getting a nuclear plant going in the state to meet the demands for tomorrow - tomorrow being the next 15 years.
\
INDECH: The most pressing issue in today's energy market is the loss of control America has over its energy supplies. We are fighting a war and losing lives of our good youth to pursue an energy policy in the Middle East. We don't need that. We need to bring it back home.
\
POWELL: We need to make sure we keep quality sources of energy and low and affordable rates for Georgia, but I think we also need to realize that investor-owned utilities need to make a profit, so there needs to be balance.
\
GIVENS: The most pressing concern for Georgia is the lack of competition among energy providers. We need to find more ways for energy producers to enter the market, as well as find new ways to allow ratepayers to generate power themselves.

"
81," This is the conversation Woody Bartlett has been waiting for.\ The retired Episcopal priest started a faith-based environmental organization three years ago with his wife Carol, to get people to do something about global warming.\ But until about a year and a half ago, whenever he talked to clergy and lay leaders around Atlanta about saving electricity and reducing air pollution, he didn't dare speak the phrase ""global warming."" He worried that people wouldn't take him seriously.\ That started to change in late 2004, when National Geographic put the issue on its cover and dedicated most of the magazine to explaining the science and why we should care about melting glaciers, rising sea levels and extended droughts.\ ""I said 'Oh my goodness, it's finally hitting.' And then the New Yorker had a three-part [series] on it a year ago, and Time magazine on April 3 had on its cover 'Be Worried. Be Very Worried,'"" Bartlett rattled off. ""Man, when those big publications spend that much time with it, then things have tipped. And then there all these movies [about it]. It's out there. Even the current administration says it's a problem.""\ These days, global warming is a centerpiece when Bartlett, 72, gives his spiel about why people of faith ought to protect God's creation by using less electricity. Georgia Interfaith Power & Light's pamphlet explains that burning coal and other fossil fuels for our energy needs releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which most scientists agree is a major cause of the warming trend.\ The news is filtering out. In March, ABC News reported a growing number of Americans --- 85 percent --- believe global warming is probably occurring. But fewer than 40 percent are very sure of it. That could reflect either a lag in understanding recent scientific research, or the vocal strength of the naysayers.\ But if the recent media storm on global warming means the issue has crossed some sort of threshold in the collective mind of the American public --- from laughing it off to wary acceptance --- former Vice President Al Gore said it still hasn't reached the political tipping point. He wants to see politicians fall all over themselves to come up with solutions.\ With this weekend's wide release of the glossy Hollywood movie ""An Inconvenient Truth"" starring Gore, he speaks from the center of the media flurry.\ ""I think we'll know when it happens,"" Gore said in a recent Atlanta interview. ""You'll see people making public statements that surprise you, publicly changing their minds, calling on others to do the same. I don't think we're that far off from it.""\ It's only been in the last few years that the international community of climate scientists finally agreed that greenhouse gases --- emitted by cars, power plants, home heat, fires and landfill gases --- are at least partially responsible for the Earth's temperature rise of one degree Fahrenheit in the last century. Carbon dioxide and other such gases get their greenhouse name because they trap heat in the atmosphere, causing the warmer temperatures.\ Already, melting glaciers are noticeably raising sea levels, and many scientists predict much hotter temperatures in the near future.\ Far from a consensus\ But that's where certainty ends. What's in dispute is how great an effect mankind's emissions have had on the warming trend and what the consequences will be. There's no consensus on where the cutoff point should be on greenhouse gases, or how soon the Earth could plunge into environmental chaos if they're not controlled, or even whether it's already too late to reverse the trends.\ The prevailing science, though, predicts water shortages, flooding in coastal and low-lying areas, and disruptions in agricultural yields by the end of this century.\ Last fall, Gov. Sonny Perdue called for the state's first energy plan in response to off-the-chart gasoline prices after Hurricane Katrina crippled Gulf Coast oil supplies. A draft released last week dedicates a three-page section to ""climate change,"" the preferred term among many scientists. (The draft is available online at www.georgiaenergyplan.org).\ ""Climate change could affect the economy through rising shoreline levels and resulting damage to coastal development, disruptions of growing seasons for agriculture and forestry, and reduced tourist trade,"" the draft says. ""The only visible options available now to reduce CO2 emissions are increasing efficiency and using more energy from sources that generate considerably less CO2, such as nuclear energy, hydropower, solar energy, wind energy, and switching to biomass energy sources.""\ The draft goes on to recommend the state start requiring companies to report their carbon dioxide emissions, and give technical and policy support to Atlanta and other Georgia cities that last year signed a U.S. Conference of Mayors resolution to voluntarily reduce greenhouse gases.\ Perdue pays attention\ While that sounds promising to Georgia's environmentalists, the state's energy strategy is a long way from seeing any action. When asked about Perdue's position, spokeswoman Heather Hedrick said he is ""interested in closely reviewing evidence of global warming.""\ She touted Perdue's push, which emulates federal policy, to get more state employees to work from home rather than drive to an office. Perdue also signed a law this year giving tax credits to employers for each telecommuting worker.\ Peter Jackson, spokesman for Secretary of State Cathy Cox's gubernatorial campaign, said the candidate ""believes that Georgia should play its part in protecting the environment, and that includes reducing emissions and air pollutants that are causing global warming.""\ The campaign for Lt. Gov. Mark Taylor, Cox's rival in the Democratic primary, did not return calls by deadline for comment.\ Global warming still has a few scoffers. They include William Gray, a media darling who has led a team of hurricane forecasters at Colorado State University for more than 20 years. He recently told The Washington Post that global warming ""is one of the greatest hoaxes ever perpetrated on the American people.""\ Complexities abound\ Atlanta-based Southern Co., whose coal-burning power plants emit much of the Southeast's carbon dioxide, is particularly interested in the skeptics' view.\ Chris Hobson, Southern Co.'s senior vice president of research and environmental affairs, said he spends a lot of time listening to outside climate scientists talk about their research, and what he hears is far from a consensus.\ ""It is so complex and so difficult that everybody feels the necessity to talk about all the uncertainties in the science,"" Hobson said in a telephone interview. ""The only thing I say about the science officially is that I think it is a little premature to claim there is consensus in the science. I think that really is a disservice.""\ He said public perception is skewed because the skeptics are being drowned out by the believers. They ""feel uneasy about coming out because of the way they're treated,"" Hobson said.\ Hobson said he's heard from scientists who say there are big questions yet to be answered, including whether it's even getting warmer --- which few dispute publicly.\ ""The next question is how much a role man is playing in climate change,"" Hobson said. ""Is it a natural cycle or is man playing some role in it? If man is, how much? Is man playing enough of a role in climate change that making changes in what we're doing will have an impact?""\ Duke Energy, a North Carolina-based power company, is taking a drastically different approach. The company recently came out in favor of a carbon tax to create a market for reductions, and a plan to scale back greenhouse gases, starting now.\ The Competitive Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank partially funded by Exxon Mobil, also agrees ""global warming is happening and man is responsible for at least some of it,"" according to a position policy paper. The outstanding questions, according to CEI, are whether it will cause damage to the Earth and whether drastic cuts in energy use make sense economically.\ 'Compelling information'\ The growing bandwagon of believers includes Judith A. Curry, chair of Georgia Tech's School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences. She has co-authored studies that link rising sea temperatures --- widely believed to be caused by global warming --- with hurricane intensity to explain why the number of Category 4 and 5 storms has doubled globally since 1970.\ Curry recently met with Florida Gov. Jeb Bush to explain the findings and risks to that state.\ Afterward, Bush's spokesman Russell Schweiss told the Tallahassee Democrat the governor ""felt that they presented some pretty compelling information. . . By and large, the governor certainly felt that it's something that needs to be continued to be researched and investigated. There's some disagreement, which makes the policy issues harder to address.""\ Curry also briefed congressional staff on the subject in Washington last year. She acknowledges the research is still new on the global warming-hurricane link and has plenty of detractors, but says there is a growing body of scientific evidence to support it.\ Her take on the dialogue about global warming is that there's one conversation going on in the media and the general public, and another one conducted in scientific circles.\ ""There are very few scientists actively conducting research on global warming (publishing their work in the scientific literature) that question that the global warming since 1970 is attributed to greenhouse warming, that is from burning of fossil fuels,"" Curry wrote in an e-mail. ""This research, conducted over several decades and by hundreds of scientists, is fairly conclusive.""\ Evidence sways opinion\ Curry says Gray's message that global warming is a hoax is being heard because of his media connections, but she points out he has not published any research to back it up. ""His ideas on global warming are not taken seriously in scientific circles,"" she said.\ Increasing scientific evidence was the turning point for Ciannat Howett, director of the Atlanta office of the Southern Environmental Law Center. She now talks about global warming while advocating --- and often litigating --- for more mass transit and cleaner energy.\ SELC's advocacy materials include a map of the Georgia coast that depicts the barrier islands and much of the coast under water, to bring the issue home to people.\ One of SELC's latest fights is against a proposed coal-fired plant in southwest Georgia's Early County.\ ""One key thing Georgia should do is allow conservation measures and renewable resources. Do that before they decide to build [another power plant],"" she said.\ In his movie, Gore talks about a 10-year window of opportunity in which the world can stabilize greenhouse gas emissions and, it is hoped, avert the coming disasters he talks about.\ Hobson, with Southern Co., said that's unrealistic. It will take much longer than that for nations to supplement their growing needs with nuclear power, wind and solar energy and other alternatives, or come up with ways to capture carbon dioxide emissions, he said.\ An eye to the future\ In the meantime, the giant utility is researching ways to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions. Not because it has to --- not now, anyway --- but because it sees the writing on the wall, and it's the right thing to do, Hobson said.\ ""Coal is too valuable for us to abandon over this or any other issue , but we need to make sure we can develop technologies so that we can use coal in a way that is acceptable to us all,"" Hobson said.\ And he said the company pushes energy efficiency with audits of large customers, and is looking at renewable energy sources, including wind power.\ Also, Southern is considering adding more nuclear energy. While it emits zero carbons, nuclear has other problems, starting with where to put the waste.\ Bartlett, the environmental minister, made his pitch Friday morning to the pastor and a lay leader at Covenant Presbyterian Church in Buckhead: Global warming is a faith issue, and congregations should respond. They can start by swapping out incandescent light bulbs with compact fluorescent ones, and ramp up to an energy audit on their often aging, inefficient buildings.\ ""Are we heavy-handed, walking around the Earth in hobnailed boots, or are we going lightly on the creation and being humble, as Jesus asked us to do?""\ > ON THE WEB: For more information about climate change: yosemite.epa.gov/oar/globalwarming.nsf/content/index.html\ The state's draft energy plan: www.georgiaenergyplan.org/\ Learn about energy efficiency: www.energystar.gov\ An interactive online game for kids to find energy hogs in their house: www.energyhog.org\ CAPTION: RICH ADDICKS / Staff Georgia's drought between 1998 and 2002, depicted on a South Georgia farm, was one of the worst in at least 100 years and coincided with the hottest temperatures ever recorded on Earth.\ CAPTION: WALTER CUMMING / Staff Illustraton of a man on a mountaintop looking at the sun through a hand-held telescope."

It will take more than just turning off the lights to reverse the trend of growing, expensive electricity needs in the state.
\
But it's a good start, according to advocates pushing Georgia Power and state utility regulators to increase energy efficiency programs that help customers conserve usage.
\
This week members of the Georgia Public Service Commission will vote on Georgia Power's long-range energy plan. Along with controversial pieces about wanting to expand nuclear power plants in Georgia, the company also will put its ideas for cutting down how much energy is consumed in front of the board.
\
Known as demand-side management, the utility has come up with five new programs to promote energy efficiency among customers.
\
Saving energy is an issue regaining more attention in the minds of homeowners and businesses as they have been hit by volatile energy prices from filling up at gasoline pumps to writing out monthly utility bills.
\
""People are starting to pay more attention to this,"" said Dean Harless, Georgia Power's marketing issues manager. ""It hasn't been that big an issue, but I think in increasing cost environments, it will be.""
\
Late last month, Georgia Power filed a request with the PSC to raise rates $406 million, or an average of $6.67 a month for residential customers.
\
Part of the argument for the extra money is to build more power lines, transmitters and other equipment to handle Georgia's growing population. But company officials also pointed out that individual consumers' electricity usage is 15 percent higher than a decade ago.
\
The theory behind an energy efficiency program, if well-used and broadly implemented, is that it would noticeably cut the amount of power being used in the state. Customers' monthly bills would drop as well as the need to build costly new equipment to transmit electricity.
\
But the state's regulators will decide how well Georgia Power has addressed that through its five suggestions for new pilot programs to help reduce demand.
\
Among the suggestions, Georgia Power is proposing to expand its power credit program to owners of apartment buildings.
\
The company's existing credit program is only for individual homeowners, who get $20 for signing up for allowing a switch to be installed on their air conditioner. During peak demands for electricity in the summer, the switch is activated to cut how long an air conditioning unit runs, and the customer gets a couple of dollars whenever that happens.
\
Harless said the multifamily credit would mean a deal is struck with property managers, who have to work with all the tenants to let them know about potential summertime interruptions.
\
Another proposal is to give away and help install water heater blankets for customers. The insulation is designed to cut down on heat loss.
\
The company also wants to give away 200,000 compact fluorescent light bulbs, which use less electricity than regular, incandescent bulbs and also last longer.
\
Homeowners could have programmable thermostats installed in their houses and have a professional audit on how energy efficient their homes are to find out where there are leaks. The usual $350 fee associated with the energy checks and the $100 for installation would be paid for through Georgia Power's program.
\
The company already works with community groups to provide weatherization and energy efficiency assistance to low-income homeowners.
\
And for commercial customers, Georgia Power wants to help them qualify for federal tax incentives given out for cutting energy use. The utility plans to give advice to individual businesses and provide computer modeling that the federal government requires for the tax incentives.
\
When combined, the five initiatives are estimated to save nearly 67 megawatts of electricity over two years - as much power as 67 homes would use in a single month.
\
The total price tag for the pilot programs, including the free energy saving materials to be given out, education efforts and energy audits, is estimated to cost $9.4 million, which would be paid for from customer bills.
\
Harless said the company estimates it would save $90 million during the two years the programs are in place, partially because of the reduced need to pay for electricity generation.
\
While many of Georgia Power's suggestions rely on changing consumer behavior around the home, large energy-users also have been looking for ways to cut down on their light bill.
\
Emory University, the sixth-largest customer of Georgia Power, spent about $30 million on energy costs last year.
\
The private school in Atlanta has embarked on an ambitious energy-efficiency program that ranges from turning off heating and cooling systems in classrooms to so-called green construction techniques that make buildings significantly cut down on energy use.
\
Ciannet Howett, who became the school's first director of Sustainability Initiatives last year, said Emory has more square footage of ""green"" buildings than any other school campus in the country and at one point trailed only the federal government and military in the effort.
\
She said the school has set a goal to reduce its energy use by 25 percent by 2015. If it reaches that level, it would mean $7.5 million in savings.
\

\
But beyond the economic impact, Howett said the campus, which also includes a hospital and medical research clinics, wanted to call attention to the health benefits of saving energy and scaling back on coal-fired electric plants that have been linked to air pollution issues.
\
""What we're trying to do is look at this issue comprehensively, and the first thing we need to do is look at ourselves,"" Howett said.
\
Howett has spoken with the PSC, asking it to push Georgia Power to add even more energy efficient programs.
\
Rita Kilpatrick, Georgia policy director for the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, criticized Georgia Power's programs for being on the conservative end of the utility's own study looking at potential energy efficiency levels.
\
On the other end of the argument, Jim Clarkson, a private energy planner and buying agent, said demand-side programs that tout energy efficiency should be done away with altogether because they waste money.
\
He pointed out recently to state regulators that in some households when people save money on energy-efficient appliances, they buy more goods that use electricity and do not cut down on total usage as intended.
\
Clarkson, president of Resource Supply Management in Sumter, S.C., said the PSC should weigh the costs of the proposed demand-side management plans.
\
""DSM programs are an assortment of give-away programs to retrofit buildings and subsidize energy-using equipment,"" he said, ""They have high administrative overhead and provide counter productive incentives to the managing utility.""

HOUSEHOLD ENERGY SAVERS
\
Here are everyday tips from the U.S. Department of Energy:
\
- Install a programmable thermostat.
\
- Clean or replace filters on furnaces at least once a month.
\
- Use compact fluorescent light bulbs.
\
- Use task lighting; instead of brightly lighting an entire room, focus the light where you need it.
\
- Consider three-way lamps; they make it easier to keep lighting levels appropriate.
\
- Turn power strips off when equipment is not in use (TVs and DVDs in standby mode still use several watts of power).

(ON WEB ONLY) HOUSEHOLD ENERGY SAVERS
\
Here are everyday tips from the U.S. Department of Energy:
\
- Install a programmable thermostat that is compatible with your heating and cooling system.
\
- Clean or replace filters on furnaces once a month or as needed.
\
- Bleed trapped air from hot-water radiators once or twice a season; if in doubt about how to perform this task, call a professional.
\
- Place heat-resistant radiator reflectors between exterior walls and the radiators.
\
- Use compact fluorescent light bulbs.
\
- Use task lighting; instead of brightly lighting an entire room, focus the light where you need it. For example, use fluorescent under-cabinet lighting for kitchen sinks and countertops under cabinets.
\
- Consider three-way lamps; they make it easier to keep lighting levels low when brighter light is not necessary.
\
- Plug home electronics, such as TVs and DVD players, into power strips; turn the power strips off when the equipment is not in use (TVs and DVDs in standby mode still use several watts of power). There is a common misconception that screen savers reduce energy use by computer monitors; they do not. Automatic switching to sleep mode or manually turning monitors off is always the better energy-saving strategy.
\
- Don't keep your refrigerator or freezer too cold. Recommended temperatures are 37 to 40 degrees for the fresh food compartment of the refrigerator and 5 degrees for the freezer section. If you have a separate freezer for long-term storage, it should be kept at 0 degrees.
\
- Lower the thermostat on your hot water heater to 120 degrees. Insulate your electric hot-water storage tank, but be careful not to cover the thermostat. Follow the manufacturer's recommendations.
\
- Drain a quart of water from your water tank every 3 months to remove sediment that impedes heat transfer and lowers the efficiency of your heater. The type of water tank you have determines the steps to take, so follow the manufacturer's advice.
\
- Insulate the first six feet of the hot and cold water pipes connected to the water heater.
\
- Install aerating, low-flow faucets and showerheads.
\
- Look for the ENERGY STAR label on home appliances and products. ENERGY STAR products meet strict efficiency guidelines set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Energy.

83,"CORRECTION: 07/10/08, Page JE/02: The last name of U.S. Senate candidate Dale Cardwell was spelled incorrectly with his photograph in the July 3 Voters Guide in CityLife.\ABOUT THIS GUIDE\The League of Women Voters of Georgia and The Atlanta Journal-Constitution are pleased to announce their partnership in producing the 2008 Voter Guide. The League has collected, compiled and coordinated all candidate information for this Guide. Responses are published exactly as they were submitted by the candidates, although some questions were deleted in print for lack of space (full responses are online). The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and the League of Women Voters of Georgia have made no edits to correct spelling, grammar, punctuation or factual errors.\U.S. SENATE\U.S. Senate, Georgia\Dale Cardwell\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Former investigative reporter with WSB/independent media consultant\> Age: 45\> Education: Bachelor of arts, Journalism/Government, Western Kentucky University, 1985\> Family: Married to Angie Cardwell, a hospice nurse, for 22 years. Two children: Adam and Jessica\> Web site: www.dale08.com\> E-mail: www.dale@dale08.com\> Why I'm running for office: As a veteran investigative reporter with WSB, I've met thousands of Georgians from all over the state, Democrats, Independents and Republicans who all told me the same thing. They said ""Dale, just once, I'd like to have the chance to vote for an honest person, a truth teller, who won't be controlled by special interests. Someone who'll work for real people like me.""\I'm running to give Georgians the chance to do just that.\> Our country is facing significant issues with rising food and energy costs. What would you propose to address these issues? Most elected officials no longer work for us. They work for special interests that fund their campaigns then control their votes. \I am the only leading Senate candidate who's refusing the special interest ""PAC"" money that's stolen your government and keeps your voice from being heard.\I will oppose big oil, promote energy alternatives and help convert Georgia pine to cellulosic ethanol to combat the ridiculous price of gasoline. Driving down the cost of fuel is the key to making food more affordable for the hard working people of Georgia.\> Party and philosophical differences have resulted in budget and policy deadlock in the past. If elected, how will you specifically work with colleagues to achieve results on the tough issues? TV shows distract us with circus-like debates between the ""R's and the ""D's."" Truth is, the prime source of gridlock is the ""P,"" or ""PAC"" money system. We can't fix health care, secure our borders, free ourselves from foreign oil or heal our economy because the giant special interests that control politicians won't allow those reforms to take place. I agree with Barack Obama. The moment we break the stranglehold lobbyists and special interests have on Washington, we WILL be able to move forward on the common sense reforms Americans support.\Vernon Jones\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Chief Executive Officer, DeKalb County\> Age: 47\> Education: B.A., Business Admininstration,North Carolina Central Univ.\Graduate, Harvard JFK School of Govt. Exec. Prog.\> Family: No response\> Web site: www.vernonjonesforgeorgia.com/home.html\> E-mail: vernon@vernonjonesforgeorgia.com\> Why I'm running for office: As a former Georgia Legislator and now as CEO of DeKalb County, I have crucial experience in writing the law and running a large metropolitan government. I am actively involved in creating jobs, balancing budgets, improving infrastructure, providing homeland security, maintaining low taxes and setting public policy. I have had to provide local solutions to national problems and am in touch with the concerns and issues that everyday Americans are experiencing.\> Our country is facing significant issues with rising food and energy costs. What would you propose to address these issues? Food price increases are tied to fuel costs increases. Fuel costs increase because of our dependence on foreign oil and reliance on a singular source of energy. We should pursue mandates on the automobile industry that require the production of vehicles that get more miles per gallon. We need to think about energy independence and pursue solar, wind and biofuel as alternative energy sources. As we invest in this technology we invest our people and economy. In turn energy diversity we will create jobs, and boost our economy.\> Party and philosophical differences have resulted in budget and policy deadlock in the past. If elected, how will you specifically work with colleagues to achieve results on the tough issues? It is important regardless of party affiliation for elected officials to work across the aisle for the benefit of our citizens. As a Chief Executive Officer of DeKalb County, when we dispatch our public service, conduct infrastructure improvements, build parks and create jobs we do not ask for party affiliation. Our job as elected officials is to provide solutions for the citizens of this country. I believe that bipartisanship is the best dose of medicine for Washington right now.\Rand Knight\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Businessman/ecologist\> Age: 36\> Education: Ph.D., Ecosystems Analysis; M.S., Ecology/Forestry; B.A., Environmental Studies\> Family: Wife: Linda; two children, Ellie Lu (3) and Thomas (1).\> Web site: www.knightforsenate.com\> E-mail: info@knightforsenate.com\> Why I'm running for office: The economy, health care system and environment of Georgia and our country have changed for the worse; it's time for a new direction. Georgians' needs are not being met, but I am ready to listen. Finally, I have the energy and the fresh perspective to go to Washington, D.C., and get things done.\> Our country is facing significant issues with rising food and energy costs. What would you propose to address these issues? A cornerstone of my campaign, the ""Green Deal,"" would create hundreds of thousands of jobs, and reduce energy costs and pollution while increasing energy efficiency and independence. I will support a Strategic Energy Fund that sponsors the research, development and deployment of renewable energy, energy efficiency and biofuels. Additionally, with a new, clean, cost-efficient infrastructure, food prices will decrease, as it will cost less to process and transport food to its final destination.\> Party and philosophical differences have resulted in budget and policy deadlock in the past. If elected, how will you specifically work with colleagues to achieve results on the tough issues? Like many Georgians and Americans, I am frustrated by the constant bickering and divisive fighting in Washington, D.C. Politicians seem more interested in choosing sides than solving problems for their constituents. I draw inspiration from former Georgia senator Sam Nunn, who reached across party lines and focused on making Georgia and America stronger. I aim to promote a real change that involves dialogue --- not bickering --- and that always keeps the American people's interests at heart.\Josh Lanier\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Former Senate staff member, retired businessman and writer.\> Age: 55\> Education: Attended Georgia Southern University\> Family: Married to Lynne 30 years, father of Heather, Brooke, Josh and Robert.\> Web site: www.JoshLanier.com\> E-mail: josh@joshlanier.com\> Why I'm running for office: I am standing for election to the U.S. Senate to retore our most basic right of a fair and free election by setting the example of a clean campaign, promoting public funding for and reform of elections, and to represent the voice of all Georgians.\> Our country is facing significant issues with rising food and energy costs. What would you propose to address these issues? The two issues are directly related. Food cost inflation is driven by spiraling energy costs that are rooted in a weak dollar and our addiction to oil, exacerbated by our current mandates for corn ethanol. Every American feels this inflation, whether in the cost of milk or even pizza, and its impact is worldwide and dangerous. America and the world need a visionary energy policy based on a combination of existing, new and sustainable technologies.\> Party and philosophical differences have resulted in budget and policy deadlock in the past. If elected, how will you specifically work with colleagues to achieve results on the tough issues? The deadlock that continues to this day has been caused less by party or philosophical differences and more by special interests and the money they bring to campaigns. There is a reason we don't have universal health care or a visionary energy policy or an answer to the foreclosure crisis. That reason is money and special interests. When we have public financing of elections, we will have more legislators free to work together for the benefit of the country.\Jim Martin\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Attorney\> Age: 62\> Education: University of Georgia, A.B.; J.D.; LL.M. Georgia State University, M.B.A. \> Family: Wife Joan, four children, three grandchildren. \> Web site: www.martinforsenate.com\> E-mail: jim@martinforsenate.com\> Why I'm running for office: President Bush and Saxby Chambliss have lost touch with what's going in Iraq and here at home. Something's wrong when we're spending $50 billion a month in Iraq while the price of gas and groceries keep rising for American families. It's time to start doing more to help the middle class.\> Our country is facing significant issues with rising food and energy costs. What would you propose to address these issues? The Bush Administration's economic policies have been disastrous for American families. The cost of living is skyrocketing while incomes are stagnating. Now, more than ever, middle-class Americans need to keep more of what they earn. \To lower energy prices, we need to encourage development of alternative fuels, require oil companies to invest some of their record profits into new clean refineries to increase supply, and find ways to encourage conservation --- particularly when it comes to transportation. \> Party and philosophical differences have resulted in budget and policy deadlock in the past. If elected, how will you specifically work with colleagues to achieve results on the tough issues? In the state Legislature, I developed a reputation for bipartisanship. I was frequently able to bring members of both parties together, help them resolve their differences, and get important legislation passed. \We need this kind of approach in Washington again. We need an independent-minded senator who can stand up to his own party and president when they're wrong, if necessary, and someone who can find common ground with those who have different viewpoints.\Unopposed in primary\U.S. Senate, Georgia, Saxby Chambliss, Republican; U.S. Senate, Georgia, Allen Buckley, Libertarian.\U.S. House, Georgia District 5\Markel Hutchins\> Party: Democratic\(No other information for this candidate was received by publication deadline)\John Lewis\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Member of Congress\> Age: 68\> Education: American Baptist Theological Seminary, 1961Fisk University, 1967\> Family: Lillian (wife), John Miles (son)\> Web site: www.johnlewisforcongress.com\> E-mail: john@johnlewisforcongress.com\> Why I'm running for office: I am running to improve the lives of the people of the fifth congressional district and the people of America and to be a voice in helping to create a world community at peace with itself. We must end the War in Iraq, strengthen our economy and provide comprehensive healthcare for all of our citizens. \> Georgia's economy is suffering along with much of the nation. What specific proposals will you advocate to bring jobs to Georgia and help grow our state's economy? We must use the tax code to make it easier and more profitable for American companies to do business in Georgia. Rather than going abroad, we must use the tax code to make it simple, convenient and profitable for American companies to create jobs here in Georgia. They are taking the jobs to Central and South America, to China and Taiwan. As a Member of Congress, I will continue fighting to protect our jobs in metro Atlanta and work to create new jobs to make our economy stronger. \> What do you see as the role of the Federal Government in protecting Georgia's environment, especially in terms of air and water quality? We must lose our love affair with the automobile. We must raise federal emission standards and spend more of our federal resources on commuter rail. \We must also continue to strengthen the Clean Water Act and clean up our lakes, our ponds and our streams. \We have a right to know what is in the water we drink, what is in the air we breathe and what is in the food we eat.\""Able"" Mable Thomas\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Business owner\> Age: 50\> Education: B.S., Public Administration, Georgia State University \> Family: Single\> Web site: ablemablethomas.com\> E-mail: mthomas949@aol.com\> Why I'm running for office: It is time for a Change. My commitment to the people of the 5th Congressional District is deeply rooted in my desire to connect the many resources in Washington, D.C., to our families, religious, businesses and neighborhood organizations that have proven records of success. I have a resume of service, a proven track record and am able to get the job done. I presently am state representative and served as City Council member citywide in Atlanta as well.\> Georgia's economy is suffering along with much of the nation. What specific proposals will you advocate to bring jobs to Georgia and help grow our state's economy? Create jobs through trade, innovation and green technology. Support sustainability of small businesses. Provide entrepreneurial mentorship initiatives. Build the middle class by ensuring tax-relief and expanded educational opportunities. Create a level playing field wherein employers pay livable wages. Bring American jobs home, limit outsourcing to save our working families jobs. Stop tax breaks to Big Oil companies in Congress.\> What do you see as the role of the Federal Government in protecting Georgia's environment, especially in terms of air and water quality? As an environmental leader in Georgia, I am one of the sponsors of the Georgia Comprehensive Water Management plan and one of 9 members on the Natural Resources and Environment committee that voted to preserve Jekyll Island from excessive development. We must relieve traffic congestion with support for mass transit, light rail options and invest in clean energy. We must reduce carbon emissions for better air quality and monitor radioactive and toxic releases from companies in our neighborhoods.\U.S. House, Georgia District 13\Donzella James\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Retired federal employee\> Age: 59 \> Education: Morris Brown College, Atlanta School of Art\> Family: Married for 39 years to Elmo James. 2 sons, 1 deceased; and 2 grandchildren \> Web site: donzellajames4congress.com\> E-mail: dzella@bellsouth.net\> Why I'm running for office: The citizens of the 13th District asked me to run because they want a representative that actually resides within the district and who is directly affected by the decisions made on all levels of government within the district. They said that they wanted someone who is accessible, hard working and willing to serve with integrity and honesty. Also, the voters indicated that their concerns were not being articulated and their needs were not being met.\> Georgia's economy is suffering along with much of the nation. What specific proposals will you advocate to bring jobs to Georgia and help grow our state's economy? I will focus on Georgia's unique renewable resources and work to attract the alternative fuels industry to Georgia by working through the Georgia Department of Economic Development and the Georgia Department of Technical and Adult Education for 'green jobs' training as described in Title X of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 to create a 'green jobs' corridor throughout the State and leverage the professional research, resources and personnel found throughout our great State. \> What do you see as the role of the Federal Government in protecting Georgia's environment, especially in terms of air and water quality? It is the job of the federal government to create a minimum standard but we should not rely on Washington to maintain air and water quality in Georgia. That is the job of Georgia's citizenry and officials. I advocate 'waste to energy' campaigns to reduce the amount of renewable energy resources that end up in Georgia landfills and working with the EPA to reduce diesel emissions from State fleet vehicles which will go a long way in enhancing overall health in our State.\David Scott\> Party: Democratic\(No other information for this candidate was received by publication deadline)\Unopposed in primary\U.S. House, Georgia District 4, Henry C.

I'm running against a career politician whose been in office since 1986.\> What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see? We cannot continue raising taxes each time we face challenges with balancing the state budget. Citizens are being taxed to death by the city and state, yet we're not seeing where our tax dollars are working FOR us. I'm very interested in working to prevent increases in our taxes and find ways to effectively spend the revenue currently available.\> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? I want to make sure that we find solutions to the Foreclosure crisis in Georgia. Also, it is important that we continue to put forth legislation that protects the seniors in our community by way of tax relief and other incentives.\Nan Orrock\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Non-profit management\> Age: 64\> Education: Mary Washington College and University of Virginia, B.A. English\> Family: Divorced, two sons 31 and 25\> Web site: www.nanorrock.com\> E-mail: nan@nanorrock.com\> Why I'm running for office: I seek another term as Senator to continue my work and leadership for policies that address the concerns of Georgians about healthcare, schools, economic security, healthy safe communities, environmental protections and equal justice.\> What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see? Tax policy needs to be approached comprehensively, not piece-meal. I advocated for dedicating the proceeds from state property tax to provide a funding stream to create a statewide trauma care network. I favor review of all the ""tax expenditure"" policies, measures that give special favored tax breaks to special interests and consider appropriate repeals of these measures. I favor a progressive rather than regressive approach to tax policy so as not to unduly burden those with the least ability to pay. \> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? Health-cover uninsured, cut spiraling admin. costs, provide accessible quality care. Expand Peachcare for Kids and Medicaid w.federal/state dollars.expand services for ""aging in place, & families w. Alzheimer's/dementia. Support grandparents raising grandkids. Centralize advanced directives registry. Electronic medical records statewide.\Housing-Restore GA Fair Lending Act. Outlaw mortgage fraud & preying on those facing foreclosure. Sanction appraiser coercion. Incent workforce housing.

I am tired of Democrats only working with Democrats, and Republicans only working with Republicans. \> What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see? I believe in tax cuts for all Georgians, not just a select few. I want to lead the fight in eliminating the tag tax, and reducing employer payroll taxes. Also, I want to reduce property taxes for all Georgians, who are already struggling to pay their house note on time. I also believe in the fair tax, we need to explore that idea futher. \> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? Just like anybody else, I am tired of $4 gasoline. I am going to lead the fight for renewable energy in Georgia.If we can send a man to the moon, than we can figure out how run a car other than on gasoline. When I get to the Senate, I will create a bill tasking University of Georgia, and Georgia Tech to partner up in creating a renewable energy source. Hopefully their research will lead to the elimination for the need of gasoline. Upon patenting the new fuel created by our universities,The State of Georgia will own the patent.\Georgia Senate, District 38\Michael Adams \> Party: Democratic (No other information for this candidate was received by publication deadline)\Horancena Tate \> Party: Democratic (No other information for this candidate was received by publication deadline)\Georgia Senate, District 40\Paul D.

Between corruption, incompetence, and ulterior motives possessed by management, many of are schools are dysfunctional. With 20 years in the corporate world and now 15 years in the front lines of education, I see very clearly what the problems are and the answers for most.\When I entered the GA schools in 1958 we were 48th and now 50 years later we are still 48th.\GA doesn't have to accept this and frankly had better speak up or we will be 50th. \> What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see? I think educational funding is headed in new directions before too long. They tried somewhat this year to no avail. The metro systems are awash with money and are wasting vast amounts while many of the South Georgia systems can't provide even the minimum.\There at least has to be a cap put on property taxes. I'm not sure eliminating them entirely is appropriate, but stopping the increases is a must. \> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? My obvious priority is legislation working towards true quality education. The NCLB federal legislation is a great first attempt and needs to be refined and tweaked; but needs to be expanded. There have been several versions of Charter bills, but none will produce what all are seeking. Dan Weber just vetoed the most recent Charter bill this past legislative session. It was probably the only bill with any hope of creating these sought-after vibrant 'Charter School' everyone thinks were are creating now.\Dan Weber\> Party: Republican\(No other information for this candidate was received by publication deadline)\Georgia Senate, District 43\Angela Moore\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Businesswoman/political advocate\> Age: 45 \> Education: University of the District of Columbia, Biology\> Family: Three birth children, many foster children. \> Web site: www.voteformissangela.com\> E-mail: angela4dcc5@aol.com\> Why I'm running for office: I see a need to be Pro-Active,Re-Active and Inter-Active within my district by Re-activating the relationship between the 43rd district constituents and their senator, something we have not had for a long time. We have no credibility, or respect at the State Capitol with our current senator, I can and will bridge this gap. \> What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see? A good tax system should remain simple and easy to comply with, avoiding favoritism. Knowing that all tax reform is not created equally, I would like to see policy solutions based on sound principles of taxation which would enable Georgia to compete with other states and help increase Georgia's competitive edge through favorable business tax structures, thus attracting new investments to the state of Georgia and improving our overall growth. \> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? My top priorities are: the Georgia foster care system, predatory lending practices, transportation,water,energy, air,conservation and public lands . I will work together with government agencies, public and private organizations as well as my community to promote legislation that will be in the best interest of the people of Georgia.\Ronald B.

Counties. I am currently in my sixteenth month of my first term and there is a lot of work left to be done. Not only is our infrastructure in jeorpardy with depleting resources like water, we must also invest in our human capital. My continued presence in the State Senate will ensure that social justice issues are deliberated along with our efforts to grow our economy.\> What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see? There were very irresponsible measures introduced in both the House and the Senate during the last two sessions. A bi-partisan commission comprised of government, business and academic leaders should be appointed to craft a responsible policy, which conforms with the state's fiscal plan. \> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? \EDUCATION REFORM: I will continue to fight Republican efforts to further erode funding and Title 20 protections in public education. \TRANSPORTATION: I will again support and vote for legislation that will allow counties and or regions to petition their citizens to approve T-Splost programs, to reduce traffic congestion.\INCREASED PROTECTION FOR VULNERABLE CITIZENS: I will partner with the prosecutors in crafting legislation to increase protection for senior citizens and citizens with developmental disabilities.\Georgia Senate, District 55\Gloria Butler\> Party: Democratic\(No other information for this candidate was received by publication deadline)\Robert Crowder\> Party: Democratic\(No other information for this candidate was received by publication deadline)\Unopposed in primary\Georgia Senate, District 6, Doug Stoner, Democratic; Georgia Senate, District 10, Emanuel Jones, Democratic; Georgia Senate, District 35, Kasim Reed, Democrat; Georgia Senate, District 39, Vincent Fort, Democratic; Georgia Senate, District 40, Martin McConaughy, Democratic; Georgia Senate, District 41, Steve Henson, Democratic; Georgia Senate, District 42, David Adelman, Democratic; Georgia Senate, District 42, Altaf Galeyev, Republican; Georgia Senate, District 43, Willie Hinton, Republican;\Steven D.

It's about being part of a community that works together for change.\> What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see? I would like to see a section in the tax policy that would allow for property taxes on senior citizens, once they hit a certian age, to be frozen at that level. This would slow down the process of seniors losing there homes of 40 and 50 years.\> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results?

Our tax policy is regressive and unfair to those earning the lowest wages in our state. Many of the bills introduced last session to change our tax system did not take this important issue into account. A person should be taxed in accordance to what he or she makes. As a state representative, I would sponsor legislation to establish a state earned income tax credit program similar to 22 other states. Allow the working poor to keep more of their money to purchase the goods and services they need to improve their quality of life.\> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? My top priority will be introducing a comprehensive anti-poverty agenda that begins to look at the causes of poverty and not the resultants of poverty. My second priority would be to establish state level trade commissions for the continent of Africa and Latin America. My last priority will be education. Our students need to be prepared for succeeding in a 21st century global economy where math, science, technology, communications, and language are essential skills.\Leonard ""Mzee"" Tate\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Retired; Life Coach\> Age: 64\> Education: B.A., M.P.A.,J.D.(Law Degree) \> Family: Wife, Ginger; son, Kenyatta (grown)\> Web site: No response \> E-mail: mzeetate@aol.com\> Why I'm running for office: To insure fairness, equity, and Justice in lending, housing, health care, SR.CITIZEN issues, education,juvenile and criminal justice, and neighborhodd safety and security. and OVERALL FAIRNESS!!!\> What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see?

Gas, food prices, foreclosures, and health insurance costs are rising. We deserve legislators committed to finding solutions rather than advancing their own political careers. I will fight to increase the minimum wage, funding for Grady Hospital and PeachCare, and to bring back the tough but fair predatory lending law. I will restore the cuts in education. I will work to make Georgia a place where equality and prosperity for all can thrive. \> What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see? I will oppose, in the strongest possible terms, any plans like the Republican plan from this session that would create hundreds of new taxes. We must closely examine our tax code, and ask ourselves, who benefits. The time has come for Georgia to create an economy that works for working people, starting with a refundable Earned Income Tax Credit targeted to low and moderate income families. I want to study property tax reform, and modernizing the income tax structure.\> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? We must restore the $1.6 billion in cuts to education. I want to go to work on health care issues, especially children's health care and ensure Grady is never forced to close its doors. I will also work to address the foreclosure crisis we're in. As a legislator, my style would be one of inclusion. I will work with any legislator of any party who will work with me to put Georgia on the right track again. We need to look beyond simple party labels and build coalitions of like-minded people with a real interest in improving our state. \Georgia House, District 59\Margaret D Kaiser\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Self-employed, small business owner.\> Age: 41\> Education: B.A., Emory University;\trained/certified in mediation\> Family: Husband, Eric Kaiser; children, Willem Kaiser Ewan Kaiser\> Web site: www.margaretkaiser.com\> E-mail: mkaiser2@comcast.net\> Why I'm running for office: I am seeking re-election, after two very rewarding and successful years in the House of Representatives, to continue to be of service to House District 59 and the State Of Georgia.\> What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see? Property tax relief. I was successful in passing three local bills to double the current homestead exemption for Fulton and Atlanta residents. This will allow homeowners to remain in the most moderate to low priced homes in the City --- to be close to the needed services --- as well as, provide relief and encourage long-time residency to every homeowner. The legislation will be on the ballot this November.\> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? Access to quality education. This can be done with improvements in our Teacher performance development incentives, small class sizes, more emphasis in the classroom and less administration where feasible. Placing the emphasis on more flexibility for teachers to really teach, and higher accountability for schools to perform at the highest standards. \Chris L Vaughn\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Public relations and marketing businessman\> Age: 30\> Education: Lakeside High School, Neighborhood Deputies Program\> Family: Single\> Web site: ww.chrisvaughnworks.com\> E-mail: chris@chrisvaughnworks.com\> Why I'm running for office: I believe it is time we have a representative who will work hard for the needs of our entire district. Someone who is willing to fight for increased state funding for maintaining Grady Hospital, Marta, and public education. As District 59's State Representative, I also plan serve the community year-round by addressing any other needs that may arise. \> What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see? Once elected, I will work on phasing out the Ad Valorem Tax. This tax primarily hurts working class families who are already bogged down by the current recession, not to mention the ever-growing cost of gas. I will also work to reform the property tax assessment system so that the county government doesn't give you a back-door tax increase by increasing the assessed value of your property. In my district particularly, many low-income and fixed income residents are losing their homes, because their income has not kept pace with development.\> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? Georgia still ranks amoung the lowest when it comes to public education, yet is increasingly growing in juvenielle crime. I believe this trend is due to the lack of parental involvement in our public schools. With the rise in childhood obesity, it should be the state's goal to promote physical activity in the classroom - over the years this has been removed. I want to see these programs restored. Improving the quality of our public schools is an issue that should cross party and geographical lines. \Georgia House, District 61\Edith Ladipo\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Teacher\> Age: 60\> Education: B.A., Clark Atlanta University; M.A., Cambridge College (pending)\> Family: Two children (Fatimot, Kaseem)\> Web site: www.ElectEdithLadipo.com\> E-mail: edithm2004@yahoo.com\> Why I'm running for office: I am running to serve the residents of House District 61 and the State of Georgia by working to establish effective public policies that improve the quality of education, the environment, and protect the personal safety and health of the people in this state. \> What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see? Before any meaningful tax policies are introduced I believe that a bi-partisan commission should be assembled to study Georgia 's tax system. The group should include representatives of both parties as well as othr stakeholders including local government officials, business and community leaders, academic experts and ""grassroots citizens representing a variety of communities and organizations. \> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? If elected, my top policy priorities will be the education of our children and access to affordable and efficient modes of public transportation. I will work to ensure the issues do not continue to be next year's priorities. I will work to become inform and to inform residents of House District 61, about the important policy changes required to improve education and public transportation in Georgia. I will then collaborate with my colleagues to ensure that Georgia's education and transportation policies are revised.\Paul Lockhart Sr. \> Party: Democratic (No other information for this candidate was received by publication deadline)\Daniel A. Blackman\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Environmental consultant\> Age: 28\> Education: Clark Atlanta University\> Family: Wife, Jeanelle Blackman;children, Anias and Zion Blackman\> Web site: danielblackman.com\> E-mail: daniel@danielblackman.com\> Why I'm running for office: As a husband, father, and citizen who lives, works and worships in Fulton County, I am concerned about Georgians' accessibility to quality health care, the strength of our economy, the nearly $1.5 billion in school cuts that that we have seen over the past 6 years, and the fact that Atlanta has been ranked as 12th amongst polluted cities. It is time to end the partisan gamesmanship at the capitol that has divided and weakened our state, while hindering opportunities for Georgia families. \> What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see? I would like to see policy that protects seniors from being taxed out of their homes. By reducing property taxes, we recognize the need to protect our financially vulnerable seniors. I will work vigorously to provide much needed property tax relief to Georgia seniors that would allow them to stay in their homes. \> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? We must make relative that access to health care and long-term financial security are basic needs that Georgians share, and this should be our commitment to current and future generations. As a legislator, I plan to promote bills that provide property tax relief to seniors, fight for uninsured Georgians right to obtain health care, and raise the minimum wage. Additionally, I will promote equal access to a quality education while ensuring energy efficiency and access to clean water and air.\Ralph Long III\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Broker/owner, Ralph Abbott Realty; owner/CEO, Mindsweat Properties\> Age: 32\> Education: Associate's degree in Interior Design, Art Institute of Atlanta\> Family: Married to Erica Morris Long and proud father of Ralph Long IV.\> Web site: www.georgiadistrict61.com\> E-mail: ralphlongiii@mindsweat.net\> Why I'm running for office: I am running for State Representative because I have the committment, passion and proven leadership ability to fight for District 61. Our community is a beautifully diverse section of Southwest Atlanta, East Point and College Park. However, we are plagued by stagnant economic development, crime and ineffective leadership. \> What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see? As a Real Estate Broker, I have watched the subprime mortgage crisis unfold for the past few years. ZIP code 30310 has the dubious distinction of being one of the top areas for foreclosures in the nation. \One of the first bills I will introduce will be legislation requiring banks, within 30 days of foreclosing on a property, to file a deed on the property. This will put the banks on the hook for paying property taxes on these vacant properties to our struggling municipalities. Our cities and counties need this tax revenue.\> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? I will: fight crime in our community; alleviate the effect of home foreclosures; strengthen Georgia's economy; protect our environment; and, fight for our Seniors and Children. \I will introduce legislation requiring banks holding foreclosed properties to maintain alarm and lawn care services on the homes. \I will introduce legislation strengthening the state's environmental regulations to protect us from creosote and pentachlorophenol. \I will fight for legislation capping the interest rates that may be charged by payday lenders.\Tony M.L. McCann\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Educator and associate minister \> Age: 28 \> Education: B.A., Political Science; B.A., Sociology, M.Ed., secondary education\> Family: Single, and no kids at this time.\> Web site: www.electtonymccann.org\> E-mail: tonynatl@bellsouth.net\> Why I'm running for office: As a community volunteer and educator,I consistently demonstrates the energy and dedication that has resulted in improvements in our neighborhoods, and I will bring the same service to the Capitol. Georgia is poised for greatness, and we can either retreat into the politics of bickering and blame or move forward with optimism and vision. I understands that education, economic and development of an environment where every person is able to thrive are the keys to our success.\> What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see? Fundamental reform of our tax system is one way to resolve these problems, but because reform creates both winners and losers, the leading presidential candidates have not addressed it seriously. Nonetheless, both candidates have proposed major changes to the nation's tax laws. Senator McCain would permanently extend the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, increase deductions for taxpayers supporting dependents, reduce the corporate income tax rate, and allow immediate deductions for the cost of certain short-lived capital equipment.\> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? Transportation helps shape an area's economic health and quality of life. Not only does the transportation system provide for the mobility of people and goods, it also influences patterns of growth and economic activity through accessibility to land. Furthermore, the performance of this system affects such public policy concerns as air quality, environmental resource consumption, social equity,' smart growth,' economic development, safety, and security. \Keisha Waites\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Emergency management consultant\> Age: 35\> Education: Atlanta Metro College, Georgia Southern University, Political Science\> Family: No response \> Web site: www.keishawaites.com\> E-mail: Keisha@keishawaites.com\> Why I'm running for office: I am running to improve the community I was raised in and help to better the quality of life for families in the 61st district. Recent legislation nationwide and in the state of Georgia does not reflect the voice of the people. I believe district 61 needs a new generation of optimistic and solution-driven leadership that will listen to the concerns of constituents, thus transforming our community and political landscape in Georgia.\> What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see? I support incentives for keeping jobs in the state of Georgia and District 61. I also support extending the existing moratorium on foreclosures and establishing an Emergency Mortgage Assistance Fund to protect Georgia families and homeowners. Mass transit is critical to our environmental health. Therefore, I support funding projects like the Brain Train, the Atlanta-Lovejoy commuter rail, enhancing Marta; in additional to, supporting a referendum for the use of sales tax to fund major transit projects.\> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? #1 Finding solutions to protect homeowners from the mortgage foreclosures crises. We must provide a safety net for homeowners that have fallen on hard times and been victims of predatory lenders. \#2 I support sponsoring and supporting legislation for funding a Regional Mass Transportation System. This must be a regionalized collaborative approach at the federal and state levels of government to ensure its success. \#3 Protect Peach Care and preserve Grady for seniors and low-income families. \Georgia House, District 64\Charles Brant\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Attorney with the law firm of Colom and Brant, partner\> Age: 45\> Education: Morehouse, 1984; Mercer Law School, J.D. in Law, 1990.\> Family: Married, three children\> Web site: www.electcharlesbrant.com\> E-mail: cbrant@colomandbrantlaw.com\> Why I'm running for office: I understand and practice law and feel I would do a great job in making laws that work.\> What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see? Taxes more evenly spread amongst the middle and upper class as well as real tax breaks for the elderly and people with lower income\> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? My top priorty would be to give the best representation to my district on every issue.\Roger Bruce\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: VP, Atlanta Life Financial Group; incumbent member, Georgia House of Representatives District 64\> Age: 55\> Education: B.A., Political Science, Morehouse College 1975\> Family: Married with three children\> Web site: rogerbruce.net\> E-mail: rbruce5347@aol.com\> Why I'm running for office: Yes, I am running for my 4th term in the Ga House of Representatives\> What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see? I believe the entire tax code in Georgia should be reviewed. I do not believe this is something that can be done in one session of the general assembly. There needs to be a very comprehensive study as to how we can relieve citizens of this tremendous tax burden while also ensuring that our school systems, cities and counties get the proper funding to provide the services that citizens expect. I would support the immediate repeal of the so called ""Birthday Tax"" on auto tags. \> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? Water mangement, changing the funding formula for Grady Hospital and MARTA, improving the quality of education, increasing services to our Senior Citizens and developing programs to assist families that have children with special needs are my top priorities. Additionally, I was the sponsor of the Parent Protection Act which allows parents 24 hours per year to attend to their childs education needs (school visits, medical concerns) and their dependent parent medical needs without their jobs being put at risk. I will also continue my efforts to get property tax relief for unincorporated South Fulton County. \Georgia House, District 65\Sharon Beasley-Teague\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Machinist\> Age: 56\> Education: Indiana College of Business and Technology\> Family: Married 1 child\> Web site: No response \> E-mail: No response \> Why I'm running for office: To continue supporting & representing the views of my consitutency.\> What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see? I would continue to lower taxes for homeowners especially the seniors. While making sure the the school taxes are protected and we can provide education for all of Georgia children.\> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? When re-elected I will continue working for the people in the 65th House district voting for budgets that get much need money to the district. work for the district to keep taxes as low as possible and sending dollars for the best programs possible to get the most for our tax dollars. Provide the best resources to our children with scholarships like HOPE and other private scholarships.\Expand support for our back to school programs which include safe schools,just help the whole family. Support good government for all Citizens.\Sandra B.

(Did not graduate)\> Family: Husband, Paul Hardy; 7 children\> Web site: www.sandrahardy.com\> E-mail: Sandra@sandrahardy.com\> Why I'm running for office: I spent many weeks under 'The Gold Dome' in 2007, begging for support in our struggle to become a city. Our voices were not heard. And we were helpless. I decided to run because the citizens of South Fulton deserve far stronger leadership and representation. We need our voices to be heard. I will do everything within my power to LISTEN.\> What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see? *Hopefully the beginning of 2009 General Assembly of Georgia won't be so contentious.\After all the debates are over. I am hopeful that a resolution to amend the constitution to allow a 1% local option sales tax to fund transportation be made. The voters need to decide.\*Property taxes are a major concern. With the new assessments, property values have increased greatly. We must stop the bleeding.\> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? I will let the legislators know how important transportation is to my district. Threats of greater traffic congestion are on the forefront. Diligence and the implementation of sound operational policies and infrastructure strategies are vital. I will support this legislation\Permanent funding for Grady's trauma center and other trauma centers is very important \Due to the fact, numerous bills were ignored in the 2008 session; I predict the 2009 session will be more productive, with sound leadership.\Lewanna Heard\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Pharmaceutical sales\> Age: 29\> Education: B.A. Communications; M.A. ,Communications\> Family: I am single with no children.\> Web site: www.lewannaheard.com\> E-mail: wanna@lewannaheard.com\> Why I'm running for office: I am running because of the stagnant leadership that has failed our community. We need a new representative, one with a vision to move the community of South Fulton forward. One who is willing to collaborate with the entire community. And one with the determination to end the isolation felt by many parts of the district and can bring resources to all of South Fulton.\> What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see? Changing the State's application of property taxes is critical. The State has consistently underfunded public education, leaving it to local governments to pick up the shortfall. Since the major source of funding available to local governments, specifically school boards, is property taxes; property taxes continue to increase because the State keeps forcing unfunded mandates down the throats of homeowners. We should also give tax breaks to first time homebuyers because new homeowners keep neighborhoods safe, stable, and vital for generations.\> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? Top policy priorities include improving the QBE formula, increasing funding for domestic violence prevention, increasing funding for juvenile crime prevention, providing mobile healthcare centers to urban and rural citizens, and imploring prescription drug patient assistance programs for the elderly and children. All of these things can be accomplished by building public/private partnerships, working with local law enforcement to secure federal funding, and working with common interest legislators.\Woody Holmes\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Retired with 30 years of service from Lockheed Martin\> Age: 63\> Education: Most of my formal education came from management courses at Lockheed. \> Family: I have a wife, 4 children, 9 grandchildren and 1 great-grandchild.\> Web site: ElectWoodyHolmes.com\> E-mail: holm3107@bellsouth.net\> Why I'm running for office: I feel that thier has to be some connon sense put back in the decision making in our government.\> What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see? Fair Tax.\> What is your solution to the issue of illegal immigration in Georgia? Stop it. I have a plan that uses the resources we have to do this.\> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? I would stand on the authority of the Preamble to the Georgia State Constitution that states that we will rely on the protection and guidance of Almighty God. We must Honor God and Protect the Family.\Charles Sharper\> Party: Democratic\(No other information for this candidate was received by publication deadline)\Georgia House, District 66\Connie Biemiller\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Licensed clinical social worker\> Age: 47\> Education: B.A. from Newberry College, M.S.W. from the University of Georgia\> Family: Husband (David); 2 children (Emily and Aaron)\> Web site: thecommunityvoice.tv\> E-mail: conniecampaign@bellsouth.net\> Why I'm running for office: In 2006, I led our community in ridding our neighborhoods of toxic poisoning in the 'onion smell' battle. After much persistence, the culprit was shut down, though sadly many remain ill with crippling diseases. It was through this struggle that I found our State Leadership inadequate and realized I must run for office. I am passionate about our community but find that passion lacking among many of our legislators. We need real leaders who don't govern in fear of political consequence.\> What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see? I advocate running our State House like we run our homes-funding vital services first and pet projects last. In our homes, we strive for food on our tables, a roof over our heads, health care and education for our children, profitable employment and savings. I propose the use of a TABOR initiative that is tailored to the specific needs of the State of Georgia. The use of such an initiative will realign the will of the government with the will of the people.\> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? The fuel crisis that is resulting in devastating food prices is top priority. I would ask the Assembly to create a Special Commission, bringing in creative minds from across the State, to tackle this problem. There are many ways that we can help our citizens at this very moment such as the creation of food cooperatives within our state. Also, promoting initiatives for businesses to find innovative fuel resolutions and clearing the red tape so that their products are implemented.\Virgil Fludd\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Business owner; corporate recruiter\> Age: 50\> Education: B.A., Economics, Davidson College\> Family: Married for 24 years; 2 children in college.\> Web site: www.virgilfludd.com\> E-mail: vfludd@mindspring.com\> Why I'm running for office: To improve education, create new jobs, offer more healthcare options and protect the environment.\> What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see? I sponsored HB1264. The bill offers:\1. Annual report on the impact of tax exemptions\2. Eliminate inventory taxes\3. Update income tax brackets and increase personal exemptions\4. Add 3.5% circuit breaker on property taxes\5. Remove taxes on fuel used in manufacturing\6. Remove vehicle tag tax\7. Track sales transactions at the source\8. Increase the cigarette tax by $1 per pack\9. Apply sales tax on selected services\This plan would save taxes for 95% of Georgia workers.\> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? - Improve education\- Increase the number of high paying jobs\- Ensure state support for healthcare and transportation\- Protect our environment\To accomplish these goals would require working with other legislators to co-sponsor appropriate bills to address these concerns. No one legislator can get a bill passed without the support and votes of at least 50% of lawmakers. I have a good rapport with my colleagues and have been successful in the past in getting bills through the process and enacted into law.\Georgia House, District 81\Cecillia Hailey\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Small business owner for five years.\> Age: 40\> Education: Arizona State University.

Mother of 4, 2 dogs, 1 cat and a fish named Herman.\> Web site: www.chailey4district81.com\> E-mail: chailey4district81@yahoo.com\> Why I'm running for office: I believe that politics is not working in the state of Georgia. Legislation that can make our lives better is disregarded and partisanship supersedes the needs of the people. I can make a difference by letting the voice of the people be heard through me,by making sure that effective legislation gets done for all Georgian's.\> What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see? I would not like to see any property tax increases. I would like a special tax to be implemented on property owners with run down properites. Higher entertainment, cigarette and alcohol tax should be put in place. In addition, I would like to create an IMMIGRATION tax imposed on ALL illegal Immigrants in Georgia.\> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? My top priority would be education. All the monies that have been 'borrowed' by the Governor need to be returned and more money needs to be added. Teaching to the test is not good teaching. School uniforms should be mandatory, P.E. music and after school programs should be available at every school. More control of school policies etc,should be in the hands of local school boards and parents. The state Superintendant should be accountable to the legislature and should report progress accurately and often.\Chris Huttman\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Information technology manager\> Age: 28\> Education: 2003 B.A. Print Journalism, Georgia State University\> Family: Single Parents and brothers live in Atlanta, Athens and Augusta.\> Web site: www.chrishuttman.com/\> E-mail: chrishuttman@gmail.com\> Why I'm running for office: I am running for state representative to increase access to health care, improve educational opportunity and help to put into place a statewide transportation plan that will reduce congestion and fund more transportation alternatives such as mass transit.\> What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see? I favor tax decisions being made at the local level when possible. I was disturbed by the legislature's efforts to consolidate tax collection from local governments and school boards. One small but meaningful change I favor: the sales tax paid on gasoline should be devoted entirely to transportation. The 4th penny should be moved from the general fund (where it currently goes) to a fund dedicated to mass transit where it can be used to pay for rail, buses and other traffic alleviating solutions.\> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? I will work to expand Georgia's Pre-K program to include universal access so that every 4 year old can attend a quality program and get a true head start. I'll work to stop the austerity cuts to schools, $1.5 billion since 2002. I favor a statewide transportation plan that puts congestion and demand above politics in spending decisions and has funding for mass transportation and promotes high density development to alleviate traffic and give Georgians more flexible options in how and where they are able to live and work.\Georgia House, District 88\Robford Hill\> Party: Democratic\(No other information for this candidate was received by publication deadline)\Billy Mitchell\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Vice President, Government Affairs\> Age: 46\> Education: Juris Doctor, Atlanta Law School\> Family: Wife Shawn, daughter Maya, son Sean\> Web site: www.billymitchell.org\> E-mail: billymitchell@bellsouth.net\> Why I'm running for office: I have long held a passion for public service and visionaries willing to create realistic solutions and for those who are willing to do the necessary work to accomplish those solutions.\As a result of the many laws I have authored and responsiveness to my district, I have earned recognition for effectiveness and productivity and setting a new standard of representation for my constituents.\Along with my aptitude for effective ""bridge building"" compelled me to seek re-election.\> What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see? As indicated by the large budget surplus Georgia has amassed (on top of contingency funds), I would like to see - and have been working to do so - the tax code amended such that we take less taxes from payers. \My preference would be the elimination of the automobile ad valorem tax - the so-called ""birthday tax"" required annually when we register our vehicles.\> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? Having authored an unprecedented 7 general bills signed into law during my previous three terms of service, I will continue to work on important issues affecting my community and state, such as legislation I have already drafted, including a bill that seeks to eliminate the problem of thieves stealing air conditioners and catalytic converters and selling them for its scrap material.\Additionally, always a priority will be the responsiveness and accessibility I maintain with my constituents in addressing their issues with government.\Georgia House, District 89\Clyburn Halley\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Deputy Sheriff, DeKalb County Sheriff's Office\> Age: 44\> Education: Master of Public Administration, Georgia Law Enforcement Command College \> Family: Single Son (18)\> Web site: electhalley.com\> E-mail: challeydistrict89@yahoo.com\> Why I'm running for office: I am running for office, because I believe there are not enough partnerships being created between Law Enforcement, Educators and Non-profit organizations.\Winning this election will places me in a position to become more involved in reducing the exploitation of DeKalb County Senior Citizens; and to create additional partnerships with Educators and the Law Enforcement community in DeKalb County.\> What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see?

Actually, I would like to see a total rewrite of the tax code to modernize the GA Tax Code to mirror contemporary federal tax law. For instance, the tax tables have not been updated in decades.

In my econmic plan, it outline a way to substitute the funds generated from this tax, without cutting into much needed programs and services.\> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? Economic stability, education and healthcare. I will intiative a plan to restructure tax policies, fight for minimum wage and pensions, to keep pace with inflation, and aggressively seek companies to relocate into Georgia and who is willing to hire a minimum of 40% of Georgia residents in their work force.

I have been in education since 1989 and the changes have constantly moved in the direction of hurting our children instead of helping them. As a teacher, I have firsthand knowledge about how our children are being impacted by laws mandated by the state.\> What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see? We are facing a severe economic downturn. State revenues are slowing and vital state services are facing steep cuts. I am concerned that tax cuts would irresponsibly deplete our state's reserve fund. Tax policy reform deserves rigorous, thoughtful debate. I support the creation of a bi-partisan commission to study the tax system and make recommendations to the Governor/General Assembly. I would urge the commission to consider a state website where citizens can see how tax dollars are being spent on contracts and grants.\> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? Restore funding to education, make sure that testing is not the main indicator for a child receiving a high school diploma, and to work to \Continue to restore austerity cuts and remove the cap from HOPE funding. \Byron Wilson\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Founder, owner and CEO of Wilson Academy \> Age: 32\> Education: Ohio State University: Double major, B.S., B.A.\> Family: Wife Tiffany, daughters Sydney, Khelsei, Tyler, Kennedy\> Web site: www.byronfwilson.com\> E-mail: byronfwilson@aol.com\> Why I'm running for office: I love my community, but we are facing several critical issues. Rather than complain, I'd like to make changes. I want to make sure our community reaches its potential, and positively affect as many lives as I can.\> What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see? Most people shutter at the word ""taxes"", but they are a necessary evil. People understand that taxes are necessary, but they want to see their money at work. One of the things I will do is bring information to the people. Citizens don't really know where their money is going. There isn't enough accountability. People are willing to invest in things as long as they get a return. We've got to implement tax policy that yields visible returns. \> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? The way many people would answer this question is one of the problems we have in government. We all have our personal interests; but at the end of the day, we're public servants. That means our priorities are not dictated by ourselves, but by the people. The issues I will tackle first our those most critical to my community. My approach to achieving results in any area is to have a thorough understanding of the issue, and then taking strong, definitive action. \Georgia House, District 92\Pam S.

I currently serve on the health and human services committee, the judiciary committee and the intra-coordination of government committee. These committees shape the majority of the healthcare policies, statutes and local goverment acts within the General Assembly. I would like to continue to represent my constituents in this manner. \> What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see? I would like to see a tax reform that is fiscally responsible and one that would not harm the state budget. I liked the idea of the elimination of the ad volrem tax if such elimination would not cut needed services such has education and healthcare. I did not like the proposed tax reform that took power away from local governments, particularly in the education system. .\> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? Working with legislators to fund the trauma network, working with the metropolitan legislators in addressing the funding of healthcare to the uninsured and underinsured including care to mental health patients. A sustainble transportation plan is needed in our state and I will work with leadership to assure the passage of a transportation bill. I would also work to allocated needed money for the educational systems in DeKalb and Rockdale counties and other local funding that is needed in the area.\George Turner\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Retired public transit manager. President of transit consulting company. \> Age: 57\> Education: Georgia State University, B.A.\> Family: Wife, Patsy Turner Daughter, Raina Son, George III\> Web site: No response \> E-mail: turnerg1@comcast.net\> Why I'm running for office: Since retiring I have become more and more involved in community affairs. I volunteer regularly to attend meetings concerning political issues. The matters I deal with are on local, regional and state levels. It appears that a vacancy could occur in my state house district. If that happens I would like to succeed the incumbent. I believe I can make a difference in the area of transportation and education. \> What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see? Leave the tax policy as it is and go after the budget. Cut pork out of the budget and automatically reduce taxes in specific categories. The budget can't just be looked at, it has to be studied and analyzed by those who are impacted most by it. Each year's budget has similar earmarks. A citizen group should be given a serious chance to review the budget and offer serious scrutiny before it is approved. If this is done then local governments can adjust their local tax structure to meet local needs, probably at a reduced rate.\> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? Transportation needs more attention in terms of mass transit. Funding has to be directed towards regional projects. There is a need to build hubs for parking and multi-use centers. We should designate special lanes for BUS RAPID TRANSIT Service. This concept can be very efficient until Rapid Rail can be extended. Bus Rapid Transit can easily alter course. We need Commuter Rail lines to feed the inner city system and a major hub to connect all forms of transportation.\Georgia House, District 93\Dee Dawkins-Haigler\> Party: Democratic\(No other information for this candidate was received by publication deadline)\Malik Douglas\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Assistant education services officer\> Age: 37\> Education: Currently completing Masters of Education\> Family: Married, Linda Douglas; children: Larry and Victoria\> Web site: www.Malikdouglas.com\> E-mail: info@malikdouglas.com\> Why I'm running for office: - no response -\> What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see? - no response - \> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? - no response -\Colet Odenigbo\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Administrator and community activist\> Age: 43\> Education: B.A. Alabama A & M; M.P.A.

Fairer tax policies that benefit middle-class Georgians, especially single family households who work hard and follow the rules. \> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? My top policy priorities would be: Education, Economic Development, Environment, and Efficacy in Government. I will promote awareness and inform my constituents on the issues. I will make sure that their interests are represented at the State House. I will be a conduit (tool) between my constituents and the legislative process.

It is the spending policy that needs major overhaul. There is little to no accountability for the tax dollars spent. Rampant abuses have been uncovered by local reporters in the use of state-issued credit cards. Because of poor supervision, taxpayers have to pay the costs. Money was wasted on fradulent bridge inspection reports and taxpayers paid again to re-do the inspections. I favor a fair-tax or flat-tax approach to state tax policy, eliminating excessive paperwork, bureaucracy, and economic burdens on taxpayers.\> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? Healthcare and education are top priorities. I will watch spending allocations and personally help administators to be good stewards of the money alloted to them in order to help all children achieve success, and for citizens to have access to complete healthcare including mental health care. I will be relentless in attacking waste and exposing fraud, especially for victims of identity theft and scam artists.

I am going to work hard to repeal the ad valorem tax on vehicles only. This will give much needed tax relief to Georgia's citizens. Also I would like to see the implementation of the flat tax. This tax policy change will allow for several deductions for lower income families but still account for needed revenues for the state. The flat tax will make up for any revenue shortfalls due to the repeal of the ad valorem tax.\> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? If elected, my priorities would include education reform and enhancement, resulting in improved education of our youth & higher test scores, equal community development and expansion of the public transportation systems for much needed relief from traffic and rising gas prices. I would accomplish this agenda through bipartisan politics, consistent pressure on my colleagues to put the interest of the people we represent over special interests, and introducing comprehensive legislation that will address the state's needs in those areas.\Randal Mangham\> Party: Democratic\(No other information for this candidate was received by publication deadline)\Unopposed in primary\Georgia House, District 40, Rob Teilhet, Democratic; Georgia House, District 41, Sharon Cooper, Republican; Georgia House, District 44, Steve Hedden, Georgia House, District 54, Edward Lindsey, Republican; Georgia House, District 56, Kathy Ashe, Democratic; Georgia House, District 57, Pat Gardner, Democratic; Georgia House, District 58, Robbin Shipp, Democratic; Georgia House, District 60, Georganna Sinkfield, Democratic; Georgia House, District 62, Joe Heckstall, Democratic; Georgia House, District 63, Tyrone Brooks, Democratic; Georgia House, District 79, Keith A.

Monthly payments for electric, natural gas, and phone are taking ever increasing scarce cash. \America has always positively responded to scarcity with technology. As a professional engineer and DOD supervisor, I am trained in technical problems experienced by our utilities. Encouraging competition without collusion, and wringing excess from the production system will better our utility rates and supply.\> In your opinion, what, if any changes are needed in Georgia's energy policy? While we don't experience roving brownouts like California, or sky-high energy prices, we can do more.\We can set cash incentives for conservation measures, including weatherization/insulation, digital thermostats, high efficiency furnaces, water heaters and air conditioners. We can encourage cooling ponds for several antiquated coal power plants that drain water mercilessly from our dwindling lakes. We can lower rates by encouraging new technology, not blind reliance on fossil fuel.\> Describe the education and experience that qualify you for this position. I am a Registered Professional Engineer for 25 years in 3 states, including 20 years in Georgia. Former Department of Defense positions include Chief of Power/Lighting, and Chief of Process Engineering.\My education includes a BScElecEngin, an MScMechEngin (GA Tech), an MScPhysics (GA Tech), and an executive MBA.\The PSC is concerned with such technical topics as underground piping infrastructure and complex power generation schemes. We need an engineer looking out for Georgian's interests.\> Commodity prices for energy are rising dramatically. What role should the PSC play in mitigating these increases? If we rely exclusively on fossil fuels, we are at the mercy of OPEC and the energy barons. In the long run, we must develop alternative sources, including increased nuclear, solar, and wind power. In the short run, we must encourage conservation measures, including proper insulation/weatherization, high efficiency air conditions, furnaces, and water heaters. Cash incentives for conversion, costly in the short run, pays rich dividends both to families and to our secure energy infrastructure.\Jim Powell\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Independent energy consultant to states, local governments and industry.\> Age: 59\> Education: B.B.A., M.B.A. from the University of North Florida. Federal Executive Institute.\> Family: Married to Karen for 37 years, 2 great sons & daughters in law, 2 adorable granddaughters\> Web site: jimpowellforgapsc.com\> E-mail: jimpowellforgapsc@gmail.com\> Why I'm running for office: It is my intent to be the consumer advocate and to keep consumers' interests a top priority while also understanding that the investor owned utilities are in business to make a profit for their shareholders. I have worked with State PSCs across the country in efforts to implement energy efficiency practices, increasing use of renewable energy and promoting conservation. I have served our Nation for over 35 years and being elected to the PSC is the next chapter in my public service career.\> In your opinion, what, if any changes are needed in Georgia's energy policy? Georgia does not have a comprehensive State Energy Policy that addresses all aspects of energy supply and demand. The Georgia Environmental Facilities Authority published the State Energy Strategy in December 2007 which was developed in a collaborative manner with extensive stakeholder input. The Governor's Energy Challenge 2020 and Conserve Georgia are both efforts at efficiency and conservation. These two initiatives, along with State Energy Strategy should be used as the basic framework to develop a comprehensive State Energy Policy. \> Describe the education and experience that qualify you for this position. I am the most experienced PSC candidate in years. I was a Senior Executive with the U.S. Department of Energy and have more than 20 years experience in developing and implementing energy policies and energy program management. I have significant experience at the regional and national level promoting renewable energy technology programs (i.e., solar, biomass), energy efficiency technologies and practices and conservation (i.e., Energy Star, Weatherization Assistance Program). My undergraduate degree is in Accounting and I have a MBA.\> Commodity prices for energy are rising dramatically. What role should the PSC play in mitigating these increases? Georgia relies primarily on coal to generate electricity. I plan to interest the State's utilities in diversifying the fuel sources for electricity so that price volatility for a particular fuel will not impact ratepayers severely. Focusing more on using renewable energy sources produced in Georgia creates jobs and keeps dollars in the State's economy. Georgia needs to pay more attention to energy efficiency. Reducing demand and mitigating the rising price of energy resources can best be achieved through energy efficiency and conservation.\Pam Davidson\> Party: Republican\> Occupation: Renewable energy consultant\> Age: 45\> Education: B.S. Organizational Behavior, University of San Francisco\> Family: One daughter age 14, two dogs, one cat, one horse\> Web site: pamdavidson.org\> E-mail: pamdavidson@tds.net\> Why I'm running for office: I am seeking the position because I am very concerned about our ability to provide clean, affordable energy in the state. \> In your opinion, what, if any changes are needed in Georgia's energy policy? We need to our maximize our energy efficiency and renewable energy potential. We have made very little ground in either area. If elected,I will ask that the Demand Side Management Group review and improve upon thier recommendations to the PSC and set forth a resolution to create a Renewable Energy Working group to develop immediate and significant goals for affordable renewable energy. \We need to evaluate our energy resources in light of water resources and air quality. \> Describe the education and experience that qualify you for this position. As an renewable energy advocate, I have had the priviledge of earning the respect of lawmakers and policy experts. Hence, I can 'hit the ground running' in order to facilitate comprehensive energy policy reform. I work well with both the environmental and business community. Recent evidence of this is the successful passsage of HB 670 (the state's first comprehensive energy efficiency and renewable energy bill) which was recently signed by the Governor. I initiated this bill in order to incentivize progressive changes in energy policy. \> Commodity prices for energy are rising dramatically. What role should the PSC play in mitigating these increases?\Firstly, we need to reduce our per capita energy usage. Less demand means less fuel. \Secondly, we need to quickly develop renewable energy resources so that we are not dependent on global fuel prices. Our greatest resource for affordable renewable energy is biomass. We can provide both electricity and biofuels (such as synthetic diesel) as a 'value add') from such facilities. \Lauren W.

My previous experiences as an assistant district attorney, defense lawyer and judge have prepared me to bring the most balanced perspective and broadest skill set to this race. I understand that the decision not to prosecute is often harder yet wiser than the decision to prosecute, but that either decision must be based soley on the evidence and not politics. As the only candidate in private practice who has represented people accused of a crime, I will bring real world experience to the D.A. office.\> What do you regard to be the most pressing problems facing the DA's office over the next term? 1. Lack of integrity. The integrity and credibility of the office must be restored by removing political influence from prosecutorial decisionmaking. 2. Backlog of cases. The backlog must be ended swiftly so that justice will be delayed no longer to victims and to defendants. 3. Reorganization. The outdated office structure needs total revamping to bring efficient and effective prosecutions. 4. Resources. With increasd caseloads and decreased funding, the office must use new investigative and litigation techniques. \Tracy Graham-Lawson\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Juvenile Court Judge in Clayton County since 1995\> Age: 50\> Education: Duke University, B.A., 1979 Univ. of North Carolina Law School, J.D., 1984Emory Law School\> Family: Married to Ted Lawson Widow of Mike Gladden Daughter Kelley, age 20 \> Web site: www.hope4clayton.com\> E-mail: TracyGLawson@hope4clayton.com\> Why I'm running for office: I love my job as a juvenile court judge but I am a public servant and go where I am needed. There is a tremendous need for change in the District Attorney. \> How have your previous experiences prepared you for the position of DA? I have been a police officer, an assistant district attorney and a judge during my 25 year working career. I worked in the Clayton County District Attorney's office for over 10 years, trying over 80 jury trials and having success in nearly 90% of those cases. As a judge I have presided in over 1800 trials involving criminal law violations and have never been reversed on appeal for an error by a higher court. All of these experiences have prepared me to become the next District Attorney of Clayton County.\> What do you regard to be the most pressing problems facing the DA's office over the next term? The most pressing problem is the tremendous backlog of cases. My goal is for all cases to be tried within six months of arrest. This allows victims' voices to be heard quickly and the accused their right to a speedy trial. It would also save taxpayer money.\Lack of leadership is another problem. Leaders lead by example not by delegation. \Prosecution, or the lack thereof, should not be politically motivated. Some times the District Attorney must make an unpopular decision that is the right one ethically and legally. \Jewel Scott\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: District Attorney of Clayton County\> Age: 47 \> Education: Bachelor of Law degree and Juris Doctor, Mercer University School of Law\> Family: Married 23 years with two sons\> Web site: www.balancingjusticewithfairness.com\> E-mail: advocate@balancingjusticewithfairness.com\> Why I'm running for office: I love my current job as District Attorney. I have a passion for public service and serving the people in my community. I take seriously the protection and safety of our county and therefore I do not hesitate to put offenders, especially violent ones, behind bars. My position has enabled me to make decisions affecting the lives of people including offering second chances where it is merited. I would like to continue to implement a system that balances justice with fairness.\> How have your previous experiences prepared you for the position of DA? Having practiced law for over 24 years in Criminal Law, Mental Hygiene, Family Law, Domestic Violence, Elder Law, among others, I am best equipped to bring a common sense, balanced approach to prosecution. Having practiced law in large organizations between New York and Georgia, and having held the DA's position, I have had the daily experience of interacting with the public and my constituents in a manner that has been positive and effective.\> What do you regard to be the most pressing problems facing the DA's office over the next term? As our county continues to become urbanized and crimes, especially violent crimes and murders continue to increase, the biggest challenge to the DA's office is that of having an adequate budget and enough staff to expedite the cases in a manner that does not clog the criminal justice system. Having had no additional staff since 2005 with a 100% increase in murders and 20% increase in caseload, I know first hand these particular challenges. \Board of Education Referendum --- DeKalb\> Shall the Act be approved which re-enacts the homestead exemption from DeKalb County School District ad valorem taxes for educational purposes in the amount of $2,500.00 of the assessed value of the homestead residents of that school district in each taxable year in which sales tax for educational purposes is imposed and collected in such school district for any portion of that year pursuant to Article VIII, Section VI, Paragraph IV of the Constitution?\City of Dunwoody Homestead Referendum --- DeKalb\> Shall the Act incorporating the city of Dunwoody in DeKalb County according to the charter contained in the Act and the homestead exemptions described in the Act be approved?\Surveyor, Cobb County\Donald L.

I will continue my efforts to help the land owners of Cobb County resolve disputes over property lines in a fair and equitable manner. I will stress the need for reliable and accurate surveys of their property to the citizens of the county and call upon the surveying society to maintain the high standards set for all surveys by our board, in order to eliminate possible conflicts.\I am only a phone call away and always respond quickly to attempt to resolve disputes.\Matt Wellborn\> Party: Republican\(No other information for this candidate was received by publication deadline)\County Commissioner Dist. 2, Cobb County\Melissa Bauer\> Party: Democratic\(No other information for this candidate was received by publication deadline)\James Royal\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Kennesaw State University athletic transportation manager \> Age: 52\> Education: Some college\> Family: Married\> Web site: No response \> E-mail: No response \> Why I'm running for office: I believe strongly in the Importance of Community involvemrnt and public service.\> Describe your education, training, and experience that qualify you for this position.

CCT do not have Sunday Bus service.\I plan to generate funds for Sunday Bus service without rising taxes.\> What, in your opinion, is the biggest budget challenge facing your area and how, if elected, would you propose to address it? Managing growth is the biggest issue District#2 are facing at this time issues such as water, sewer, jobs and infrastructure.\We must have a 5, 10, 20 year plan in place for managing growth.\Bob Ott\> Party: Republican\> Occupation: Airline pilot/instructor\> Age: 51\> Education: M.S., Systems Management, University of Southern California; B.A., Biology, Bucknell; science/math teacher\> Family: Wife, Judy, and two children, daughter, 10, and son, 8.\> Web site: www.bob4cobb.com\> E-mail: bob@bob4cobb.com\> Why I'm running for office: To provide uniform representation for the entire district, to improve community involvement in the decision-making process, to promote more comprehensive planning for better management of growth and redevelopment, and to offer new ideas for addressing issues such as transportation, water and green space conservation, and infrastructure \> Describe your education, training, and experience that qualify you for this position. I have provided leadership on zoning and land use matters as president of my homeowners association and of the East Cobb Civic Association. In 2004, I was appointed to the county Planning and Zoning Appeals boards, where I served until resigning earlier this year. My college education, military training and career as an airline pilot provide me with the knowledge and discipline to analyze and understand difficult situations, and develop well thought-out solutions. \> What will be your top priorities during your term of office and how will you pursue them? My first priority will be to re-engage the commissioner's office with the residents of the entire district to tackle the issues of transportation, traffic, water and green space conservation. In addition, as the economy revives, redevelopment will again become a critical issue for District 2. I will actively involve the community in the process of planning for the future so we can ensure the efficient, effective use of our financial and natural resources while maintaining quality of life. \> What, in your opinion, is the biggest budget challenge facing your area and how, if elected, would you propose to address it? For more than 40 years, Cobb County's increased budget needs have been met largely with revenue from growth. While Cobb has a reputation for good fiscal policy, the closer the county gets to build-out, the more critical it will be to find new and innovative ways to provide the services necessary for maintaining a high quality of life. We must not be afraid to think outside the box to make things happen.\Ron Sifen\> Party: Republican\> Occupation: Banking\> Age: 58\> Education: B.A., Washington University\> Family: Married, four children, one granddaughter on the way\> Web site: www.ronsifen.com\> E-mail: ron@ronsifen.com\> Why I'm running for office: Stop overdevelopment, reduce traffic congestion, protect water supply and green space, protect neighborhoods, protect taxpayers. Future development should not exceed the capacity of our roads, water supply, and other infrastructure. Policy details and proposals at www.ronsifen.com\> Describe your education, training, and experience that qualify you for this position. Many years of experience as neighborhood advocate. Past president Vinings Homeowners Association 5 years. As past President Cobb County Civic Coalition 3 years, I had extensive experience working on neighborhood issues throughout Cobb. Appointed to several county advisory committees, including Steering Committee for Cobb's 2030 Comprehensive Plan. Currently serve on Citizens Advisory Committee for ""Revive285,"" a GDOT project to improve traffic flow on I-285. Extensive experience on transportation projects.\> What will be your top priorities during your term of office and how will you pursue them? Stop overdevelopment, reduce traffic congestion, protect water supply, greenspace, protect neighborhoods, protect taxpayers. Past overdevelopment has filled our roads to near capacity. Continued overdevelopment will cause traffic to exceed the capacity of our roads. Costs of future infrastructure improvements necessitated by overdevelopment will fall on taxpayers, unless we begin now to implement policies to prevent future continued overdevelopment.\> What, in your opinion, is the biggest budget challenge facing your area and how, if elected, would you propose to address it? Meeting our future transportation needs will be a staggering challenge unless we stop the overdevelopment that is putting too much traffic on our roads. Also, we will not fix our transportation problems with ultra-expensive, un-vetted, unprioritized transportation wish lists. We need to identify and prioritize the most affordable and effective transportation projects, that will have the most impact on reducing traffic congestion, and focus on getting the high-priority transportation projects built. \Joe Thompson\> Party: Republican\> Occupation: Property management\> Age: 70\> Education: Bachelor's of science degree in Industrial Management, Georgia Tech\> Family: Wife Charlsie, four children, seven grandchildren\> Web site: commissionerjoethompson.com\> E-mail: joe@commissionerjoethompson.com\> Why I'm running for office: I am running for office to continue to provide quality services at the lowest cost to the taxpayer.\> Describe your education, training, and experience that qualify you for this position. After graduating from Georgia Tech, I served as Vice President and Department Head for a local financial institution for 10 years.\I represented most of District 2 in the State Senate for 12 years, serving on the Banking and Finance, Ways and Means, and Appropriations committees.\For the past 15 years, I have served as District 2 Commissioner, Cobb County has achieved a triple (AAA), triple (AAA) bond rating, which puts our county in the top 1% of all city and county governments in the United States.\> What will be your top priorities during your term of office and how will you pursue them? \Low Taxes: Cobb County has the lowest property taxes in the Metro Atlanta area. I will work to keep it that way.\Traffic: We can improve traffic a great deal by eliminating bottlenecks. The county is replacing the Johnson Ferry Road, Cobb Parkway, and Atlanta Road Bridges over the Chattachoochee River, and I will continue to support these projects.\Water: I will support the cooperative effort with other counties and the State of Georgia to supplement Lake Lanier by building another reservoir in North Georgia.\> What, in your opinion, is the biggest budget challenge facing your area and how, if elected, would you propose to address it? The biggest budget challenge facing Cobb County is the decline in real estate values. This decline will cause the Board of Tax Assessors to lower property assessments.\I would not support raising the millage rate. I would support making those necessary changes in the budget needed to provide a balanced budget.\Unopposed in primary\Sheriff, Cobb County, Gregory B.

Two children: Adam and Jessica\> Web site: www.dale08.com\> E-mail: www.dale@dale08.com\> Why I'm running for office: As a veteran investigative reporter with WSB, I've met thousands of Georgians from all over the state, Democrats, Independents and Republicans who all told me the same thing. They said ""Dale, just once, I'd like to have the chance to vote for an honest person, a truth teller, who won't be controlled by special interests. Someone who'll work for real people like me.""\I'm running to give Georgians the chance to do just that.\> Our country is facing significant issues with rising food and energy costs. What would you propose to address these issues? Most elected officials no longer work for us. They work for special interests that fund their campaigns then control their votes. \I am the only leading Senate candidate who's refusing the special interest ""PAC"" money that's stolen your government and keeps your voice from being heard.\I will oppose big oil, promote energy alternatives and help convert Georgia pine to cellulosic ethanol to combat the ridiculous price of gasoline. Driving down the cost of fuel is the key to making food more affordable for the hard working people of Georgia.\> Party and philosophical differences have resulted in budget and policy deadlock in the past. If elected, how will you specifically work with colleagues to achieve results on the tough issues? TV shows distract us with circus-like debates between the ""R's and the ""D's"". Truth is, the prime source of gridlock is the ""P,"" or ""PAC"" money system. We can't fix health care, secure our borders, free ourselves from foreign oil or heal our economy because the giant special interests that control politicians won't allow those reforms to take place. I agree with Barack Obama. The moment we break the stranglehold lobbyists and special interests have on Washington, we WILL be able to move forward on the common sense reforms Americans support.\> What experience to set policy for our country do you bring to the job? For 23 years I've gone behind the lines of power and government to uncover and report the truth. Together we've fought countless battles and share the scars. But that's not enough. The Senate requires integrity, the ability to listen to all sides, an old-fashioned work ethic and the courage to lead. Angie Cardwell, the love of my life, mother of our 2 kids, hospice nurse and my wife for 22 years, will tell you this: my only motive in this effort is to give you what you truly deserve; the chance for clean, transparent and honest government.\Vernon Jones\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Chief Executive Officer, Dekalb County\> Age: 47\> Education: BA, Business Admin., North Carolina Central Univ.; graduate, Harvard JFK School of Government Exec. Prog.\> Family: No response \> Web site: www.vernonjonesforgeorgia.com/home.html\> E-mail: vernon@vernonjonesforgeorgia.com\> Why I'm running for office: As a former Georgia Legislator and now as CEO of Dekalb County I have crucial experience in writing the law and running a large metropolitan government. I am actively involved in creating jobs, balancing budgets, improving infrastructure, providing homeland security, maintaining low taxes and setting public policy. I have had to provide local solutions to national problems and am in touch with the concerns and issues that everyday Americans are experiencing.\> Our country is facing significant issues with rising food and energy costs. What would you propose to address these issues? Food price increases are tied to fuel costs increases. Fuel costs increase because of our dependence on foreign oil and reliance on a singular source of energy. We should pursue mandates on the automobile industry that require the production of vehicles that get more miles per gallon. We need to think about energy independence and pursue solar, wind and biofuel as alternative energy sources. As we invest in this technology we invest our people and economy. In turn energy diversity we will create jobs, and boost our economy.\> Party and philosophical differences have resulted in budget and policy deadlock in the past. If elected, how will you specifically work with colleagues to achieve results on the tough issues? It is important regardless of party affiliation for elected officials to work across the aisle for the benefit of our citizens. As a Chief Executive Officer of Dekalb County, when we dispatch our public service, conduct infrastructure improvements, build parks and create jobs we do not ask for party affiliation. Our job as elected officials is to provide solutions for the citizens of this country. I believe that bipartisanship is the best dose of medicine for Washington right now. \> What experience to set policy for our country do you bring to the job? I was responsible for introducing, passing laws and setting public policy for over 16 years as a State legislator and as CEO for DeKalb County. I bring the experience of both local and state policy setting to the US Senate. As a law maker I think about what is good for the people, democrat or republican. The state of Georgia deserves a US Senator committed to action and positive change. It's about getting things done.\Rand Knight\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Businessman/ecologist\> Age: 36\> Education: Ph.D, Ecosystems Analysis, M.S. Ecology/Forestry, B.A. Environmental Studies\> Family: Wife Linda; two children, Ellie Lu (3) and Thomas (1).\> Web site: www.knightforsenate.com\> E-mail: info@knightforsenate.com\> Why I'm running for office: The economy, healthcare system and environment of Georgia and our country have changed for the worse; it's time for a new direction. Georgians' needs are not being met, but I am ready to listen. Finally, I have the energy and the fresh perspective to go to Washington, D.C. and get things done.\> Our country is facing significant issues with rising food and energy costs. What would you propose to address these issues? A cornerstone of my campaign, the ""Green Deal,"" would create hundreds of thousands of jobs, and reduce energy costs and pollution while increasing energy efficiency and independence. I will support a Strategic Energy Fund that sponsors the research, development and deployment of renewable energy, energy efficiency and biofuels. Additionally, with a new, clean, cost-efficient infrastructure, food prices will decrease, as it will cost less to process and transport food to its final destination.\> Party and philosophical differences have resulted in budget and policy deadlock in the past. If elected, how will you specifically work with colleagues to achieve results on the tough issues? Like many Georgians and Americans, I am frustrated by the constant bickering and divisive fighting in Washington, D.C. Politicians seem more interested in choosing sides than solving problems for their constituents. I draw inspiration from former Georgia senator, Sam Nunn, who reached across party lines and focused on making Georgia and America stronger. I aim to promote a real change that involves dialogue - not bickering - and that always keeps the American people's interests at heart. \> What experience to set policy for our country do you bring to the job? In my years as a businessman in technology and consulting, I have developed a skill for diagnosing difficult problems and proposing innovative solutions. My background in science and ecology gives me \a key understanding of our energy crisis and how to solve it. Listening thoughtfully to all sides of an issue allows me to truly grasp a problem, craft a solution, and understand how to implement it. I am ready to use my expertise and problem-solving experience in the service of my home state.\Josh Lanier\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Former Senate staff member, retired businessman and writer.\> Age: 55\> Education: Attended Georgia Southern University\> Family: Married to Lynne 30 years, father of Heather, Brooke, Josh and Robert.\> Web site: www.JoshLanier.com\> E-mail: josh@joshlanier.com\> Why I'm running for office: I am standing for election to the U.S. Senate to retore our most basic right of a fair and free election by setting the example of a clean campaign, promoting public funding for and reform of elections, and to represent the voice of all Georgians.\> Our country is facing significant issues with rising food and energy costs. What would you propose to address these issues? The two issues are directly related. Food cost inflation is driven by spiraling energy costs that are rooted in a weak dollar and our addiction to oil, exacerbated by our current mandates for corn ethanol. Every American feels this inflation, whether in the cost of milk or even pizza, and its impact is worldwide and dangerous. America and the world need a visionary energy policy based on a combination of existing, new and sustainable technologies.\> Party and philosophical differences have resulted in budget and policy deadlock in the past. If elected, how will you specifically work with colleagues to achieve results on the tough issues? The deadlock that continues to this day has been caused less by party or philosophical differences and more by special interests and the money they bring to campaigns. There is a reason we don't have universal health care or a visionary energy policy or an answer to the foreclosure crisis. That reason is money and special interests. When we have public financing of elections, we will have more legislators free to work together for the benefit of the country.\> What experience to set policy for our country do you bring to the job? I have served my country for 38 years. I enlisted in the Army on my 18th birthday, served in Viet Nam, as a staff member in both the U.S. Senate and House, as a non-profit CEO and was later co-founder of an environmental company. I have visited with leaders throughout the United States and in over 40 countries. I have more years of experience working in and with the United States Senate than all the other candidates combined. These are the life experiences I would bring to the United States Senate.\Jim Martin\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Attorney\> Age: 62\> Education: University of Georgia, A.B.; J.D.; LL.M. Georgia State University, M.B.A . \> Family: Wife Joan, four children, three grandchildren. \> Web site: www.martinforsenate.com\> E-mail: jim@martinforsenate.com\> Why I'm running for office: President Bush and Saxby Chambliss have lost touch with what's going in Iraq and here at home. Something's wrong when we're spending $50 billion a month in Iraq while the price of gas and groceries keep rising for American families. It's time to start doing more to help the middle class.\> Our country is facing significant issues with rising food and energy costs. What would you propose to address these issues? The Bush Administration's economic policies have been disastrous for American families. The cost of living is skyrocketing while incomes are stagnating. Now, more than ever, middle class Americans need to keep more of what they earn. \To lower energy prices, we need to encourage development of alternative fuels, require oil companies to invest some of their record profits into new clean refineries to increase supply, and find ways to encourage conservation - particularly when it comes to transportation. \> Party and philosophical differences have resulted in budget and policy deadlock in the past. If elected, how will you specifically work with colleagues to achieve results on the tough issues? In the State Legislature, I developed a reputation for bipartisanship. I was frequently able to bring members of both parties together, help them resolve their differences, and get important legislation passed. \We need this kind of approach in Washington again. We need an independent-minded Senator who can stand up to his own party and president when they're wrong, if necessary, and someone who can find common ground with those who have different viewpoints.\> What experience to set policy for our country do you bring to the job? In my 35 years of public service, I have a strong record of accomplishment for middle class Georgia families. I served for nearly two decades in the Georgia House of Representatives, where I worked on issues like health care and consumer protection. I was also a leader in the effort to create PeachCare, the program that provides health care to thousands of Georgia's children. I later led the Department of Human Resources under both Democratic and Republican governors.\U.S. House, Georgia District 13\Donzella James\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Retired federal employee\> Age: 59 \> Education: Morris Brown College, Atlanta School of Art\> Family: Married for 39 years to Elmo James. 2 sons (1 deceased) and 2 grandchildren \> Web site: donzellajames4congress.com\> E-mail: dzella@bellsouth.net\> Why I'm running for office: The citizens of the 13th district asked me to run because they want a representative that actually resides within the district and who is directly affected by the decisions made on all levels of government within the district. They said that they wanted someone who is accessible, hard working and willing to serve with integrity and honesty. Also, the voters indicated that their concerns were not being articulated and their needs were not being met.\> Georgia's economy is suffering along with much of the nation. What specific proposals will you advocate to bring jobs to Georgia and help grow our state's economy? I will focus on Georgia's unique renewable resources and work to attract the alternative fuels industry to Georgia by working through the Georgia Department of Economic Development and the Georgia Department of Technical and Adult education for 'green jobs' training as described in Title X of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 to create a 'green jobs' corridor throughout the State and leverage the professional research, resources and personnel found throughout our great State. \> What do you see as the role of the Federal Government in protecting Georgia's environment, especially in terms of air and water quality? It is the job of the federal government to create a minimum standard but we should not rely on Washington to maintain air and water quality in Georgia. That is the job of Georgia's citizenry and officials. I advocate 'waste to energy' campaigns to reduce the amount of renewable energy resources that end up in Georgia landfills and working with the EPA to reduce diesel emissions from State fleet vehicles which will go a long way in enhancing overall health in our State.\David Scott\> Party: Democratic\(No other information for this candidate was received by publication deadline)\Georgia House, District 20\Charlice Byrd\> Party: Republican\> Occupation: Homemaker\> Age: 56\> Education: B.A., Elementary Education\> Family: Husband, Michael\> Web site: byrdforhouse.com\> E-mail: byrdforhouse@gmail.com\> Why I'm running for office: Because I represent the conservative values of Cherokee County -- less government, lower taxes, personal responsibilty and liberty and justice for all. I believe in the power of ""we the people"" and their inherent goodness, and the values they believe in. \> What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see? I believe it is time for Georgia to take the lead on the fair tax.\> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? Government accountability. I will continue to work on the Government Accountability Act to sunset departments, agencies, authorities and commissions. Under this proposal, the sunset committee would review and recommend changes to the mission, a merger with other departments or agencies, a total repeal of the entity or a refocus of responsibilities. This is a much needed mechanism for a relatively transparent and regular evaluation of state government's operations.\Shawn T. O'Rourke\> Party: Republican\> Occupation: Businessman\> Age: 36\> Education: B.S., Economics; M.B.A.\> Family: Wife Denise; Son Shawn Jr, 11; Daughters Kennady, 8, and Karrington, 8\> Web site: www.ShawnORourkeSR.com\> E-mail: shawn@shawnorourkesr.com\> Why I'm running for office: All of my adult life, I have excercised my passion for leadership and service. I maintain a core belief that those who are blessed with the opportunity to give back to their community have an obligation to do so. I believe it is time to restore strong and honorable leadership to the 20th District.\> What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see? During the 2008 legislative session, nine separate tax reform plans were proposed. It will require a collaborative effort to develop a comprehensive plan that effectively captures the best components of each idea to build a consensus. I support icnreased local control of our government that returns our tax dollars directly back to our communities from where they were derived.\> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? While Georgia provides an enviable environment to live and work and remains a growing and thriving state, our weaknesses in transportation and education must be addressed with comprehensive long-term solutions. I am a firm believer that solutions are found by soliciting input from the experts in the field and then providing the resources to enable them to implement these solutions.\Georgia House, District 22\Sean Jerguson\> Party: Republican\> Occupation: Business Owner\> Age: 36\> Education: B.S., Kennesaw State College;\M.P.A. Kennesaw State University\> Family: Wife Kate,\Children Claire and Eli\> Web site: www.electsean.com\> E-mail: sean@electsean.com\> Why I'm running for office: To provide conservative leadership through service so our community continues to be an excellent place to live and raise a family. \> What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see? I would like to see our state move to a Fair Tax system. This would include eliminating the current state tax code, replacing it with a consumption tax on goods and services.\> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? My top priority is to promote and implement a regional approach to transportation. I will do two things to achieve this goal. First, I will work closely with existing agencies and commissions to have them refocus their efforts along these lines. Second, I will support and sponsor legislation that enables local governments to identify transportation needs and implement solutions.\Mary Elizabeth Wilhite\> Party: Republican\> Occupation: Director of Faith Center for Community Development\> Age: 49\> Education: B.S., Howard University, Washington, DC.\> Family: Marvin Wilhite, married 23 years\> Web site: www.votemary.us\> E-mail: mary@votemary.us\> Why I'm running for office: Because I am not a politician, I am a public servant,. I have the ability to listen and respond to the needs of all constituents and provide a principle new voice at the State Capitol. I believe strongly that I can truly make a difference for the community I call home. Key Issues that the district face are traffic and transportation, managing growth, local control of education, keeping taxes low and supporting families. \> What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see? I support the National Fair Tax and other tax policies that simplify taxes and reduce the number of bureaucrats needed to administer tax policy. Congressmen John Linder, the author of the Fair Tax, has endorsed my campaign. I believe the district 22 incumbent's approach of shifting tax burdens and using tax gimmicks are simply election year politics. In general, lower taxes for both individuals and businesses would encourage our economy to grow. Tax policy should be fair and not penalize people who work hard and save for their future.\> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? Traffic, education, and taxes would be my top priorities. I support road expansion where appropriate, additional road construction, and incentives for businesses that offer telecommuting. Educational standards and expectations should be set higher statewide, with successful school districts given more control over resources and personnel Tax policy should be simple and fair, and taxes cut or eliminated where possible, which would help our economy grow.\Georgia House, District 33\Michael Smith\> Party: Democratic\(No other information for this candidate was received by publication deadline)\Don Wix\> Party: Democratic\(No other information for this candidate was received by publication deadline)\Georgia House, District 36\Tammy Bailey Rohner \> Party: Republican (No other information for this candidate was received by publication deadline)\Earl Ehrhart \> Party: Republican (No other information for this candidate was received by publication deadline)\Public Service Commissioner, Dist. 1 Southern\Rick Collum\> Party: Republican\> Occupation: Attorney and magistrate judge\> Age: 38\> Education: Juris Doctorate; B.A. in Sociology\B.S. in Criminal Justice\> Family: Wife of 15 years Donna Collum; two children 9 and 7\> Web site: No response \> E-mail: rickcollum2000@yahoo.com\> Why I'm running for office: I am running for the Georgia Public Service Commission in order to serve the people of Georgia by helping to facilitate safe and affordable energy by combining traditional sources of energy such as natural gas and nuclear power with renewable energy sources such as solar, wind and landfill gas.

Monthly payments for electric, natural gas, and phone are taking ever increasing scarce cash. \America has always positively responded to scarcity with technology. As a professional engineer and DOD supervisor, I am trained in technical problems experienced by our utilities. Encouraging competition without collusion, and wringing excess from the production system will better our utility rates and supply.\> In your opinion, what, if any changes are needed in Georgia's energy policy? While we don't experience roving brownouts like California, or sky-high energy prices, we can do more.\We can set cash incentives for conservation measures, including weatherization/insulation, digital thermostats, high efficiency furnaces, water heaters and air conditioners. We can encourage cooling ponds for several antiquated coal power plants that drain water mercilessly from our dwindling lakes. We can lower rates by encouraging new technology, not blind reliance on fossil fuel.\> How would you work to fix inefficiencies and divisions within the five member commission? The PSC ensures that Georgians pay the lowest rates for their utility services, while maintaining viable suppliers. All commissioners must be on the same page with this mandate. Except for personnel matters, meetings must be open to the public, including rights of all parties to speak. No more 'good ole boy' politics. Every area the PSC governs: electric, gas, phone, common carriers, to have two commissioners concerned full-time with that area, reporting biweekly to the others.\> Describe the education and experience that qualify you for this position. I am a Registered Professional Engineer for 25 years in 3 states, including 20 years in Georgia. Former Department of Defense positions include Chief of Power/Lighting, and Chief of Process Engineering.\My education includes a BScElecEngin, an MScMechEngin (GA Tech), an MScPhysics (GA Tech), and an executive MBA.\The PSC is concerned with such technical topics as underground piping infrastructure and complex power generation schemes. We need an engineer looking out for Georgian's interests.\> Commodity prices for energy are rising dramatically. What role should the PSC play in mitigating these increases? If we rely exclusively on fossil fuels, we are at the mercy of OPEC and the energy barons. In the long run, we must develop alternative sources, including increased nuclear, solar, and wind power. In the short run, we must encourage conservation measures, including proper insulation/weatherization, high efficiency air conditions, furnaces, and water heaters. Cash incentives for conversion, costly in the short run, pays rich dividends both to families and to our secure energy infrastructure.\Jim Powell\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Independent energy consultant to states, local governments and industry.\> Age: 59\> Education: B.B.A., M.B.A., University of North Florida. Federal Executive Institute.\> Family: Married to Karen for 37 years, 2 great sons and daughters-in-law, 2 adorable granddaughters\> Web site: jimpowellforgapsc.com\> E-mail: jimpowellforgapsc@gmail.com\> Why I'm running for office: It is my intent to be the consumer advocate and to keep consumers' interests a top priority while also understanding that the investor owned utilities are in business to make a profit for their shareholders. I have worked with State PSCs across the country in efforts to implement energy efficiency practices, increasing use of renewable energy and promoting conservation. I have served our Nation for over 35 years and being elected to the PSC is the next chapter in my public service career.\> In your opinion, what, if any changes are needed in Georgia's energy policy? Georgia does not have a comprehensive State Energy Policy that addresses all aspects of energy supply and demand. The Georgia Environmental Facilities Authority published the State Energy Strategy in December 2007 which was developed in a collaborative manner with extensive stakeholder input. The Governor's Energy Challenge 2020 and Conserve Georgia are both efforts at efficiency and conservation. These two initiatives, along with State Energy Strategy should be used as the basic framework to develop a comprehensive State Energy Policy.\> How would you work to fix inefficiencies and divisions within the five member commission? One of my strongest attributes is the ability to bring people together who possess different perspectives and get them to reach a consensus. During my 35 year career, I worked for 7 different Presidential administrations. I was able to work with the political and career leadership towards common goals. I plan on using this experience to work in partnership with my fellow Commissioners to advance the mission of the PSC and thereby ensure that the citizens of Georgia get a fair deal for the utility services they purchase. \> Describe the education and experience that qualify you for this position. I am the most experienced PSC candidate in years. I was a Senior Executive with the U.S. Department of Energy and have more than 20 years experience in developing and implementing energy policies and energy program management. I have significant experience at the regional and national level promoting renewable energy technology programs (i.e., solar, biomass), energy efficiency technologies and practices and conservation (i.e., Energy Star, Weatherization Assistance Program). My undergraduate degree is in Accounting and I have a MBA.\> Commodity prices for energy are rising dramatically. What role should the PSC play in mitigating these increases? Georgia relies primarily on coal to generate electricity. I plan to interest the State's utilities in diversifying the fuel sources for electricity so that price volatility for a particular fuel will not impact ratepayers severely. Focusing more on using renewable energy sources produced in Georgia creates jobs and keeps dollars in the State's economy. Georgia needs to pay more attention to energy efficiency. Reducing demand and mitigating the rising price of energy resources can best be achieved through energy efficiency and conservation.\Pam Davidson\> Party: Republican\> Occupation: Renewable energy consultant\> Age: 45\> Education: B.S. Organizational Behavior University of San Francisco\> Family: One daughter age 14, two dogs, one cat, one horse\> Web site: pamdavidson.org\> E-mail: pamdavidson@tds.net\> Why I'm running for office: I am seeking the position because I am very concerned about our ability to provide clean, affordable energy in the state. \> In your opinion, what, if any changes are needed in Georgia's energy policy? We need to our maximize our energy efficiency and renewable energy potential. We have made very little ground in either area. If elected,I will ask that the Demand Side Management Group review and improve upon thier recommendations to the PSC and set forth a resolution to create a Renewable Energy Working group to develop immediate and significant goals for affordable renewable energy. \We need to evaluate our energy resources in light of water resources and air quality. \> How would you work to fix inefficiencies and divisions within the five member commission? Regarding divisiveness: I would encourage and employ an attitude of mutual respect. I would make every effort to listen and understand all parties and conduct myself with dignity and selflessness. \Regarding inefficiencies: I would encourage a culture of positive, future-oriented leadership in which the PSC is not a reactionary body (simply hearing and reacting to the entities we regulate)but acts confidently towards meeting established goals. \> Describe the education and experience that qualify you for this position. As an renewable energy advocate, I have had the priviledge of earning the respect of lawmakers and policy experts. Hence, I can 'hit the ground running' in order to facilitate comprehensive energy policy reform. I work well with both the environmental and business community. Recent evidence of this is the successful passsage of HB 670 (the state's first comprehensive energy efficiency and renewable energy bill) which was recently signed by the Governor. I initiated this bill in order to incentivize progressive changes in energy policy. \> Commodity prices for energy are rising dramatically. What role should the PSC play in mitigating these increases?\Firstly, we need to reduce our per capita energy usage. Less demand means less fuel. \Secondly, we need to quickly develop renewable energy resources so that we are not dependent on global fuel prices. Our greatest resource for affordable renewable energy is biomass. We can provide both electricity and biofuels (such as synthetic diesel) as a 'value add') from such facilities. \Lauren W.

85,"Voters in the July 15 primaries can choose among six candidates for two spots on the Georgia Public Service Commission. Two Democrats and two Republicans are vying for the vacant District 4 seat, and the District 1 incumbent faces one challenger.\Commissioners are elected statewide and serve six-year terms. They make $116,452 a year.\Opponents will square off today at Georgia Public Broadcasting's headquarters as part of 10 state primary debates sponsored by the Atlanta Press Club. All are open to the public. The PSC debates will be streamed live at gpb.com.\Here's a rundown of the candidates as well as their responses to what they think about Georgia's energy future.\PRIMER ON LOW-PROFILE AGENCY\What is the PSC?\A five-member panel that oversees electric and natural gas utilities as well as the telephone companies and some transportation companies that operate in Georgia. Those firms include Georgia Power, AGL Resources and AT&T.\What does it do?\Sets rates that customers pay on their monthly utility bills, with some exceptions. Natural gas marketers' prices do not require approval but may be investigated for fairness. Also, certain telecom services such as cable television, high-speed Internet and cellphone rates are not regulated by the PSC. When determining rates, commissioners are supposed to weigh fairness to consumers and companies' return on investment.\Upcoming major decisions\A vote next year on Georgia Power's request to build two additional nuclear reactors at Plant Vogtle, and a decision in 2010 on Atlanta Gas Light's anticipated rate hike request.\PSC DISTRICT 1\Republican primary\Rick Collum \Age: 38\Home: Moultrie\Occupation: Attorney\""We have to use all of the means that are feasible but that work for the environment. We have to use what we have that is financially feasible. Biomass [wood chips, chicken feed and other agricultural by-products] does a great deal for everyone, including the farmers of South Georgia. Biomass is not going to be able to sustain our energy needs, but it can optimize energy up to 10 percent.""\Doug Everett (Incumbent)\Age: 70\Home: Albany\""Coal is a good fuel, in my opinion. However the carbon footprint is much greater on it than anything else, and the cost is going sky high. With the new technologies coming out everyday on coal, it's getting cleaner. I'm trying to be pro-nuclear. It is the cleanest, the safest, the cheapest and the most reliable form of electricity that we have.""\Democratic primary\No candidates\PSC DISTRICT 4\Republican primary\Pam Davidson \Age: 44\Home: Blue Ridge\Occupation: Renewable-energy consultant \""I am very concerned about the cost of energy going up very soon. We have to implement some demand-side management [more efficient production]. It's as simple as that.""\Lauren McDonald Jr. \Age: 69\Home: Clarkesville\Occupation: Businessman and former Public Service commissioner\""I am very pro-nuclear. We've got to get that started. It's the cleanest energy source that we have that's affordable and operational in our state. I am appreciative of renewables whether it's wind or biofuel or solar, but we are not in an area that suggests that they are reliable. And the cost for what you look at per kilowatt basis, they are not competitive.""\Democratic primary\Bob Indech \Age: 53\Home: Norcross\Occupation: Engineer\""We have to try and promote some alternative energies, primarily wind power. It is a very good source for Georgia, particularly in the south where it's windy. I don't see any good long-term plans, any good long-term movements to actually ameliorate our fossil-fuel dependence.""\Jim Powell \Age: 59\Home: Hiawassee\Occupation: Retired from the U.S. Department of Energy's Atlanta regional office.\""I honestly believe that all of the fuel options should be on the table. I'm an advocate for renewables --- that's kind of what I did for a living. There's an opportunity to put more renewables into the mix as well as energy efficiency.""\CAPTION:\CAPTION:\CAPTION:\CAPTION:\CAPTION:\CAPTION:\Credit: STAFF"

The League has collected, compiled and coordinated all candidate information for this Guide. Responses are published exactly as they were submitted by the candidates, although some questions were deleted in print for lack of space (full responses are online).

Two children: Adam and Jessica\> Web site: www.dale08.com\> E-mail: www.dale@dale08.com\> Why I'm running for office: As a veteran investigative reporter with WSB, I've met thousands of Georgians from all over the state, Democrats, independents and Republicans who all told me the same thing. They said: ""Dale, just once, I'd like to have the chance to vote for an honest person, a truth teller, who won't be controlled by special interests. Someone who'll work for real people like me.""\I'm running to give Georgians the chance to do just that.\> Our country is facing significant issues with rising food and energy costs. What would you propose to address these issues? Most elected officials no longer work for us. They work for special interests that fund their campaigns, then control their votes. \I am the only leading Senate candidate who's refusing the special interest PAC money that's stolen your government and keeps your voice from being heard.\I will oppose Big Oil, promote energy alternatives and help convert Georgia pine to cellulosic ethanol to combat the ridiculous price of gasoline. Driving down the cost of fuel is the key to making food more affordable for the hardworking people of Georgia.\> Party and philosophical differences have resulted in budget and policy deadlock in the past. If elected, how will you specifically work with colleagues to achieve results on the tough issues? TV shows distract us with circuslike debates between the ""R's"" and the ""D's"". Truth is, the prime source of gridlock is the ""P,"" or ""PAC"" money system. We can't fix health care, secure our borders, free ourselves from foreign oil or heal our economy because the giant special interests that control politicians won't allow those reforms to take place. I agree with Barack Obama: The moment we break the stranglehold lobbyists and special interests have on Washington, we WILL be able to move forward on the common-sense reforms Americans support.\> What experience to set policy for our country do you bring to the job? For 23 years I've gone behind the lines of power and government to uncover and report the truth. Together we've fought countless battles and share the scars. But that's not enough. The Senate requires integrity, the ability to listen to all sides, an old-fashioned work ethic and the courage to lead. Angie Cardwell, the love of my life, mother of our two kids, hospice nurse and my wife for 22 years, will tell you this: My only motive in this effort is to give you what you truly deserve, the chance for clean, transparent and honest government. \Vernon Jones\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Chief executive officer, DeKalb County\> Age: 47\> Education: Bachelor of Arts, business administration,North Carolina Central Univ.; \graduate --- Harvard JFK School of Government Executive Program.\> Family: No response\> Web site: www.vernonjonesforgeorgia.com/home.html\> E-mail: vernon@vernonjonesforgeorgia.com\> Why I'm running for office: As a former Georgia legislator and now as CEO of DeKalb County, I have crucial experience in writing the law and running a large metropolitan government. I am actively involved in creating jobs, balancing budgets, improving infrastructure, providing homeland security, maintaining low taxes and setting public policy. I have had to provide local solutions to national problems and am in touch with the concerns and issues that everyday Americans are experiencing.\> Our country is facing significant issues with rising food and energy costs. What would you propose to address these issues? Food price increases are tied to fuel costs increases. Fuel costs increase because of our dependence on foreign oil and reliance on a singular source of energy. We should pursue mandates on the automobile industry that require the production of vehicles that get more miles per gallon. We need to think about energy independence and pursue solar, wind and biofuel as alternative energy sources. As we invest in this technology we invest our people and economy. In turn, energy diversity we will create jobs and boost our economy.\> Party and philosophical differences have resulted in budget and policy deadlock in the past. If elected, how will you specifically work with colleagues to achieve results on the tough issues? It is important regardless of party affiliation for elected officials to work across the aisle for the benefit of our citizens. As a chief executive officer of DeKalb County, when we dispatch our public service, conduct infrastructure improvements, build parks and create jobs, we do not ask for party affiliation. Our job as elected officials is to provide solutions for the citizens of this country. I believe that bipartisanship is the best dose of medicine for Washington right now. \> What experience to set policy for our country do you bring to the job? I was responsible for introducing, passing laws and setting public policy for over 16 years as a state legislator and as CEO for DeKalb County. I bring the experience of both local and state policy setting to the U.S. Senate. As a lawmaker, I think about what is good for the people, Democrat or Republican. The state of Georgia deserves a U.S. senator committed to action and positive change. It's about getting things done.\Rand Knight\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Businessman/ecologist\> Age: 36\> Education: Doctorate, ecosystems analysis; Masters of Science, ecology/forestry: Bachelor of Arts, environmental studies\> Family: Wife, Linda; two children, Ellie Lu (3) and Thomas (1).\> Web site: www.knightforsenate.com\> E-mail: info@knightforsenate.com\> Why I'm running for office: The economy, health care system and environment of Georgia and our country have changed for the worse; it's time for a new direction. Georgians' needs are not being met, but I am ready to listen. Finally, I have the energy and the fresh perspective to go to Washington, D.C., and get things done.\> Our country is facing significant issues with rising food and energy costs. What would you propose to address these issues? A cornerstone of my campaign, the ""Green Deal,"" would create hundreds of thousands of jobs and reduce energy costs and pollution while increasing energy efficiency and independence. I will support a Strategic Energy Fund that sponsors the research, development and deployment of renewable energy, energy efficiency and biofuels. Additionally, with a new, clean, cost-efficient infrastructure, food prices will decrease, as it will cost less to process and transport food to its final destination.\> Party and philosophical differences have resulted in budget and policy deadlock in the past. If elected, how will you specifically work with colleagues to achieve results on the tough issues? Like many Georgians and Americans, I am frustrated by the constant bickering and divisive fighting in Washington, D.C. Politicians seem more interested in choosing sides than solving problems for their constituents. I draw inspiration from former Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn, who reached across party lines and focused on making Georgia and America stronger. I aim to promote a real change that involves dialogue --- not bickering --- and that always keeps the American people's interests at heart. \> What experience to set policy for our country do you bring to the job? In my years as a businessman in technology and consulting, I have developed a skill for diagnosing difficult problems and proposing innovative solutions. My background in science and ecology gives me a key understanding of our energy crisis and how to solve it. Listening thoughtfully to all sides of an issue allows me to truly grasp a problem, craft a solution and understand how to implement it. I am ready to use my expertise and problem-solving experience in the service of my home state.\Josh Lanier\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Former Senate staff member, retired businessman and writer.\> Age: 55\> Education: Attended Georgia Southern University\> Family: Married to Lynne 30 years; four children, Heather, Brooke, Josh and Robert.\> Web site: www.JoshLanier.com\> E-mail: josh@joshlanier.com\> Why I'm running for office: I am standing for election to the U.S. Senate to retore our most basic right of a fair and free election by setting the example of a clean campaign, promoting public funding for and reform of elections, and to represent the voice of all Georgians.\> Our country is facing significant issues with rising food and energy costs. What would you propose to address these issues? The two issues are directly related. Food cost inflation is driven by spiraling energy costs that are rooted in a weak dollar and our addiction to oil, exacerbated by our current mandates for corn ethanol. Every American feels this inflation, whether in the cost of milk or even pizza, and its impact is worldwide and dangerous. America and the world need a visionary energy policy based on a combination of existing, new and sustainable technologies.\> Party and philosophical differences have resulted in budget and policy deadlock in the past. If elected, how will you specifically work with colleagues to achieve results on the tough issues? The deadlock that continues to this day has been caused less by party or philosophical differences and more by special interests and the money they bring to campaigns. There is a reason we don't have universal health care or a visionary energy policy or an answer to the foreclosure crisis. That reason is money and special interests. When we have public financing of elections, we will have more legislators free to work together for the benefit of the country.\> What experience to set policy for our country do you bring to the job? I have served my country for 38 years. I enlisted in the Army on my 18th birthday, served in Vietnam, as a staff member in both the U.S. Senate and House, as a nonprofit CEO and was later co-founder of an environmental company. I have visited with leaders throughout the United States and in over 40 countries. I have more years of experience working in and with the United States Senate than all the other candidates combined. These are the life experiences I would bring to the United States Senate.\Jim Martin\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Attorney\> Age: 62\> Education: University of Georgia, A.B.; J.D.; LL.M. Georgia State Univ., M.B.A . \> Family: Wife Joan, four children, and three grandchildren. \> Web site: www.martinforsenate.com\> E-mail: jim@martinforsenate.com\> Why I'm running for office: President Bush and Saxby Chambliss have lost touch with what's going on in Iraq and here at home. Something's wrong when we're spending $50 billion a month in Iraq while the price of gas and groceries keep rising for American families. It's time to start doing more to help the middle class.\> Our country is facing significant issues with rising food and energy costs. What would you propose to address these issues? The Bush administration's economic policies have been disastrous for American families. The cost of living is skyrocketing while incomes are stagnating. Now, more than ever, middle-class Americans need to keep more of what they earn. To lower energy prices, we need to encourage development of alternative fuels, require oil companies to invest some of their record profits into new clean refineries to increase supply, and find ways to encourage conservation --- particularly when it comes to transportation. \> Party and philosophical differences have resulted in budget and policy deadlock in the past. If elected, how will you specifically work with colleagues to achieve results on the tough issues? In the state Legislature, I developed a reputation for bipartisanship. I was frequently able to bring members of both parties together, help them resolve their differences, and get important legislation passed. We need this kind of approach in Washington again. We need an independent-minded senator who can stand up to his own party and president when they're wrong, if necessary, and someone who can find common ground with those who have different viewpoints.\> What experience to set policy for our country do you bring to the job? In my 35 years of public service, I have a strong record of accomplishment for middle-class Georgia families. I served for nearly two decades in the Georgia House of Representatives, where I worked on issues like health care and consumer protection. I was also a leader in the effort to create PeachCare, the program that provides health care to thousands of Georgia's children. I later led the Department of Human Resources under both Democratic and Republican governors.\U.S. House, Georgia District 13\Donzella James\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Retired federal employee\> Age: 59 \> Education: Morris Brown College and Atlanta School of Art\> Family: Married for 39 years to Elmo James. Two sons, (one deceased), and two grandchildren \> Web site: donzellajames4congress.com\> E-mail: dzella@bellsouth.net\> Why I'm running for office: The citizens of the 13th District asked me to run because they want a representative that actually resides within the district and who is directly affected by the decisions made on all levels of government within the district. They said that they wanted someone who is accessible, hardworking and willing to serve with integrity and honesty. Also, the voters indicated that their concerns were not being articulated and their needs were not being met.\> Georgia's economy is suffering along with much of the nation. What specific proposals will you advocate to bring jobs to Georgia and help grow our state's economy? I will focus on Georgia's unique renewable resources and work to attract the alternative fuels industry to Georgia by working through the Georgia Department of Economic Development and the Georgia Department of Technical and Adult Education for ""green jobs"" training as described in Title X of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 to create a ""green jobs"" corridor throughout the state and leverage the professional research, resources and personnel found throughout our great state.\> What measures would you recommend to control the influence of large campaign contributions over Congress? Campaign spending has become a multibillion-dollar business each election year. We must revisit and strengthen the Transparency and Accountability Act of 2006 focusing on leveling the playing field for all candidates. More oversight on campaign disclosures and ethics is needed to end compaign corruption. \> What do you see as the role of the federal government in protecting Georgia's environment, especially in terms of air and water quality? It is the job of the federal government to create a minimum standard but we should not rely on Washington to maintain air and water quality in Georgia. That is the job of Georgia's citizenry and officials. I advocate 'waste to energy' campaigns to reduce the amount of renewable energy resources that end up in Georgia landfills and working with the EPA to reduce diesel emissions from State fleet vehicles which will go a long way in enhancing overall health in our State.\David Scott\> Party: Democratic\(No other information for this candidate was received by publication deadline)\Georgia Senate, District 6\William D.

Between corruption, incompetence, and ulterior motives possessed by management, many of are schools are dysfunctional. With 20 years in the corporate world and now 15 years in the front lines of education, I see very clearly what the problems are and the answers for most.\When I entered the GA schools in 1958 we were 48th and now 50 years later we are still 48th.\GA doesn't have to accept this and frankly had better speak up or we will be 50th. \> The 2008 General Assembly has received significant criticism for failing to resolve critical issues of the state. If elected, what will you do to ensure better success in 2009 and future legislative sessions? Recently the AJC discussed the cozy relationship between the Bankers and legislation. A similar relationship also exists with the municipality/education/construction/lawyers/legislators groups. Just next door, Sandy Springs' two high schools were left in a shambles after this group razed them. What better example than Dan Weber, Chairman of the Senate Education committee not only supports, but also initiates and promotes the legislation to give education dollars back to developers. \> What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see? I think educational funding is headed in new directions before too long. They tried somewhat this year to no avail. The metro systems are awash with money and are wasting vast amounts while many of the South Georgia systems can't provide even the minimum. There at least has to be a cap put on property taxes. I'm not sure eliminating them entirely is appropriate, but stopping the increases is a must. \> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? My obvious priority is legislation working towards true quality education. The NCLB federal legislation is a great first attempt and needs to be refined and tweaked; but needs to be expanded. There have been several versions of Charter bills, but none will produce what all are seeking. Dan Weber just vetoed the most recent Charter bill this past legislative session. It was probably the only bill with any hope of creating these sought-after vibrant 'Charter School' everyone thinks were are creating now.\Dan Weber\> Party: Republican\(No other information for this candidate was received by publication deadline)\Georgia House, District 44\Sheila Jones\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Lockheed Martin Co. - Spares Procurement Customer Property Clerk (28 years)\> Age: 52\> Education: S.

Archer High; Frederick Douglass High; Clark College; Georgia State\> Family: Mother: Mrs. Darnella Jones; 1 Sister and 5 Brothers (I am the youngest)\> Web site: www.sheilajones.org\> E-mail: info@sheilajones.org\> Why I'm running for office: I'm running for re-election to continue to have a voice in the Legislature to pass meaningful legislation. I want a voice in improving the quality of life for residents in my district and for the people of Georgia. When I return, I will work on funding transportation, better health care, improving our educational system and environmental needs. I look forward to doing more to keep low income and senior citizens in their homes. Also, Georgia is in need of tougher laws for drunk drivers.\> The 2008 General Assembly has received significant criticism for failing to resolve critical issues of the state. If elected, what will you do to ensure better success in 2009 and future legislative sessions? All legislators, from the top leadership to the newest freshmen, must remember that we are here to represent the interests of all Georgians, not just serve our own political interests. The best legislation results from everyone having a seat at the table, and all viewpoints are heard.\I will reach across party lines to resolve some of the divisive conflicts that kept us from addressing several serious issues at the end of the 2008 session.\> What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see? Capping or freezing tax assessments will help bring some fairness to the property tax system and eliminate the 'back door' tax increases we have now. Our property owners are in need of relief from ad valorem tax increases. I am pleased that we passed (and I supported) HB 1273, which will expand employment opportunities by offering a $3,500 job tax credit for qualifying businesses in designated opportunity zones in Georgia.\> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? Transportation, Grady, Education, & Better Retirement for ""all"" Public School employees. Passing the regional option to fund transportation. A reliable, permanent funding source for Grady and other trauma care facilities. Restore state funding to local schools to give local property owners some relief. Provide our students & educators the needed tools for excellence.

The community we live in is diverse and full of great potential. Whether it's Fulton County or Cobb County , I believe it's time to erase crime, drugs, and vagrancy. And together, I know we can take back our streets and make them safe for our children. This campaign is not about me. It's about us. It's about being part of a community that works together for change.\> The 2008 General Assembly has received significant criticism for failing to resolve critical issues of the state. If elected, what will you do to ensure better success in 2009 and future legislative sessions? If elected, I will push for more open government. I will bring the community back to the table of government. Make of the people for the people, and by the people more than just a phrase.\> What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see? I would like to see a section in the tax policy that would allow for property taxes on senior citizens, once they hit a certian age, to be frozen at that level. This would slow down the process of seniors losing there homes of 40 and 50 years.\> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? Education and Quality and Affordable Heathcare;\I will work to achieve these task by building a coalition of like minded members of the House and Senate.

Legislation that can make our lives better is disregarded and partisanship supersedes the needs of the people. I can make a difference by letting the voice of the people be heard through me,by making sure that effective legislation gets done for all Georgian's.\> The 2008 General Assembly has received significant criticism for failing to resolve critical issues of the state. If elected, what will you do to ensure better success in 2009 and future legislative sessions? It is important for Legislators to realize that this is not about power or presence. It is about the issues that must be addressed to keep Georgia one of the most beautiful and comfortable states in America. My role would be to work on committees with that focus. I want to work with state officials that deliver results, are hard working and get things done. I will be a key player with a strong work ethic, an enduring attitude and zeal. This has been missing in our state house for quite sometime. It is time for new energy and change.\> What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see? I would not like to see any property tax increases. I would like a special tax to be implemented on property owners with run down properites. Higher entertainment, cigarette and alcohol tax should be put in place. In addition, I would like to create an IMMIGRATION tax imposed on ALL illegal Immigrants in Georgia.\> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? My top priority would be education. All the monies that have been 'borrowed' by the Governor need to be returned and more money needs to be added. Teaching to the test is not good teaching. School uniforms should be mandatory, P.E. music and after school programs should be available at every school. More control of school policies etc,should be in the hands of local school boards and parents. The state Superintendant should be accountable to the legislature and should report progress accurately and often.\Chris Huttman\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Information Technology Manager\> Age: 28\> Education: 2003 BA Print Journalism Georgia State University\> Family: Single\Parents and brothers live in Atlanta, Athens and Augusta.\> Web site: www.chrishuttman.com/\> E-mail: chrishuttman@gmail.com\> Why I'm running for office: I am running for state representative to increase access to health care, improve educational opportunity and help to put into place a statewide transportation plan that will reduce congestion and fund more transportation alternatives such as mass transit.\> The 2008 General Assembly has received significant criticism for failing to resolve critical issues of the state. If elected, what will you do to ensure better success in 2009 and future legislative sessions? The culture at the General Assembly rewards political posturing and promotes those who shout the loudest but produce the fewest results. It has to change. I will bring together lawmakers and other interested policy groups in a bipartisan fashion to work one at a time on small solutions that can add up to positive change going forward. By focusing on accountability and openness at all levels of the lawmaking process we can begin to get back on track and make progress in the areas of education, health care, transportation and the environment.\> What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see? I favor tax decisions being made at the local level when possible. I was disturbed by the legislature's efforts to consolidate tax collection from local governments and school boards. One small but meaningful change I favor: the sales tax paid on gasoline should be devoted entirely to transportation. The 4th penny should be moved from the general fund (where it currently goes) to a fund dedicated to mass transit where it can be used to pay for rail, buses and other traffic alleviating solutions.\> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? I will work to expand Georgia's Pre-K program to include universal access so that every 4 year old can attend a quality program and get a true head start. I'll work to stop the austerity cuts to schools, $1.5 billion since 2002. I favor a statewide transportation plan that puts congestion and demand above politics in spending decisions and has funding for mass transportation and promotes high density development to alleviate traffic and give Georgians more flexible options in how and where they are able to live and work.\Right to Life Republican Referendum --- Forsyth\> Do you support an amendment to the Georgia State Constitution so as to provide that the paramount right to life is vested in each human from the moment of fertilization until a natural death?\County Charter Repulican Referendum --- Forsyth\> Should the county charter be revised to provide that County Commissioners and School Board members be elected by the voters in the respective districts?\School Voucher Republican Referendum --- Forsyth\> Do you support school choice in the form of a school voucher system?\Fair Tax Republican Referendum --- Forsyth\> Are you familiar with the Fair Tax Act?\Fair Tax Support Republican Referendum --- Forsyth\> Do you support the Fair Tax Act?\County Charter Democratic Referendum --- Forsyth\> Should the county charter be revised to provide that the County Commissioners and School Board members be elected by the voters in their respective districts?\County Golf Course Democratic Referendum --- Forsyth\> Should the county buy the plot of land known as Lanier Golf Course and keep it as a public golf course, placing it in the green space bond for the benefit of all?\Public Service Commissioner, Dist. 1 Southern\Rick Collum\> Party: Republican\> Occupation: Attorney and magistrate judge\> Age: 38\> Education: Juris Doctorate; B.A. in Sociology\B.S. in Criminal Justice\> Family: Wife of 15 years, Donna Collum; two children, 9 and 7\> Web site: No response\> E-mail: rickcollum2000@yahoo.com\> Why I'm running for office: I am running for the Georgia Public Service Commission in order to serve the people of Georgia by helping to facilitate safe and affordable energy by combining traditional sources of energy such as natural gas and nuclear power with renewable energy sources such as solar, wind and landfill gas.

Monthly payments for electric, natural gas, and phone are taking ever increasing scarce cash. \America has always positively responded to scarcity with technology. As a professional engineer and DOD supervisor, I am trained in technical problems experienced by our utilities. Encouraging competition without collusion, and wringing excess from the production system will better our utility rates and supply.\> In your opinion, what, if any changes are needed in Georgia's energy policy? While we don't experience roving brownouts like California, or sky-high energy prices, we can do more.\We can set cash incentives for conservation measures, including weatherization/insulation, digital thermostats, high efficiency furnaces, water heaters and air conditioners. We can encourage cooling ponds for several antiquated coal power plants that drain water mercilessly from our dwindling lakes. We can lower rates by encouraging new technology, not blind reliance on fossil fuel.\> How would you work to fix inefficiencies and divisions within the five member commission? The PSC ensures that Georgians pay the lowest rates for their utility services, while maintaining viable suppliers. All commissioners must be on the same page with this mandate. Except for personnel matters, meetings must be open to the public, including rights of all parties to speak. No more 'good ole boy' politics. Every area the PSC governs: electric, gas, phone, common carriers, to have two commissioners concerned full-time with that area, reporting biweekly to the others.\> Describe the education and experience that qualify you for this position. I am a Registered Professional Engineer for 25 years in 3 states, including 20 years in Georgia. Former Department of Defense positions include Chief of Power/Lighting, and Chief of Process Engineering.\My education includes a BScElecEngin, an MScMechEngin (GA Tech), an MScPhysics (GA Tech), and an executive MBA.\The PSC is concerned with such technical topics as underground piping infrastructure and complex power generation schemes. We need an engineer looking out for Georgian's interests.\> Commodity prices for energy are rising dramatically. What role should the PSC play in mitigating these increases? If we rely exclusively on fossil fuels, we are at the mercy of OPEC and the energy barons. In the long run, we must develop alternative sources, including increased nuclear, solar, and wind power. In the short run, we must encourage conservation measures, including proper insulation/weatherization, high efficiency air conditions, furnaces, and water heaters. Cash incentives for conversion, costly in the short run, pays rich dividends both to families and to our secure energy infrastructure.\Jim Powell\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Independent energy consultant to states, local governments and industry.\> Age: 59\> Education: BBA, MBA from the University of North Florida. Federal Executive Institute.\> Family: Married to Karen for 37years, 2 great sons and daughters in law, 2 adorable granddaughters\> Web site: jimpowellforgapsc.com\> E-mail: jimpowellforgapsc@gmail.com\> Why I'm running for office: It is my intent to be the consumer advocate and to keep consumers' interests a top priority while also understanding that the investor owned utilities are in business to make a profit for their shareholders. I have worked with State PSCs across the country in efforts to implement energy efficiency practices, increasing use of renewable energy and promoting conservation. I have served our Nation for over 35 years and being elected to the PSC is the next chapter in my public service career.\> In your opinion, what, if any changes are needed in Georgia's energy policy? Georgia does not have a comprehensive State Energy Policy that addresses all aspects of energy supply and demand. The Georgia Environmental Facilities Authority published the State Energy Strategy in December 2007 which was developed in a collaborative manner with extensive stakeholder input. The Governor's Energy Challenge 2020 and Conserve Georgia are both efforts at efficiency and conservation. These two initiatives, along with State Energy Strategy should be used as the basic framework to develop a comprehensive State Energy Policy.\> How would you work to fix inefficiencies and divisions within the five member commission? One of my strongest attributes is the ability to bring people together who possess different perspectives and get them to reach a consensus. During my 35 year career, I worked for 7 different Presidential administrations. I was able to work with the political and career leadership towards common goals. I plan on using this experience to work in partnership with my fellow Commissioners to advance the mission of the PSC and thereby ensure that the citizens of Georgia get a fair deal for the utility services they purchase. \> Describe the education and experience that qualify you for this position. I am the most experienced PSC candidate in years. I was a Senior Executive with the U.S. Department of Energy and have more than 20 years experience in developing and implementing energy policies and energy program management. I have significant experience at the regional and national level promoting renewable energy technology programs (i.e., solar, biomass), energy efficiency technologies and practices and conservation (i.e., Energy Star, Weatherization Assistance Program). My undergraduate degree is in Accounting and I have a MBA.\> Commodity prices for energy are rising dramatically. What role should the PSC play in mitigating these increases? Georgia relies primarily on coal to generate electricity. I plan to interest the State's utilities in diversifying the fuel sources for electricity so that price volatility for a particular fuel will not impact ratepayers severely. Focusing more on using renewable energy sources produced in Georgia creates jobs and keeps dollars in the State's economy. Georgia needs to pay more attention to energy efficiency. Reducing demand and mitigating the rising price of energy resources can best be achieved through energy efficiency and conservation.\Pam Davidson\> Party: Republican\> Occupation: Renewable Energy Consultant\> Age: 45\> Education: B.S. , Organizational Behavior, University of San Francisco\> Family: One daughter age 14, two dogs, one cat, one horse\> Web site: pamdavidson.org\> E-mail: pamdavidson@tds.net\> Why I'm running for office: I am seeking the position because I am very concerned about our ability to provide clean, affordable energy in the state. \> In your opinion, what, if any changes are needed in Georgia's energy policy? We need to our maximize our energy efficiency and renewable energy potential. We have made very little ground in either area. If elected,I will ask that the Demand Side Management Group review and improve upon thier recommendations to the PSC and set forth a resolution to create a Renewable Energy Working group to develop immediate and significant goals for affordable renewable energy. \We need to evaluate our energy resources in light of water resources and air quality. \> How would you work to fix inefficiencies and divisions within the five member commission? Regarding divisiveness: I would encourage and employ an attitude of mutual respect. I would make every effort to listen and understand all parties and conduct myself with dignity and selflessness. \Regarding inefficiencies: I would encourage a culture of positive, future-oriented leadership in which the PSC is not a reactionary body (simply hearing and reacting to the entities we regulate)but acts confidently towards meeting established goals. \> Describe the education and experience that qualify you for this position. As an renewable energy advocate, I have had the priviledge of earning the respect of lawmakers and policy experts. Hence, I can 'hit the ground running' in order to facilitate comprehensive energy policy reform. I work well with both the environmental and business community. Recent evidence of this is the successful passsage of HB 670 (the state's first comprehensive energy efficiency and renewable energy bill) which was recently signed by the Governor. I initiated this bill in order to incentivize progressive changes in energy policy. \> Commodity prices for energy are rising dramatically. What role should the PSC play in mitigating these increases?\Firstly, we need to reduce our per capita energy usage. Less demand means less fuel. \Secondly, we need to quickly develop renewable energy resources so that we are not dependent on global fuel prices. Our greatest resource for affordable renewable energy is biomass. We can provide both electricity and biofuels (such as synthetic diesel) as a 'value add') from such facilities. \Lauren W.

Two children: Adam and Jessica\> Web site: www.dale08.com\> E-mail: www.dale@dale08.com\> Why I'm running for office: As a veteran investigative reporter with WSB, I've met thousands of Georgians from all over the state, Democrats, Independents and Republicans who all told me the same thing. They said ""Dale, just once, I'd like to have the chance to vote for an honest person, a truth teller, who won't be controlled by special interests. Someone who'll work for real people like me.""\I'm running to give Georgians the chance to do just that.\> Our country is facing significant issues with rising food and energy costs. What would you propose to address these issues? Most elected officials no longer work for us. They work for special interests that fund their campaigns then control their votes. \I am the only leading Senate candidate who's refusing the special interest ""PAC"" money that's stolen your government and keeps your voice from being heard.\I will oppose big oil, promote energy alternatives and help convert Georgia pine to cellulosic ethanol to combat the ridiculous price of gasoline. Driving down the cost of fuel is the key to making food more affordable for the hard working people of Georgia.\> Do you believe that the United States has lost the respect of much of the international community, and if so, what would you propose to regain standing in the world? We are the world's beacon of hope and model for freedom. Repeated disclosures from Bush administration insiders show the lack of deliberation and intelligence gathering that has marked this administration's foreign policy, policy that has damaged the image we treasure as Lincoln's ""the last best hope of earth."" \As a long-time investigative reporter with a reputation of toughness, I understand the value of communication. We can restore our reputation. Communicating with conditions is not only wise, but follows bipartisan American precedent.\> Party and philosophical differences have resulted in budget and policy deadlock in the past. If elected, how will you specifically work with colleagues to achieve results on the tough issues? TV shows distract us with circus-like debates between the ""R's and the ""D's"". Truth is, the prime source of gridlock is the ""P,"" or ""PAC"" money system. We can't fix health care, secure our borders, free ourselves from foreign oil or heal our economy because the giant special interests that control politicians won't allow those reforms to take place. I agree with Barack Obama. The moment we break the stranglehold lobbyists and special interests have on Washington, we WILL be able to move forward on the common sense reforms Americans support.\> What is your solution to the issue of illegal immigration? Immigration should be based on the American dream. If you contribute to our economy but don't take an American's job, commit to learn English and assimilate, then you should have an equal chance to apply. At the same time, we must implement a foolproof document verification system employers must access before future workers can be hired. Employers will be prosecuted for hiring undocumented workers. Illegals already employed will not be fired or rounded up, but will have an incentive to go home, get in line, and legally pursue the dream.\> What experience to set policy for our country do you bring to the job? For 23 years I've gone behind the lines of power and government to uncover and report the truth. Together we've fought countless battles and share the scars. But that's not enough. The Senate requires integrity, the ability to listen to all sides, an old-fashioned work ethic and the courage to lead. Angie Cardwell, the love of my life, mother of our 2 kids, hospice nurse and my wife for 22 years, will tell you this: my only motive in this effort is to give you what you truly deserve; the chance for clean, transparent and honest government.\Vernon Jones\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Chief Executive Officer --- Dekalb County\> Age: 47\> Education: BA Business Admin.,NCCU\Graduate --- Harvard JFK School of Govt. Exec. Prog.\> Family: - no response -\> Web site: www.vernonjonesforgeorgia.com/home.html\> E-mail: vernon@vernonjonesforgeorgia.com\> Why I'm running for office: As a former Georgia Legislator and now as CEO of Dekalb County I have crucial experience in writing the law and running a large metropolitan government. I am actively involved in creating jobs, balancing budgets, improving infrastructure, providing homeland security, maintaining low taxes and setting public policy. I have had to provide local solutions to national problems and am in touch with the concerns and issues that everyday Americans are experiencing.\> Our country is facing significant issues with rising food and energy costs. What would you propose to address these issues? Food price increases are tied to fuel costs increases. Fuel costs increase because of our dependence on foreign oil and reliance on a singular source of energy. We should pursue mandates on the automobile industry that require the production of vehicles that get more miles per gallon. We need to think about energy independence and pursue solar, wind and biofuel as alternative energy sources. As we invest in this technology we invest our people and economy. In turn energy diversity we will create jobs, and boost our economy.\> Do you believe that the United States has lost the respect of much of the international community, and if so, what would you propose to regain standing in the world? Yes. I believe that the United States has lost the respect of much of the international community. We are also quickly losing our standing as the leader of the international free world. While we find ourselves in an increasingly precarious situation, we still have the capacity and opportunity to come together to maintain and build an even stronger America. I believe that the most important thing we can do is to work to rebuild our international relationships by increasing our diplomatic efforts.\> Party and philosophical differences have resulted in budget and policy deadlock in the past. If elected, how will you specifically work with colleagues to achieve results on the tough issues? It is important regardless of party affiliation for elected officials to work across the aisle for the benefit of our citizens. As a Chief Executive Officer of Dekalb County, when we dispatch our public service, conduct infrastructure improvements, build parks and create jobs we do not ask for party affiliation. Our job as elected officials is to provide solutions for the citizens of this country. I believe that bipartisanship is the best dose of medicine for Washington right now. \> What is your solution to the issue of illegal immigration? I believe that the problem of illegal immigration is exacerbated by an ineffective naturalization process. While I am opposed to amnesty and believe that we need to continue to secure the borders and enforce the law, I will work to ensure that the process to become a legal US citizen and obtain work permits becomes more efficient and effective. \> What experience to set policy for our country do you bring to the job? I was responsible for introducing, passing laws and setting public policy for over 16 years as a State legislator and as CEO for DeKalb County. I bring the experience of both local and state policy setting to the US Senate. As a law maker I think about what is good for the people, democrat or republican. The state of Georgia deserves a US Senator committed to action and positive change. It's about getting things done.\Rand Knight\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Businessman/Ecologist\> Age: 36\> Education: Ph.D Ecosystems Analysis, M.S. Ecology/Forestry, B.A. Environmental Studies\> Family: Wife: Linda; two children: Ellie Lu (3) and Thomas (1).\> Web site: www.knightforsenate.com\> E-mail: info@knightforsenate.com\> Why I'm running for office: The economy, healthcare system and environment of Georgia and our country have changed for the worse; it's time for a new direction. Georgians' needs are not being met, but I am ready to listen. Finally, I have the energy and the fresh perspective to go to Washington, D.C. and get things done.\> Our country is facing significant issues with rising food and energy costs. What would you propose to address these issues? A cornerstone of my campaign, the ""Green Deal,"" would create hundreds of thousands of jobs, and reduce energy costs and pollution while increasing energy efficiency and independence. I will support a Strategic Energy Fund that sponsors the research, development and deployment of renewable energy, energy efficiency and biofuels. Additionally, with a new, clean, cost-efficient infrastructure, food prices will decrease, as it will cost less to process and transport food to its final destination.\> Do you believe that the United States has lost the respect of much of the international community, and if so, what would you propose to regain standing in the world? The U.S. has lost the respect of the international community; we must regain it. First, we must steadfastly commit to diplomacy. Second, our involvement in Iraq must come to a close. Third, we must empower the United Nations to act on countries that abuse Human Rights; we must re-adhere to the Geneva Convention and stop our use of torture. Fourth, we must be a world leader in curbing global warming. Finally, we must work to eradicate poverty and deplorable living conditions worldwide.\> Party and philosophical differences have resulted in budget and policy deadlock in the past. If elected, how will you specifically work with colleagues to achieve results on the tough issues? Like many Georgians and Americans, I am frustrated by the constant bickering and divisive fighting in Washington, D.C. Politicians seem more interested in choosing sides than solving problems for their constituents. I draw inspiration from former Georgia senator, Sam Nunn, who reached across party lines and focused on making Georgia and America stronger. I aim to promote a real change that involves dialogue - not bickering - and that always keeps the American people's interests at heart.\> What is your solution to the issue of illegal immigration? We must first find fair and humane ways to deal with the current undocumented population; we must not dehumanize immigrants by employing mean-spirited rhetoric and initiatives. We can structure a law that grants eventual legal status to many of the undocumented immigrants living and working here. Additionally, to promote legal pathways to citizenship, we must punish employers who partake in illegal employment practices. Finally, we must work to better preserve the integrity of our borders. \> What experience to set policy for our country do you bring to the job? In my years as a businessman in technology and consulting, I have developed a skill for diagnosing difficult problems and proposing innovative solutions. My background in science and ecology gives me a key understanding of our energy crisis and how to solve it. Listening thoughtfully to all sides of an issue allows me to truly grasp a problem, craft a solution, and understand how to implement it. I am ready to use my expertise and problem-solving experience in the service of my home state.\Josh Lanier\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Former Senate staff member, retired businessman and writer.\> Age: 55\> Education: Attended Georgia Southern University\> Family: Married to Lynne 30 years, father of Heather, Brooke, Josh and Robert.\> Web site: www.JoshLanier.com\> E-mail: josh@joshlanier.com\> Why I'm running for office: I am standing for election to the U.S. Senate to retore our most basic right of a fair and free election by setting the example of a clean campaign, promoting public funding for and reform of elections, and to represent the voice of all Georgians.\> Our country is facing significant issues with rising food and energy costs. What would you propose to address these issues? The two issues are directly related. Food cost inflation is driven by spiraling energy costs that are rooted in a weak dollar and our addiction to oil, exacerbated by our current mandates for corn ethanol. Every American feels this inflation, whether in the cost of milk or even pizza, and its impact is worldwide and dangerous. America and the world need a visionary energy policy based on a combination of existing, new and sustainable technologies.\> Do you believe that the United States has lost the respect of much of the international community, and if so, what would you propose to regain standing in the world? Since 2000, I have traveled to over 40 countries to work with business and government leaders. Throughout the world, there is disappointment and anger with the Bush Administration, but there remains a friendship for the American people and hope for the promise that is America. As a nation, we can restore our relations with the rest of the world by returning to our values and leading by example.\> Party and philosophical differences have resulted in budget and policy deadlock in the past. If elected, how will you specifically work with colleagues to achieve results on the tough issues? The deadlock that continues to this day has been caused less by party or philosophical differences and more by special interests and the money they bring to campaigns. There is a reason we don't have universal health care or a visionary energy policy or an answer to the foreclosure crisis. That reason is money and special interests. When we have public financing of elections, we will have more legislators free to work together for the benefit of the country.\> What is your solution to the issue of illegal immigration? I support immigration reform that (1) repairs and brings our immigration policies and agencies into the 21st century, (2) enforces our employment laws, (3) offers a Pay My Debt to Society program whereby some here illegally but contributing to their communities can plead guilty to a misdemeanor with a significant fine, pay any back taxes owed, and then apply for established legal alien status under normal procedures, and (4) leaves the question of citizenship up to the application process as with any other immigrant.\> What experience to set policy for our country do you bring to the job? I have served my country for 38 years. I enlisted in the Army on my 18th birthday, served in Viet Nam, as a staff member in both the U.S. Senate and House, as a non-profit CEO and was later co-founder of an environmental company. I have visited with leaders throughout the United States and in over 40 countries. I have more years of experience working in and with the United States Senate than all the other candidates combined. These are the life experiences I would bring to the United States Senate.\Jim Martin\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Attorney\> Age: 62\> Education: University of Georgia, AB; JD; LL.M. Georgia State University, MBA . \> Family: Wife Joan, four children, and three grandchildren. \> Web site: www.martinforsenate.com\> E-mail: jim@martinforsenate.com\> Why I'm running for office: President Bush and Saxby Chambliss have lost touch with what's going in Iraq and here at home. Something's wrong when we're spending $50 billion a month in Iraq while the price of gas and groceries keep rising for American families. It's time to start doing more to help the middle class.\> Our country is facing significant issues with rising food and energy costs. What would you propose to address these issues? The Bush Administration's economic policies have been disastrous for American families. The cost of living is skyrocketing while incomes are stagnating. Now, more than ever, middle class Americans need to keep more of what they earn. \To lower energy prices, we need to encourage development of alternative fuels, require oil companies to invest some of their record profits into new clean refineries to increase supply, and find ways to encourage conservation - particularly when it comes to transportation.\> Do you believe that the United States has lost the respect of much of the international community, and if so, what would you propose to regain standing in the world? As the world's most powerful and influential country, the United States has a moral and ethical obligation to use its resources and influence to help create a safer future. In order to maximize our influence, the United States must work to reestablish our credibility and stature in the world by being a leader on global issues and engaging our allies a to address issues that affect us all.\> Party and philosophical differences have resulted in budget and policy deadlock in the past. If elected, how will you specifically work with colleagues to achieve results on the tough issues? In the State Legislature, I developed a reputation for bipartisanship. I was frequently able to bring members of both parties together, help them resolve their differences, and get important legislation passed. \We need this kind of approach in Washington again. We need an independent-minded Senator who can stand up to his own party and president when they're wrong, if necessary, and someone who can find common ground with those who have different viewpoints.\> What is your solution to the issue of illegal immigration? There are two things that we must do immediately to address the problems of illegal immigration: secure our borders and crackdown on employers who hire undocumented workers.\Only when we accomplish these two goals can we shut down the black market for cheap labor and work toward meaningful comprehensive immigration reform.\> What experience to set policy for our country do you bring to the job? In my 35 years of public service, I have a strong record of accomplishment for middle class Georgia families. I served for nearly two decades in the Georgia House of Representatives, where I worked on issues like health care and consumer protection. I was also a leader in the effort to create PeachCare, the program that provides health care to thousands of Georgia's children. I later led the Department of Human Resources under both Democratic and Republican governors.\Georgia Senate, District 45\Peggy Armstrong\> Party: Republican\> Occupation: Retired-Previous Occ:\Property mgr.

If elected, what will you do to ensure better success in 2009 and future legislative sessions? I have had a lot of business experience especailly working with people and working in teams to get projects completed on time. I work well with others and have always been a team player. If needs be I can reach accross the isle and get things accomplished. \As a Property Manager I ran my building as a separate business which gave me a lot of experience working with people both tenants and employees. This also provide me the opportunity to do accounting and financial reporting. > What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see? Taxes on individuals have to be reduced locally and nationally in order to move our economy forward and away from economic slowing.\We need to look at how we are taxing companies small and large in Gwinnett and Georgia to see how we can encourage companies to locate here and add good jobs to our area.\> What is your solution to the issue of illegal immigration in Georgia? Number one close the the borders! Immigration can only be legal. As to what to do with the immigrents that are already here, that is a national issue that will have to have a sweeping answer. They definitely should not just be allowed to stay. They did not enter our country repecting our rule of law!\The slowing number of construction jobs in Gwinnett is sending some of the illegal immigrents away from our area. \> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? Long range solution to our lack of water.( Volunteer to serve on a committee to come up with a plan)\Tax Reform (The Fair Tax and The Flat Tax Plans are already worked out for us we just need to go ahead and implement all or some of them for GA)\Cut Spending: Every spending issue needs close inspection we need to quit wasting our tax payer's money!\> What further changes, if any, does Georgia need in terms of campaign finance reform? It seems that a great deal of money is spent on campaigns. I do not yet have a handle on how to reform the process.\Renee S.

If elected, what will you do to ensure better success in 2009 and future legislative sessions? I will continue working with the excutive branch (Governor's office), the senate and the house leadership to advance the needs and desires of the constituents of District 45. I do not agree with the political gamesmanship exemplified in previous sessions and believe egos and political aspirations should be put aside. We should strive to achieve the best goals to improve the quality of life for all Georgians. \> What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see? I believe the debate should be continued on tax reform and a compromise between the house and senate should be reached this next session. I supported the repeal of the car tag tax and the freezinof property re-assessments statewide. I am open and amenable to discussion of a cut in any tax. I believe the people who earn their money have a right to keep it and spend it as they see fit--not the government. \> What is your solution to the issue of illegal immigration in Georgia? The General Assembly has done a good job of enacting new laws to make it more difficult to live and work in Georgia and be here illegally. It is up to the senators and representatives to continue putting pressure on our Washington congressional delegation to make stricter and enforcable federal laws restricting illegal immigrants. We need help from Washington with deportation and stopping the boarders for easy access. \> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? I would continue my work as Chairman of Ethics, as Vice -Chairman of Health, and on appropriations to develop legislation in each committee. I would also continue work as a consumer watch-dog protecting the interests of Georgia consumers. As the subcommitte chairman of Appropriations, I would continue writing the state budget for the Department of Human Resources, the Department of Labor, and the Department of Veterans Affairs. Tax reform will also be a priority. \> What further changes, if any, does Georgia need in terms of campaign finance reform? With the inaguration of Governor, Sonny Purdue, the General Assembly passed the strongest ethics/campaign disclosure laws in the history of Georgia. The state literally came out of the cellar and ranks higher now in ethics reform than ever before.\Two years ago, I wrote again a new ethics revision law that was 52 pages long--it passed the Senate unanimously but unfortunatley stalled in the House. I will continue pursing reform and enforcement. \Georgia Senate, District 55\Gloria Butler\> Party: Democratic\(No other information for this candidate was received by publication deadline)\Robert Crowder\> Party: Democratic\(No other information for this candidate was received by publication deadline)\Georgia House, District 88\Robford Hill\> Party: Democratic\(No other information for this candidate was received by publication deadline)\Billy Mitchell\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Vice President Government Affairs\> Age: 46\> Education: Juris Doctor - Atlanta Law School\> Family: Wife Shawn, daughter Maya, son Sean\> Web site: www.billymitchell.org\> E-mail: billymitchell@bellsouth.net\> Why I'm running for office: I have long held a passion for public service and visionaries willing to create realistic solutions and for those who are willing to do the necessary work to accomplish those solutions.\As a result of the many laws I have authored and responsiveness to my district, I have earned recognition for effectiveness and productivity and setting a new standard of representation for my constituents.\Along with my aptitude for effective ""bridge building"" compelled me to seek re-election.\> The 2008 General Assembly has received significant criticism for failing to resolve critical issues of the state. If elected, what will you do to ensure better success in 2009 and future legislative sessions? As one of the few Democratic members of the 2007/2008 General Assembly who authored a bill which was signed into law, I will continue to rely on my ability of being able to work across party lines, which has earned me a reputation for consensus building that is unique in today's political environment, particularly in a solidly, so-called 'Red State,' as is the case with Georgia.\> What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see? As indicated by the large budget surplus Georgia has amassed (on top of contingency funds), I would like to see - and have been working to do so - the tax code amended such that we take less taxes from payers. \My preference would be the elimination of the automobile ad valorem tax - the so-called ""birthday tax"" required annually when we register our vehicles.\> What is your solution to the issue of illegal immigration in Georgia? The preliferation of illegal immigration is primarlily the result of employment seekers. If there were no jobs to seek this issue would be all but non-existent. Accordingly, the penalty should rest with employers who would hire workers that have not been accorded the legal status to do be employed.\> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? Having authored an unprecedented 7 general bills signed into law during my previous three terms of service, I will continue to work on important issues affecting my community and state, such as legislation I have already drafted, including a bill that seeks to eliminate the problem of thieves stealing air conditioners and catalytic converters and selling them for its scrap material.\Additionally, always a priority will be the responsiveness and accessibility I maintain with my constituents in addressing their issues with government.\> What further changes, if any, does Georgia need in terms of campaign finance reform? There needs to be a one-stop method to be able to ascertain financial disclosures/campaign information for all campaign levels, municipal, county, state and federal.\As it stands now you would have to visit as many agencies to obtain such and many do not have this information on-line.\At the very least, all levels should be required to make this information web accessible.\Georgia House, District 95\Toney Collins\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Computer Engineer/Real Estate\> Age: 42\> Education: Degree in Computer Engineering\> Family: No children, Not Married\> Web site: www.ToneyCollins.com\> E-mail: toneycollins95@gmail.com\> Why I'm running for office: The reason for running to be the next State Representative for the 95th Distict are for the following reasons: To be a powerful voice for my constituents, to be a voice for people who are never heard, to make life better for our Georgia citizen, to help influence the Education system, the Healthcare system, the Tax system, and our Economic condition, to make life better for our children and seniors, and to make Georgia a great place to live.\> The 2008 General Assembly has received significant criticism for failing to resolve critical issues of the state. If elected, what will you do to ensure better success in 2009 and future legislative sessions? Better success comes with agreeing. I will work quickly to find common ground on issues that could pass quickly and will listen and work with legislators who want to see resolve,no matter what party affiliation and I will encourage others to do likewise, whether democrat or republicans. We all have common issues, we just need to work to find them. I will let them understand I care about their constituents also. I will be a reader of bills that are presented to me before voting. I will not be an absentee legislator. \> What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see? I would greatly consider the fair tax plan. This will ensure a higher revenue growth for our state and help the poor and seniors. And until we get our immigration policy working, this will ensure revenue from illegal immigrants \> What is your solution to the issue of illegal immigration in Georgia? My solution to illegal immigration is as followed: Because Georgia is a great place to find illegal work, My solution is to make Georgia less attractive to illegal immigrant. I would crack down on employers through fines and public list employers who hire illegal immigrants. This is pure ethics violation. Work with public safety to ensure that deportation is happening, especially for illegals who are committing personal crimes to our citizen. Finally work to see that the Federal government enforce the laws already in place. \> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? My top priorities will be Education, Health-care, Economic growth, and making Georgia a great place to live and raise a family. I will work with legislators, citizens, and local and federal government to attract new businesses to Georgia which will bring in more jobs, more revenue. I will help in fully funded our Education system in order to produce an intelligent workforce to attract new industries to a smart Georgia. \I will work with anyone who want more doctors, nurses, better health facilities and universal health-care in Georgia. \> What further changes, if any, does Georgia need in terms of campaign finance reform? I will present a bill that will allow individual donors to be able to write off up to $1200.00 donation off their taxes. This will give incentive for more people who would like to enter into public service an avenue to do so. And I believe more citizens will give donations and by doing so this will deter pay raises of legislators. I would pay more closely attention to lobbyist donation by publicly showing of their financial contributions to candidates. \George Wilson\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Owner Automated Business Forms,Inc.& Automated Data Decisions\> Age: 66\> Education: BSBA Rockhurst College,Central Missoui State\> Family: Married 39 years to Wendy Wilson,VP Community Health Charities of Georgia\> Web site: electgeorgewilson.com\> E-mail: electwilson@juno.com\> Why I'm running for office: My concerns about ethics in government and the lack of progress,vision,and leadership on the tough problems facing our state compelled me to run for this office.The problems are many...education ,health care, transportation solutions for metro Atlanta,environmental issues,and of course the economy.\> The 2008 General Assembly has received significant criticism for failing to resolve critical issues of the state. If elected, what will you do to ensure better success in 2009 and future legislative sessions? My ability to communicate and work with all types of people and organizations has enabled me to build several successful businesses and to be active as a community leader on controversial issues.I believe that this experience will enable me to reach across the aisle and work with my fellow legislators to achieve what is in the best interest of all Georgians.Moreover, I will endeavor to bring creative and progressive solutions to the many problems facing our state. \> What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see? We have a regressive tax system that hurts lower and middle class families.Lawmakers need to visit the state tax codes in a holistic manner to bring our tax systems into the 21st century.All components--the income tax,sales tax,property tax and others---should be thoroughly examined and modernized to improve and ensure the fairness,adequacy and integrity of our tax systems.We need to make the state tax codes more representaive of todays complex and changing society.\> What is your solution to the issue of illegal immigration in Georgia? This is a simple issue.All employers in Georgia should be required to use the federal E-Verify systems that allows businesses to check the legal status of workers.While the system is not perfect ...you have to start somewhere.We would quickly get to the point that if no jobs are available in Georgia for illegal immigrants than they would stop coming to our state. \> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? 1.Support transportation funding plan to relieve traffic congestion in metro area\2.Work to restore funding cuts to education\3.""Real"" tax reform\4.Try to work towards a fair way to redistrict legislative seats to make every seat competitive\5.Work for open and transparent government\6.Reform criminal justice system\7.Expand pre-k program\> What further changes, if any, does Georgia need in terms of campaign finance reform? The more complicated we make campaign finance reform the more loop holes are devised to get around the so called reforms.This than requires a bigger and expensive bureaucracy to administer the program/reforms.The current system is a nightmare for your typical legislator to keep track of and to comply with and is really ineffective.The current speaker of the house will not let any legislation on this subject pass. \Georgia House, District 96\Torry Lewis\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Loss Prevention Investigator (Credit Card Fraud)\> Age: 24\> Education: B.S.

I am the person to do that!\> The 2008 General Assembly has received significant criticism for failing to resolve critical issues of the state. If elected, what will you do to ensure better success in 2009 and future legislative sessions? We did not resolve critical issues because of the ridiculous and hateful partisan ideology that encompasses both parties. My opponent is apart of this!\I have said on several occasions that we need to put this behind us and use common sense policies. Quite frankly, success relies on our ability to work together. Another aspect that I will bring is that of community involvement. I would say less than 10% of Georgians know who their State Representative is'that is a direct reflection on the lack of excitement our legislative branch.\> What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see? I really do not have any pressing issues about the tax policy. I do think that we should suspend state tax to all public education and emergency service personnel. We must do more to use our tax money appropriately, especially in the fields of education, healthcare, and traffic. I have dedicated myself to work for a more efficacious use of public funds.\> What is your solution to the issue of illegal immigration in Georgia? Unlike my opponent, I do not support illegal immigration activities. I think there are two actors in causing the problem; the illegal immigrant and the illegal employer. Illegal immigrants come for jobs from sharks who are employers that purposely seek illegal immigrants. Both the illegal immigrant and employer should be seen as acts of crime. The employer should be striped of his business license if it is found that they sought illegal workers, and the immigrant should be reported to ICE\> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? Proposed Legislation for 2009 Session\College Sex offender Registry\Stiffer penalties against Graffiti\Stiffer Gang Laws\Stiffer Organized Retail Crimes\Stiffer Credit Fraud Penalties\Mandatory Credit Education in high school\More funds to rural county education\Establish Ethic Commissions for all School Boards\Tax cuts for all educators and public safety personnel \> What further changes, if any, does Georgia need in terms of campaign finance reform? None. We need to focus on ethics in general.\Pedro ""Pete"" Marin\> Party: Democratic\(No other information for this candidate was received by publication deadline.)\Georgia House, District 98\David Hancock\> Party: Republican\> Occupation: Vice President\> Age: 47\> Education: Bachelor of Science, Computer Engineering, Auburn University\> Family: Wife Darlene, daughter Ann, son Michael\> Web site: www.hancock2008.org\> E-mail: david@hancock2008.org\> Why I'm running for office: We need a representative who will get things done for the district. Tax revenue collected in our district has been spent on transportation projects across the state while our own needs suffer. We need transparency in State spending and need to address illegal immigration by focusing on companies who hire and exploit illegal workers, and by keeping unlicensed drivers off our streets. We need a more accessible Representative who is involved in local issues as well as the State government.\> The 2008 General Assembly has received significant criticism for failing to resolve critical issues of the state. If elected, what will you do to ensure better success in 2009 and future legislative sessions? I'm not interested in a political career so I am willing to do whatever is required to get things done. I will identify an issue and then find what is stopping it from moving forward and will make weekly reports back to the district on my progress. I believe strongly in transparency and accessibility of government. I may not make friends among those that have been there the longest, but hopefully running the State more like a business and less like a club will be effective.\> What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see? Reduction in spending to allow reduction in taxes and elimination of GA's income tax or a shifting to a flat tax. Several states get by on corporate taxes or interest/dividend taxes alone. An ideal solution for the US would be the Fair Tax. This has been considered as an option for State revenue in some places but it is difficult to imagine how this could be implemented at a state level alone - although State Representatives who are well versed on the Fair Tax would be helpful to the debate.\> What is your solution to the issue of illegal immigration in Georgia? I believe in focusing efforts against companies who hire illegal immigrants and profit by paying lower wages. Illegal immigrants bring increased gang activity and are a target for criminals because they deal in cash and are not likely to report a crime. This increase in crime hurts everyone in the community. Working with the Federal and County government to identify, track and deport criminals who are here illegally and enforcing only legal hiring will cause these workers to move elsewhere.\> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? Use local tax money for local transportation projects such as widening SR-20 from PIB to the river to match what has been done outside the district. Enhance transparency in State Spending with online posting of all government expenditures. Encourage illegal immigrants to move elsewhere by making it difficult to get work and drive. Increase accessibility of State Government with regular communication and work with local governments.\> What further changes, if any, does Georgia need in terms of campaign finance reform? Unfortunately I believe that some oversight and limitation is required to ensure that funding sources are properly disclosed and regulated. But existing rules do not address the real problem - legislators who do not act ethically and impartially. The Ethics Board should continue to step up enforcement of existing laws. One suggestion is to eliminate contributions from other political campaigns. This encourages raising excess money just to pass to political cronies.\Bobby Reese\> Party: Republican\> Occupation: Real Estate Broker\> Age: 53\> Education: criminal justice and electronic technology\> Family: 1 wife, 2 daughters and four grand children\> Web site: bobbyreese.com\> E-mail: bobby_reese@bellsouth.net\> Why I'm running for office: I'm the incumbent and want to continue to serve my area.\> The 2008 General Assembly has received significant criticism for failing to resolve critical issues of the state. If elected, what will you do to ensure better success in 2009 and future legislative sessions? I know we got a lot accomplished the past two years. I will keep working with the GDOT to get the dysfuntional department fixed. They need more outside accountability and then funding. I will continue to work ethically and consistantly to keep government from growing too large and giving the citizens the freedom they need to be sucessful. \> What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see? I would like to see a reduction in the state income tax and property assessments.\> What is your solution to the issue of illegal immigration in Georgia? to hold the people that knowingly hire them accountable, and to make it harder for the illegals to remain hidden in society while they reap the benefits that the tax payer provides for them.\> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? Last session I worked on a water harvesting bill that if it had passed we would have immediately seen the benefits of better water conservation as people put the systems in. I am going to re-introduce the bill again if I get re-elected and work with the many organizations that want to see this bill pass. I also sponsored HB 1098, an election reform bill that the GOv. signed in May of 2008. I will continue to work with the SOS and make elections in GA fair for all.\> What further changes, if any, does Georgia need in terms of campaign finance reform? It takes money to run a campaign. People want to limit lobbiests from giving to campaigns but that will not stop someone that is dishonest from getting money elsewhere and continuing to be dishonest. The interested public should be involved and watch the votes their elected officials make. The general public gives very little money and want great returns from their elected officials. We need to continue to hold all elected officials accountable by how they spend the money they recieve.\Public Service Commissioner, Dist. 1 Southern\Rick Collum\> Party: Republican\> Occupation: Attorney and Magistrate Judge\> Age: 38\> Education: Juris Doctorate \B.A. in Sociology\B.S. in Criminal Justice\> Family: Wife of 15 years - Donna Collum\Two children 9 and 7\> Web site: - no response -\> E-mail: rickcollum2000@yahoo.com\> Why I'm running for office: I am running for the Georgia Public Service Commission in order to serve the people of Georgia by helping to facilitate safe and affordable energy by combining traditional sources of energy such as natural gas and nuclear power with renewable energy sources such as solar, wind and landfill gas.

Monthly payments for electric, natural gas, and phone are taking ever increasing scarce cash. \America has always positively responded to scarcity with technology. As a professional engineer and DOD supervisor, I am trained in technical problems experienced by our utilities. Encouraging competition without collusion, and wringing excess from the production system will better our utility rates and supply.\> In your opinion, what, if any changes are needed in Georgia's energy policy? While we don't experience roving brownouts like California, or sky-high energy prices, we can do more.\We can set cash incentives for conservation measures, including weatherization/insulation, digital thermostats, high efficiency furnaces, water heaters and air conditioners. We can encourage cooling ponds for several antiquated coal power plants that drain water mercilessly from our dwindling lakes. We can lower rates by encouraging new technology, not blind reliance on fossil fuel.\> How would you work to fix inefficiencies and divisions within the five member commission? The PSC ensures that Georgians pay the lowest rates for their utility services, while maintaining viable suppliers. All commissioners must be on the same page with this mandate. Except for personnel matters, meetings must be open to the public, including rights of all parties to speak. No more 'good ole boy' politics. Every area the PSC governs: electric, gas, phone, common carriers, to have two commissioners concerned full-time with that area, reporting biweekly to the others.\> Describe the education and experience that qualify you for this position. I am a Registered Professional Engineer for 25 years in 3 states, including 20 years in Georgia. Former Department of Defense positions include Chief of Power/Lighting, and Chief of Process Engineering.\My education includes a BScElecEngin, an MScMechEngin (GA Tech), an MScPhysics (GA Tech), and an executive MBA.\The PSC is concerned with such technical topics as underground piping infrastructure and complex power generation schemes. We need an engineer looking out for Georgian's interests.\> Commodity prices for energy are rising dramatically. What role should the PSC play in mitigating these increases? If we rely exclusively on fossil fuels, we are at the mercy of OPEC and the energy barons. In the long run, we must develop alternative sources, including increased nuclear, solar, and wind power. In the short run, we must encourage conservation measures, including proper insulation/weatherization, high efficiency air conditions, furnaces, and water heaters. Cash incentives for conversion, costly in the short run, pays rich dividends both to families and to our secure energy infrastructure. \> Many would say that telecommunications is a fully competitive business. Should the PSC continue to be involved in telecommunications regulations, why or why not? In theory, a mature industry has many players, all seeking business by constantly lowering prices to consumers. Our experience with the airline industry proves otherwise.\As cell phone and landline service is a necessity rather than a luxury, and it is difficult to find alternatives, then the public has the right to control rates. Rates must be ratcheted down until most phone companies find Georgia is not a source of excessive profit. At the same time, service must not be compromised.\Jim Powell\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Independent energy consultant to states, local governments and industry.\> Age: 59\> Education: BBA, MBA from the University of North Florida.

I have worked with State PSCs across the country in efforts to implement energy efficiency practices, increasing use of renewable energy and promoting conservation. I have served our Nation for over 35 years and being elected to the PSC is the next chapter in my public service career.\> In your opinion, what, if any changes are needed in Georgia's energy policy? Georgia does not have a comprehensive State Energy Policy that addresses all aspects of energy supply and demand. The Georgia Environmental Facilities Authority published the State Energy Strategy in December 2007 which was developed in a collaborative manner with extensive stakeholder input. The Governor's Energy Challenge 2020 and Conserve Georgia are both efforts at efficiency and conservation. These two initiatives, along with State Energy Strategy should be used as the basic framework to develop a comprehensive State Energy Policy.\> How would you work to fix inefficiencies and divisions within the five member commission? One of my strongest attributes is the ability to bring people together who possess different perspectives and get them to reach a consensus. During my 35 year career, I worked for 7 different Presidential administrations. I was able to work with the political and career leadership towards common goals. I plan on using this experience to work in partnership with my fellow Commissioners to advance the mission of the PSC and thereby ensure that the citizens of Georgia get a fair deal for the utility services they purchase. \> Describe the education and experience that qualify you for this position. I am the most experienced PSC candidate in years. I was a Senior Executive with the U.S. Department of Energy and have more than 20 years experience in developing and implementing energy policies and energy program management. I have significant experience at the regional and national level promoting renewable energy technology programs (i.e., solar, biomass), energy efficiency technologies and practices and conservation (i.e., Energy Star, Weatherization Assistance Program). My undergraduate degree is in Accounting and I have a MBA.\> Commodity prices for energy are rising dramatically. What role should the PSC play in mitigating these increases? Georgia relies primarily on coal to generate electricity. I plan to interest the State's utilities in diversifying the fuel sources for electricity so that price volatility for a particular fuel will not impact ratepayers severely. Focusing more on using renewable energy sources produced in Georgia creates jobs and keeps dollars in the State's economy. Georgia needs to pay more attention to energy efficiency. Reducing demand and mitigating the rising price of energy resources can best be achieved through energy efficiency and conservation.\> Many would say that telecommunications is a fully competitive business. Should the PSC continue to be involved in telecommunications regulations, why or why not? Any further deregulation of telecommunications in Georgia would likely require legislation by the General Assembly, where this topic has been debated since early 1990. Under 1995 legislation, the role of the PSC changed to only establishing and administering a universal access fund, monitoring rates and service quality, and mediating disputes between telecommunications competitors. Recalling the problems that resulted from deregulating retail natural gas service, we should proceed with caution in further deregulating telecommunications.\Pam Davidson\> Party: Republican\> Occupation: Renewable Energy Consultant\> Age: 45\> Education: B.S. Organizational Behavior University of San Francisco\> Family: One daughter age 14, two dogs, one cat, one horse\> Web site: pamdavidson.org\> E-mail: pamdavidson@tds.net\> Why I'm running for office: I am seeking the position because I am very concerned about our ability to provide clean, affordable energy in the state. \> In your opinion, what, if any changes are needed in Georgia's energy policy? We need to our maximize our energy efficiency and renewable energy potential. We have made very little ground in either area. If elected,I will ask that the Demand Side Management Group review and improve upon thier recommendations to the PSC and set forth a resolution to create a Renewable Energy Working group to develop immediate and significant goals for affordable renewable energy. \We need to evaluate our energy resources in light of water resources and air quality. \> How would you work to fix inefficiencies and divisions within the five member commission? Regarding divisiveness: I would encourage and employ an attitude of mutual respect. I would make every effort to listen and understand all parties and conduct myself with dignity and selflessness. \Regarding inefficiencies: I would encourage a culture of positive, future-oriented leadership in which the PSC is not a reactionary body (simply hearing and reacting to the entities we regulate)but acts confidently towards meeting established goals. \> Describe the education and experience that qualify you for this position. As an renewable energy advocate, I have had the priviledge of earning the respect of lawmakers and policy experts. Hence, I can 'hit the ground running' in order to facilitate comprehensive energy policy reform. I work well with both the environmental and business community. Recent evidence of this is the successful passsage of HB 670 (the state's first comprehensive energy efficiency and renewable energy bill) which was recently signed by the Governor. I initiated this bill in order to incentivize progressive changes in energy policy. \> Commodity prices for energy are rising dramatically. What role should the PSC play in mitigating these increases?\Firstly, we need to reduce our per capita energy usage. Less demand means less fuel. \Secondly, we need to quickly develop renewable energy resources so that we are not dependent on global fuel prices. Our greatest resource for affordable renewable energy is biomass. We can provide both electricity and biofuels (such as synthetic diesel) as a 'value add') from such facilities. \> Many would say that telecommunications is a fully competitive business. Should the PSC continue to be involved in telecommunications regulations, why or why not?\I believe the PSC should continue to regulate telecommunications. As I travel the state, many Georgians have shared with me the difficulties they have experienced with their telephone service and I believe there is still a need to protect the consumer and to improve service in rural areas. \Lauren W.

Two children: Adam and Jessica\> Web site: www.dale08.com\> E-mail: www.dale@dale08.com\> Why I'm running for office: As a veteran investigative reporter with WSB, I've met thousands of Georgians from all over the state, Democrats, Independents and Republicans who all told me the same thing. They said ""Dale, just once, I'd like to have the chance to vote for an honest person, a truth teller, who won't be controlled by special interests. Someone who'll work for real people like me.""\I'm running to give Georgians the chance to do just that.\> Our country is facing significant issues with rising food and energy costs. What would you propose to address these issues? Most elected officials no longer work for us. They work for special interests that fund their campaigns then control their votes. \I am the only leading Senate candidate who's refusing the special interest ""PAC"" money that's stolen your government and keeps your voice from being heard.\I will oppose big oil, promote energy alternatives and help convert Georgia pine to cellulosic ethanol to combat the ridiculous price of gasoline. Driving down the cost of fuel is the key to making food more affordable for the hard working people of Georgia.\> Party and philosophical differences have resulted in budget and policy deadlock in the past. If elected, how will you specifically work with colleagues to achieve results on the tough issues? TV shows distract us with circus-like debates between the ""R's and the ""D's"". Truth is, the prime source of gridlock is the ""P,"" or ""PAC"" money system. We can't fix health care, secure our borders, free ourselves from foreign oil or heal our economy because the giant special interests that control politicians won't allow those reforms to take place. I agree with Barack Obama. The moment we break the stranglehold lobbyists and special interests have on Washington, we WILL be able to move forward on the common sense reforms Americans support.\> What experience to set policy for our country do you bring to the job? For 23 years I've gone behind the lines of power and government to uncover and report the truth. Together we've fought countless battles and share the scars. But that's not enough. The Senate requires integrity, the ability to listen to all sides, an old-fashioned work ethic and the courage to lead. Angie Cardwell, the love of my life, mother of our 2 kids, hospice nurse and my wife for 22 years, will tell you this: my only motive in this effort is to give you what you truly deserve; the chance for clean, transparent and honest government.\Vernon Jones\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Chief Executive Officer, Dekalb County\> Age: 47\> Education: BA, Business Admin., North Carolina Central Univ.; graduate, Harvard JFK School of Government Exec. Prog.\> Family: No response \> Web site: www.vernonjonesforgeorgia.com/home.html\> E-mail: vernon@vernonjonesforgeorgia.com\> Why I'm running for office: As a former Georgia Legislator and now as CEO of Dekalb County I have crucial experience in writing the law and running a large metropolitan government. I am actively involved in creating jobs, balancing budgets, improving infrastructure, providing homeland security, maintaining low taxes and setting public policy. I have had to provide local solutions to national problems and am in touch with the concerns and issues that everyday Americans are experiencing.\> Our country is facing significant issues with rising food and energy costs. What would you propose to address these issues? Food price increases are tied to fuel costs increases. Fuel costs increase because of our dependence on foreign oil and reliance on a singular source of energy. We should pursue mandates on the automobile industry that require the production of vehicles that get more miles per gallon. We need to think about energy independence and pursue solar, wind and biofuel as alternative energy sources. As we invest in this technology we invest our people and economy. In turn energy diversity we will create jobs, and boost our economy.\> Party and philosophical differences have resulted in budget and policy deadlock in the past. If elected, how will you specifically work with colleagues to achieve results on the tough issues? It is important regardless of party affiliation for elected officials to work across the aisle for the benefit of our citizens. As a Chief Executive Officer of Dekalb County, when we dispatch our public service, conduct infrastructure improvements, build parks and create jobs we do not ask for party affiliation. Our job as elected officials is to provide solutions for the citizens of this country. I believe that bipartisanship is the best dose of medicine for Washington right now. \> What experience to set policy for our country do you bring to the job? I was responsible for introducing, passing laws and setting public policy for over 16 years as a State legislator and as CEO for DeKalb County. I bring the experience of both local and state policy setting to the US Senate. As a law maker I think about what is good for the people, democrat or republican. The state of Georgia deserves a US Senator committed to action and positive change. It's about getting things done.\Rand Knight\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Businessman/ecologist\> Age: 36\> Education: Ph.D, Ecosystems Analysis, M.S. Ecology/Forestry, B.A. Environmental Studies\> Family: Wife Linda; two children, Ellie Lu (3) and Thomas (1).\> Web site: www.knightforsenate.com\> E-mail: info@knightforsenate.com\> Why I'm running for office: The economy, healthcare system and environment of Georgia and our country have changed for the worse; it's time for a new direction. Georgians' needs are not being met, but I am ready to listen. Finally, I have the energy and the fresh perspective to go to Washington, D.C. and get things done.\> Our country is facing significant issues with rising food and energy costs. What would you propose to address these issues? A cornerstone of my campaign, the ""Green Deal,"" would create hundreds of thousands of jobs, and reduce energy costs and pollution while increasing energy efficiency and independence. I will support a Strategic Energy Fund that sponsors the research, development and deployment of renewable energy, energy efficiency and biofuels. Additionally, with a new, clean, cost-efficient infrastructure, food prices will decrease, as it will cost less to process and transport food to its final destination.\> Party and philosophical differences have resulted in budget and policy deadlock in the past. If elected, how will you specifically work with colleagues to achieve results on the tough issues? Like many Georgians and Americans, I am frustrated by the constant bickering and divisive fighting in Washington, D.C. Politicians seem more interested in choosing sides than solving problems for their constituents. I draw inspiration from former Georgia senator, Sam Nunn, who reached across party lines and focused on making Georgia and America stronger. I aim to promote a real change that involves dialogue - not bickering - and that always keeps the American people's interests at heart. \> What experience to set policy for our country do you bring to the job? In my years as a businessman in technology and consulting, I have developed a skill for diagnosing difficult problems and proposing innovative solutions. My background in science and ecology gives me \a key understanding of our energy crisis and how to solve it. Listening thoughtfully to all sides of an issue allows me to truly grasp a problem, craft a solution, and understand how to implement it. I am ready to use my expertise and problem-solving experience in the service of my home state.\Josh Lanier\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Former Senate staff member, retired businessman and writer.\> Age: 55\> Education: Attended Georgia Southern University\> Family: Married to Lynne 30 years, father of Heather, Brooke, Josh and Robert.\> Web site: www.JoshLanier.com\> E-mail: josh@joshlanier.com\> Why I'm running for office: I am standing for election to the U.S. Senate to retore our most basic right of a fair and free election by setting the example of a clean campaign, promoting public funding for and reform of elections, and to represent the voice of all Georgians.\> Our country is facing significant issues with rising food and energy costs. What would you propose to address these issues? The two issues are directly related. Food cost inflation is driven by spiraling energy costs that are rooted in a weak dollar and our addiction to oil, exacerbated by our current mandates for corn ethanol. Every American feels this inflation, whether in the cost of milk or even pizza, and its impact is worldwide and dangerous. America and the world need a visionary energy policy based on a combination of existing, new and sustainable technologies.\> Party and philosophical differences have resulted in budget and policy deadlock in the past. If elected, how will you specifically work with colleagues to achieve results on the tough issues? The deadlock that continues to this day has been caused less by party or philosophical differences and more by special interests and the money they bring to campaigns. There is a reason we don't have universal health care or a visionary energy policy or an answer to the foreclosure crisis. That reason is money and special interests. When we have public financing of elections, we will have more legislators free to work together for the benefit of the country.\> What experience to set policy for our country do you bring to the job? I have served my country for 38 years. I enlisted in the Army on my 18th birthday, served in Viet Nam, as a staff member in both the U.S. Senate and House, as a non-profit CEO and was later co-founder of an environmental company. I have visited with leaders throughout the United States and in over 40 countries. I have more years of experience working in and with the United States Senate than all the other candidates combined. These are the life experiences I would bring to the United States Senate.\Jim Martin\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Attorney\> Age: 62\> Education: University of Georgia, A.B.; J.D.; LL.M. Georgia State University, M.B.A . \> Family: Wife Joan, four children, three grandchildren. \> Web site: www.martinforsenate.com\> E-mail: jim@martinforsenate.com\> Why I'm running for office: President Bush and Saxby Chambliss have lost touch with what's going in Iraq and here at home. Something's wrong when we're spending $50 billion a month in Iraq while the price of gas and groceries keep rising for American families. It's time to start doing more to help the middle class.\> Our country is facing significant issues with rising food and energy costs. What would you propose to address these issues? The Bush Administration's economic policies have been disastrous for American families. The cost of living is skyrocketing while incomes are stagnating. Now, more than ever, middle class Americans need to keep more of what they earn. \To lower energy prices, we need to encourage development of alternative fuels, require oil companies to invest some of their record profits into new clean refineries to increase supply, and find ways to encourage conservation - particularly when it comes to transportation. \> Party and philosophical differences have resulted in budget and policy deadlock in the past. If elected, how will you specifically work with colleagues to achieve results on the tough issues? In the State Legislature, I developed a reputation for bipartisanship. I was frequently able to bring members of both parties together, help them resolve their differences, and get important legislation passed. \We need this kind of approach in Washington again. We need an independent-minded Senator who can stand up to his own party and president when they're wrong, if necessary, and someone who can find common ground with those who have different viewpoints.\> What experience to set policy for our country do you bring to the job? In my 35 years of public service, I have a strong record of accomplishment for middle class Georgia families. I served for nearly two decades in the Georgia House of Representatives, where I worked on issues like health care and consumer protection. I was also a leader in the effort to create PeachCare, the program that provides health care to thousands of Georgia's children. I later led the Department of Human Resources under both Democratic and Republican governors.\U.S. House, Georgia District 13\Donzella James\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Retired federal employee\> Age: 59 \> Education: Morris Brown College, Atlanta School of Art\> Family: Married for 39 years to Elmo James. 2 sons (1 deceased) and 2 grandchildren \> Web site: donzellajames4congress.com\> E-mail: dzella@bellsouth.net\> Why I'm running for office: The citizens of the 13th district asked me to run because they want a representative that actually resides within the district and who is directly affected by the decisions made on all levels of government within the district. They said that they wanted someone who is accessible, hard working and willing to serve with integrity and honesty. Also, the voters indicated that their concerns were not being articulated and their needs were not being met.\> Georgia's economy is suffering along with much of the nation. What specific proposals will you advocate to bring jobs to Georgia and help grow our state's economy? I will focus on Georgia's unique renewable resources and work to attract the alternative fuels industry to Georgia by working through the Georgia Department of Economic Development and the Georgia Department of Technical and Adult education for 'green jobs' training as described in Title X of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 to create a 'green jobs' corridor throughout the State and leverage the professional research, resources and personnel found throughout our great State. \> What do you see as the role of the Federal Government in protecting Georgia's environment, especially in terms of air and water quality? It is the job of the federal government to create a minimum standard but we should not rely on Washington to maintain air and water quality in Georgia. That is the job of Georgia's citizenry and officials. I advocate 'waste to energy' campaigns to reduce the amount of renewable energy resources that end up in Georgia landfills and working with the EPA to reduce diesel emissions from State fleet vehicles which will go a long way in enhancing overall health in our State.\David Scott\> Party: Democratic\(No other information for this candidate was received by publication deadline)\Georgia House, District 20\Charlice Byrd\> Party: Republican\> Occupation: Homemaker\> Age: 56\> Education: B.A., Elementary Education\> Family: Husband, Michael\> Web site: byrdforhouse.com\> E-mail: byrdforhouse@gmail.com\> Why I'm running for office: Because I represent the conservative values of Cherokee County -- less government, lower taxes, personal responsibilty and liberty and justice for all. I believe in the power of ""we the people"" and their inherent goodness, and the values they believe in. \> What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see? I believe it is time for Georgia to take the lead on the fair tax.\> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? Government accountability. I will continue to work on the Government Accountability Act to sunset departments, agencies, authorities and commissions. Under this proposal, the sunset committee would review and recommend changes to the mission, a merger with other departments or agencies, a total repeal of the entity or a refocus of responsibilities. This is a much needed mechanism for a relatively transparent and regular evaluation of state government's operations.\Shawn T. O'Rourke\> Party: Republican\> Occupation: Businessman\> Age: 36\> Education: B.S., Economics; M.B.A.\> Family: Wife Denise; Son Shawn Jr, 11; Daughters Kennady, 8, and Karrington, 8\> Web site: www.ShawnORourkeSR.com\> E-mail: shawn@shawnorourkesr.com\> Why I'm running for office: All of my adult life, I have excercised my passion for leadership and service. I maintain a core belief that those who are blessed with the opportunity to give back to their community have an obligation to do so. I believe it is time to restore strong and honorable leadership to the 20th District.\> What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see? During the 2008 legislative session, nine separate tax reform plans were proposed. It will require a collaborative effort to develop a comprehensive plan that effectively captures the best components of each idea to build a consensus. I support icnreased local control of our government that returns our tax dollars directly back to our communities from where they were derived.\> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? While Georgia provides an enviable environment to live and work and remains a growing and thriving state, our weaknesses in transportation and education must be addressed with comprehensive long-term solutions. I am a firm believer that solutions are found by soliciting input from the experts in the field and then providing the resources to enable them to implement these solutions.\Georgia House, District 22\Sean Jerguson\> Party: Republican\> Occupation: Business Owner\> Age: 36\> Education: B.S., Kennesaw State College;\M.P.A. Kennesaw State University\> Family: Wife Kate,\Children Claire and Eli\> Web site: www.electsean.com\> E-mail: sean@electsean.com\> Why I'm running for office: To provide conservative leadership through service so our community continues to be an excellent place to live and raise a family. \> What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see? I would like to see our state move to a Fair Tax system. This would include eliminating the current state tax code, replacing it with a consumption tax on goods and services.\> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? My top priority is to promote and implement a regional approach to transportation. I will do two things to achieve this goal. First, I will work closely with existing agencies and commissions to have them refocus their efforts along these lines. Second, I will support and sponsor legislation that enables local governments to identify transportation needs and implement solutions.\Mary Elizabeth Wilhite\> Party: Republican\> Occupation: Director of Faith Center for Community Development\> Age: 49\> Education: B.S., Howard University, Washington, DC.\> Family: Marvin Wilhite, married 23 years\> Web site: www.votemary.us\> E-mail: mary@votemary.us\> Why I'm running for office: Because I am not a politician, I am a public servant,. I have the ability to listen and respond to the needs of all constituents and provide a principle new voice at the State Capitol. I believe strongly that I can truly make a difference for the community I call home. Key Issues that the district face are traffic and transportation, managing growth, local control of education, keeping taxes low and supporting families. \> What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see? I support the National Fair Tax and other tax policies that simplify taxes and reduce the number of bureaucrats needed to administer tax policy. Congressmen John Linder, the author of the Fair Tax, has endorsed my campaign. I believe the district 22 incumbent's approach of shifting tax burdens and using tax gimmicks are simply election year politics. In general, lower taxes for both individuals and businesses would encourage our economy to grow. Tax policy should be fair and not penalize people who work hard and save for their future.\> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? Traffic, education, and taxes would be my top priorities. I support road expansion where appropriate, additional road construction, and incentives for businesses that offer telecommuting. Educational standards and expectations should be set higher statewide, with successful school districts given more control over resources and personnel Tax policy should be simple and fair, and taxes cut or eliminated where possible, which would help our economy grow.\Georgia House, District 33\Michael Smith\> Party: Democratic\(No other information for this candidate was received by publication deadline)\Don Wix\> Party: Democratic\(No other information for this candidate was received by publication deadline)\Georgia House, District 36\Tammy Bailey Rohner \> Party: Republican (No other information for this candidate was received by publication deadline)\Earl Ehrhart \> Party: Republican (No other information for this candidate was received by publication deadline)\Public Service Commissioner, Dist. 1 Southern\Rick Collum\> Party: Republican\> Occupation: Attorney and magistrate judge\> Age: 38\> Education: Juris Doctorate; B.A. in Sociology\B.S. in Criminal Justice\> Family: Wife of 15 years Donna Collum; two children 9 and 7\> Web site: No response \> E-mail: rickcollum2000@yahoo.com\> Why I'm running for office: I am running for the Georgia Public Service Commission in order to serve the people of Georgia by helping to facilitate safe and affordable energy by combining traditional sources of energy such as natural gas and nuclear power with renewable energy sources such as solar, wind and landfill gas.

Monthly payments for electric, natural gas, and phone are taking ever increasing scarce cash. \America has always positively responded to scarcity with technology. As a professional engineer and DOD supervisor, I am trained in technical problems experienced by our utilities. Encouraging competition without collusion, and wringing excess from the production system will better our utility rates and supply.\> In your opinion, what, if any changes are needed in Georgia's energy policy? While we don't experience roving brownouts like California, or sky-high energy prices, we can do more.\We can set cash incentives for conservation measures, including weatherization/insulation, digital thermostats, high efficiency furnaces, water heaters and air conditioners. We can encourage cooling ponds for several antiquated coal power plants that drain water mercilessly from our dwindling lakes. We can lower rates by encouraging new technology, not blind reliance on fossil fuel.\> How would you work to fix inefficiencies and divisions within the five member commission? The PSC ensures that Georgians pay the lowest rates for their utility services, while maintaining viable suppliers. All commissioners must be on the same page with this mandate. Except for personnel matters, meetings must be open to the public, including rights of all parties to speak. No more 'good ole boy' politics. Every area the PSC governs: electric, gas, phone, common carriers, to have two commissioners concerned full-time with that area, reporting biweekly to the others.\> Describe the education and experience that qualify you for this position. I am a Registered Professional Engineer for 25 years in 3 states, including 20 years in Georgia. Former Department of Defense positions include Chief of Power/Lighting, and Chief of Process Engineering.\My education includes a BScElecEngin, an MScMechEngin (GA Tech), an MScPhysics (GA Tech), and an executive MBA.\The PSC is concerned with such technical topics as underground piping infrastructure and complex power generation schemes. We need an engineer looking out for Georgian's interests.\> Commodity prices for energy are rising dramatically. What role should the PSC play in mitigating these increases? If we rely exclusively on fossil fuels, we are at the mercy of OPEC and the energy barons. In the long run, we must develop alternative sources, including increased nuclear, solar, and wind power. In the short run, we must encourage conservation measures, including proper insulation/weatherization, high efficiency air conditions, furnaces, and water heaters. Cash incentives for conversion, costly in the short run, pays rich dividends both to families and to our secure energy infrastructure.\Jim Powell\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Independent energy consultant to states, local governments and industry.\> Age: 59\> Education: B.B.A., M.B.A., University of North Florida.

I have worked with State PSCs across the country in efforts to implement energy efficiency practices, increasing use of renewable energy and promoting conservation. I have served our Nation for over 35 years and being elected to the PSC is the next chapter in my public service career.\> In your opinion, what, if any changes are needed in Georgia's energy policy? Georgia does not have a comprehensive State Energy Policy that addresses all aspects of energy supply and demand. The Georgia Environmental Facilities Authority published the State Energy Strategy in December 2007 which was developed in a collaborative manner with extensive stakeholder input. The Governor's Energy Challenge 2020 and Conserve Georgia are both efforts at efficiency and conservation. These two initiatives, along with State Energy Strategy should be used as the basic framework to develop a comprehensive State Energy Policy.\> How would you work to fix inefficiencies and divisions within the five member commission? One of my strongest attributes is the ability to bring people together who possess different perspectives and get them to reach a consensus. During my 35 year career, I worked for 7 different Presidential administrations. I was able to work with the political and career leadership towards common goals. I plan on using this experience to work in partnership with my fellow Commissioners to advance the mission of the PSC and thereby ensure that the citizens of Georgia get a fair deal for the utility services they purchase. \> Describe the education and experience that qualify you for this position. I am the most experienced PSC candidate in years. I was a Senior Executive with the U.S. Department of Energy and have more than 20 years experience in developing and implementing energy policies and energy program management. I have significant experience at the regional and national level promoting renewable energy technology programs (i.e., solar, biomass), energy efficiency technologies and practices and conservation (i.e., Energy Star, Weatherization Assistance Program). My undergraduate degree is in Accounting and I have a MBA.\> Commodity prices for energy are rising dramatically. What role should the PSC play in mitigating these increases? Georgia relies primarily on coal to generate electricity. I plan to interest the State's utilities in diversifying the fuel sources for electricity so that price volatility for a particular fuel will not impact ratepayers severely. Focusing more on using renewable energy sources produced in Georgia creates jobs and keeps dollars in the State's economy. Georgia needs to pay more attention to energy efficiency. Reducing demand and mitigating the rising price of energy resources can best be achieved through energy efficiency and conservation.\Pam Davidson\> Party: Republican\> Occupation: Renewable energy consultant\> Age: 45\> Education: B.S. Organizational Behavior University of San Francisco\> Family: One daughter age 14, two dogs, one cat, one horse\> Web site: pamdavidson.org\> E-mail: pamdavidson@tds.net\> Why I'm running for office: I am seeking the position because I am very concerned about our ability to provide clean, affordable energy in the state. \> In your opinion, what, if any changes are needed in Georgia's energy policy? We need to our maximize our energy efficiency and renewable energy potential. We have made very little ground in either area. If elected,I will ask that the Demand Side Management Group review and improve upon thier recommendations to the PSC and set forth a resolution to create a Renewable Energy Working group to develop immediate and significant goals for affordable renewable energy. \We need to evaluate our energy resources in light of water resources and air quality. \> How would you work to fix inefficiencies and divisions within the five member commission? Regarding divisiveness: I would encourage and employ an attitude of mutual respect. I would make every effort to listen and understand all parties and conduct myself with dignity and selflessness. \Regarding inefficiencies: I would encourage a culture of positive, future-oriented leadership in which the PSC is not a reactionary body (simply hearing and reacting to the entities we regulate)but acts confidently towards meeting established goals. \> Describe the education and experience that qualify you for this position. As an renewable energy advocate, I have had the priviledge of earning the respect of lawmakers and policy experts. Hence, I can 'hit the ground running' in order to facilitate comprehensive energy policy reform. I work well with both the environmental and business community. Recent evidence of this is the successful passsage of HB 670 (the state's first comprehensive energy efficiency and renewable energy bill) which was recently signed by the Governor. I initiated this bill in order to incentivize progressive changes in energy policy. \> Commodity prices for energy are rising dramatically. What role should the PSC play in mitigating these increases?\Firstly, we need to reduce our per capita energy usage. Less demand means less fuel. \Secondly, we need to quickly develop renewable energy resources so that we are not dependent on global fuel prices. Our greatest resource for affordable renewable energy is biomass. We can provide both electricity and biofuels (such as synthetic diesel) as a 'value add') from such facilities. \Lauren W.

89,"Voters in the July 15 primaries can choose among six candidates for two spots on the Georgia Public Service Commission. Two Democrats and two Republicans are vying for the vacant District 4 seat, and the District 1 incumbent faces one challenger.\Commissioners are elected statewide and serve six-year terms. They make $116,452 a year.\Opponents will square off today at Georgia Public Broadcasting's headquarters as part of 10 state primary debates sponsored by the Atlanta Press Club. All are open to the public. The PSC debates will be streamed live at gpb.com.\Here's a rundown of the candidates as well as their responses to what they think about Georgia's energy future.\PRIMER ON LOW-PROFILE AGENCY\What is the PSC?\A five-member panel that oversees electric and natural gas utilities as well as the telephone companies and some transportation companies that operate in Georgia. Those firms include Georgia Power, AGL Resources and AT&T.\What does it do?\Sets rates that customers pay on their monthly utility bills, with some exceptions. Natural gas marketers' prices do not require approval but may be investigated for fairness. Also, certain telecom services such as cable television, high-speed Internet and cellphone rates are not regulated by the PSC. When determining rates, commissioners are supposed to weigh fairness to consumers and companies' return on investment.\Upcoming major decisions\A vote next year on Georgia Power's request to build two additional nuclear reactors at Plant Vogtle, and a decision in 2010 on Atlanta Gas Light's anticipated rate hike request.\PSC DISTRICT 1\Republican primary\Rick Collum \Age: 38\Home: Moultrie\Occupation: Attorney\""We have to use all of the means that are feasible but that work for the environment. We have to use what we have that is financially feasible. Biomass [wood chips, chicken feed and other agricultural by-products] does a great deal for everyone, including the farmers of South Georgia. Biomass is not going to be able to sustain our energy needs, but it can optimize energy up to 10 percent.""\Doug Everett (Incumbent)\Age: 70\Home: Albany\""Coal is a good fuel, in my opinion. However the carbon footprint is much greater on it than anything else, and the cost is going sky high. With the new technologies coming out everyday on coal, it's getting cleaner. I'm trying to be pro-nuclear. It is the cleanest, the safest, the cheapest and the most reliable form of electricity that we have.""\Democratic primary\No candidates\PSC DISTRICT 4\Republican primary\Pam Davidson \Age: 44\Home: Blue Ridge\Occupation: Renewable-energy consultant \""I am very concerned about the cost of energy going up very soon. We have to implement some demand-side management [more efficient production]. It's as simple as that.""\Lauren McDonald Jr. \Age: 69\Home: Clarkesville\Occupation: Businessman and former Public Service commissioner\""I am very pro-nuclear. We've got to get that started. It's the cleanest energy source that we have that's affordable and operational in our state. I am appreciative of renewables whether it's wind or biofuel or solar, but we are not in an area that suggests that they are reliable. And the cost for what you look at per kilowatt basis, they are not competitive.""\Democratic primary\Bob Indech \Age: 53\Home: Norcross\Occupation: Engineer\""We have to try and promote some alternative energies, primarily wind power. It is a very good source for Georgia, particularly in the south where it's windy. I don't see any good long-term plans, any good long-term movements to actually ameliorate our fossil-fuel dependence.""\Jim Powell \Age: 59\Home: Hiawassee\Occupation: Retired from the U.S. Department of Energy's Atlanta regional office.\""I honestly believe that all of the fuel options should be on the table. I'm an advocate for renewables --- that's kind of what I did for a living. There's an opportunity to put more renewables into the mix as well as energy efficiency.""\CAPTION:\CAPTION:\CAPTION:\CAPTION:\CAPTION:\CAPTION:\Credit: STAFF"

The League has collected, compiled and coordinated all candidate information for this Guide. Responses are published exactly as they were submitted by the candidates, although some questions were deleted in print for lack of space (full responses are online).

Two children: Adam and Jessica\> Web site: www.dale08.com\> E-mail: www.dale@dale08.com\> Why I'm running for office: As a veteran investigative reporter with WSB, I've met thousands of Georgians from all over the state, Democrats, independents and Republicans who all told me the same thing. They said: ""Dale, just once, I'd like to have the chance to vote for an honest person, a truth teller, who won't be controlled by special interests. Someone who'll work for real people like me.""\I'm running to give Georgians the chance to do just that.\> Our country is facing significant issues with rising food and energy costs. What would you propose to address these issues? Most elected officials no longer work for us. They work for special interests that fund their campaigns, then control their votes. \I am the only leading Senate candidate who's refusing the special interest PAC money that's stolen your government and keeps your voice from being heard.\I will oppose Big Oil, promote energy alternatives and help convert Georgia pine to cellulosic ethanol to combat the ridiculous price of gasoline. Driving down the cost of fuel is the key to making food more affordable for the hardworking people of Georgia.\> Party and philosophical differences have resulted in budget and policy deadlock in the past. If elected, how will you specifically work with colleagues to achieve results on the tough issues? TV shows distract us with circuslike debates between the ""R's"" and the ""D's"". Truth is, the prime source of gridlock is the ""P,"" or ""PAC"" money system. We can't fix health care, secure our borders, free ourselves from foreign oil or heal our economy because the giant special interests that control politicians won't allow those reforms to take place. I agree with Barack Obama: The moment we break the stranglehold lobbyists and special interests have on Washington, we WILL be able to move forward on the common-sense reforms Americans support.\> What experience to set policy for our country do you bring to the job? For 23 years I've gone behind the lines of power and government to uncover and report the truth. Together we've fought countless battles and share the scars. But that's not enough. The Senate requires integrity, the ability to listen to all sides, an old-fashioned work ethic and the courage to lead. Angie Cardwell, the love of my life, mother of our two kids, hospice nurse and my wife for 22 years, will tell you this: My only motive in this effort is to give you what you truly deserve, the chance for clean, transparent and honest government. \Vernon Jones\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Chief executive officer, DeKalb County\> Age: 47\> Education: Bachelor of Arts, business administration,North Carolina Central Univ.; \graduate --- Harvard JFK School of Government Executive Program.\> Family: No response\> Web site: www.vernonjonesforgeorgia.com/home.html\> E-mail: vernon@vernonjonesforgeorgia.com\> Why I'm running for office: As a former Georgia legislator and now as CEO of DeKalb County, I have crucial experience in writing the law and running a large metropolitan government. I am actively involved in creating jobs, balancing budgets, improving infrastructure, providing homeland security, maintaining low taxes and setting public policy. I have had to provide local solutions to national problems and am in touch with the concerns and issues that everyday Americans are experiencing.\> Our country is facing significant issues with rising food and energy costs. What would you propose to address these issues? Food price increases are tied to fuel costs increases. Fuel costs increase because of our dependence on foreign oil and reliance on a singular source of energy. We should pursue mandates on the automobile industry that require the production of vehicles that get more miles per gallon. We need to think about energy independence and pursue solar, wind and biofuel as alternative energy sources. As we invest in this technology we invest our people and economy. In turn, energy diversity we will create jobs and boost our economy.\> Party and philosophical differences have resulted in budget and policy deadlock in the past. If elected, how will you specifically work with colleagues to achieve results on the tough issues? It is important regardless of party affiliation for elected officials to work across the aisle for the benefit of our citizens. As a chief executive officer of DeKalb County, when we dispatch our public service, conduct infrastructure improvements, build parks and create jobs, we do not ask for party affiliation. Our job as elected officials is to provide solutions for the citizens of this country. I believe that bipartisanship is the best dose of medicine for Washington right now. \> What experience to set policy for our country do you bring to the job? I was responsible for introducing, passing laws and setting public policy for over 16 years as a state legislator and as CEO for DeKalb County. I bring the experience of both local and state policy setting to the U.S. Senate. As a lawmaker, I think about what is good for the people, Democrat or Republican. The state of Georgia deserves a U.S. senator committed to action and positive change. It's about getting things done.\Rand Knight\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Businessman/ecologist\> Age: 36\> Education: Doctorate, ecosystems analysis; Masters of Science, ecology/forestry: Bachelor of Arts, environmental studies\> Family: Wife, Linda; two children, Ellie Lu (3) and Thomas (1).\> Web site: www.knightforsenate.com\> E-mail: info@knightforsenate.com\> Why I'm running for office: The economy, health care system and environment of Georgia and our country have changed for the worse; it's time for a new direction. Georgians' needs are not being met, but I am ready to listen. Finally, I have the energy and the fresh perspective to go to Washington, D.C., and get things done.\> Our country is facing significant issues with rising food and energy costs. What would you propose to address these issues? A cornerstone of my campaign, the ""Green Deal,"" would create hundreds of thousands of jobs and reduce energy costs and pollution while increasing energy efficiency and independence. I will support a Strategic Energy Fund that sponsors the research, development and deployment of renewable energy, energy efficiency and biofuels. Additionally, with a new, clean, cost-efficient infrastructure, food prices will decrease, as it will cost less to process and transport food to its final destination.\> Party and philosophical differences have resulted in budget and policy deadlock in the past. If elected, how will you specifically work with colleagues to achieve results on the tough issues? Like many Georgians and Americans, I am frustrated by the constant bickering and divisive fighting in Washington, D.C. Politicians seem more interested in choosing sides than solving problems for their constituents. I draw inspiration from former Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn, who reached across party lines and focused on making Georgia and America stronger. I aim to promote a real change that involves dialogue --- not bickering --- and that always keeps the American people's interests at heart. \> What experience to set policy for our country do you bring to the job? In my years as a businessman in technology and consulting, I have developed a skill for diagnosing difficult problems and proposing innovative solutions. My background in science and ecology gives me a key understanding of our energy crisis and how to solve it. Listening thoughtfully to all sides of an issue allows me to truly grasp a problem, craft a solution and understand how to implement it. I am ready to use my expertise and problem-solving experience in the service of my home state.\Josh Lanier\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Former Senate staff member, retired businessman and writer.\> Age: 55\> Education: Attended Georgia Southern University\> Family: Married to Lynne 30 years; four children, Heather, Brooke, Josh and Robert.\> Web site: www.JoshLanier.com\> E-mail: josh@joshlanier.com\> Why I'm running for office: I am standing for election to the U.S. Senate to retore our most basic right of a fair and free election by setting the example of a clean campaign, promoting public funding for and reform of elections, and to represent the voice of all Georgians.\> Our country is facing significant issues with rising food and energy costs. What would you propose to address these issues? The two issues are directly related. Food cost inflation is driven by spiraling energy costs that are rooted in a weak dollar and our addiction to oil, exacerbated by our current mandates for corn ethanol. Every American feels this inflation, whether in the cost of milk or even pizza, and its impact is worldwide and dangerous. America and the world need a visionary energy policy based on a combination of existing, new and sustainable technologies.\> Party and philosophical differences have resulted in budget and policy deadlock in the past. If elected, how will you specifically work with colleagues to achieve results on the tough issues? The deadlock that continues to this day has been caused less by party or philosophical differences and more by special interests and the money they bring to campaigns. There is a reason we don't have universal health care or a visionary energy policy or an answer to the foreclosure crisis. That reason is money and special interests. When we have public financing of elections, we will have more legislators free to work together for the benefit of the country.\> What experience to set policy for our country do you bring to the job? I have served my country for 38 years. I enlisted in the Army on my 18th birthday, served in Vietnam, as a staff member in both the U.S. Senate and House, as a nonprofit CEO and was later co-founder of an environmental company. I have visited with leaders throughout the United States and in over 40 countries. I have more years of experience working in and with the United States Senate than all the other candidates combined. These are the life experiences I would bring to the United States Senate.\Jim Martin\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Attorney\> Age: 62\> Education: University of Georgia, A.B.; J.D.; LL.M. Georgia State Univ., M.B.A . \> Family: Wife Joan, four children, and three grandchildren. \> Web site: www.martinforsenate.com\> E-mail: jim@martinforsenate.com\> Why I'm running for office: President Bush and Saxby Chambliss have lost touch with what's going on in Iraq and here at home. Something's wrong when we're spending $50 billion a month in Iraq while the price of gas and groceries keep rising for American families. It's time to start doing more to help the middle class.\> Our country is facing significant issues with rising food and energy costs. What would you propose to address these issues? The Bush administration's economic policies have been disastrous for American families. The cost of living is skyrocketing while incomes are stagnating. Now, more than ever, middle-class Americans need to keep more of what they earn. To lower energy prices, we need to encourage development of alternative fuels, require oil companies to invest some of their record profits into new clean refineries to increase supply, and find ways to encourage conservation --- particularly when it comes to transportation. \> Party and philosophical differences have resulted in budget and policy deadlock in the past. If elected, how will you specifically work with colleagues to achieve results on the tough issues? In the state Legislature, I developed a reputation for bipartisanship. I was frequently able to bring members of both parties together, help them resolve their differences, and get important legislation passed. We need this kind of approach in Washington again. We need an independent-minded senator who can stand up to his own party and president when they're wrong, if necessary, and someone who can find common ground with those who have different viewpoints.\> What experience to set policy for our country do you bring to the job? In my 35 years of public service, I have a strong record of accomplishment for middle-class Georgia families. I served for nearly two decades in the Georgia House of Representatives, where I worked on issues like health care and consumer protection. I was also a leader in the effort to create PeachCare, the program that provides health care to thousands of Georgia's children. I later led the Department of Human Resources under both Democratic and Republican governors.\U.S. House, Georgia District 13\Donzella James\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Retired federal employee\> Age: 59 \> Education: Morris Brown College and Atlanta School of Art\> Family: Married for 39 years to Elmo James. Two sons, (one deceased), and two grandchildren \> Web site: donzellajames4congress.com\> E-mail: dzella@bellsouth.net\> Why I'm running for office: The citizens of the 13th District asked me to run because they want a representative that actually resides within the district and who is directly affected by the decisions made on all levels of government within the district. They said that they wanted someone who is accessible, hardworking and willing to serve with integrity and honesty. Also, the voters indicated that their concerns were not being articulated and their needs were not being met.\> Georgia's economy is suffering along with much of the nation. What specific proposals will you advocate to bring jobs to Georgia and help grow our state's economy? I will focus on Georgia's unique renewable resources and work to attract the alternative fuels industry to Georgia by working through the Georgia Department of Economic Development and the Georgia Department of Technical and Adult Education for ""green jobs"" training as described in Title X of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 to create a ""green jobs"" corridor throughout the state and leverage the professional research, resources and personnel found throughout our great state.\> What measures would you recommend to control the influence of large campaign contributions over Congress? Campaign spending has become a multibillion-dollar business each election year. We must revisit and strengthen the Transparency and Accountability Act of 2006 focusing on leveling the playing field for all candidates. More oversight on campaign disclosures and ethics is needed to end compaign corruption. \> What do you see as the role of the federal government in protecting Georgia's environment, especially in terms of air and water quality? It is the job of the federal government to create a minimum standard but we should not rely on Washington to maintain air and water quality in Georgia. That is the job of Georgia's citizenry and officials. I advocate 'waste to energy' campaigns to reduce the amount of renewable energy resources that end up in Georgia landfills and working with the EPA to reduce diesel emissions from State fleet vehicles which will go a long way in enhancing overall health in our State.\David Scott\> Party: Democratic\(No other information for this candidate was received by publication deadline)\Georgia Senate, District 6\William D.

Between corruption, incompetence, and ulterior motives possessed by management, many of are schools are dysfunctional. With 20 years in the corporate world and now 15 years in the front lines of education, I see very clearly what the problems are and the answers for most.\When I entered the GA schools in 1958 we were 48th and now 50 years later we are still 48th.\GA doesn't have to accept this and frankly had better speak up or we will be 50th. \> The 2008 General Assembly has received significant criticism for failing to resolve critical issues of the state. If elected, what will you do to ensure better success in 2009 and future legislative sessions? Recently the AJC discussed the cozy relationship between the Bankers and legislation. A similar relationship also exists with the municipality/education/construction/lawyers/legislators groups. Just next door, Sandy Springs' two high schools were left in a shambles after this group razed them. What better example than Dan Weber, Chairman of the Senate Education committee not only supports, but also initiates and promotes the legislation to give education dollars back to developers. \> What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see? I think educational funding is headed in new directions before too long. They tried somewhat this year to no avail. The metro systems are awash with money and are wasting vast amounts while many of the South Georgia systems can't provide even the minimum. There at least has to be a cap put on property taxes. I'm not sure eliminating them entirely is appropriate, but stopping the increases is a must. \> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? My obvious priority is legislation working towards true quality education. The NCLB federal legislation is a great first attempt and needs to be refined and tweaked; but needs to be expanded. There have been several versions of Charter bills, but none will produce what all are seeking. Dan Weber just vetoed the most recent Charter bill this past legislative session. It was probably the only bill with any hope of creating these sought-after vibrant 'Charter School' everyone thinks were are creating now.\Dan Weber\> Party: Republican\(No other information for this candidate was received by publication deadline)\Georgia House, District 44\Sheila Jones\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Lockheed Martin Co. - Spares Procurement Customer Property Clerk (28 years)\> Age: 52\> Education: S.

Archer High; Frederick Douglass High; Clark College; Georgia State\> Family: Mother: Mrs. Darnella Jones; 1 Sister and 5 Brothers (I am the youngest)\> Web site: www.sheilajones.org\> E-mail: info@sheilajones.org\> Why I'm running for office: I'm running for re-election to continue to have a voice in the Legislature to pass meaningful legislation. I want a voice in improving the quality of life for residents in my district and for the people of Georgia. When I return, I will work on funding transportation, better health care, improving our educational system and environmental needs. I look forward to doing more to keep low income and senior citizens in their homes. Also, Georgia is in need of tougher laws for drunk drivers.\> The 2008 General Assembly has received significant criticism for failing to resolve critical issues of the state. If elected, what will you do to ensure better success in 2009 and future legislative sessions? All legislators, from the top leadership to the newest freshmen, must remember that we are here to represent the interests of all Georgians, not just serve our own political interests. The best legislation results from everyone having a seat at the table, and all viewpoints are heard.\I will reach across party lines to resolve some of the divisive conflicts that kept us from addressing several serious issues at the end of the 2008 session.\> What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see? Capping or freezing tax assessments will help bring some fairness to the property tax system and eliminate the 'back door' tax increases we have now. Our property owners are in need of relief from ad valorem tax increases. I am pleased that we passed (and I supported) HB 1273, which will expand employment opportunities by offering a $3,500 job tax credit for qualifying businesses in designated opportunity zones in Georgia.\> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? Transportation, Grady, Education, & Better Retirement for ""all"" Public School employees. Passing the regional option to fund transportation. A reliable, permanent funding source for Grady and other trauma care facilities. Restore state funding to local schools to give local property owners some relief. Provide our students & educators the needed tools for excellence. Allow all public school employees ""the option"" to join the Teachers Retirement System (to include bus drivers, lunchroom, and maintenance workers).\Steven D.

The community we live in is diverse and full of great potential. Whether it's Fulton County or Cobb County , I believe it's time to erase crime, drugs, and vagrancy. And together, I know we can take back our streets and make them safe for our children. This campaign is not about me. It's about us. It's about being part of a community that works together for change.\> The 2008 General Assembly has received significant criticism for failing to resolve critical issues of the state. If elected, what will you do to ensure better success in 2009 and future legislative sessions? If elected, I will push for more open government. I will bring the community back to the table of government. Make of the people for the people, and by the people more than just a phrase.\> What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see? I would like to see a section in the tax policy that would allow for property taxes on senior citizens, once they hit a certian age, to be frozen at that level. This would slow down the process of seniors losing there homes of 40 and 50 years.\> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results?

If elected, what will you do to ensure better success in 2009 and future legislative sessions? It is important for Legislators to realize that this is not about power or presence. It is about the issues that must be addressed to keep Georgia one of the most beautiful and comfortable states in America. My role would be to work on committees with that focus. I want to work with state officials that deliver results, are hard working and get things done. I will be a key player with a strong work ethic, an enduring attitude and zeal. This has been missing in our state house for quite sometime. It is time for new energy and change.\> What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see? I would not like to see any property tax increases. I would like a special tax to be implemented on property owners with run down properites. Higher entertainment, cigarette and alcohol tax should be put in place. In addition, I would like to create an IMMIGRATION tax imposed on ALL illegal Immigrants in Georgia.\> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? My top priority would be education. All the monies that have been 'borrowed' by the Governor need to be returned and more money needs to be added. Teaching to the test is not good teaching. School uniforms should be mandatory, P.E. music and after school programs should be available at every school. More control of school policies etc,should be in the hands of local school boards and parents. The state Superintendant should be accountable to the legislature and should report progress accurately and often.\Chris Huttman\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Information Technology Manager\> Age: 28\> Education: 2003 BA Print Journalism Georgia State University\> Family: Single\Parents and brothers live in Atlanta, Athens and Augusta.\> Web site: www.chrishuttman.com/\> E-mail: chrishuttman@gmail.com\> Why I'm running for office: I am running for state representative to increase access to health care, improve educational opportunity and help to put into place a statewide transportation plan that will reduce congestion and fund more transportation alternatives such as mass transit.\> The 2008 General Assembly has received significant criticism for failing to resolve critical issues of the state. If elected, what will you do to ensure better success in 2009 and future legislative sessions? The culture at the General Assembly rewards political posturing and promotes those who shout the loudest but produce the fewest results. It has to change. I will bring together lawmakers and other interested policy groups in a bipartisan fashion to work one at a time on small solutions that can add up to positive change going forward. By focusing on accountability and openness at all levels of the lawmaking process we can begin to get back on track and make progress in the areas of education, health care, transportation and the environment.\> What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see? I favor tax decisions being made at the local level when possible. I was disturbed by the legislature's efforts to consolidate tax collection from local governments and school boards. One small but meaningful change I favor: the sales tax paid on gasoline should be devoted entirely to transportation. The 4th penny should be moved from the general fund (where it currently goes) to a fund dedicated to mass transit where it can be used to pay for rail, buses and other traffic alleviating solutions.\> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? I will work to expand Georgia's Pre-K program to include universal access so that every 4 year old can attend a quality program and get a true head start. I'll work to stop the austerity cuts to schools, $1.5 billion since 2002. I favor a statewide transportation plan that puts congestion and demand above politics in spending decisions and has funding for mass transportation and promotes high density development to alleviate traffic and give Georgians more flexible options in how and where they are able to live and work.\Right to Life Republican Referendum --- Forsyth\> Do you support an amendment to the Georgia State Constitution so as to provide that the paramount right to life is vested in each human from the moment of fertilization until a natural death?\County Charter Repulican Referendum --- Forsyth\> Should the county charter be revised to provide that County Commissioners and School Board members be elected by the voters in the respective districts?\School Voucher Republican Referendum --- Forsyth\> Do you support school choice in the form of a school voucher system?\Fair Tax Republican Referendum --- Forsyth\> Are you familiar with the Fair Tax Act?\Fair Tax Support Republican Referendum --- Forsyth\> Do you support the Fair Tax Act?\County Charter Democratic Referendum --- Forsyth\> Should the county charter be revised to provide that the County Commissioners and School Board members be elected by the voters in their respective districts?\County Golf Course Democratic Referendum --- Forsyth\> Should the county buy the plot of land known as Lanier Golf Course and keep it as a public golf course, placing it in the green space bond for the benefit of all?\Public Service Commissioner, Dist. 1 Southern\Rick Collum\> Party: Republican\> Occupation: Attorney and magistrate judge\> Age: 38\> Education: Juris Doctorate; B.A. in Sociology\B.S. in Criminal Justice\> Family: Wife of 15 years, Donna Collum; two children, 9 and 7\> Web site: No response\> E-mail: rickcollum2000@yahoo.com\> Why I'm running for office: I am running for the Georgia Public Service Commission in order to serve the people of Georgia by helping to facilitate safe and affordable energy by combining traditional sources of energy such as natural gas and nuclear power with renewable energy sources such as solar, wind and landfill gas.

Monthly payments for electric, natural gas, and phone are taking ever increasing scarce cash. \America has always positively responded to scarcity with technology. As a professional engineer and DOD supervisor, I am trained in technical problems experienced by our utilities. Encouraging competition without collusion, and wringing excess from the production system will better our utility rates and supply.\> In your opinion, what, if any changes are needed in Georgia's energy policy? While we don't experience roving brownouts like California, or sky-high energy prices, we can do more.\We can set cash incentives for conservation measures, including weatherization/insulation, digital thermostats, high efficiency furnaces, water heaters and air conditioners. We can encourage cooling ponds for several antiquated coal power plants that drain water mercilessly from our dwindling lakes. We can lower rates by encouraging new technology, not blind reliance on fossil fuel.\> How would you work to fix inefficiencies and divisions within the five member commission? The PSC ensures that Georgians pay the lowest rates for their utility services, while maintaining viable suppliers. All commissioners must be on the same page with this mandate. Except for personnel matters, meetings must be open to the public, including rights of all parties to speak. No more 'good ole boy' politics. Every area the PSC governs: electric, gas, phone, common carriers, to have two commissioners concerned full-time with that area, reporting biweekly to the others.\> Describe the education and experience that qualify you for this position. I am a Registered Professional Engineer for 25 years in 3 states, including 20 years in Georgia. Former Department of Defense positions include Chief of Power/Lighting, and Chief of Process Engineering.\My education includes a BScElecEngin, an MScMechEngin (GA Tech), an MScPhysics (GA Tech), and an executive MBA.\The PSC is concerned with such technical topics as underground piping infrastructure and complex power generation schemes. We need an engineer looking out for Georgian's interests.\> Commodity prices for energy are rising dramatically. What role should the PSC play in mitigating these increases? If we rely exclusively on fossil fuels, we are at the mercy of OPEC and the energy barons. In the long run, we must develop alternative sources, including increased nuclear, solar, and wind power. In the short run, we must encourage conservation measures, including proper insulation/weatherization, high efficiency air conditions, furnaces, and water heaters. Cash incentives for conversion, costly in the short run, pays rich dividends both to families and to our secure energy infrastructure.\Jim Powell\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Independent energy consultant to states, local governments and industry.\> Age: 59\> Education: BBA, MBA from the University of North Florida. Federal Executive Institute.\> Family: Married to Karen for 37years, 2 great sons and daughters in law, 2 adorable granddaughters\> Web site: jimpowellforgapsc.com\> E-mail: jimpowellforgapsc@gmail.com\> Why I'm running for office: It is my intent to be the consumer advocate and to keep consumers' interests a top priority while also understanding that the investor owned utilities are in business to make a profit for their shareholders. I have worked with State PSCs across the country in efforts to implement energy efficiency practices, increasing use of renewable energy and promoting conservation. I have served our Nation for over 35 years and being elected to the PSC is the next chapter in my public service career.\> In your opinion, what, if any changes are needed in Georgia's energy policy? Georgia does not have a comprehensive State Energy Policy that addresses all aspects of energy supply and demand. The Georgia Environmental Facilities Authority published the State Energy Strategy in December 2007 which was developed in a collaborative manner with extensive stakeholder input. The Governor's Energy Challenge 2020 and Conserve Georgia are both efforts at efficiency and conservation. These two initiatives, along with State Energy Strategy should be used as the basic framework to develop a comprehensive State Energy Policy.\> How would you work to fix inefficiencies and divisions within the five member commission? One of my strongest attributes is the ability to bring people together who possess different perspectives and get them to reach a consensus. During my 35 year career, I worked for 7 different Presidential administrations. I was able to work with the political and career leadership towards common goals. I plan on using this experience to work in partnership with my fellow Commissioners to advance the mission of the PSC and thereby ensure that the citizens of Georgia get a fair deal for the utility services they purchase. \> Describe the education and experience that qualify you for this position. I am the most experienced PSC candidate in years. I was a Senior Executive with the U.S. Department of Energy and have more than 20 years experience in developing and implementing energy policies and energy program management. I have significant experience at the regional and national level promoting renewable energy technology programs (i.e., solar, biomass), energy efficiency technologies and practices and conservation (i.e., Energy Star, Weatherization Assistance Program). My undergraduate degree is in Accounting and I have a MBA.\> Commodity prices for energy are rising dramatically. What role should the PSC play in mitigating these increases? Georgia relies primarily on coal to generate electricity. I plan to interest the State's utilities in diversifying the fuel sources for electricity so that price volatility for a particular fuel will not impact ratepayers severely. Focusing more on using renewable energy sources produced in Georgia creates jobs and keeps dollars in the State's economy. Georgia needs to pay more attention to energy efficiency. Reducing demand and mitigating the rising price of energy resources can best be achieved through energy efficiency and conservation.\Pam Davidson\> Party: Republican\> Occupation: Renewable Energy Consultant\> Age: 45\> Education: B.S. , Organizational Behavior, University of San Francisco\> Family: One daughter age 14, two dogs, one cat, one horse\> Web site: pamdavidson.org\> E-mail: pamdavidson@tds.net\> Why I'm running for office: I am seeking the position because I am very concerned about our ability to provide clean, affordable energy in the state. \> In your opinion, what, if any changes are needed in Georgia's energy policy? We need to our maximize our energy efficiency and renewable energy potential. We have made very little ground in either area. If elected,I will ask that the Demand Side Management Group review and improve upon thier recommendations to the PSC and set forth a resolution to create a Renewable Energy Working group to develop immediate and significant goals for affordable renewable energy. \We need to evaluate our energy resources in light of water resources and air quality. \> How would you work to fix inefficiencies and divisions within the five member commission? Regarding divisiveness: I would encourage and employ an attitude of mutual respect. I would make every effort to listen and understand all parties and conduct myself with dignity and selflessness. \Regarding inefficiencies: I would encourage a culture of positive, future-oriented leadership in which the PSC is not a reactionary body (simply hearing and reacting to the entities we regulate)but acts confidently towards meeting established goals. \> Describe the education and experience that qualify you for this position. As an renewable energy advocate, I have had the priviledge of earning the respect of lawmakers and policy experts. Hence, I can 'hit the ground running' in order to facilitate comprehensive energy policy reform. I work well with both the environmental and business community. Recent evidence of this is the successful passsage of HB 670 (the state's first comprehensive energy efficiency and renewable energy bill) which was recently signed by the Governor. I initiated this bill in order to incentivize progressive changes in energy policy. \> Commodity prices for energy are rising dramatically. What role should the PSC play in mitigating these increases?\Firstly, we need to reduce our per capita energy usage. Less demand means less fuel. \Secondly, we need to quickly develop renewable energy resources so that we are not dependent on global fuel prices. Our greatest resource for affordable renewable energy is biomass. We can provide both electricity and biofuels (such as synthetic diesel) as a 'value add') from such facilities. \Lauren W.

Two children: Adam and Jessica\> Web site: www.dale08.com\> E-mail: www.dale@dale08.com\> Why I'm running for office: As a veteran investigative reporter with WSB, I've met thousands of Georgians from all over the state, Democrats, Independents and Republicans who all told me the same thing. They said ""Dale, just once, I'd like to have the chance to vote for an honest person, a truth teller, who won't be controlled by special interests. Someone who'll work for real people like me.""\I'm running to give Georgians the chance to do just that.\> Our country is facing significant issues with rising food and energy costs. What would you propose to address these issues? Most elected officials no longer work for us. They work for special interests that fund their campaigns then control their votes. \I am the only leading Senate candidate who's refusing the special interest ""PAC"" money that's stolen your government and keeps your voice from being heard.\I will oppose big oil, promote energy alternatives and help convert Georgia pine to cellulosic ethanol to combat the ridiculous price of gasoline. Driving down the cost of fuel is the key to making food more affordable for the hard working people of Georgia.\> Do you believe that the United States has lost the respect of much of the international community, and if so, what would you propose to regain standing in the world? We are the world's beacon of hope and model for freedom. Repeated disclosures from Bush administration insiders show the lack of deliberation and intelligence gathering that has marked this administration's foreign policy, policy that has damaged the image we treasure as Lincoln's ""the last best hope of earth."" \As a long-time investigative reporter with a reputation of toughness, I understand the value of communication. We can restore our reputation. Communicating with conditions is not only wise, but follows bipartisan American precedent.\> Party and philosophical differences have resulted in budget and policy deadlock in the past. If elected, how will you specifically work with colleagues to achieve results on the tough issues? TV shows distract us with circus-like debates between the ""R's and the ""D's"". Truth is, the prime source of gridlock is the ""P,"" or ""PAC"" money system. We can't fix health care, secure our borders, free ourselves from foreign oil or heal our economy because the giant special interests that control politicians won't allow those reforms to take place. I agree with Barack Obama. The moment we break the stranglehold lobbyists and special interests have on Washington, we WILL be able to move forward on the common sense reforms Americans support.\> What is your solution to the issue of illegal immigration? Immigration should be based on the American dream. If you contribute to our economy but don't take an American's job, commit to learn English and assimilate, then you should have an equal chance to apply. At the same time, we must implement a foolproof document verification system employers must access before future workers can be hired. Employers will be prosecuted for hiring undocumented workers. Illegals already employed will not be fired or rounded up, but will have an incentive to go home, get in line, and legally pursue the dream.\> What experience to set policy for our country do you bring to the job? For 23 years I've gone behind the lines of power and government to uncover and report the truth. Together we've fought countless battles and share the scars. But that's not enough. The Senate requires integrity, the ability to listen to all sides, an old-fashioned work ethic and the courage to lead. Angie Cardwell, the love of my life, mother of our 2 kids, hospice nurse and my wife for 22 years, will tell you this: my only motive in this effort is to give you what you truly deserve; the chance for clean, transparent and honest government.\Vernon Jones\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Chief Executive Officer --- Dekalb County\> Age: 47\> Education: BA Business Admin.,NCCU\Graduate --- Harvard JFK School of Govt. Exec. Prog.\> Family: - no response -\> Web site: www.vernonjonesforgeorgia.com/home.html\> E-mail: vernon@vernonjonesforgeorgia.com\> Why I'm running for office: As a former Georgia Legislator and now as CEO of Dekalb County I have crucial experience in writing the law and running a large metropolitan government. I am actively involved in creating jobs, balancing budgets, improving infrastructure, providing homeland security, maintaining low taxes and setting public policy. I have had to provide local solutions to national problems and am in touch with the concerns and issues that everyday Americans are experiencing.\> Our country is facing significant issues with rising food and energy costs. What would you propose to address these issues? Food price increases are tied to fuel costs increases. Fuel costs increase because of our dependence on foreign oil and reliance on a singular source of energy. We should pursue mandates on the automobile industry that require the production of vehicles that get more miles per gallon. We need to think about energy independence and pursue solar, wind and biofuel as alternative energy sources. As we invest in this technology we invest our people and economy. In turn energy diversity we will create jobs, and boost our economy.\> Do you believe that the United States has lost the respect of much of the international community, and if so, what would you propose to regain standing in the world? Yes. I believe that the United States has lost the respect of much of the international community. We are also quickly losing our standing as the leader of the international free world. While we find ourselves in an increasingly precarious situation, we still have the capacity and opportunity to come together to maintain and build an even stronger America. I believe that the most important thing we can do is to work to rebuild our international relationships by increasing our diplomatic efforts.\> Party and philosophical differences have resulted in budget and policy deadlock in the past. If elected, how will you specifically work with colleagues to achieve results on the tough issues? It is important regardless of party affiliation for elected officials to work across the aisle for the benefit of our citizens. As a Chief Executive Officer of Dekalb County, when we dispatch our public service, conduct infrastructure improvements, build parks and create jobs we do not ask for party affiliation. Our job as elected officials is to provide solutions for the citizens of this country. I believe that bipartisanship is the best dose of medicine for Washington right now. \> What is your solution to the issue of illegal immigration? I believe that the problem of illegal immigration is exacerbated by an ineffective naturalization process. While I am opposed to amnesty and believe that we need to continue to secure the borders and enforce the law, I will work to ensure that the process to become a legal US citizen and obtain work permits becomes more efficient and effective. \> What experience to set policy for our country do you bring to the job? I was responsible for introducing, passing laws and setting public policy for over 16 years as a State legislator and as CEO for DeKalb County. I bring the experience of both local and state policy setting to the US Senate. As a law maker I think about what is good for the people, democrat or republican. The state of Georgia deserves a US Senator committed to action and positive change. It's about getting things done.\Rand Knight\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Businessman/Ecologist\> Age: 36\> Education: Ph.D Ecosystems Analysis, M.S. Ecology/Forestry, B.A. Environmental Studies\> Family: Wife: Linda; two children: Ellie Lu (3) and Thomas (1).\> Web site: www.knightforsenate.com\> E-mail: info@knightforsenate.com\> Why I'm running for office: The economy, healthcare system and environment of Georgia and our country have changed for the worse; it's time for a new direction. Georgians' needs are not being met, but I am ready to listen. Finally, I have the energy and the fresh perspective to go to Washington, D.C. and get things done.\> Our country is facing significant issues with rising food and energy costs. What would you propose to address these issues? A cornerstone of my campaign, the ""Green Deal,"" would create hundreds of thousands of jobs, and reduce energy costs and pollution while increasing energy efficiency and independence. I will support a Strategic Energy Fund that sponsors the research, development and deployment of renewable energy, energy efficiency and biofuels. Additionally, with a new, clean, cost-efficient infrastructure, food prices will decrease, as it will cost less to process and transport food to its final destination.\> Do you believe that the United States has lost the respect of much of the international community, and if so, what would you propose to regain standing in the world? The U.S. has lost the respect of the international community; we must regain it. First, we must steadfastly commit to diplomacy. Second, our involvement in Iraq must come to a close. Third, we must empower the United Nations to act on countries that abuse Human Rights; we must re-adhere to the Geneva Convention and stop our use of torture. Fourth, we must be a world leader in curbing global warming. Finally, we must work to eradicate poverty and deplorable living conditions worldwide.\> Party and philosophical differences have resulted in budget and policy deadlock in the past. If elected, how will you specifically work with colleagues to achieve results on the tough issues? Like many Georgians and Americans, I am frustrated by the constant bickering and divisive fighting in Washington, D.C. Politicians seem more interested in choosing sides than solving problems for their constituents. I draw inspiration from former Georgia senator, Sam Nunn, who reached across party lines and focused on making Georgia and America stronger. I aim to promote a real change that involves dialogue - not bickering - and that always keeps the American people's interests at heart.\> What is your solution to the issue of illegal immigration? We must first find fair and humane ways to deal with the current undocumented population; we must not dehumanize immigrants by employing mean-spirited rhetoric and initiatives. We can structure a law that grants eventual legal status to many of the undocumented immigrants living and working here. Additionally, to promote legal pathways to citizenship, we must punish employers who partake in illegal employment practices. Finally, we must work to better preserve the integrity of our borders. \> What experience to set policy for our country do you bring to the job? In my years as a businessman in technology and consulting, I have developed a skill for diagnosing difficult problems and proposing innovative solutions. My background in science and ecology gives me a key understanding of our energy crisis and how to solve it. Listening thoughtfully to all sides of an issue allows me to truly grasp a problem, craft a solution, and understand how to implement it. I am ready to use my expertise and problem-solving experience in the service of my home state.\Josh Lanier\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Former Senate staff member, retired businessman and writer.\> Age: 55\> Education: Attended Georgia Southern University\> Family: Married to Lynne 30 years, father of Heather, Brooke, Josh and Robert.\> Web site: www.JoshLanier.com\> E-mail: josh@joshlanier.com\> Why I'm running for office: I am standing for election to the U.S. Senate to retore our most basic right of a fair and free election by setting the example of a clean campaign, promoting public funding for and reform of elections, and to represent the voice of all Georgians.\> Our country is facing significant issues with rising food and energy costs. What would you propose to address these issues? The two issues are directly related. Food cost inflation is driven by spiraling energy costs that are rooted in a weak dollar and our addiction to oil, exacerbated by our current mandates for corn ethanol. Every American feels this inflation, whether in the cost of milk or even pizza, and its impact is worldwide and dangerous. America and the world need a visionary energy policy based on a combination of existing, new and sustainable technologies.\> Do you believe that the United States has lost the respect of much of the international community, and if so, what would you propose to regain standing in the world? Since 2000, I have traveled to over 40 countries to work with business and government leaders. Throughout the world, there is disappointment and anger with the Bush Administration, but there remains a friendship for the American people and hope for the promise that is America. As a nation, we can restore our relations with the rest of the world by returning to our values and leading by example.\> Party and philosophical differences have resulted in budget and policy deadlock in the past. If elected, how will you specifically work with colleagues to achieve results on the tough issues? The deadlock that continues to this day has been caused less by party or philosophical differences and more by special interests and the money they bring to campaigns. There is a reason we don't have universal health care or a visionary energy policy or an answer to the foreclosure crisis. That reason is money and special interests. When we have public financing of elections, we will have more legislators free to work together for the benefit of the country.\> What is your solution to the issue of illegal immigration? I support immigration reform that (1) repairs and brings our immigration policies and agencies into the 21st century, (2) enforces our employment laws, (3) offers a Pay My Debt to Society program whereby some here illegally but contributing to their communities can plead guilty to a misdemeanor with a significant fine, pay any back taxes owed, and then apply for established legal alien status under normal procedures, and (4) leaves the question of citizenship up to the application process as with any other immigrant.\> What experience to set policy for our country do you bring to the job? I have served my country for 38 years. I enlisted in the Army on my 18th birthday, served in Viet Nam, as a staff member in both the U.S. Senate and House, as a non-profit CEO and was later co-founder of an environmental company. I have visited with leaders throughout the United States and in over 40 countries. I have more years of experience working in and with the United States Senate than all the other candidates combined. These are the life experiences I would bring to the United States Senate.\Jim Martin\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Attorney\> Age: 62\> Education: University of Georgia, AB; JD; LL.M. Georgia State University, MBA . \> Family: Wife Joan, four children, and three grandchildren. \> Web site: www.martinforsenate.com\> E-mail: jim@martinforsenate.com\> Why I'm running for office: President Bush and Saxby Chambliss have lost touch with what's going in Iraq and here at home. Something's wrong when we're spending $50 billion a month in Iraq while the price of gas and groceries keep rising for American families. It's time to start doing more to help the middle class.\> Our country is facing significant issues with rising food and energy costs. What would you propose to address these issues? The Bush Administration's economic policies have been disastrous for American families. The cost of living is skyrocketing while incomes are stagnating. Now, more than ever, middle class Americans need to keep more of what they earn. \To lower energy prices, we need to encourage development of alternative fuels, require oil companies to invest some of their record profits into new clean refineries to increase supply, and find ways to encourage conservation - particularly when it comes to transportation.\> Do you believe that the United States has lost the respect of much of the international community, and if so, what would you propose to regain standing in the world? As the world's most powerful and influential country, the United States has a moral and ethical obligation to use its resources and influence to help create a safer future. In order to maximize our influence, the United States must work to reestablish our credibility and stature in the world by being a leader on global issues and engaging our allies a to address issues that affect us all.\> Party and philosophical differences have resulted in budget and policy deadlock in the past. If elected, how will you specifically work with colleagues to achieve results on the tough issues? In the State Legislature, I developed a reputation for bipartisanship. I was frequently able to bring members of both parties together, help them resolve their differences, and get important legislation passed. \We need this kind of approach in Washington again. We need an independent-minded Senator who can stand up to his own party and president when they're wrong, if necessary, and someone who can find common ground with those who have different viewpoints.\> What is your solution to the issue of illegal immigration? There are two things that we must do immediately to address the problems of illegal immigration: secure our borders and crackdown on employers who hire undocumented workers.\Only when we accomplish these two goals can we shut down the black market for cheap labor and work toward meaningful comprehensive immigration reform.\> What experience to set policy for our country do you bring to the job? In my 35 years of public service, I have a strong record of accomplishment for middle class Georgia families. I served for nearly two decades in the Georgia House of Representatives, where I worked on issues like health care and consumer protection. I was also a leader in the effort to create PeachCare, the program that provides health care to thousands of Georgia's children. I later led the Department of Human Resources under both Democratic and Republican governors.\Georgia Senate, District 45\Peggy Armstrong\> Party: Republican\> Occupation: Retired-Previous Occ:\Property mgr.

If elected, what will you do to ensure better success in 2009 and future legislative sessions? I have had a lot of business experience especailly working with people and working in teams to get projects completed on time. I work well with others and have always been a team player. If needs be I can reach accross the isle and get things accomplished. \As a Property Manager I ran my building as a separate business which gave me a lot of experience working with people both tenants and employees. This also provide me the opportunity to do accounting and financial reporting. > What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see? Taxes on individuals have to be reduced locally and nationally in order to move our economy forward and away from economic slowing.\We need to look at how we are taxing companies small and large in Gwinnett and Georgia to see how we can encourage companies to locate here and add good jobs to our area.\> What is your solution to the issue of illegal immigration in Georgia? Number one close the the borders! Immigration can only be legal. As to what to do with the immigrents that are already here, that is a national issue that will have to have a sweeping answer. They definitely should not just be allowed to stay. They did not enter our country repecting our rule of law!\The slowing number of construction jobs in Gwinnett is sending some of the illegal immigrents away from our area. \> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? Long range solution to our lack of water.( Volunteer to serve on a committee to come up with a plan)\Tax Reform (The Fair Tax and The Flat Tax Plans are already worked out for us we just need to go ahead and implement all or some of them for GA)\Cut Spending: Every spending issue needs close inspection we need to quit wasting our tax payer's money!\> What further changes, if any, does Georgia need in terms of campaign finance reform? It seems that a great deal of money is spent on campaigns. I do not yet have a handle on how to reform the process.\Renee S.

If elected, what will you do to ensure better success in 2009 and future legislative sessions? I will continue working with the excutive branch (Governor's office), the senate and the house leadership to advance the needs and desires of the constituents of District 45. I do not agree with the political gamesmanship exemplified in previous sessions and believe egos and political aspirations should be put aside. We should strive to achieve the best goals to improve the quality of life for all Georgians. \> What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see? I believe the debate should be continued on tax reform and a compromise between the house and senate should be reached this next session. I supported the repeal of the car tag tax and the freezinof property re-assessments statewide. I am open and amenable to discussion of a cut in any tax. I believe the people who earn their money have a right to keep it and spend it as they see fit--not the government. \> What is your solution to the issue of illegal immigration in Georgia? The General Assembly has done a good job of enacting new laws to make it more difficult to live and work in Georgia and be here illegally. It is up to the senators and representatives to continue putting pressure on our Washington congressional delegation to make stricter and enforcable federal laws restricting illegal immigrants. We need help from Washington with deportation and stopping the boarders for easy access. \> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? I would continue my work as Chairman of Ethics, as Vice -Chairman of Health, and on appropriations to develop legislation in each committee. I would also continue work as a consumer watch-dog protecting the interests of Georgia consumers. As the subcommitte chairman of Appropriations, I would continue writing the state budget for the Department of Human Resources, the Department of Labor, and the Department of Veterans Affairs. Tax reform will also be a priority. \> What further changes, if any, does Georgia need in terms of campaign finance reform? With the inaguration of Governor, Sonny Purdue, the General Assembly passed the strongest ethics/campaign disclosure laws in the history of Georgia. The state literally came out of the cellar and ranks higher now in ethics reform than ever before.\Two years ago, I wrote again a new ethics revision law that was 52 pages long--it passed the Senate unanimously but unfortunatley stalled in the House. I will continue pursing reform and enforcement. \Georgia Senate, District 55\Gloria Butler\> Party: Democratic\(No other information for this candidate was received by publication deadline)\Robert Crowder\> Party: Democratic\(No other information for this candidate was received by publication deadline)\Georgia House, District 88\Robford Hill\> Party: Democratic\(No other information for this candidate was received by publication deadline)\Billy Mitchell\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Vice President Government Affairs\> Age: 46\> Education: Juris Doctor - Atlanta Law School\> Family: Wife Shawn, daughter Maya, son Sean\> Web site: www.billymitchell.org\> E-mail: billymitchell@bellsouth.net\> Why I'm running for office: I have long held a passion for public service and visionaries willing to create realistic solutions and for those who are willing to do the necessary work to accomplish those solutions.\As a result of the many laws I have authored and responsiveness to my district, I have earned recognition for effectiveness and productivity and setting a new standard of representation for my constituents.\Along with my aptitude for effective ""bridge building"" compelled me to seek re-election.\> The 2008 General Assembly has received significant criticism for failing to resolve critical issues of the state. If elected, what will you do to ensure better success in 2009 and future legislative sessions? As one of the few Democratic members of the 2007/2008 General Assembly who authored a bill which was signed into law, I will continue to rely on my ability of being able to work across party lines, which has earned me a reputation for consensus building that is unique in today's political environment, particularly in a solidly, so-called 'Red State,' as is the case with Georgia.\> What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see? As indicated by the large budget surplus Georgia has amassed (on top of contingency funds), I would like to see - and have been working to do so - the tax code amended such that we take less taxes from payers. \My preference would be the elimination of the automobile ad valorem tax - the so-called ""birthday tax"" required annually when we register our vehicles.\> What is your solution to the issue of illegal immigration in Georgia? The preliferation of illegal immigration is primarlily the result of employment seekers. If there were no jobs to seek this issue would be all but non-existent. Accordingly, the penalty should rest with employers who would hire workers that have not been accorded the legal status to do be employed.\> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? Having authored an unprecedented 7 general bills signed into law during my previous three terms of service, I will continue to work on important issues affecting my community and state, such as legislation I have already drafted, including a bill that seeks to eliminate the problem of thieves stealing air conditioners and catalytic converters and selling them for its scrap material.\Additionally, always a priority will be the responsiveness and accessibility I maintain with my constituents in addressing their issues with government.\> What further changes, if any, does Georgia need in terms of campaign finance reform? There needs to be a one-stop method to be able to ascertain financial disclosures/campaign information for all campaign levels, municipal, county, state and federal.\As it stands now you would have to visit as many agencies to obtain such and many do not have this information on-line.\At the very least, all levels should be required to make this information web accessible.\Georgia House, District 95\Toney Collins\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Computer Engineer/Real Estate\> Age: 42\> Education: Degree in Computer Engineering\> Family: No children, Not Married\> Web site: www.ToneyCollins.com\> E-mail: toneycollins95@gmail.com\> Why I'm running for office: The reason for running to be the next State Representative for the 95th Distict are for the following reasons: To be a powerful voice for my constituents, to be a voice for people who are never heard, to make life better for our Georgia citizen, to help influence the Education system, the Healthcare system, the Tax system, and our Economic condition, to make life better for our children and seniors, and to make Georgia a great place to live.\> The 2008 General Assembly has received significant criticism for failing to resolve critical issues of the state. If elected, what will you do to ensure better success in 2009 and future legislative sessions? Better success comes with agreeing. I will work quickly to find common ground on issues that could pass quickly and will listen and work with legislators who want to see resolve,no matter what party affiliation and I will encourage others to do likewise, whether democrat or republicans. We all have common issues, we just need to work to find them. I will let them understand I care about their constituents also. I will be a reader of bills that are presented to me before voting. I will not be an absentee legislator. \> What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see? I would greatly consider the fair tax plan. This will ensure a higher revenue growth for our state and help the poor and seniors. And until we get our immigration policy working, this will ensure revenue from illegal immigrants \> What is your solution to the issue of illegal immigration in Georgia? My solution to illegal immigration is as followed: Because Georgia is a great place to find illegal work, My solution is to make Georgia less attractive to illegal immigrant. I would crack down on employers through fines and public list employers who hire illegal immigrants. This is pure ethics violation. Work with public safety to ensure that deportation is happening, especially for illegals who are committing personal crimes to our citizen. Finally work to see that the Federal government enforce the laws already in place. \> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? My top priorities will be Education, Health-care, Economic growth, and making Georgia a great place to live and raise a family. I will work with legislators, citizens, and local and federal government to attract new businesses to Georgia which will bring in more jobs, more revenue. I will help in fully funded our Education system in order to produce an intelligent workforce to attract new industries to a smart Georgia. \I will work with anyone who want more doctors, nurses, better health facilities and universal health-care in Georgia. \> What further changes, if any, does Georgia need in terms of campaign finance reform? I will present a bill that will allow individual donors to be able to write off up to $1200.00 donation off their taxes. This will give incentive for more people who would like to enter into public service an avenue to do so. And I believe more citizens will give donations and by doing so this will deter pay raises of legislators. I would pay more closely attention to lobbyist donation by publicly showing of their financial contributions to candidates. \George Wilson\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Owner Automated Business Forms,Inc.& Automated Data Decisions\> Age: 66\> Education: BSBA Rockhurst College,Central Missoui State\> Family: Married 39 years to Wendy Wilson,VP Community Health Charities of Georgia\> Web site: electgeorgewilson.com\> E-mail: electwilson@juno.com\> Why I'm running for office: My concerns about ethics in government and the lack of progress,vision,and leadership on the tough problems facing our state compelled me to run for this office.The problems are many...education ,health care, transportation solutions for metro Atlanta,environmental issues,and of course the economy.\> The 2008 General Assembly has received significant criticism for failing to resolve critical issues of the state. If elected, what will you do to ensure better success in 2009 and future legislative sessions? My ability to communicate and work with all types of people and organizations has enabled me to build several successful businesses and to be active as a community leader on controversial issues.I believe that this experience will enable me to reach across the aisle and work with my fellow legislators to achieve what is in the best interest of all Georgians.Moreover, I will endeavor to bring creative and progressive solutions to the many problems facing our state. \> What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see? We have a regressive tax system that hurts lower and middle class families.Lawmakers need to visit the state tax codes in a holistic manner to bring our tax systems into the 21st century.All components--the income tax,sales tax,property tax and others---should be thoroughly examined and modernized to improve and ensure the fairness,adequacy and integrity of our tax systems.We need to make the state tax codes more representaive of todays complex and changing society.\> What is your solution to the issue of illegal immigration in Georgia? This is a simple issue.All employers in Georgia should be required to use the federal E-Verify systems that allows businesses to check the legal status of workers.While the system is not perfect ...you have to start somewhere.We would quickly get to the point that if no jobs are available in Georgia for illegal immigrants than they would stop coming to our state. \> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? 1.Support transportation funding plan to relieve traffic congestion in metro area\2.Work to restore funding cuts to education\3.""Real"" tax reform\4.Try to work towards a fair way to redistrict legislative seats to make every seat competitive\5.Work for open and transparent government\6.Reform criminal justice system\7.Expand pre-k program\> What further changes, if any, does Georgia need in terms of campaign finance reform? The more complicated we make campaign finance reform the more loop holes are devised to get around the so called reforms.This than requires a bigger and expensive bureaucracy to administer the program/reforms.The current system is a nightmare for your typical legislator to keep track of and to comply with and is really ineffective.The current speaker of the house will not let any legislation on this subject pass. \Georgia House, District 96\Torry Lewis\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Loss Prevention Investigator (Credit Card Fraud)\> Age: 24\> Education: B.S.

I am the person to do that!\> The 2008 General Assembly has received significant criticism for failing to resolve critical issues of the state. If elected, what will you do to ensure better success in 2009 and future legislative sessions? We did not resolve critical issues because of the ridiculous and hateful partisan ideology that encompasses both parties. My opponent is apart of this!\I have said on several occasions that we need to put this behind us and use common sense policies. Quite frankly, success relies on our ability to work together. Another aspect that I will bring is that of community involvement. I would say less than 10% of Georgians know who their State Representative is'that is a direct reflection on the lack of excitement our legislative branch.\> What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see? I really do not have any pressing issues about the tax policy. I do think that we should suspend state tax to all public education and emergency service personnel. We must do more to use our tax money appropriately, especially in the fields of education, healthcare, and traffic. I have dedicated myself to work for a more efficacious use of public funds.\> What is your solution to the issue of illegal immigration in Georgia? Unlike my opponent, I do not support illegal immigration activities. I think there are two actors in causing the problem; the illegal immigrant and the illegal employer. Illegal immigrants come for jobs from sharks who are employers that purposely seek illegal immigrants. Both the illegal immigrant and employer should be seen as acts of crime. The employer should be striped of his business license if it is found that they sought illegal workers, and the immigrant should be reported to ICE\> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? Proposed Legislation for 2009 Session\College Sex offender Registry\Stiffer penalties against Graffiti\Stiffer Gang Laws\Stiffer Organized Retail Crimes\Stiffer Credit Fraud Penalties\Mandatory Credit Education in high school\More funds to rural county education\Establish Ethic Commissions for all School Boards\Tax cuts for all educators and public safety personnel \> What further changes, if any, does Georgia need in terms of campaign finance reform? None. We need to focus on ethics in general.\Pedro ""Pete"" Marin\> Party: Democratic\(No other information for this candidate was received by publication deadline.)\Georgia House, District 98\David Hancock\> Party: Republican\> Occupation: Vice President\> Age: 47\> Education: Bachelor of Science, Computer Engineering, Auburn University\> Family: Wife Darlene, daughter Ann, son Michael\> Web site: www.hancock2008.org\> E-mail: david@hancock2008.org\> Why I'm running for office: We need a representative who will get things done for the district. Tax revenue collected in our district has been spent on transportation projects across the state while our own needs suffer. We need transparency in State spending and need to address illegal immigration by focusing on companies who hire and exploit illegal workers, and by keeping unlicensed drivers off our streets. We need a more accessible Representative who is involved in local issues as well as the State government.\> The 2008 General Assembly has received significant criticism for failing to resolve critical issues of the state. If elected, what will you do to ensure better success in 2009 and future legislative sessions? I'm not interested in a political career so I am willing to do whatever is required to get things done. I will identify an issue and then find what is stopping it from moving forward and will make weekly reports back to the district on my progress. I believe strongly in transparency and accessibility of government. I may not make friends among those that have been there the longest, but hopefully running the State more like a business and less like a club will be effective.\> What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see? Reduction in spending to allow reduction in taxes and elimination of GA's income tax or a shifting to a flat tax. Several states get by on corporate taxes or interest/dividend taxes alone. An ideal solution for the US would be the Fair Tax. This has been considered as an option for State revenue in some places but it is difficult to imagine how this could be implemented at a state level alone - although State Representatives who are well versed on the Fair Tax would be helpful to the debate.\> What is your solution to the issue of illegal immigration in Georgia? I believe in focusing efforts against companies who hire illegal immigrants and profit by paying lower wages. Illegal immigrants bring increased gang activity and are a target for criminals because they deal in cash and are not likely to report a crime. This increase in crime hurts everyone in the community. Working with the Federal and County government to identify, track and deport criminals who are here illegally and enforcing only legal hiring will cause these workers to move elsewhere.\> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? Use local tax money for local transportation projects such as widening SR-20 from PIB to the river to match what has been done outside the district. Enhance transparency in State Spending with online posting of all government expenditures. Encourage illegal immigrants to move elsewhere by making it difficult to get work and drive. Increase accessibility of State Government with regular communication and work with local governments.\> What further changes, if any, does Georgia need in terms of campaign finance reform? Unfortunately I believe that some oversight and limitation is required to ensure that funding sources are properly disclosed and regulated. But existing rules do not address the real problem - legislators who do not act ethically and impartially. The Ethics Board should continue to step up enforcement of existing laws. One suggestion is to eliminate contributions from other political campaigns. This encourages raising excess money just to pass to political cronies.\Bobby Reese\> Party: Republican\> Occupation: Real Estate Broker\> Age: 53\> Education: criminal justice and electronic technology\> Family: 1 wife, 2 daughters and four grand children\> Web site: bobbyreese.com\> E-mail: bobby_reese@bellsouth.net\> Why I'm running for office: I'm the incumbent and want to continue to serve my area.\> The 2008 General Assembly has received significant criticism for failing to resolve critical issues of the state. If elected, what will you do to ensure better success in 2009 and future legislative sessions? I know we got a lot accomplished the past two years. I will keep working with the GDOT to get the dysfuntional department fixed. They need more outside accountability and then funding. I will continue to work ethically and consistantly to keep government from growing too large and giving the citizens the freedom they need to be sucessful. \> What specific changes, if any, to tax policy would you like to see? I would like to see a reduction in the state income tax and property assessments.\> What is your solution to the issue of illegal immigration in Georgia? to hold the people that knowingly hire them accountable, and to make it harder for the illegals to remain hidden in society while they reap the benefits that the tax payer provides for them.\> If elected, what would be your top policy priorities and how would you work to achieve results? Last session I worked on a water harvesting bill that if it had passed we would have immediately seen the benefits of better water conservation as people put the systems in. I am going to re-introduce the bill again if I get re-elected and work with the many organizations that want to see this bill pass. I also sponsored HB 1098, an election reform bill that the GOv. signed in May of 2008. I will continue to work with the SOS and make elections in GA fair for all.\> What further changes, if any, does Georgia need in terms of campaign finance reform? It takes money to run a campaign. People want to limit lobbiests from giving to campaigns but that will not stop someone that is dishonest from getting money elsewhere and continuing to be dishonest. The interested public should be involved and watch the votes their elected officials make. The general public gives very little money and want great returns from their elected officials. We need to continue to hold all elected officials accountable by how they spend the money they recieve.\Public Service Commissioner, Dist. 1 Southern\Rick Collum\> Party: Republican\> Occupation: Attorney and Magistrate Judge\> Age: 38\> Education: Juris Doctorate \B.A. in Sociology\B.S. in Criminal Justice\> Family: Wife of 15 years - Donna Collum\Two children 9 and 7\> Web site: - no response -\> E-mail: rickcollum2000@yahoo.com\> Why I'm running for office: I am running for the Georgia Public Service Commission in order to serve the people of Georgia by helping to facilitate safe and affordable energy by combining traditional sources of energy such as natural gas and nuclear power with renewable energy sources such as solar, wind and landfill gas.

Monthly payments for electric, natural gas, and phone are taking ever increasing scarce cash. \America has always positively responded to scarcity with technology. As a professional engineer and DOD supervisor, I am trained in technical problems experienced by our utilities. Encouraging competition without collusion, and wringing excess from the production system will better our utility rates and supply.\> In your opinion, what, if any changes are needed in Georgia's energy policy? While we don't experience roving brownouts like California, or sky-high energy prices, we can do more.\We can set cash incentives for conservation measures, including weatherization/insulation, digital thermostats, high efficiency furnaces, water heaters and air conditioners. We can encourage cooling ponds for several antiquated coal power plants that drain water mercilessly from our dwindling lakes. We can lower rates by encouraging new technology, not blind reliance on fossil fuel.\> How would you work to fix inefficiencies and divisions within the five member commission? The PSC ensures that Georgians pay the lowest rates for their utility services, while maintaining viable suppliers. All commissioners must be on the same page with this mandate. Except for personnel matters, meetings must be open to the public, including rights of all parties to speak. No more 'good ole boy' politics. Every area the PSC governs: electric, gas, phone, common carriers, to have two commissioners concerned full-time with that area, reporting biweekly to the others.\> Describe the education and experience that qualify you for this position. I am a Registered Professional Engineer for 25 years in 3 states, including 20 years in Georgia. Former Department of Defense positions include Chief of Power/Lighting, and Chief of Process Engineering.\My education includes a BScElecEngin, an MScMechEngin (GA Tech), an MScPhysics (GA Tech), and an executive MBA.\The PSC is concerned with such technical topics as underground piping infrastructure and complex power generation schemes. We need an engineer looking out for Georgian's interests.\> Commodity prices for energy are rising dramatically. What role should the PSC play in mitigating these increases? If we rely exclusively on fossil fuels, we are at the mercy of OPEC and the energy barons. In the long run, we must develop alternative sources, including increased nuclear, solar, and wind power. In the short run, we must encourage conservation measures, including proper insulation/weatherization, high efficiency air conditions, furnaces, and water heaters. Cash incentives for conversion, costly in the short run, pays rich dividends both to families and to our secure energy infrastructure. \> Many would say that telecommunications is a fully competitive business. Should the PSC continue to be involved in telecommunications regulations, why or why not? In theory, a mature industry has many players, all seeking business by constantly lowering prices to consumers. Our experience with the airline industry proves otherwise.\As cell phone and landline service is a necessity rather than a luxury, and it is difficult to find alternatives, then the public has the right to control rates. Rates must be ratcheted down until most phone companies find Georgia is not a source of excessive profit. At the same time, service must not be compromised.\Jim Powell\> Party: Democratic\> Occupation: Independent energy consultant to states, local governments and industry.\> Age: 59\> Education: BBA, MBA from the University of North Florida. Federal Executive Institute.\> Family: Married to Karen for 37 years, 2 great sons & DIL, 2 adorable granddaughters\> Web site: jimpowellforgapsc.com\> E-mail: jimpowellforgapsc@gmail.com\> Why I'm running for office: It is my intent to be the consumer advocate and to keep consumers' interests a top priority while also understanding that the investor owned utilities are in business to make a profit for their shareholders. I have worked with State PSCs across the country in efforts to implement energy efficiency practices, increasing use of renewable energy and promoting conservation. I have served our Nation for over 35 years and being elected to the PSC is the next chapter in my public service career.\> In your opinion, what, if any changes are needed in Georgia's energy policy? Georgia does not have a comprehensive State Energy Policy that addresses all aspects of energy supply and demand. The Georgia Environmental Facilities Authority published the State Energy Strategy in December 2007 which was developed in a collaborative manner with extensive stakeholder input. The Governor's Energy Challenge 2020 and Conserve Georgia are both efforts at efficiency and conservation. These two initiatives, along with State Energy Strategy should be used as the basic framework to develop a comprehensive State Energy Policy.\> How would you work to fix inefficiencies and divisions within the five member commission? One of my strongest attributes is the ability to bring people together who possess different perspectives and get them to reach a consensus. During my 35 year career, I worked for 7 different Presidential administrations. I was able to work with the political and career leadership towards common goals. I plan on using this experience to work in partnership with my fellow Commissioners to advance the mission of the PSC and thereby ensure that the citizens of Georgia get a fair deal for the utility services they purchase. \> Describe the education and experience that qualify you for this position. I am the most experienced PSC candidate in years. I was a Senior Executive with the U.S. Department of Energy and have more than 20 years experience in developing and implementing energy policies and energy program management. I have significant experience at the regional and national level promoting renewable energy technology programs (i.e., solar, biomass), energy efficiency technologies and practices and conservation (i.e., Energy Star, Weatherization Assistance Program). My undergraduate degree is in Accounting and I have a MBA.\> Commodity prices for energy are rising dramatically. What role should the PSC play in mitigating these increases? Georgia relies primarily on coal to generate electricity. I plan to interest the State's utilities in diversifying the fuel sources for electricity so that price volatility for a particular fuel will not impact ratepayers severely. Focusing more on using renewable energy sources produced in Georgia creates jobs and keeps dollars in the State's economy. Georgia needs to pay more attention to energy efficiency. Reducing demand and mitigating the rising price of energy resources can best be achieved through energy efficiency and conservation.\> Many would say that telecommunications is a fully competitive business. Should the PSC continue to be involved in telecommunications regulations, why or why not? Any further deregulation of telecommunications in Georgia would likely require legislation by the General Assembly, where this topic has been debated since early 1990. Under 1995 legislation, the role of the PSC changed to only establishing and administering a universal access fund, monitoring rates and service quality, and mediating disputes between telecommunications competitors. Recalling the problems that resulted from deregulating retail natural gas service, we should proceed with caution in further deregulating telecommunications.\Pam Davidson\> Party: Republican\> Occupation: Renewable Energy Consultant\> Age: 45\> Education: B.S. Organizational Behavior University of San Francisco\> Family: One daughter age 14, two dogs, one cat, one horse\> Web site: pamdavidson.org\> E-mail: pamdavidson@tds.net\> Why I'm running for office: I am seeking the position because I am very concerned about our ability to provide clean, affordable energy in the state. \> In your opinion, what, if any changes are needed in Georgia's energy policy? We need to our maximize our energy efficiency and renewable energy potential. We have made very little ground in either area. If elected,I will ask that the Demand Side Management Group review and improve upon thier recommendations to the PSC and set forth a resolution to create a Renewable Energy Working group to develop immediate and significant goals for affordable renewable energy. \We need to evaluate our energy resources in light of water resources and air quality. \> How would you work to fix inefficiencies and divisions within the five member commission? Regarding divisiveness: I would encourage and employ an attitude of mutual respect. I would make every effort to listen and understand all parties and conduct myself with dignity and selflessness. \Regarding inefficiencies: I would encourage a culture of positive, future-oriented leadership in which the PSC is not a reactionary body (simply hearing and reacting to the entities we regulate)but acts confidently towards meeting established goals. \> Describe the education and experience that qualify you for this position. As an renewable energy advocate, I have had the priviledge of earning the respect of lawmakers and policy experts. Hence, I can 'hit the ground running' in order to facilitate comprehensive energy policy reform. I work well with both the environmental and business community. Recent evidence of this is the successful passsage of HB 670 (the state's first comprehensive energy efficiency and renewable energy bill) which was recently signed by the Governor. I initiated this bill in order to incentivize progressive changes in energy policy. \> Commodity prices for energy are rising dramatically. What role should the PSC play in mitigating these increases?\Firstly, we need to reduce our per capita energy usage. Less demand means less fuel. \Secondly, we need to quickly develop renewable energy resources so that we are not dependent on global fuel prices. Our greatest resource for affordable renewable energy is biomass. We can provide both electricity and biofuels (such as synthetic diesel) as a 'value add') from such facilities. \> Many would say that telecommunications is a fully competitive business. Should the PSC continue to be involved in telecommunications regulations, why or why not?\I believe the PSC should continue to regulate telecommunications. As I travel the state, many Georgians have shared with me the difficulties they have experienced with their telephone service and I believe there is still a need to protect the consumer and to improve service in rural areas. \Lauren W.

92,"As a child growing up in Georgia in the 1960s and '70s it was always easy to tell whenever we crossed the line into any of our five neighboring states due to the superior quality of Georgia's roads and highways compared to that of our neighbors.\A quick check of history will reveal that the Georgia Department of Transportation has received many national awards for its work over the years.\Now we Georgians find ourselves 49th in the nation in per capita spending on transportation. And it shows.\Transportation experts estimate that Georgia needs tens of billions of dollars in new funding in coming years just to get us back to where we need to be.\While it is true that for the past several years our governor and Legislature have failed to pass a plan to address transportation funding, we really only have ourselves to blame.\In today's political environment, no elected official would dare risk the wrath of the voters by passing any legislation that could even remotely be construed as a tax increase.\Almost every transportation proposal floated involves either paying for projects with tolls or by giving voters the option of taxing themselves through either a statewide or regional sales tax referendum, thus giving our leaders some political cover.\There's a dirty little secret about Georgia's needed transportation improvements.\A new mile of roadway costs the same whether paid for by tolls, sales taxes or the gasoline tax.\Instead of creating new layers of government to handle collections from additional tollways or confusing regional sales tax plans, the simplest answer would be to raise Georgia's gasoline tax.\However, that brings us back to the issue of a public ready to skewer any politician advocating a tax increase.\Here's an idea that would give our elected officials that political cover they desire.\Calculate what a 10-cent-per-gallon increase in the state gasoline tax would generate over a 10-year period.\Provide voters a list of transportation projects that would be funded with those dollars and then place the measure, much like a SPLOST, on a statewide ballot.\After 10 years the tax increase would sunset. Those who use the roads would foot the bill.\History has shown us that whenever government taxes something, we get less of that something.\A statewide or regional transportation sales tax would suppress retail sales, especially of bigger-ticket items like furniture and cars.\This is not something we want as we try to recover from a major recession.\Toll roads also raise other concerns. Our highways are the great equalizer. Whether you drive a rust bucket or a luxury sports car, you are free to drive almost anywhere you want.\By utilizing tolls, our roadways become segregated into rich and poor. This is especially true of concepts such as congestion pricing or HOT lanes.\As a conservative I despise taxes as much as anyone.\However, each day that passes without adequate transportation funding places us further behind our neighboring states and is crippling our ability to attract new businesses.\It's also ruining the quality of life for families spending far too much time stuck in traffic.\Unless we act now, I foresee a day when my future grandchildren will say that it's easy to tell when you cross the state line back into Georgia, because our neighbor's roadways are superior.\Chuck Shiflett is a former chairman of the Bartow County Board of Education and former communications director of the Georgia Republican Party.\Credit: For the AJC"
93,"Higher gas prices are with us to stay, so the gas tax is headed for extinction.\That's the counterintuitive message from Samuel Staley, a leading expert on free-market transportation policy.\Gas prices are destined to remain high, said Staley, director of urban and land use policy for the libertarian Reason Foundation, because of greater demand for oil from China, India and Africa.\""We're not going to give up our cars"" and the controlled environment and customized mobility they provide us, Staley said Tuesday at a luncheon held by the Georgia Public Policy Foundation, and in an interview with me beforehand.\""What we're going to do is find different ways to power our cars.""\That means less gas used, and declining gas-tax revenues.\Staley sees China's rising demand firsthand. He spends much of his time there, counseling local governments on transportation issues. (Flip over his business card, and you'll see his contact information in Mandarin on the back.)\But even in a country where the demand for gas is soaring, Chinese authorities don't depend chiefly on gas taxes to pay for new infrastructure. They're tapping into private pools of capital --- to such a greater degree than America does, Staley said, that it's sometimes unclear to him which country is communist and which one champions free markets.\These public-private partnerships are a crucial supplement to government revenue streams for building transportation infrastructure, Staley said.\""If you've got a facility that will pay for itself, why [let government] get in the way?"" he said, advising Georgia's lawmakers to ""put legislation in place so that these things go.""\Of course, private investors want to be repaid. The most common mechanism for doing this is a toll, which brings us back to phasing out the gas tax.\Even if gas doesn't decline as an energy source, Staley argued, tolling is a better way to identify which road projects to build and then pay for them.\That's because prices in any market --- in this case, tolls --- send the truest signal about which products --- i.e., the routes formed by interstates, arterial roads and surface streets --- consumers value.\Motorists will be able to access new lanes, or perhaps new highways, if they're willing to pay for the privilege of moving at a guaranteed speed.\An example is the network of high-occupancy toll (HOT) lanes planned for metro Atlanta, which Staley called ""way ahead of the curve"" nationally.\Perhaps best of all, ""willingness to pay"" dictates how and when investments are made, lessening political influence.\Those who favor public transportation also can take heart, and not only because tolling would guarantee a high minimum speed for buses.\""With such a broad-based change"" in the way we pay for our travel, Staley said, ""everyone will recalibrate their trade-offs about which mode to use, and transit will benefit.""\MARTA, he said, should vary its pricing based on segments traveled, charging enough to cover its costs and then using vouchers to subsidize travel by the poor or elderly.\Even if all this sounds great, we are, by Staley's estimation, 30 years away from relying totally on user pricing. What to do until then?\The interim solution in Georgia is for voters next year to consider a penny sales tax that would fund a list of projects selected by local elected officials and state planners.\Such general revenues, Staley said, ""should be the option of last resort.""\Given our traffic problems and the dearth of alternatives at hand, we're arguably at the point of last resort. The question we need to discuss next is which projects would justify that option.\Blog with Kyle Wingfield at ajc.com/opinion.\Kyle Wingfield, an Opinion Columnist, appears on Thursdays.

94,"METRO FINAL TODAY'S NEWS This article appeared in both The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta Constitution.\Washington - Georgia would get a whopping 80 percent increase in federal transportation funds over the next six years in legislation that passed a House committee Tuesday with bipartisan support and Speaker Newt Gingrich's blessing.\The state's average annual take would be $970 million, paid through an 18.3-cent federal gasoline tax that drivers are levied each time they fill up.\The election-year legislation calls for $218 billion in highway and mass transit spending through 2003, far above the levels allowed in last year's balanced budget agreement.\House Republican leaders have agreed to find $26 billion in cuts in other parts of the budget before the legislation wins final congressional approval, probably in late April.\The bill includes nearly $18 billion in projects specifically requested by members of Congress. It passed the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee 69-0 amid an orgy of self-congratulation from Republicans and Democrats alike. ''It is a very, very broadly supported piece of legislation,'' said Rep. Bud Shuster (R-Pa.), the committee chairman.\About $240 million would go to earmarked projects in Georgia. They include: A proposed rail line linking Atlanta and Macon, $39 million A study of ways to relieve congestion along the Ga. 400 corridor, $25 million Downtown's hoped-for rail and bus terminal, $16 million Conversion of Ga. 316 to a limited access road in Gwinnett County, $40.9 million Improvements to Buford Highway, Lithonia Industrial Boulevard, Memorial Drive and Candler Road in DeKalb County, $15.9 million A study of congestion relief between Atlanta and Chattanooga, $5 million.\In addition, MARTA probably will receive funding for construction of rail stations on its north line and the purchase of rail cars and buses, although no money is earmarked for it in the House legislation, Gingrich spokesman Andrew Weinstein said.\But even with all the federal aid the House bill would bring, the money for these projects would cover only a fraction of their total cost. The Atlanta terminal, for example, has a $175 million price tag. The Ga. 316 project in Gwinnett would take $283 million to complete.\The legislation's proponents built support by increasing the size of the total transportation funding pie and redoing the formulas by which states receive federal motor fuel tax revenues. The proposed formula guarantees that every state would receive at least 95 percent of the taxes it collects.\Georgia and other Southern states are among so-called donor states, which contribute far more in gas taxes than they receive under the current transportation bill. For example, Georgia got back only 81 cents for every $1 of gas taxes paid into the trust fund in 1995.\Shuster fought a yearlong battle with Gingrich and other GOP leaders over the amount of money he would be allowed to include in his bill. With a 73-member committee and the power to dole out billions of dollars, Shuster brought a good deal of leverage to the bargaining.\The agreement he struck with Gingrich drew criticism from some government watchdog groups. Friends of the Earth, a nonpartisan environmental group, said the House is playing with ""election-year funny money.""\Despite Georgia's good fortune and nearly $60 million in projects that Gingrich requested, Shuster denied he used his committee's pot of money to attract support. ""I've not spoken to anybody about getting their vote in exchange for a project,"" Shuster said.\He said the member-requested projects, dubbed high-priority projects in the legislation, were subjected to a ""stringent vetting process"" before they were put in the bill.\The Senate passed its version of the transportation bill, minus special projects, this month. The Senate calls for slightly less spending and a different formula that benefits smaller and sparsely populated states. The chairmen of the Senate's Environment and Public Works Committee, the Budget Committee and Finance Committee come from those states.\Georgia's share of transportation money would increase by 66 percent in the Senate bill. House and Senate negotiators will attempt to work out differences if, as expected, the full House passes its legislation sometime next week.\Credit: STAFF"
95,"THE OLYMPICS\Slain Israeli Olympians deserve remembrance\I am one of millions who have hope for humanity because of those who perpetuate the Olympic ideals. The Olympic flame is the symbol of those ideals --- but for the Israeli athletes murdered during the Munich Olympics by terrorists, their flames were snuffed out.\The International Olympic Committee should have a moment of remembrance at the London opening ceremonies, not just to remember those athletes but to remind the world what the Olympic movement stands for. Official, public commemoration by the IOC in London is not a pro-Israel political act. The Olympic Games are not about medals or champions or the superiority of one country or ideology over another. Devoting a minute to the memory of the murdered Israeli athletes will do more to reinforce the real meaning of the games than anything I recall the IOC doing since I first watched the Olympics more than 50 years ago. RON DOLINSKY, ATLANTA\APS CHEATING SCANDAL\It appears educators' fears were groundless\After following the proceedings of the APS tribunal, I have a question for the teachers and some administrators who claimed fear for their jobs as reasons for cheating: If it is this hard to fire a teacher, even one accused of such a serious offense, why were you in fear for your job? PATSY MONCRIEF, CONYERS\BOARD OF REGENTS\5-day review period for public is too short\The AJC story on Georgia's Board of Regents' intent to cut public vetting of university presidents to five days is proof enough that we still need our daily paper in Atlanta (""Regents fast-track leadership,"" News, June 8). The move to cut the old vetting requirement --- with the blessing of the Georgia Legislature --- can only be described as ""slimy"" (and that's being nice).\Regents Chairman Ben Tarbutton needs to be reminded that the mood of the public these days is for more oversight, not less, of public agencies --- including his own. An important part of the AJC article was the quote from a UGA student that five days is not enough time for her fellow students to have an impact on the regents' selection of a new president. The question --- the only question --- is, will this move by the regents to limit public oversight help Georgia college students? Of course not.\In a note to Tarbutton, I said the regents could easily rescind this action. If they don't, I am calling on Gov. Nathan Deal to issue an executive order putting the vetting back at 14 days. It's up to him. JAMES HIGHTOWER, TYRONE\HEALTH CARE OVERHAUL\Medical insurance mandates are needed\I see Mitt Romney wants to get rid of President Barack Obama's health care program. Judging from the stellar way some states protected civil rights, rights to legal counsel for all accused (regardless of wealth) and the environment, I am sure that would be just fine --- for the standards of the 1890s!

More on language
\
Although I am not going to ingratiate myself with those who see all French people as fussy and arrogant know-it-alls, I feel compelled to correct the writer of the letter ""When in America, use 'Ivory Coast' "" (July 25).
\
Regardless of the controversy on ""Ivory Coast"" vs. ""Cote d'Ivoire,"" the French do not refer to 'L'Etats Unis"" but ""Les Etats Unis."" In a country where anti-Americanism is unfortunately not uncommon, and where the use of the French language can be a matter of legal obligation, we still routinely use the acronym ""Les USA.""

THE GAS TAX Don't add to burden
\
In the July 25 Reader's Column, ""Motorists have left gas tax in the dust,"" Charles F. Floyd said Georgia needs to raise its gas tax, which is the lowest in the nation.
\
Floyd said the current tax rate does not meet the needs of the Atlanta region for highways and other modes of transportation, nor does it provide adequate highways to help lagging rural areas become economically competitive.
\
Georgians are overtaxed, and taxpayers should resist all efforts to increase current taxes. ROBERT ANDREWS, Smyrna
\
Work on crews' attitudes instead
\
In his Reader's Column, Charles F. Floyd took the attitude of ""most other states have raised the gas tax, so should we."" Just because the first lemming jumps off the cliff doesn't make it any smarter for the last lemming to jump.
\
How many more roads does Floyd want in urban areas? Where does he propose to put them?
\
The solution to the road maintenance problem is to make sure we get what we pay for, which is not happening. Everybody has driven past a work crew, and it is obvious there is no work going on. The attitudes of some of the workers and mid- to lower-level supervisors must improve, not the amount of money we throw at the problem. EDGAR DELOACH JR., Lawrenceville
\
Problem rests with homosexuals' lifestyle, not with the individual
\
""Sexual orientation has about as much to do with 'choice' as does skin color"" is a mantra of gay activists (""Lott misunderstands homosexuality,"" Letters, July 25). This beliefis the justification for laws banning discrimination against gays. It has been repeated so much that the media accept it without question.
\
But where is the ""mountain of scientific evidence"" the letter writer claimed? What genetic markers have been found to be indicative of homosexuality? And what about the thousands of homosexuals who, according to a group that ministers to ex-gays, have changed their lifestyle, married members of the opposite sex and had children? Were these people forced to change?
\
Most Americans do not hate or condemn gays. It is their lifestyle we do not accept. ROBERT BROWN , Peachtree City
\
Foe of environment
\
I am very disappointed that U.S. Sen. Paul Coverdell has again voted to prevent the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency from doing its job.
\
The failure of the Waxman Amendment, which would have provided more funding to fight pollution, has serious impact on America's environment. Its defeat means there won't be enough funding to clean up waterways that are polluted with health-threatening PCBs. These chemicals, which are suspected cancer-causers, were banned from commerce more than a dozen years ago but are still buried in some of our riverbeds.
\
Failure of the amendment will also keep the EPA from fighting air pollution and visibility-reducing haze in our national parks. The amendment also would have provided funding to clean up the mercury from power plants. Mercury is a poison that can cause brain damage in children and adults. It's a chemical that's already made its way up the food chain into some lake fish and caused doctors to warn pregnant women not to eat fish caught in the Great Lakes. VINNIE METZGER, Decatur

Don't relive it
\
I cannot for love or money figure out why Americans re-enact the Civil War. Although sometimes necessary, violence is man's lowest physical expression. It takes place after all intelligent reasoning has ended.

Is America the warmonger nation that others have suggested? Is this a pet hurt that America nourishes and returns to let heal? What, if anything, is gained by the re-enactment? LEWIS CHARLES, Atlanta

In spite of McCain's pledge to balance the budget, his proposals suggest that he would add to the deficit rather than eliminate it.

98,"Home\A candidate for the 6th District congressional race took a swipe at front-runner Johnny Isakson at a political forum Monday night by accusing him of lying about his record on taxes.\Christina Jeffrey, a 51-year-old Kennesaw State University professor, accused Isakson of supporting taxes while in the Legislature, including voting for a gas tax as well as pushing for sales tax increases in voter referendums for Cobb County schools.\""I differ from the leading candidate, Mr. Isakson,"" Jeffrey said. ""I believe people should tell the truth. I believe they should stand on their record.""\Isakson, the 54-year-old chairman of the state Board of Education, who has faced the same charges in past statewide races for governor and U.S. senator, dismissed Jeffrey's accusations as simply untrue. He said he voted against increases in the sales tax and the gas tax.\The evidence that the Jeffrey campaign cited for the gas tax vote was an article in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution about the 1990 governor's race that quoted political operative James Carville, who then was working for Isakson's opponent, Zell Miller.\Jeffrey's comments were the only even minor fireworks at the forum sponsored by the Marietta-Cobb and Atlanta-Fulton chapters of the League of Women Voters. It was held at the Roswell library.\More than 100 people crowded into the small meeting room to ask the candidates questions on topics that included Social Security, the environment, regulating the sale of guns at gun shows and campaign finance reform.\Abortion wasn't mentioned except by Jeffrey, who said she was ""pro-life.""\Andy Naples, a 46-year-old electrical engineer from Marietta, sent word that he had to miss the forum because his flight back to Atlanta had been delayed by the American Airlines pilot sick-out.\Besides Isakson and Jeffrey, who have the most well-financed campaigns, the other candidates participating were: Leigh Baier, 57, a lawyer and businessman from Smyrna; Kelly Brown, an Alpharetta lawyer who is running a write-in candidacy; Barry Doublestein, 44, president of the Georgia Osteopathic Institute and chairman of the GOP's 11th Congressional District; Marco Longo, 27, a salesman from Duluth; and Gary Pelphrey, 63, a lawyer from Marietta who ran against Newt Gingrich last year.\A nonpartisan special election to replace Gingrich will be held Feb. 23.

Sun City incorporation? The topic is a hazy image propagated by a power-hungry, paranoid committee of myopics with no glasses.
\
However well-meaning, I strongly disagree with their approach, particularly Carl Lehmann, who is absolutely out of line using his so-called position at BT to promote his agenda. Carl does not speak for Sun City Hilton Head.
\
Wes Grady is well known on Sun City's ... Vox Populi. He resembles a typical malcontent, always complaining, always an agenda ... just undefined. As a board of directors candidate he campaigned to ""explore incorporation,"" among other more worthwhile issues like listening.
\
This is not exploration nor listening. Together, Lehmann and Grady have created a low-grade panic amongst many residents by using what ifs and half-truths; ""the sky is falling.""
\
They are supposing certain future negative actions by developers, builders and municipalities, which may or may not be negative or even factual.
\
And through their self-advised wisdom (nobody else in SCHH has any wisdom) they have chosen a disastrous course and are trying to drag all of us down with them. Rather than looking for input from their own community and, hopefully, a resolve, they barge ahead, draw battle lines, create a ""them vs. us"" environment and threaten to use a huge cannon (incorporation) to solve a problem they have not aptly identified, and then are asking us to help them load the cannon.
\
And when asked about future scenarios, they offer not much more than ""it shouldn't cost,"" ""we think this,"" ""we don't know"" or ""maybe."" Not much they know for sure.
\
I hope all their floundering around will bring the true issues to light and to acceptable solutions. Meanwhile, let them load their own cannon.
\
Insofar as Pulte, well, here's the first commandment of successful businesses: Tell them what you'll do, then do what you told them.

\
IS REP. JOE WILSON A LIBERAL?
\
Due to the recent dramatic increase in the price of oil, people have begun driving less and the price of road repair has jumped.
\
Therefore, when Congress looked at giving the people a ""gas tax holiday,"" they said ""No way, Jose,"" and are actually going to increase the federal gas tax 10 cents a gallon this year and another 12 cents next year.
\
They think that they have to do that since tax receipts are going down while costs are going up.
\
Your elected officials are comfortable doing that because they know that you, the voters, are going to re-elect them regardless because you vote for labels rather than people and don't pay attention to what they do once elected.
\
For example, there have been many Vox calls blaming labels (environmentalists, Democrats, liberals) for stopping expanded drilling for oil. Last week, a bill expanding drilling in Alaska was proposed (HR6515). Your representative, Joe Wilson, and 161 other Republicans voted against it and it failed.
\
So, Joe Wilson and the other 161 Republicans who voted against the bill must be environmentalists and/or Democrats and/or liberals, right? Or is Joe more interested in keeping the oil companies happy than you?

SUN CITY HAS LARGEST VOTING BLOCK
\
I'm afraid that you are a ""day late"" if incorporation of Sun City and surrounding areas is to be able to control what is going on beyond your borders.
\
By the time signatures are collected to go to the state, a large portion that you want to have control over will already be rezoned to high density with a strip mall in front of it.
\
The proposed change of zoning surrounding Okatie Elementary will shortly be before the County Council and without a loud outcry from the residents of Sun City, the rezoning will almost assuredly be approved.
\
This development will add enough traffic to require paying for six lanes if you want to travel 55 mph on S.C. 170, along with at least two more traffic lights. The added children will mean a new school. You will also be paying for the added infrastructure that these developments will cost, estimated in the millions by the county comptroller.
\
To stop anything only takes making your pleasure known to the county. You have the largest voting block. A threat of withholding approval of bond issues will bring the immediate attention of our officials. You do not need to become a town to control your surroundings. Simply get involved with what is going on around you today.

100,"COLUMBUS --- The city of Columbus will soon expand its popular RiverWalk along the Chattahoochee, tunnel under a rail line that has cut off part of the town for years, and add more hours for bus service.\Those improvements arise from the regional 1-cent sales tax voters approved in 2012 --- the same referendum that went down in flames in the Atlanta region.\The penny tax is expected to raise nearly $300 million over 10 years in the 16-county River Valley region. The money will be used to complete eight projects in the city alone --- projects that otherwise wouldn't have been possible for decades, city leaders say.\As Georgia lawmakers wrangle with a $74 billion gap for transportation funding statewide over the next 20 years, they are looking to the success of the transportation sales tax in the state's second-largest city as one possible solution.\State Transportation Board member Sam Wellborn, whose district includes Columbus, said he's a tax-averse Republican. But he nonetheless recommended a statewide gas tax hike and applauded the regional transportation sales tax before a group of state legislators and business leaders last week.\""Columbus gets about $200,000 a month in what I call free money that we never had before,"" Wellborn told them. ""I refer to it as manna from heaven.""\The Joint Study Committee on Critical Transportation Infrastructure Funding is trying to find a long-term solution for Georgia's chronically underfunded transportation system. They visited Columbus on Monday as their second stop on an eight-city listening tour.\The squeeze, the juice\Members of the committee also questioned local officials on how the sales tax, known as the Transportation Special Purpose Local Option Sales Tax or TSPLOST, is working.\The River Valley area was one of three regions in the state that passed the TSPLOST. The referendum failed in nine other regions.\Mayor Teresa Tomlinson said TSPLOST was hotly debated in Columbus, in part because much of the money raised within the city will be used elsewhere in the 16-county area.\""But in the end, the voters wanted the investment now and they are seeing that pay off,"" Tomlinson said. ""It may not be an ideal system in every voter's mind, but the juice is worth the squeeze.""\The tax has been collected only since Jan. 1, 2013. Yet city officials said they are already seeing benefits. They have used some of the tax money to repair bridges and have started preliminary work on several projects on the city's to-do list.\Reviving the TSPLOST in other regions is still a possibility that would require no action from the committee, according to its co-chair Rep. Jay Roberts, R-Ocilla, because the enabling legislation is still on the books.\Roberts said it is ""one tool in the tool chest."" The committee could also consider legislation to enable two or more counties --- rather than the large multicounty regions created under the TSPLOST law --- to band together to pass a transportation sales tax for selected projects. Or legislators could pass a law enabling counties to impose a transportation sales tax of less than 1 cent on the dollar. (The law currently provides for a full penny only, not a fraction of a cent.)\Roberts still hopes to find a reliable statewide revenue generator. That could involve a gasoline sales tax increase; some sort of user fee for drivers that includes fees on alternative vehicles; or recapturing 1 percent of motor fuel tax money that now goes into the general fund (about $182 million a year). He believes the state Department of Transportation needs between $750 million and $1 billion more a year for Georgia to grow and stay competitive.\'I say watch them grow'\The 2012 TSPLOST failed in nine of 12 regions of the state despite strong backing from the business community and most of the state's leading politicians. The tax would have raised about $7.2 billion for metro Atlanta's transportation needs.\Opponents of the plan --- the odd bedfellows of the NAACP, Sierra Club and tea party --- criticized the makeup of the counties in each region, the project list and the process by which the projects were chosen.\Debbie Dooley, who led part of the opposition to the T-SPLOST as national coordinator of the Tea Party Patriots, said the group would oppose TSPLOST again if it involved the same regional makeup. But she would be in favor of allowing a few counties to join together to pass a transportation tax for local priorities.\""We believe it should be up to the counties to decide who they want to partner with for their transportation projects and be allowed to levy taxes, even a fourth of a percent of a tax,"" Dooley said.\Gov. Nathan Deal has said the three regions that passed the TSPLOST --- the Augusta area, Columbus and the Dublin, Jesup and Vidalia area in east central Georgia --- made the smart choice.\The River Valley district has budgeted $381 million for 23 projects based on the sales tax revenue. The Augusta area has budgeted $539 million for 84 projects. The Dublin/Jesup/Vidalia region has budgeted $256 million for 764 projects.\""I say watch them grow, "" Deal said in 2012.\His November opponent, Jason Carter, reiterated his interest in reviving the transportation sales tax after a speech to Gwinnett County business leaders on Tuesday.\""We have to revisit a TSPLOST of some kind, and we have to revisit it in a way that would change the political environment,"" Carter said. ""Folks just don't trust the political environment.""\Staff writer Greg Bluestein contributed to this article.\Committee's meeting schedule\Upcoming meetings of the Joint Study Committee on Critical Transportation Infrastructure Funding.

\
To east Cobb resident John Fetterly, metro Atlanta's situation recalls the ""tragedy of the commons""--- when something belongs to everyone but is the responsibility of no one, it is inevitably destroyed.
\
That is why critical features of the area's quality of life --- air, water and mobility --- are threatened, he said. And that's why Atlanta may need some form of regional governance.
\
""We need somebody who can oversee the big picture without looking in a tunnel,"" Fetterly said. ""We need someone to say what is best for the overall area, not Fulton or Cobb or whatever.""
\
His sentiments echo the thoughts of a growing number of metro residents, according to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution's Horizon Metro Poll.
\
Asked whether they would favor or oppose ""establishing a metrowide authority to handle regional problems such as water and land use and traffic control,"" 74 percent express support. That's up from a year ago, when 65 percent of poll respondents supported a regional authority. The poll also reflected significant doubts about whether local governments are doing a good job protecting the region's environment, with 80 percent saying area governments were doing a poor or fair job.
\
The feeling among residents tracks closely with that of some 200 business and civic leaders surveyed earlier this year in the newspaper's Horizon Leadership Poll. There, 68 percent supported a metrowide authority, up from 64 percent the year before.
\
Left unanswered in these responses are a number of questions: Exactly what powers would a regional body or bodies have? How would the concept fit in with Georgia's constitutional provisions for strong ""home rule""? How would it be enacted? How does this idea fit in with the trend toward government downsizing?
\
""I think what we're seeing from the polls is that people favor regional delivery of certain services,"" said Harry West, director of the Atlanta Regional Commission. ""I don't think they want a regional government.""
\
Local leaders who support a regional approach to managing and providing for Atlanta's growth and related problems tend to fall into two camps. One favors setting up independent authorities to handle a single service, such as mass transit or sewers. The other favors holding one body accountable for planning and coordinating a range of regional services, even if each service is actually delivered by another entity. Neither camp likes to talk in terms of a new level of government, fearing the idea wouldn't be popular.
\
Indeed, any effort to change the current system is likely to meet resistance from county officials loathe to cede authority. Two years ago, the Legislature-appointed Georgia Future Communities Commission dropped proposals to institutionalize inter-county cooperation after many local officials expressed opposition. Similarly, any effort to shift transportation authority and funds to a regional entity is likely to encounter resistance from the powerful state Department of Transportation. Using state gas tax revenues for a regional transit system would require a change in the state constitution.
\
Some poll respondents were ready for change, however. ""In general, I don't like central government controls,"" said David Gorin of Marietta. ""But you're talking about issues that are far more widespread than a single county, so trying to handle it at a county level is not efficient. You're obviously talking about some form of metro government.""
\
Models for regional governance are limited. There are just two metropolitan areas in the United States with regional governments, Portland, Ore., and Minneapolis-St. Paul. However, there are a number of places with regionwide service providers. Indianapolis has a unified sewer system. Many large metro areas have regionwide mass transit systems. In Toronto, which has had regional government since 1953, the metro government oversees arterial roads as well as transit.
\
Roots in the 1960s
\
The two regional governments in the United States both began by taking charge of particular services.
\
In the Twin Cities, regionalism started in the late 1960s, when metro authorities were created to consolidate and upgrade a dysfunctional plethora of sewer systems and to take over the city's airport. The trend continued a few years later when the region's bus systems were integrated into one service covering seven counties and 189 cities.
\
Today, the region is governed by a Metropolitan Council made up of 16 representatives, all appointed by the governor of Minnesota. In addition to operating the sewer and transit systems, the Met Council sets a virtual urban growth boundary by establishing the limits on infrastructure to support development.
\
The council also outlines a broad framework for development within the region, but then allows local governments to make their own comprehensive plans within that framework. In 1996, the council was given the power to override local zoning decisions when they go against the comprehensive plan, or if a proposed development exceeds road and sewer capacity.
\
Portland group elected
\
Portland has the only elected regional government in the country. Portland Metro's earliest responsibilities included operating the zoo on behalf of the region.
\
But when Oregon passed the first comprehensive land-use planning law in the country in the 1970s, Metro became responsible for establishing and maintaining the region's urban growth boundary, a demarcation line between rural and developed areas.
\
In 1992, the region's voters approved a charter that called for direct election of a seven-member regional council and executive officer. The agency, which covers three counties and 24 cities, has responsibility for transportation, water quality, air quality and solid waste.
\
Portland's regional approach has been popular. A recent effort by one political candidate to abolish Metro was abandoned after polls showed about two-thirds of residents support it.
\
In addition to managing urban sprawl, regional government allows Portland to do things that can't be done as well on a smaller scale, said John Fregonese, a former Metro official who is now an independent consultant. For example, the region currently is acquiring 6,000 acres of open space through a $136 million regional bond measure.
\
""You have to establish the rules in a collaborative way, with all the local governments participating,"" said Fregonese. ""But then you have to live by the rules. A metro government has to be the bad guy.""
\
Currently, Metro Atlanta has some mechanisms for regional collaboration, but there is no ""bad guy"" to enforce the rules, West noted.
\
""Theoretically, what we have now could work if everybody agreed on the goal,"" he said.
\
Indeed, metro Atlanta has had cross-jurisdictional agencies for many years, but none has overarching, regional authority to implement plans.
\
MARTA was created by the legislature to include five counties: Clayton, Cobb, DeKalb, Fulton and Gwinnett. But each county was required to hold a referendum to impose the sales tax to pay for the transit system, and only DeKalb and Fulton have approved it.
\
The Atlanta Regional Commission was created 50 years ago as a joint planning agency for the two core counties and has expanded over the years to embrace 10. The ARC had little in the way of independent authority until Congress in 1991 gave it and similar bodies the right to program all federal transportation dollars in their region.
\
But because the vast majority of that money flows to metro Atlanta at the discretion of the state Department of Transportation, the ARC has used its authority merely to divide up a relatively small share of available money for projects primarily of local, rather than truly regional, interest. Since last January even that latitude has been severely restricted because of the failure of ARC and state officials to agree on a plan to clean up Atlanta's air.
\
Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell said MARTA is the logical first choice in establishing a regional authority, since it would help to address both transportation and air quality issues.
\
""There's nothing more fundamental to the whole regional issue than transportation,"" Campbell said. ""Once there's a meaningful dialogue on MARTA and expansion of transit to the suburban areas, we can expand the discussion to other regional issues.""
\
MARTA still in the cold
\
But MARTA expansion remains a hot-button issue in the suburbs. Key suburban politicians have opposed such a move. And in the most recent vote on MARTA, a 1990 ballot measure in Gwinnett, MARTA was voted down by 70 percent.
\
Jim Carson, head of Carter Commercial Properties and a longtime champion of regional cooperation at the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce, agreed that regional transit was important. But because it is politically sensitive, it might be better to start elsewhere, he said.
\
""The first step has to be special-purpose authorities,"" Carson said. ""It's more than could be done politically to say we'll have one overall tribunal that will resolve all the issues that cross county lines.
\
""I'd like to see it start with the airport, and see the state create an authority to oversee it,"" he added. ""I would guess that water and sewer is probably the next one to attack. Transportation is the most closely related to land use, and it's the most difficult."" The Atlanta chamber recently decided to take on transportation issues with its Metropolitan Transportation Initiative, a blue-ribbon committee of local notables that plans to make recommendations to the next governor.
\
Growth concerns
\
Separating functions, though, might not fix some underlying problems, some experts said. Most planners agree that it will be extremely difficult to get a handle on transportation problems as long as the region develops in a far-flung, automobile-dependent pattern. Likewise, air pollution will be hard to tame if car travel continues to escalate, and water quality is tough to maintain while development is allowed to encroach on rivers, streams and wetlands.
\
""You don't want to get to a point where you've isolated your community by function,"" West said. ""You don't want to have water on one side, transportation on one side, waste disposal on another. All those things need to be coordinated together.
\
""That doesn't mean they all have to be in one body,"" he added. ""There could be independent authorities and yet have them develop according to an overall agreed-upon plan, so that open space and environmental concerns are acknowledged along with transportation, water and sewer services.""
\
Fregonese suggested that the next governor could appoint a blue-ribbon committee to examine what other regions in the U.S. and Canada have done.
\
""Whatever they propose should include a clear description of the limited authority of a regional government,"" he added. ""Even though it would have to be created by the Legislature, it should be established by a vote of the region. Then start slowly solving one problem at a time. Pick your biggest issue and get going with that. Be a little modest in your goals and promises.""
\
Myron Orfield, a member of the Minnesota House who is a strong proponent of regional governance in his home state and nationally, urged a comprehensive approach.
\
""Start by consolidating water and sewer, the airport and transit,"" he said. ""You need a land-use planning act to require local governments to have careful, phased plans for expanding water, sewer, roads, transit, schools and stick to them.""
\
Georgia Rep. June Hegstrom, who is chairing a House Committee to rethink the composition and function of the ARC, said she was encouraged that so many metro residents appeared ready for change.
\
""We're going to see if we can make the ARC more user-friendly, as well as give it some teeth,"" she said. ""It won't be fun facing the people who feel like government is this big, bad thing. It will help that people understand we need a regional authority to deal with these regional problems.""
\
As a relative newcomer to Atlanta who hopes to stay, Gorin said he understood why support for regionalism was growing.
\
""There are a lot of new people coming in, and they find Atlanta beautiful and friendly,"" he said. ""They don't want to see that get destroyed.""

102,"Some Atlanta drivers --- who are shouldering the highest car ownership costs in the nation --- have seized upon an electrifying solution.\The number of plug-in cars on the road in Georgia is increasing by about 500 a month, and last month, Atlanta was the top-selling market in the country for the all-electric Nissan LEAF, surpassing even San Francisco and Los Angeles.\Paired with gains in the number of metro Atlantans choosing to telework, the rise in electric car purchases paints a picture of weary drivers looking for unconventional ways to save time and money.\While the number of electric cars is amping up, so is the debate on their value as relief from congestion and from reliance on fossil fuels, and perhaps of equal importance, their effect on gas tax revenue, the No. 1 source of money to pay for the nations's aging road and highway infrastructure.\Electric and hybrid vehicles still make up a tiny portion of vehicles on the road, about 2.2 million of the nation's approximately 253 million registered vehicles.\Nationwide, about 150,000 plug-in vehicles were in service at the end of August, according to the Electric Drive Transportation Association. About 3,000 of them were on the road in Georgia, and that number is growing by at least 500 per month, according to Don Francis, executive director of Clean Cities Atlanta.\Accenture consulting company forecasts 1.5 million electric-only vehicles in the United States by 2015. By 2020, more than 10 million electric vehicles could be on the road.\The Clean Air Campaign has not strongly endorsed electric cars, choosing instead to focus on promoting carpooling. That's because electric cars won't help congestion if people continue to drive alone.\""We hope they choose to carpool when they're riding in their EVs (electric vehicles),"" said Brian Carr, a spokesman for The Clean Air Campaign.\Whether an electric car is better for the environment than a hybrid or even a fuel-efficient car depends on which state you live in and how much that state relies on fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas to generate electricity.\The rising popularity of electric cars undoubtedly spells trouble for state and federal gas tax collections, a problem that lawmakers are still unsure how to tackle.\Also cutting into gas tax collections is the rising popularity of teleworking --- the fastest-growing commute option in the metro Atlanta area, according to a 2010 study commissioned by the Georgia Department of Transportation. More than 600,000 people telework occasionally in the region.\State gas tax revenue isn't keeping up with the growing population and its demands on transportation infrastructure. Instead the income has stagnated at $987 million in fiscal year 2013, slightly less than a peak high of over $1 billion that was reached in FY 2008. The national Highway Trust Fund, comprised of gas taxes, is also dwindling as more fuel-efficient and hybrid cars are introduced. Gas taxes are the primary funding source for fixing the nation's vast network of aging highways and bridges, which is projected to cost hundreds of billions of dollars.\Federal lawmakers have kicked around several possible solutions, including a 10-cent per gallon federal fuel tax increase, a mileage-based user fee and borrowing from the general fund. But so far, Congress has deadlocked.\Regional leaders were relying on the TSPLOST, a 10-year penny sales tax, to fund a laundry list of transportation projects in metro Atlanta. But since voters in the region overwhelmingly rejected the plan in a referendum last year, the focus now is on prioritizing spending on the most congested roadways, while taking advantage of cost-saving innovations in design and financing options (such as partnering with the private sector), said Toby Carr, director of planning for the Georgia Department of Transportation.\Last month, Bankrate.com ranked Georgia as the state with the highest average annual cost for car ownership in the country at $4,233 versus the national average of $3,201.\The cost of operating an electric car is about one-third that of a gas-powered vehicle. But the total cost of ownership should be carefully weighed, because electric cars have a higher sale price and a battery replacement can cost more than fuel-powered engine repairs.\Incentives for electric cars can add up to big savings, though. Georgia offers a $5,000 tax credit for buyers or leasors. And buyers are also eligible for a $7,500 federal tax credit. In addition, electric car owners can use HOT lanes on I-85 without paying a toll if they register for a Peach Pass.\The cost to buy an electric car depends on the make and model. It can range from $29,760 for the Nissan LEAF at the low end to $87,400 for the Tesla Model S at the high end. But many are choosing to lease instead of buy, since the battery technology is so rapidly evolving. A typical plug-in vehicle can travel about 100 miles per charge, a distance which according to the Federal Highway Administration is sufficient for more than 90 percent of all household vehicle trips in the United States.\A year ago, the Atlanta market only represented about 3 percent of LEAF sales. Last month, it accounted for up to a fifth of the 2,400 sales nationwide, according to Erik Gottfried, director of electric vehicle sales and marketing for Nissan.\However, Atlanta isn't the top market for all electric cars. The top three markets for the all-electric Ford Fusion are Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle, according to Ford spokesman Erich Merkle. Local sales data on other popular electric cars such as the Toyota Prius plug-in and Chevrolet Volt was not available.\East Cobb mom Rani Quirk bought the LEAF a few weeks ago and expects to save about $100-a week in fuel costs commuting to her Duluth job. Several neighbors already had electric cars, and now her next-door neighbor is interested in one.\""It's been kind of a snowball effect,"" Quirk said.\Credit: STAFF"
103,"
The Editors: The article on the high dropout rate among black college students, ""Diploma rate not budging,"" should come as no surprise to anyone. The problem is not just poor high school preparation. It's the disintegration of the traditional family, the disappearance of good factory jobs and the destructive impact of welfare programs.
\
Not long ago, urban blacks could leave high school and expect to find good jobs locally in manufacturing. Today, such jobs do not exist. The urban black family too often includes a single woman on welfare who is raising her teenage daughter's illegitimate children whose absent fathers probably are in jail. What chance do these children have to succeed in high school, much less in college?
\
Spelman College provost Dr. Glenda Price is quite right about the student's need for a ""solid foundation"" for college. Experts miss the mark by pointing to ""high school preparation"" instead of the family as the real building block for success.
\
Where is the cry?
\
The Editors: About the gas tax, here's an idea. Why doesn't Sen. Bob Dole crusade to repeal the tax he put on gas? After all, it's more than twice as large as the 1993 surcharge. And was that Dole recently doing a photo-op in front of a service station in Virginia which lowered its prices, supposedly in support of such a move?
\
Well, if prices can be lowered with the surcharge in place, why don't we simply urge others to do just that?
\
We know oil companies pushed up prices because this is an election year and they could get away with it while everyone argued over a moderate, much-needed tax which had nothing to do with it. We should not let them get away with it, nor let Dole, the senator for sale, help them.
\
The Republicans wanted to set up a permanent committee to investigate a minor land deal in 1978 Arkansas. Where is the cry from them for hearings on oil company price gouging?
\
Artificial prices
\
The Editors: Statements about the duration of high gasoline prices into summer lead me to believe the prices are artificial and are caused by heavy market speculation on oil futures. The market once again has provided short-term investors a windfall while penalizing the majority.
\
We must decide what is important. Continuing an environment where short-term investors are rewarded for creating market turmoil also rewards predatory investment and barbaric treatment of employees, weakens corporate research and development and destabilizes corporations. Creating an environment where long-term investment is encouraged rewards investment in building strong businesses through product development and corporate intellectual infrastructure development.
\
What's going on?
\
The Editors: I have often complained about the Department of Medical Assistance and its overview of the Medicaid problem, but I must say I don't understand just where it stands, especially after reading your articles on the cost of nursing home care billed to Medicaid. If only one bid is received on a multimillion-dollar contract, something is amiss. The requests for the proposal must go out again. The political ties (between the company bidding to operate the veteran's home in
\
Milledgeville and Gov. Zell Miller) should make it apparent something is fishy.
\
When I contract for a suite at a hotel, the salaries of the manager and the CEO are included in the cost per room. I don't care how much booze the CEO drinks or if he rides a pickup to the office. All I care about is the cost per room or cost per bed.
\
What hasn't been given the public for nursing home contracts is the total cost per bed or room a including meals, beverages, jets and salaries. This is the only figure we are interested in.
\
Market irony
\
The Editors: How ironic. When the economy soars and unemployment lessens, the stock market goes down, bringing losses to shareholders. Using the same logic, what happiness Wall Street might have if we had a Great Depression.
\
Education ripoff
\
The Editors: Legislators again have shown they are willing to sacrifice our children so the educational establishment can maintain their death grip on education. The General Assembly passed a bill which gives nationally certified teachers a $5,000 raise while reducing funding for high school instructional programs. The salaries of metro Atlanta teachers already exceed the national average.
\
The legislation allots unlimited state funds to pay teachers to become nationally certified. The fee is more than $2,000. But national certification is just another barrier to keep other professions from entering public education.
\
Subject knowledge and teaching skills are the main predictors of teaching quality. National certification does not assess subject knowledge; it simply accepts the already low academic standards set by the state.
\
As a high school teacher, I am concerned that the Legislature reduced high school funding to provide training and raises for teachers who participate in a program that does not recognize the importance of subject knowledge. As a science teacher, I am concerned that science receives the largest reduction in funds.

104,"METRO FINAL TODAY'S NEWS This article appeared in both The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta Constitution.\A federal transportation bill approved Tuesday by a Senate committee would mean $350 million a year more to Georgia roads, a measure applauded by state transportation officials who have long complained that Georgia doesn't get a fair shake in federal distribution of gas tax funds. ""It's very, very good news,"" said state DOT Chairman Wayne Shackelford. ""You've got to recognize this is step one.""\The bill, if it becomes law, would increase Georgia's roads budget from $1.3 billion to an average of $1.6 billion during the next six years, he said.\It could speed up projects such as interstate highway improvements, and help MARTA rail expansion, bridge improvements and safety programs that were hampered by a lack of funds, said George Boulineau, DOT's director of planning and programming.\The current formula used to distribute road funds is based on 1980 population figures. With Georgia's rapid growth, its return had diminished to about 76 cents on the dollar.\The six-year transportation bill should give all states about 91 cents on the dollar.\''Under this agreement, Georgians will receive significantly more money for transportation,'' said Sen. Paul Coverdell (R-Ga). ''This is a significant victory for the state of Georgia.'' Lawmakers from states like Georgia, which historically have paid more in gasoline taxes than they have received in federal highway aid, had been pushing legislation to guarantee them a 95 percent return. And House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) as late as Monday reiterated his support for that benchmark. The reallocation discussion was kicked off because the 4.3 cents of each gasoline tax dollar that was earmarked for deficit reduction is no longer needed. The total federal tax is 18.3 cents.\Overall, the Senate bill would increase Georgia's federal funds to $902.2 million a year. The state received $543.5 million annually from fiscal 1992 to 1996.\The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee approved the bill with bipartisan support. It still has to meet Senate approval, but its spending figure is closer to what is advocated by House transportation committee members.\Shackelford said the extra money would help the metro area even though it is under a federal ban on building additional roads\Credit: STAFF"
105," Playing race card will keep Al-Amin free\ Whew! I am glad to see that the Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin trial is, for all practical purposes, finally over with and another killer will be set loose soon just because he's black (""White men rejected for jury,"" News, Feb. 19). The defense attorneys have 99 percent ensured a not guilty verdict by placing plenty of blacks on the jury and rejecting any of those detestable conservative, Republican, Jesus- loving white men. After all, that's what most blacks mean when they say ""a fair trial"" for any black defendant: have as few whites as possible, get blacks who are opposed to the death penalty and, in this case, are sensitive to U.S.-hating Muslims.\ It worked for Ray Lewis and his two pals, and the notorious O.J. Even if Al-Amin were actually to confess, stinking liberals would still probably vow to defend him and set him free, but only because he is black.\ Justice aborted, again, via the race card.\ ROBIN LEDBETTER, Tucker\ Social Security is America at its best\ Thomas Oliver's @ Wits' End column of Feb. 15 linked the Social Security program with the Enron Ponzi scheme. This is a very distasteful, if not disgraceful, and perhaps ignorant comparison. Enron represents the worst behavior in our brilliant economic system. The rogues at Enron lied and cheated.\ The Social Security program represents the best in our economic system. At one time, the system discarded the elderly. It dictated that if you no longer produced, you were useless. Capitalism is brilliant, but it is also a brutal system. President Franklin D. Roosevelt knew that we could do better; he knew that the system could respond and initiated Social Security, which turned the most vulnerable segment of society into perhaps the least vulnerable.\ Some now want to privatize parts of this marvelous program. That's almost as crazy as @ Wits' End.\ JERRY HULSHULT, Canton\ Higher fuel efficiency won't have to cost jobs\ The column by Randy Thayer of General Motors on increasing Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency standards was well-meaning but misses the point (""Rules produce economic pain,"" @issue, Feb. 18). We do not have to choose between protecting the environment and protecting jobs. We can do both.\ Increasing fuel efficiency for cars, light trucks and SUVs can be achieved through advances in engine and transmission technology. It does not require that only smaller cars be sold, and it does not require that people in the Doraville plant, or any other plant, be laid off.\ We do not need to pick and choose what cars or SUVs can be on the roads. We need to ensure that all automobiles on the road are as clean as possible.\ For everyone's health, it is time to reduce pollution by increasing corporate fuel-efficiency for cars.\ JENNIFER GIEGERICH , Atlanta\ DeKalb school chief search is laughable\ The recent article on the search for a new leader for the DeKalb County school system made me realize why I enjoy reading the paper so much (""DeKalb schools eye D.C. educator,"" Metro, Feb. 19). Comic relief!\ We're told that the DeKalb County school board hired a search firm, and the best it could come up with were two existing superintendents from less-than-stellar school systems, an unnamed Georgia educator, and (lo and behold!) Vernon Jones' campaign manager! What the heck, running a political campaign is just like running a school system, right?\ Who needs the comics when there is material like this?\ ALEX McNEIL, Chamblee\ Barnes should cut executive spending\ King Roy is at it again. Recently our benevolent despot demanded that all departments in state government bite the bullet and cut back spending (""Cutbacks don't apply to governor,"" Metro, Feb. 18.) Apparently he is ignoring his own order as he is trying to add 25 employees to his own office.\ If the recession has hammered hard not only the state as well as state government, then our arrogant, officious governor should tighten his own belt and slash spending in the already bloated executive department.\ Perhaps ol' Roy should take a cue from Her Honor, the mayor of Atlanta, Shirley Franklin, and take a sizeable pay cut himself. Anyone agree?\ JACK McKINLEY, Cordele\ American Taliban\ Charen insults liberty-lovers\ According to Mona Charen, John Walker Lindh became a fighter for the Taliban because his parents were liberals, because his mother is a Buddhist and protested America's actions in Iraq and because his father is a homosexual (""To understand Lindh, look at liberal family,"" @issue, Feb. 19).\ So I guess, according to Charen's logic, conservatives never parent children who make bad decisions and destroy other people's lives.\ Give me a break. Charen's comments are not only an affront to Buddhists and homosexuals, but also to freedom-loving Americans everywhere. When is The Atlanta Journal-Constitution going to stop giving voice to inflammatory hypocrites such as Charen, who will clearly stop at nothing to insult others for their own personal aggrandizement?\ KEVIN LITTLE , Atlanta\ Conservative parents have bad kids, too\ Mona Charen finds an obvious explanation for John Walker Lindh's journey to fight America as a member of the Taliban: of course, it was his liberal Marin County, Calif., upbringing, right?\ But, gee, if Charen wants to allow environment as an explanation for criminal behavior, rather than personal responsibility, isn't that enough to get her right-wing pundit's credentials revoked?\ Furthermore, if a liberal background explains Lindh, then what kind of permissive leftist hellholes did Tim McVeigh and Eric Rudolph spring from?\ Privilege and permissiveness are not unique to families who lean to the left. Our president has acknowledged his own wild days, and his daughter and niece seem to be following in his footsteps. As far as we can tell, this doesn't seem to have bred any terrorist leanings.\ FRED ROBERTS and LARRY WOODRING, Decatur\ MARTA\ Rest of state shouldn't pay\ The recent editorial on MARTA funding problems demonstrates the myopic view that MARTA has when it comes to paying its bills (""MARTA needs reliable funding,"" @issue, Feb. 18). Though it currently serves only Fulton and DeKalb counties, MARTA expects the rest of Georgia to fund it while giving the majority of areas in the state no service whatsoever. And as an extension to this logic, it wants to tap into the gas tax pot, so more funds can flow into Atlanta, at the expense of hard-working and nonurban Georgians.\ A mass transit system will be successful only if it takes people where they want to go, and reasonably quickly. Unless one works in downtown Atlanta, MARTA does neither. Except for the runs to the airport, MARTA's transit system is useless to the majority of residents of the Northside. As the business center of Atlanta continues to move northward, MARTA trains still run with the old model of urban design.\ Perhaps Atlanta will finally figure that the rest of the state of Georgia will not bail it out of its financial difficulties. Let those who use MARTA pay for it and not expect the rest of us to fund their follies.\ ERIC FEINSMITH, Woodstock\ Rich intowners are opposed\ Do keep in mind that prosperous intowners share the same anti- MARTA views as suburbanites. Go to Candler Park and see that pedestrian residents are barred from strolling through a public park and entering the MARTA station by an 8-foot fence. What do you think motivates them to do that?\ The fence in Iverson Park exposes the truth about the intown, tree- hugging liberals. We intown MARTA riders do not need to travel to the suburbs to learn about opposition to MARTA.\ GREG STREIB, Atlanta\ Credit: FOR THE JOURNAL-CONSTITUTION"

Air quality problems that threaten the state's transportation funding. The steady degradation of waterways. Mounting traffic congestion with no relief in sight.
\
In the nine months since the last legislative session ended, these concerns have come to dominate the agenda in North Georgia. At chamber of commerce functions, on talk radio and in kitchen table conversations, there is a growing uneasiness that within the state's astounding economic success lie the seeds of its destruction.
\
In December, Gov. Zell Miller broke from state government's traditional any-growth-is-good-growth stance and sounded a warning.
\
""As I go into my last legislative session and reflect on the great progress we've made,"" he said, ""I see clearly it could all be imperiled if we don't begin to deal with these problems.""
\
Changing laws political risk
\
Miller began to deal with the problems by asking 20 percent of state employees to leave their cars at home during the summertime ozone season. He asked for planning money for commuter rail from Athens to Atlanta and for a $1,500 tax credit for businesses and individuals that purchase low-emission vehicles.
\
But as the 1998 legislative session gets under way, neither Miller nor anyone else has proposed to change the laws and policies that produce the sprawling, automobile-oriented development patterns that underlie the growth problems. In part, that's because it is politically treacherous territory ---especially this year.
\
""I've had several folks who are quite concerned because this is so important to our economy and environment, and they've asked why these issues aren't being talked about,"" said Sen. Charlie Tanksley (R-Marietta). ""Quite frankly, this is so controversial and so major an area that no one wants to touch it in an election year.""
\
Consider the issue of funding alternatives to highways. The Clean Air Act won't allow metro Atlanta to spend federal money on new road projects until it makes progress on air pollution. But Georgia law won't allow state transportation money to be spent on anything but roads. So Miller can propose to spend money on planning for commuter rail, for example, but at the moment there is no way to pay for it.
\
A bill that would permit state gas tax money to go toward bicycle and pedestrian ways and commuter rail passed the Senate last year but was buried in the House after Georgia Department of Transportation Commissioner Wayne Shackelford objected to the inclusion of rail. Because he controls whether projects in legislators' districts get built, Shackelford usually gets his way at the Capitol.
\
""I think it's dead,"" Sen. Steve Thompson (D-Powder Springs) said of the gas tax proposal. Thompson chairs the Senate Transportation Committee. ""The bottom line is that with limited funds for these rural communities (legislators are) not willing to pay for rail.""
\
'89 state limits law toothless
\
A proposal to raise the gas tax to pay for alternative modes as well as developmental highways also died quickly after Miller reiterated his pledge against new taxes.
\
Transportation funding, of course, is only one driver of sprawl. There are other areas the Legislature could address in this or future sessions to help manage urban growth and its problems, including some methods being tried by other states.
\
Oregon and Minnesota have required local governments to establish urban growth boundaries. The concept is to set a limit on how far the infrastructure and services that support development ---the water and sewer lines, roads, schools ---will be extended over the coming five, 10 or 20 years.
\
The Maryland Legislature last year chose a different approach with its Smart Growth law. The measure, championed by Gov. Parris Glendening, withholds state dollars for transportation, housing, water and sewer from areas outside those targeted for development by local governments. To keep development compact, residential growth areas must have a minimum of 3.5 dwellings per acre.
\
The Georgia Legislature actually intended to limit state funding similarly when it passed the Growth Strategies Act in 1989. But with no teeth in the law it made compliance by state agencies virtually voluntary, said Harry West, director of the Atlanta Regional Commission. Many state departments, most notably the DOT, have ignored it.
\
Elected board needed
\
One problem with managing Atlanta's sprawl is the go-it-alone approach of 16 metro counties and more than 100 cities, said Chris Nelson, a professor of city planning at Georgia Tech and an expert on growth management.
\
""Metro Atlanta needs an elected regional board that has the power to coordinate decision-making on issues of regional concern,"" Nelson said. ""Not police and parks, but cross-jurisdictional things like highways, rail systems and waterways. Unless that happens, growth will not be sustained. Nobody can create such a body but the state.""
\
The ARC doesn't have the authority to make its plans stick, said Nelson, and with a board dominated by local politicians, it isn't accountable for its regional actions.
\
Call for changes in ARC
\
Just as legislators are loath to defy the DOT, so too are ARC members. To counter that, a coalition of homeowners groups and U.S. Rep. Cynthia McKinney (D-Ga.) have called for state legislation this year to make the board directly elected.
\
But state Rep. Billy McKinney (D-Atlanta), the congresswoman's father, said he would not introduce such legislation. Instead, he is trying to increase the representation of Fulton and DeKalb counties on the board.
\
""It would be difficult to have an elected board,"" McKinney said. ""As long as the ARC is what it is, that wouldn't change anything anyway.""
\
As a step in the direction of regional coordination, the Georgia Future Communities Commission created legislation to be submitted this year that would allow counties and cities to band together to provide a particular service, such as recreation or water. The multijurisdictional agencies could not levy taxes, but would have to be funded by the fees they charge customers or contributions from local governments.
\
(The Future Communities Commission was formed by the Legislature two years ago to examine ways to make local governments more efficient while reducing their numbers. While making some recommendations on the former, it dissolved in December without taking action on the latter.)
\
Locals rely on growth
\
For Jim Chapman, director of Georgians for Transportation Alternatives, the question is ""how to rein in the Georgia DOT"" and end the cycle of road widening, overdevelopment and further road widening.
\
""We need some way to prevent existing roads from being overdeveloped, and for rewarding those local governments that preserve their state roads,"" Chapman said. ""Florida has a policy of only widening interstates to a certain number of lanes, and after that the local government has to pay or the state will pursue rail.""
\
West said sprawl will continue until there is reform in the way local governments are funded.
\
""We continue to make local government rely on property tax,"" he said, ""and it becomes very clear that the way to increase revenues is . . . by developing property. That means you have to promote development.""
\
Nelson also suggests asking voters to create a special fund to purchase development rights on land that is important to protect for the air, water, wildlife habitat or scenic views. Montgomery County, Md., has used that, along with 25-acre zonings in agricultural areas, to protect a third of its territory.
\
""People who own property would still own it,"" Nelson said, ""but they would have sold development rights for fair market value. It's the only way in this state to preserve those landscapes. It does so fairly and equitably by purchasing those rights.""
\
State's growth unchecked
\
Several legislators said any of these initiatives would have to be offered by the next governor. It's unclear whether urban sprawl and the related quality of life and environmental issues will become part of this year's statewide races. Some observers suggested they might play well in Atlanta's Republican-dominated suburbs, where activism on these issues has surged in recent months.
\
Meanwhile, the state's wildfire growth is continuing, as Miller pointed out in his State of the State address Thursday. Miller noted that Georgia was one of the fastest-growing states in the nation, adding an average of 2,000 jobs per week since 1991, as well as new residents to go with them.
\
""By the year 2000,"" he said, ""the South will surpass the Northeast in population.""
\
Not everyone finds that a comforting prospect.
\
""What we keep hearing from people is they're not willing to give up everything they like about living here and their environment to grow for growth's sake,"" West said. ""We have to be a little more intelligent about what we do.""
"

OPPONENTS OF THE OUTER Perimeter are furious that the state Department of Transportation has, quite reasonably we think, declined to spend the public's money to restudy the impact of the proposed highway through Forsyth and Gwinnett counties. Why are we not surprised?
\
An environmental impact study was conducted eight years ago; the DOT is not legally required to do another and is under no moral obligation to provide ammunition to adversaries who flat-out oppose the highway in any form whatsoever.
\
There is a line here, often crossed in zealotry, between regulation as the useful protector of the public interest and regulation as a weapon of harassment of projects and public officials that represent policy choices with which the would-be regulators disagree.
\
This is one of the reasons, frankly, that we welcome devolution, with the shift in authority from federal to state officials.
\
Regulation has a common-sense place in government; reasonable people making a good- faith effort to apply rational standards to protect the public and the environment ought to be able to make a decision about something like the northern arc of the Outer Perimeter and move on to complete it.
\
We, as you might guess, favor at least the northern arc. It's an essential connector linking northwest Georgia to the eastern seaboard. We are, however, distressed at the prospect that it would be a toll road. It is appalling that Georgians will spend billions of dollars to complete 13 so-called developmental highways, where there is little traffic justification, while forcing individual users to pay extra to drive on a highway that is needed.
\
By borrowing money to build unneeded roads, the state's taxpayers this year find themselves forced to spend $116.4 million in interest and principal on debt accumulated at about $100 million per year for four- lane roads. This state, once again this year, will borrow $100 million, above and beyond the gas tax revenues. Over the next 20 years, taxpayers will pay $1.5 billion in principal and interest on developmental highway debt accumulated since 1989.
\
The reality, then, is this: Money is spent for unneeded roads and is not available for one that would be heavily used. The motorists who drive on it, assuming the regulatory obstructions are cleared, will pay twice: once at the toll both and again at the gas pump.

Islamorada, Village of Islands, Fla. - Ten years ago, when Ron Levy moved to this picturesque fishing village in the middle Florida Keys, he thought he'd found paradise.
\
Eventually he learned even paradise has its potholes.
\
""We moved here for the quality of life, for the water, the environment and the small-town atmosphere,"" said Levy, a ceramic artist who had lived most of his life in New York City. ""But after being here a couple of years, we felt the trend of government, of growth and degradation of the environment was contrary to what we came here for.""
\
It's a story that could be told about dozens of Florida communities. Warm weather and scenic beauty have drawn thousands of newcomers, who at first are dazzled by their new surroundings, only to watch the steady encroachment of problems like the pollution, overcrowding, crime and traffic they left behind.
\
Levy decided to do something about it.
\
Until this year, unincorporated Islamorada was governed by the Monroe County Commission, which oversees the 120-mile-long chain of islands that stretch from just south of Miami to Key West. Levy led a drive to incorporate Islamorada so residents would have their own local government.
\
""The County Commission meets in Key West,"" he said. ""We would have them voting on some local issue and nobody from here had the time to drive 80 miles to their meeting. There was no access.""
\
A year ago, residents voted in favor of forming their own city, which is officially named Islamorada, Village of Islands, population 7,500. This spring the town's first election was held and Levy, to no one's surprise, was chosen mayor.
\
Now he and his fellow commissioners are helping map the future of one of Florida's best-loved --- and most threatened --- areas. Their new town encompasses Plantation, Windley and Upper and Lower Matecumbe Keys, 30 miles south of Key Largo and 80 miles north of Key West.
\
""The issue is quality of life and local control,"" Levy said. ""Big regional governments just can't address the problems of a local neighborhood because they don't live here. We want people who live here making the decisions.""
\
The biggest issue on the minds of most residents seems to be preserving the Keys' stunning environment. The islands have been battered in recent years by pollution that has clouded offshore waters and threatened the fish and brilliant corals that bring millions of visitors each year. Growth and commercial development have also marred some of the once-quaint islands as thousands of new residents have moved in.
\
Islamorada's new government is sharply pro-environment. The city is home to several upscale resorts that cater to fishermen, and residents seem to understand that keeping local waters clean is vital to keeping the economy healthy.
\
""This is a fishing community,"" Levy said. ""What we need is growth that is appropriate, that will help us preserve what we've got.""
\
The other big issue on the minds of locals is more like what you might find in any Atlanta suburb: People want a say in what is built around them, in what densities and signs and types of buildings are allowed.
\
""We want to keep the mom-and-pop feel of the place,"" said Jeff Gleason, an airline pilot who moved here with his wife after discovering it on a diving vacation. ""We don't want to be Key Largo or Marathon with an Office Depot and a Home Depot. We like the village feel.""
\
Gleason and his friends supported forming a new government, and so far are pleased with its performance.
\
Other residents aren't so sure.
\
Henry Rosenthal is a 30-year resident who owns one of Islamorada's landmarks, the Green Turtle Restaurant. Active for years in the chamber of commerce, he believes Levy and the other newcomers lack experience, despite their good intentions.
\
""It's adding a new layer of bureaucracy,"" he said of the new government. ""They've already bought a fire truck. Well, the county had a fire truck on Plantation Key. What do we need one for? Now I guess they'll need a building to put it in and somebody to drive it.""
\
Levy is aware of the criticisms. As mayor, he's gotten an earful at many of the commission meetings, which often draw crowds of 50 to 60 residents.
\
But he believes the new city is actually saving money while providing better services. Tax bills in Islamorada's first year went down a small amount, which Levy attributes to good budgeting and the town's ability to tap sources other than just property taxes.
\
""We get a share of the sales tax, of the gas tax, of state community development money,"" he said. ""Before, that money went to the county, and they could spend it in Key West or Marathon or someplace else.""
\
The city ended its first year in the black, with revenues of some $5.5 million and expenses of $4 million, Levy said. The surplus has enabled the city to purchase a large marina on Plantation Key that will be used for recreation and city offices --- a purchase the city is making without raising taxes.
\
As Islamorada approaches its first anniversary, most residents seem supportive --- or at least willing to give the new government a chance.
\
""I think it's kind of wait-and-see,"" said longtime resident Dottie Sena, who helps her son run a marina and resort. ""They did a real good job cleaning up after the hurricane, and my taxes did go down a little. But it's too early to be passing judgment.""

\
STATE SENATE: DISTRICT 10 Bart Ladd (R) Age: 41 Residence: Atlanta Education: Bachelor's and master's degrees, Purdue University Profession: Pilot Political experience: State representative, 1991-present Personal: Single Top priority: To help the Republican team transition into the majority role in state government. This would require the experience I've gained over the last eight years, especially in the areas of taxation. The focal issue is to remove the ad valorem tax from automobiles. The General Assembly changed the method of this tax a couple of years ago and, frankly, messed it up. I opposed those changes, tried to fix it after it passed, and realized that we need to just get rid of it. The local jurisdiction can get lost revenue from the state coffers, which are bulging.

(2) Quality education --- setting higher standards for teachers and students. (3) Crime reduction --- offering ideas for tougher enforcement and sentencing. (4) Health care --- making health insurance more affordable and available.
\
J. Max Davis (R) (I) Age: 59 Residence: Atlanta Education: Bachelor's and law degrees Profession: Attorney Political experience: 18 years in Georgia House of Representatives Personal: Wife, Mary; three children Top priority: To continue fulfilling my promise to represent the people of the 60th District in a conservative manner, and to uphold the philosophy of Republicanism as a conservative should. I will continue to promote the philosophy which causes government to stay out of our lives as much as possible and which allows the taxpaying citizen to keep as much of his or her earnings as possible. I will continue to keep my pledge to never vote for a tax increase and to vote for all measures which tend to reduce the government's take. I will continue my ""tough on crime"" stance and will continue to try to improve our education system.

STATE HOUSE: DISTRICT 62 Sally Roettger Harrell (D) Age: 32 Residence: Atlanta Education: Master's, University of Georgia Profession: Executive director, Healthy Mothers, Healthy Babies Coalition of Georgia Political experience: Policy analyst on issues relating to child well-being Personal: Husband, Jay Top priority: The return of local decision-making is allowing the state Legislature to truly impact the lives of Georgians. I have seen this through my work with the Georgia Council on Child Abuse and with the Healthy Mothers, Healthy Babies Coalition of Georgia. I am also very concerned about health care. As we move towards consolidating limited medical resources, I want to make sure that families are central to their own decisions. The state Legislature can be a powerful tool in addressing many concerns. If elected as representative, I will be available to hear the concerns of the constituents, and to learn from them.
\
Linton Broome (R) Age: 65 Residence: Chamblee Education: Bachelor's degree, public administration, University of Georgia Profession: Editorial services-investor Political experience: Former city commisioner and mayor of Doraville; chairman of DeKalb County Airport Authority Personal: Wife, Ruth; three children Top priority: To work and vote in every way to combat the insidious drug problem and to help bring the International Village concept to fruition in south Chamblee, which lies within my House district (62).

\
Virginia Kent Leslie (D) Age: 56 Residence: Decatur Education: Bachelor's degree, Queens College; master's, doctorate degrees, Emory University Profession: College professor Political experience: Lobbying for Atlanta Food Bank; volunteer for political campaigns Personal: Husband, Robert; two children Top priority: (1) Strongly represent the district as we consider the impact of constructing a 2,000-(car) parking deck on Clairmont, increasing the density of older apartment complexes, and the bisecting of our district by a rapid rail line. (2 ) Address quality of life issues: the need to reform and restructure health care delivery services; to provide for excellent child and elder care; to value and support teachers and students in meaningful ways; to assure that the water Georgians drink and the air they breathe are clean and that our natural resources are protected as an irreplaceable legacy for our children.
\
STATE HOUSE: DISTRICT 64 Arnold Mays Ragas (D) (I) Age: 31 Residence: Stone Mountain Education: Bachelor's and law degrees from Georgia State University. Profession: Lawyer Political experience: State representative, 1997-present Personal: Wife, Cheryl; one child Top priority: I will continue working toward reforming HMOs. Managed health care has become less about health care and more about managment. People should be allowed greater choice in deciding their doctors. When HMOs delay or deny coverage to someone deserving and entitled, they should be accountable. I will continue maintaining and expanding pre-K, expanding after-school programs, especially for at-risk students, and protecting the HOPE scholarship.
\

Watson (D) (I) Age: 44 Residence: Decatur Education: Columbia College; Georgia State University Profession: Tenet Healthcare Political experience: State legislator Personal: Wife, Pamela; one child Top priority: To continue to raise the salaries of teachers and Georgia's ranking in education. To provide teachers with more authority in the classroom and protection from violent students. To create a communication bridge between developers and school systems, showing the correlation between residential development and overcrowded classrooms. Air quality must be addressed. We need alternatives to commuting, and we need to provide employers with more incentives to implore workers to use mass transit. We must work to attract industry and cultural arts facilities to south DeKalb.
\
Catherine Gilliard (R) Age: 42 Residence: Stone Mountain Education: Bachelor's, University of Kansas Profession: Owner, Gilliard Communications Political experience: None Personal: Husband, Eric; three children Top priority: Connecting businesses and students to form an economic empowerment relationship that provides ""real-world"" intern opportunities in corporate settings. First, I would eliminate trailers from all schools in the district. By reducing the number of students attending our schools to the proper occupancy, mid- to small businesses can make a significant impact in the training of our future leaders now enrolled in high school in public, private or home-school classes. More students could participate in these programs because smaller businesses would adopt schools with smaller enrollments and prepare students to take their places as business leaders of tommorow.
\
STATE HOUSE: DISTRICT 63 Earl O'Neal (D) (I) Age: 70 Residence: Conyers Education: Bachelor's, Florida State University; master's, George Peabody College Profession: Retired educator Political experience: Six years in Georgia House of Representatives Personal: Wife, Glenn Ann; three children Top priority: 1) Education. 2) Health care. 3) Crime.

SENATE DISTRICT 56 Ellen Milholland (D) Age: 43 Residence: Roswell Education: Bachelor's, master's and law degrees Profession: Homemaker Political experience: None Personal: Husband, James; two children Top priority: I will concentrate my efforts on tackling the pressures of exploding growth in District 56 by: 1) reallocating funds to rapidly growing school systems; 2) reducing class size to ensure that our students will be able to compete in a sophisticated job market; 3) balancing environmental restrictions, job creation and residential development to improve air and water quality and 4) changing Georgia's Constitution to allow gasoline tax proceeds to be used for sidewalks, bike paths, intermodal transportation and drivers education.
\
Thomas E. Price (R) (I) Age: 43 Residence: Roswell Education: Bachelor's and M.D. degrees, University of Michigan Profession: Physician Political experience: State senator, 1996-present Personal: Wife, Elizabeth; one child Top priority: To foster a more challenging and successful public education system with greater accountability and competition and allowing teachers disciplinary authority so that disruptive students will not be able to rob others of their opportunity to learn; to require more fiscal responsiblity in government and to allow hard-working Georgians to keep more of what they earn, including returning to our citizens any tax surplus; and to increase the safety for all Georgian families and children by ensuring ""truth-in-sentencing"" for violent criminals.

DISTRICT 78 Mary Hodges Squires (D) Age: 40 Residence: Norcross Education: Bachelor's degree, University of South Florida, Tampa Profession: Title examiner Political experience: Former lobbyist Personal: Divorced; two children Top priority: My campaign is based on going door-to-door and learning from the constituents what their issues are. If elected, my top priority will be to work with the people of the district on solving their issues.

""Ron"" Crews (R) (I) Age: 50 Residence: Tucker Education: Bachelor's degree, Stetson University; master's degree, Columbia Theological Seminary; doctorate, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School Profession: Pastor, New Covenant Community Church Political experience: Three terms as state representative Personal: Wife, Jonda; four children Top priority: Since my first election, it has been my goal to be a voice for the families of District 78 and as a result, to be a voice for families in this state. My 25 years as a pastor have provided a breadth and depth of experience in dealing with the needs of families: jobs, child care, single-parenting, financial counseling, marriage and educational concerns. I have also met with families addressing safety and crime concerns. I have served in the Meadowcreek Cluster of schools as PTA President, LSAC member and helper. My top priority will continue to be a voice for families.

HOUSE DISTRICT 79 John Schwab (D) Age: 67 Residence: Norcross Education: Bachelor's in arts, North Texas State University; Club Managers Association of America certification in private club management Profession: Retired general manager of the former Peachtree World of Tennis Political experience: Ran in the 1996 Republican primary Personal: Single, divorced Top priority: Restoring personal freedoms and removing of the religious right's attempt to impose its brand of morality. The religious right's domination of the Republican Party has driven many fiscal conservatives like myself from the party's ranks. It is bitterly ironic that the party which once stood for less government and greater personal freedoms has been taken over by people, such as state Rep. Tom Rice, who want to pass laws allowing government to poke its nose in our private lives, controlling what we check out in our public libraries and what consenting adults do in private.
\
Tom Rice (R) (I) Age: 57 Residence: Norcross Education: Bachelor's degree, Temple University Profession: Developing multimedia training as a partner in The Quality Group Political experience: One term as state representative Personal: Wife, Ann; three children Top priority: As a member of the House Education Committee, I will focus on enhancements to school choice, public school funding and quality and reading initiatives that will enhance the opportunity of Georgia's students to enter an increasingly competitive market place. I believe the Charter School Bill, initiated by Republicans and passed on a bipartisan basis, is the first step in offering alternatives in education that will have the effect of raising academic achievement in all schools. This issue is my passion and a prime purpose for running for re-election.
\
HOUSE DISTRICT 82 Mike Coan (R) (I) Age: 29 Residence: Lawrenceville Education: Bachelor's degree, University of West Georgia Political experience : State representative since 1996 Personal: Wife, Hope Top priority: To continue the fight to give the citizens of Georgia real tax relief. We gave the people a small tax cut of $168 per family of four, but I know we can do better than that. We must get our spending under control and our priorities in order. We must stop the election year vote-buying by representatives using our tax dollars. In the last budget, there were over 600 pork barrel projects costing taxpayers more than $15.7 million. I will continue to fight for lower taxes and less government.
\
Carol A. Plunkett (D) Age: N/A Residence: Lawrenceville Education: Bachelor's degree, Georgia State University Profession: Casualty insurance broker Political experience: Ran for state representative in 1992 Personal: Divorced; two children Top priority: 1) To bring some balance to our ultra conservative Gwinnett delegation. They need a woman's perspective. 2) Consumer rights in managed care. Debate the pros and cons of the whole issue. I have a college degree, I work in the insurance industry, and I still can't seem to match facility coverage with the facilities' doctor! 3) Rethink school sports programs. Schools are much bigger and fewer students as a percentage of the whole can participate.
\
HOUSE DISTRICT 86 William Donald ""Don"" Webster (D) Age: 40 Residence: Braselton Education: Bachelor's degree Profession: Financial services professional Political experience: Member, Braselton City Council Personal: Wife, Nancy Top priority: It is important that we improve local public education, sustain the economy, and protect the environment. In my work as a professional financial planner, I have helped many families and small businesses protect their hard-earned assets and plan for a better future. I know first-hand the kinds of problems individuals and families face --- making ends meet and getting the best value for dollar. Also, I know planning and level-headed decision-making combined with hard work is the best formula for success. My wife, Nancy, and I want to give something back to the community that has been so good to us.

COUNTYWIDE REFERENDUM
\
All Gwinnett County voters except for city of Buford residents may vote in a referendum on granting qualified elderly and disabled homeowners a school tax exemption.
\
The amendment would make eligible all disabled homeowners, and those 65 and older, who earn less than $25,000, excluding Social Security payments.
\
Current guidelines disqualify some elderly and disabled homeowners whose income stems primarily from investments or rental property, not Social Security or pension funds.
\
The amendment would not cause anyone to lose the exemption.
\
But the additional people claiming the exemption would cost the Gwinnett County school system an estimated loss of at least $1 million.
\
School officials, however, are supporting the measure, saying it is an issue of fairness for seniors.

"
111," The Environment\ What is the most important environmental challenge facing the state?\ Sonny Perdue, Republican incumbent:\ One of the most challenging issues facing the state is ensuring that we have a plentiful and quality water supply as Georgia grows and prospers. I signed into law the Comprehensive Statewide Water Plan, and now I'm focused on a resolution to the ongoing tristate water wars to protect our water supply into the future.\ Mark Taylor, Democrat:\ Water conservation is one of the most important environmental issues facing Georgians today, but that is not the only resolution. The recent mistake in miscalculating the water level in Lake Lanier for months is telling. Without accurate figures, I don't see how any realistic or meaningful negotiating [with Alabama and Florida over sharing the Chattahoochee River] can even begin. The longer we wait for an approved water plan that the Legislature funds, the worse off we will be. The dam really is breaking for all of us --- figuratively and literally. And that doesn't mean that we ignore the need for more aggressive conservation of water either.\ -----\ Should the state set up a permanent, dedicated source of funding for land conservation?\ Sonny Perdue, Republican incumbent:\ I signed into law the Governor's Land Conservation Act, which established a trust fund and a revolving loan fund of $100 million in state, federal and private funding. My priorities for this program are protection of water quality, prime agricultural and forest lands and fragile natural habitats.\ Mark Taylor, Democrat:\ Absolutely. As governor, land conservation and green space funding will be a priority. Unfortunately, Governor Perdue has passed on several opportunities for land conservation. In 1996, I supported the effort to pass a constitutional amendment that authorized the creation of a State Land Trust to purchase, maintain and preserve lands and to protect river corridors and environmentally sensitive lands.\ -----\ Should the state encourage renewable energy?\ Sonny Perdue, Republican incumbent:\ Absolutely. That is why I have proposed a sales tax exemption for the construction of biofuel facilities in Georgia (biodiesel, ethanol and butanol). This is a great way for leaders at the state level to do everything possible to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, protect the environment and create other sources of commerce for Georgia's ag industry.\ Mark Taylor, Democrat:\ Yes. More than 18 states have adopted renewable energy standards. Some have set a target percentage at a future date; others have adopted annual percentage increases. Although Georgia is behind in considering such legislation, we can use other states' experiences to adopt standards that are obtainable and that significantly enhance the environment. In 2002, I supported HB 1389 and 1439, which provided state income tax credit for low emission and low speed vehicles. I continue to support such credits and believe they should be expanded.\ -----\ Immigration\ Should employers be punished for knowingly hiring illegal immigrants?\ Sonny Perdue, Republican incumbent:\ I believe all citizens who knowingly break the law should be held accountable. However, I don't expect employers to do the job of the federal government and INS and become experts in document verification. We need to secure our borders, create fraud-proof documents, and then we can start talking about what role private business needs to play.\ Mark Taylor, Democrat:\ I think there should be tougher penalties for those employers who knowingly hire illegal aliens, but there must be intent to break the law. Employers who unknowingly hire illegal immigrants should only be subject to existing laws regarding employment and taxation.\ -----\ A bill supported by the president would provide a path to citizenship for people illegally in the country. Do you support such a proposal?\ Sonny Perdue, Republican incumbent:\ The first step is to secure the border. Period. After our border is secure, we can talk about a sensible policy that integrates legal workers into our economy as they are needed. I do not believe that any new immigration policy should allow illegal immigrants to break line in front of people that have been following the law and waiting to enter our country legally.\ Mark Taylor, Democrat:\ We should avoid any provision that rewards illegal behavior; providing amnesty will only encourage more illegal immigration.\ -----\ Do you think the influx of illegal immigrants into Georgia has held down wages for people legally in this country?\ Sonny Perdue, Republican incumbent:\ I am a facts-based kind of guy. I wouldn't want to speculate on such a comment without seeing some reliable facts on the topic. But one can generally assume that laws of supply and demand work in the work force as they do in the rest of the free market. If supply is affected, then demand (and therefore wages) could be as well.\ Mark Taylor, Democrat:\ Wages have suffered in this country because many of our well- paying jobs have been outsourced to foreign countries. I support policies that will keep and create jobs for our hard-working Georgians such as raising the minimum wage and providing incentives to companies that bring well-paying jobs to Georgia. We already have a guest worker program that allows immigrants to work in this country legally, but condoning illegal labor is not fair to our hard- working citizens.\ -----\ Transportation\ What is the most pressing transportation issue facing the state, and what would you do about it?\ Sonny Perdue, Republican incumbent:\ There are different transportation needs across the state. In the metro Atlanta area, congestion is the number one issue that we have focused on. [Examples Perdue cites include creating ""a culture of cooperation among transportation"" agencies, establishing the Fast Forward $15.5 billion six-year program of accelerated projects, the record $2.25 billion in transportation projects the state DOT committed to last year, coordinating traffic signals, which he says saved drivers nearly $9 million in delay costs, promoting teleworking and flex schedules, and creating the Congestion Mitigation Task Force, which he says makes congestion relief the top priority in allocating transportation resources.]\ Mark Taylor, Democrat:\ In Atlanta, the issue is traffic congestion. Outside of Atlanta, transportation and roads play a major part in job creation. We need a balanced approach that recognizes the unique needs of all of Georgia. In Atlanta, we need to look at both commuter rail and light rail to solve our congestion problems. However, we must be equitable in our resources, and our transportation budget must include funds for improving the infrastructure in rural Georgia.\ -----\ Transportation funding is falling short nationwide, and Atlanta's congestion is epic. Possible changes to the gas tax are being floated for the 2007 session, including a statewide sales tax, or permitting regions like metro Atlanta to vote on a dedicated sales tax. Would you support a change to transportation funding? If so, what?\ Sonny Perdue, Republican incumbent:\ I am not in support of raising the state gas tax. Georgians are paying more than $801 million a year in gas taxes. In 2003 I committed $424 million in bonds to transportation projects. In 2004 I announced the $15 billion Fast Forward transportation program to relieve congestion and spur economic growth through the acceleration of existing projects. In 2006 I announced the ""Paving the Way Home"" Initiative, which budgeted $234 million for local road funding in all 159 Georgia counties. Prosperity brings with it successes and challenges. We must keep this region and the state an attractive place to live and work.\ Mark Taylor, Democrat:\ Georgia invests in transportation at two-thirds the U.S. average. This problem is growing daily, and we must have regional solutions. Our balanced approach must include investments in both mass transit and roads. Georgians pay a 4 percent sales tax and a 7.5 cent-per- gallon charge on fuel. When gas prices rise, the amount collected in taxes automatically increases, making it harder on Georgians to go about their daily business. We should look at alternative fuels to help offset long-term fuel costs and we could look into recalculating the method in which it's collected, provided that the method is fair and doesn't increase the tax on motor fuel.\ -----\ Crime\ Would you support changes to the sweeping sex offender law passed this year? For instance, to allow registered sex offenders to live and work within 1,000 feet of churches and school bus stops? Why or why not?\ Sonny Perdue, Republican incumbent:\ Our strongest obligation is to keep Georgia citizens safe, especially for our children. I was proud to sign a bill that did everything in our power to keep dangerous sexual predators away from our children, and I will support improvements to the law that will better protect our families from harm.\ Mark Taylor, Democrat:\ No, but I do think that we must fund it so our local officials can fully implement it. We don't need more childhood victims to show us the need for a serious law that keeps predators away from our children.\ When I am governor, repeat sexual predators will not get a free pass. In fact, they will potentially face the death penalty.\ -----\ Education\ Every year, voters are reminded that Georgia's average SAT score lags nearly every other state. Currently, the state average is 1477 on a scale with a top score of 2400, making Georgia 46th in the country. What, if anything, will you do to improve student performance on the SAT?\ Sonny Perdue, Republican incumbent:\ I am committed to raising SAT scores in Georgia. We have increased awareness through programs like the Governor's Cup, a statewide SAT improvement competition in public schools. We have increased opportunities for preparedness by making PSAT and Advanced Placement classes, both proven to improve performance on the SAT, more accessible through the Georgia Virtual School that we established a few years ago. Georgia's high school sophomores can now take the PSAT free and more students than ever are attempting and passing Advanced Placement tests. And we have also funded a free online SAT prep course.\ Mark Taylor, Democrat:\ These low test scores reflect on Gov. Perdue's refusal to make education a top priority. Our scores in reading and math have dropped or stayed the same, while education is still not made a priority. I will stop the billion-dollar cuts to education and lower class sizes in grades k-3.\ -----\ The state is defending itself against a lawsuit that says Georgia inadequately funds its public schools. Superintendents have complained for years that cuts to the education funding formula hurt their schools. Are schools getting the money they need? Please explain your answer.\ Sonny Perdue, Republican incumbent:\ Georgia is spending more on education than it ever has --- over $1 billion more. And Georgia is spending more per student than it ever has. State funding alone has increased over $400 per student per year over the course of my term. But the question of how much money we spend is missing the bigger point. I believe that academic success in Georgia is not solely a function of how much money we spend. How we invest our education dollars is critical. Do we spend our education dollars on more of the same? Or do we begin to invest in excellence and proven best practices? That is why I have established an education finance task force called IE2, Investing in Education Excellence. This task force is reviewing best practices from all over the state that contribute to an excellent education for Georgia students.\ Mark Taylor, Democrat:\ Right now, schools all across this state are suffering from more than $1.25 billion in cuts to education. Nearly 100 school districts have been forced to raise property taxes as a result and this puts an even greater strain on our hard-working families. You will hear the opposite from my opponent. Ask your teachers and your local school board members and they can attest to the seriousness and the true effect of the cuts.\ > AJC.COM/ELECTION: Go online for full responses and additional questions, plus more coverage including breaking news\ CAPTION: Sonny Perdue\ CAPTION: Mark Taylor\ Credit: STAFF"
112," The following is a selection of reader comments on the Atlanta Regional Commission's Mobility 2030 transportation plan detailed in a series of Horizon stories in recent weeks.\ Transportation thinking far too conventional\ I lost track of the number of times in the past week that major highways were completely shut down by accidents, bomb scares, hazardous material alerts and other things.\ I imagine more than one express bus was in the backup. HOV lanes are in the same roadway and subject to the same blockages and delays. If bus rapid transit had been running in parallel, albeit separate lanes, those vehicles would have been at a standstill, also. When is ARC going to get out of the concrete-and-asphalt box and realize that alternative means of transport needs to be available?\ The lion's share of ""transit"" in Mobility 2030 is for the same old rubber-tired vehicles. The only commuter rail line in the plan is the one that's already an almost done deal, and I doubt if it would have been included otherwise. How come every city that is larger than Atlanta in the 2000 census has commuter rail operating or in advanced planning?\ The innovative Atlanta Belt Line is not included but may be now through no fault of the ARC --- it has been spearheaded by other political powers thinking outside of the box. Likewise, the Peachtree Streetcar project is missing.\ MARTA is the largest metro transportation system in the United States that receives no state funding, but the plan does nothing to address a broader funding base for MARTA or transit in general.\ A plan that does not address transit issues in a bold way will leave us worse off than today, and that, by the way, is exactly what Mobility 2030 does, by ARC's own admission.\ STEVE VOGEL, Decatur\ Earmarking tax dollars the wisest way to go\ Since it appears that metro Atlanta's $52 billion transportation plan won't bear fruit until next decade, let me offer some suggestions that can get drivers out of their cars sooner:\ Commence commuter rail service between Woodstock and Atlanta, Atlanta and Griffin, and Athens and Atlanta. This solution will give commuters in the northern, southern and eastern suburbs options, and the service can be up and running fairly quickly using existing freight lines. Building the Belt Line gives intown residents a way to move around using light rail. The Peachtree Streetcar will move people from downtown out to Buckhead. People want rail --- give it to them.\ Enact a 5-cents-per-gallon gas tax for metro Atlanta's drivers, and 3 cents per gallon for the rest of the state. Write an amendment to the state constitution that earmarks these funds for mass transit improvements only. At this point in time, gas tax funds are only to maintain roads and bridges. This amendment would be separate from the existing gas tax.\ All of this other creative funding (tax allocation districts, etc.) is acceptable, but we need money now. Earmarking the tax dollars protects the money from being used for other than its intended purpose.\ ROGER COLEY, Lithonia\ Netherlands a nirvana of mass transportation\ When will Americans realize that we need mass transit to lower reliance on oil, to keep air cleaner and to move more people more efficiently.\ We are currently living in the Netherlands and can get anywhere in great time --- by rail, bus or bike! Of course the bikes wouldn't do in Atlanta's heat and humidity and hills, but the trains would be wonderful.\ Inter-city transportation is marvelous and regular. Thousands of bikes around everywhere, and they have right of way --- in most cases. On the highway there are bike lanes. And the price of gas is now the equivalent of $5 a gallon, so even those with small cars use them as infrequently as possible.\ Somehow mothers manage to ride a bike, have an infant in the front seat, a toddler on the back seat and carry their purchases on saddle bags or over the handle bars. It is amazing!\ This might not work in our climate, but it certainly points to the necessity for mass transit to cover large areas. People here do live up to a 90-minute train commute from their place of work, but they still don't use private cars.\ MARYLOU H. FOLEY\ Foley is an Ansley Park resident living in Delft in the Netherlands for a semester with her husband, who is a Georgia Tech professor on sabbatical.\ Higher gasoline tax would be worth it\ We need leaders who will take action to make mass transit a reality across the metro area. MARTA is coming apart at the seams, and there is no bright light at the end of this tunnel. ARC has a great plan in Mobility 2030 but nowhere near enough money to make it a reality.\ There are plans all over the place. There is one great idea after another.\ We have planned for light rail into Cobb, we have planned for bus rapid transit across the Top End Perimeter, we have planned for rail service to south DeKalb, we have planned for two different loops to circle the city and connect various intown destinations like Piedmont Hospital, Emory, Piedmont Park, the zoo, the West End and West Midtown, and the list goes on.\ This leads me to ask one basic question: Where is the money?\ Where is dedicated funding for mass transit? Where is a new or increased gas tax? Where is a restructuring of our current gas tax so that it can pay for mass transit in addition to roads? But the most important question of all, where are our leaders? Obviously tax is not a popular word. It often spells the death of a career for a politician.\ However, I believe that metro Atlantans would embrace a leader who can level with them about traffic. It is going to take more money than we currently have to adequately address traffic in our region; there is no way around that. The state, the feds, the tooth fairy, no one else is going to step in and write us a check. We created this problem for ourselves, and we are responsible for fixing it. That means we have to foot the bill.\ PATRICK BUSKO, Atlanta\ $52 billion for roads better spent elsewhere\ Instead of spending $52 billion on road improvements, they should spend that money on a public transportation system. It is illogical to think we can keep up with growth in numbers of people and cars by adding more pavement.\ It will ultimately damage the environment beyond repair and encourage more unnecessary car buying and driving and wasting of precious resources.\ If someone is foolish enough to buy a house way out in the middle of nowhere without a transportation system, they earned the traffic jams. Let them stew in their cars. The foolishness needs to stop. It would help if the media got behind the real solution to traffic.\ LARRY WOODGEARD, Lawrenceville\ If MARTA goes under, we all will suffer\ $52 billion will be spent by the Atlanta Regional Commission during the next 25 years. And, yet, they themselves have said that their plan will in no way reduce traffic congestion. It's been proved that MARTA, the public transportation agency that carries 98 percent of all transit riders in the metro area, keeps hundreds of thousands of cars off Atlanta's roads every day.\ As it is now, MARTA would need approximately $54 million to achieve the most minimal surplus. That's one-thousandth of the money destined to be spent upon a plan that will do absolutely nothing to help Atlanta out of its quagmire of congestion and pollution.\ If nothing is done soon, MARTA will virtually cease operations before 2008, and everybody who rides MARTA now would be forced onto Atlanta's highways. How can you say, then, that the ARC is not spending enough already on the same roads that put Atlanta into the mess it's in today?\ MATTHEW WAMBOLDT, Snellville\ Credit: FOR THE JOURNAL-CONSTITUTION"

Political experience: Transportation activist, DeKalb County Civic Coalition; member, Federation of Georgia Homeowners Personal: Wife, Ana Christina Top priority: To protect the integrity of our communities and promote respect for individuals. Established neighborhoods are under seige from fiscally irresponsible development patterns that undermine the value of our homes and the safety of our streets. We face worsening congestion. Changes to the Georgia Constitution, the Georgia Department of Transportation and the Atlanta Regional Commission that increase accountability to the citizens are needed. To be able to pick the best transportation solution, the gas tax should not be artifically limited to only asphalt solutions. I support the Clean Elections effort and making our diversity an asset.

Bart Ladd (R) (I) Age: 40 Residence: Atlanta Education: Bachelor's and master's degrees, Purdue University Profession: Pilot Political experience: State representative, 1991-present Personal: Single Top priority: To help the Republican team transition into the majority role in state government. This would require the experience I've gained over the last eight years, especially in the areas of taxation. The focal issue is to remove the ad valorem tax from automobiles. The General Assembly changed the method of this tax a couple of years ago and frankly messed it up. I opposed those changes, tried to fix it after it passed and realized that we need to just get rid of it. The local jurisdiction can get lost revenue from the state coffers, which are bulging.

SENATE DISTRICT 56 Ellen Milholland (D) Age: 43 Residence: Roswell Education: Bachelor's, master's and law degrees Profession: Homemaker Political experience: None Personal: Husband, James; two children Top priority: I will concentrate my efforts on tackling the pressures of exploding growth in District 56 by: 1) reallocating funds to rapidly growing school systems; 2) reducing class size to ensure that our students will be able to compete in a sophisticated job market; 3) balancing environmental restrictions, job creation and residential development to improve air and water quality and 4) changing Georgia's Constitution to allow gasoline tax proceeds to be used for sidewalks, bike paths, intermodal transportation and drivers education.
\
Thomas E. Price (R) (I) Age: 43 Residence: Roswell Education: Bachelor's and M.D. degrees, University of Michigan Profession: Physician Political experience: State senator, 1996-present Personal: Wife, Elizabeth; one child Top priority: To foster a more challenging and successful public education system with greater accountability and competition and allowing teachers disciplinary authority so that disruptive students will not be able to rob others of their opportunity to learn; to require more fiscal responsiblity in government and to allow hard-working Georgians to keep more of what they earn, including returning to our citizens any tax surplus; and to increase the safety for all Georgia families and children by ensuring ""truth-in-sentencing"" for violent criminals.

My 25 years as a pastor have provided a breadth and depth of experience in dealing with the needs of families: jobs, child care, single parenting, financial counseling, marriage and educational concerns. I have also met with families addressing safety and crime concerns. I have served in the Meadowcreek Cluster of schools as PTA President, LSAC member and helper. My top priority will continue to be a voice for families.

The religious right's domination of the Republican Party has driven many fiscal conservatives like myself from the party's ranks. It is bitterly ironic that the party which once stood for less government and greater personal freedoms has been taken over by people, such as state Rep. Tom Rice, who want to pass laws allowing government to poke its nose in our private lives, controlling what we check out in our public libraries and what consenting adults do in private.
\
Tom Rice (R) (I) Age: 57 Residence: Norcross Education: Bachelor's degree, Temple University Profession: Developing multimedia training as a partner in The Quality Group Political experience: One term as state representative Personal: Wife, Ann; three children Top priority: As a member of the House Education Committee, I will focus on enhancements to school choice, public school funding and quality and reading initiatives that will enhance the opportunity of Georgia's students to enter an increasingly competitive market place. I believe the Charter School Bill, initiated by Republicans and passed on a bipartisan basis, is the first step in offering alternatives in education that will have the effect of raising academic achievement in all schools. This issue is my passion and a prime purpose for running for re-election.

HOUSE DISTRICT 82 Mike Coan (R) (I) Age: 29 Residence: Lawrenceville Education: Bachelor's degree, University of West Georgia Political experience : State representative since 1996 Personal: Wife, Hope Top priority: To continue the fight to give the citizens of Georgia real tax relief. We gave the people a small tax cut of $168 per family of four, but I know we can do better than that. We must get our spending under control and our priorities in order. We must stop the election year vote-buying by representatives using our tax dollars. In the last budget, there were over 600 pork barrel projects costing taxpayers more than $15.7 million. I will continue to fight for lower taxes and less government.

Plunkett (D) Age: N/A Residence: Lawrenceville Education: Bachelor's degree, Georgia State University Profession: Casualty insurance broker Political experience: Ran for state representative in 1992 Personal: Divorced; two children Top priority: 1) To bring some balance to our ultra conservative Gwinnett delegation. They need a woman's perspective. 2) Consumer rights in managed care. Debate the pros and cons of the whole issue. I have a college degree, I work in the insurance industry, and I still can't seem to match facility coverage with the facilities' doctor! 3) Rethink school sports programs. Schools are much bigger and fewer students as a percentage of the whole can participate.

In my work as a professional financial planner, I have helped many families and small businesses protect their hard-earned assets and plan for a better future. I know first-hand the kinds of problems individuals and families face --- making ends meet and getting the best value for dollar. Also, I know planning and level-headed decision-making combined with hard work is the best formula for success.

COUNTYWIDE REFERENDUM
\
All Gwinnett County voters except for city of Buford residents may vote in a referendum on granting qualified elderly and disabled homeowners a school tax exemption.
\
The amendment would make eligible all disabled homeowners, and those 65 and older, who earn less than $25,000, excluding Social Security payments.
\
Current guidelines disqualify some elderly and disabled homeowners whose income stems primarily from investments or rental property, not Social Security or pension funds.
\
The amendment would not cause anyone to lose the exemption.
\
But the additional people claiming the exemption would cost the Gwinnett County school system an estimated loss of at least $1 million.
\
School officials, however, are supporting the measure, saying it is an issue of fairness for seniors.

TWO WEEKS ago, an 1866 building at Trustees Garden crumbled as it was being moved. Two men working on the building were injured; one lost his arm. The mishap also seriously damaged a retaining wall, causing the temporary closure of General McIntosh Boulevard, the main connector between President Street and East Bay Street.
\
Since then, traffic has been forced to detour around the site. The barrier has added to the congested roadways and frustrated drivers that are standard ingredients in Savannah's transportation gumbo.
\
Indeed, this new traffic headache underlines the need for a solution to the challenge of getting from one side of town to the other.
\
It's not a new problem. However, as long as the community procrastinates and avoids making a decision, conditions will only get worse, as the General McIntosh Boulevard closure has shown.
\
The need for an improved east-west corridor is no mystery. Studies have been conducted over the years, with little to show for the money and time.
\
In 1997, the Metropolitan Planning Commission decided to have one more study conducted with the expectation that this time the final report wouldn't be filed on a shelf somewhere and forgotten. It agreed to pay $250,000 to HNTB, a Raleigh, N.C., consulting firm, to look at the problem and come up with one or more solutions.
\
By the time the money ran out in 1999, the firm had looked at dozens of alternatives. It winnowed the list down to eight that had potential: a second bridge crossing the Savannah River to Hutchinson Island; tunnels beneath either Bay, Liberty, Gwinnett or Broughton streets; one-way traffic on Broughton and Bay streets in opposite directions; the widening of Henry and Anderson streets; or a DeRenne Avenue expressway, wider and with a second traffic level.
\
All these options have definite problems, from high construction costs (an estimated $330 million for the second bridge) to serious negative impact on neighborhoods and the environment. Imagine how a double-decked expressway might destroy the residential areas along DeRenne Avenue, or how wider, heavily trafficked lanes along Henry and Anderson streets could hurt the neighborhoods there.
\
In late June, the Chatham County Commission agreed to use $67,100 in special purpose local option sales tax revenues to complete the long-delayed study by HNTB. A final report for public scrutiny is expected in the next few months, probably just after the first of the year.
\
A solution needs to be found, and soon. Transportation experts predict that by 2020 traffic on Bay Street will increase by 45 percent and will nearly double on DeRenne Avenue. It may take that long to get a solution identified and built, once you add time to secure funding, complete the design and environmental impact studies, and finish with construction.
\
The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, a federal program signed into law in 1998, changed the way gas tax revenues are returned to the states. It makes this a good time for funding highway projects, says Mark Wilkes, director of transportation services for the Metropolitan Planning Commission.
\
It also helps that the Georgia Department of Transportation is headed by a former Savannah alderman, county commissioner and legislator. DOT Commissioner Tom Coleman may not be able to make Chatham County the DOT's priority, but at least he will listen to proposals and give them a fair consideration.
\
In the meantime, there are some steps the city can take to make Bay Street and DeRenne Avenue safer, starting with the enforcement of speed limits and other traffic laws.
\
Speeding trucks and cars make Bay Street, the prime east-west corridor, a dangerous place, particularly for pedestrians. The street already has the highest concentration of commercial truck traffic in the city. In addition, the number of drivers running red lights at DeRenne Avenue and Abercorn Street seems to increase every day.
\
The east-west traffic problem isn't going away. It's time for the city, county and state to take the situation seriously and act. When the final report from HNTB comes in, it can't just be filed away under ""projects to consider later.""
\
The final recommendations may be controversial. And they may not be the final answer. However, they should jump start a community-wide push to get this overdue project moving.

Metro Final
\
Gubernatorial candidate Roy Barnes and Guy Middleton, candidate for lieutenant governor, got the highest rankings Friday from a consortium of Georgia's largest black and minority groups.
\
Barnes, a Mableton lawmaker, agreed with the Georgia Coalition for a People's Agenda almost 44 percent of the time on issues ranging from crime and health care to taxes and the environment. Middleton, a Dahlonega lawmaker, agreed nearly 82 percent of the time on issues deemed key to minorities.
\
Only four out of 21 candidates for governor and lieutenant governor --- all Democrats --- responded to the coalition's efforts to evaluate the candidates on 55 issues developed in a series of 10 public hearings across the state. Eight of 10 candidates for governor did not respond, nor did nine of 11 candidates for lieutenant governor. No Republican responses were received, said the Rev. Joseph Lowery, a veteran civil rights activist and one of the conveners of the coalition.
\
""Maybe it means Republicans have written the black vote off,"" Lowery said. ""I would think any candidate who is serious about getting black votes ought to be concerned enough to respond to questions from the major black groups in the state.""
\
""Are they sure they sent us the questionnaire?"" said Bill Crane, spokesman for Republican gubernatorial candidate Mike Bowers. ""We've filled out tons of surveys, even when we knew they wouldn't like our answers.""
\
Gubernatorial candidate Lewis Massey and state Sen. Floyd Griffin, a candidate for lieutenant governor, were the only other candidates for the top two state posts to respond. Massey agreed with the coalition 31 percent of the time, while Griffin, an African-American lawmaker, answered yes to 67 percent of the CPA's queries.
\
Lowery said the effort is designed to educate voters. ""What we are trying to do is get people issue-oriented,"" he said.
\
Composed of leaders from groups such as the NAACP, the Concerned Black Clergy, the Georgia Missionary Baptist Convention, the Rainbow Coalition, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the Georgia Coalition of Black Women and 100 Black Men, the coalition's stated goals include abolishing the death penalty, creating a publicly financed insurance program to cover Georgia's 1.4 million uninsured and increasing the gasoline tax by 2 cents per gallon to fund public transit and increasing government contracting and appointments for minorities.
\
Most of the candidates made it clear they don't support those most extreme proposals, but they back sentencing reform, after-school programs and efforts to increase minority contracting.
\
Middleton said he doesn't support the gas tax increase, publicly funded insurance program or an end to the death penalty. ""I'm sure some of the things I put down are not in total accord with the group's thinking. But I'm glad I scored as high as I did,"" he said.
\
The respondents generally supported plans to increase after-school programs, create sentencing guidelines to remove racial disparity in Georgia prisons and study minority business and employment and establish programs to give minorities more state contracts.
\
""Our feeling was it's certainly appropriate to ask these questions,"" Massey spokesman Chris Riggall said of the coalition's positions. ""Lewis presented his views and responses and let the chips fall where they may.""

COLUMBIA, S.C. - South Carolina's tourism department hopes to woo visitors with the promise of cheaper gas.
\
""As a matter of fact, we actually mention that in some of our public relations stuff now, that we have some of the least expensive gas,"" Duane Parrish, director of the S.C. Department of Parks, Recreation and Tourism, said during a three-day state tourism conference that ended Jan. 30.
\
The agency is also trying to encourage in-state residents to travel within South Carolina.
\
""Eighty percent of the people here have to buy gas. Why not?"" Parrish said.
\
The top states whose residents travel to South Carolina destinations include South Carolina at 31 percent, North Carolina 19 percent, Georgia 13 percent, Virginia 5 percent, and Florida 4 percent, according to the state agency.
\
The secret to South Carolina's cheap gas lies in its gas tax of 16 cents a gallon. The tax is among the lowest in the nation and hasn't been raised since 1987. Highway funding to fix and maintain roadways in the state comes largely from revenue generated by the gas tax.
\
On the flip side, South Carolina drivers pay an average of $265 each year fixing their vehicles because of ailing road conditions, according to one estimate.
\
On Friday, regular fuel averaged $3.25 per gallon in South Carolina, $3.39 in Georgia, $3.52 in Florida and $3.43 in North Carolina, according to AAA. Only eight states, concentrated in the West, had lower gas prices than South Carolina.

INDUSTRIAL REAL ESTATE MARKET CONTINUES SLOW IMPROVEMENT
\
Vacancy rates for industrial real estate in Savannah dropped below 12 percent at 2012's end, down from 21 percent in mid-2010, according to market reports prepared by local commercial real estate firms Colliers International and Gilbert & Ezelle.
\
Space remains plentiful. More than 4 million square feet is available, and another 800,000 square feet is set to come on the market in April. Yet 2012 activity reflected major investment interest as Georgia Ports Authority traffic grows and the Savannah Harbor deepening progresses.
\
Five 100,000-plus square-foot buildings sold in 2012, and several national developers now hold industrial land in the area. At least two of those properties are ""pad-ready,"" meaning the infrastructure is in place.
\
""As far as leasing and absorption of space goes, we still have a healthy amount of space to work through,"" said David Sink, who helped prepare a report published by Colliers International's Savannah office. ""That said, the market is very much poised to handle additional growth if demand warrants.""
\
Investor activity hints Savannah has finally shed the ""oversaturated"" label. A building boom tied to the Georgia Ports' rapid growth a decade ago, combined with the recession, saw the vacancy rate go from 7.5 percent at the end of 2007 to 21 percent in less than three years.
\
The oversupply drove down both lease and sales prices. The absorption rate turned positive in 2012, though, after two years of declines. That activity stabilized prices: rental rates flattened out, dropping just 3.1 percent for the year, while sales prices stabilized in the $30-per-square-foot range.
\
""With the absorption swing, Savannah is popping up on developers' radar screens again,"" said Rex Benton with NAI Savannah, a commercial real estate firm. ""Those same investors had been hesitant a few years ago because of our saturation issues. Their interest is encouraging for the market.""
\
The industrial market in 2012 also bucked two significant trends that marked the early days of the recovery. Much of the activity in 2011 involved build-to-suit projects, particularly those with railroad links. Three rail-served custom warehouses were constructed in 2010 and 2011.
\
Cold storage was a big niche in 2012. Two companies purchased properties to build refrigerated facilities last year to take advantage of poultry export business through the port.
\
Interest is currently ""more traditional,"" according to Colliers' Sink, with the focus on trucking and intermodal facilities.

GULFSTREAM G280 SETS CITY-PAIR SPEED RECORDS
\
Gulfstream Aerospace Corp.'s new super mid-cabin G280 aircraft recently set 15 new city-pair speed records, including one from Honolulu to Savannah, as part of the company's reliability demonstration program.
\
The 250-hour internal testing program, among the most extensive voluntary reliability programs ever implemented by Gulfstream, served to enhance fleet reliability, enrich pilot training and improve customer readiness, according to Mark Burns, Gulfstream's president for product support.
\
""The Gulfstream reliability demonstration program incorporates pilot check rides, maintenance on auxiliary power units, engine run qualifications, technical operations, publications validations and basic servicing and handling at typical fixed-base operators,"" Burns said.
\
""This is just one more way we are going above and beyond for our customers, ensuring they have the most reliable and high-performing aircraft.""
\
Of the 15 new city-pair speed records set as part of the program, the most notable were a flight from Aspen, Colo., to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and one from Honolulu to Savannah. The super mid-sized aircraft has established 22 speed records since setting its first in May.
\
""Two of these new speed records are particularly significant because they demonstrate the G280's capability to reach the East Coast from Aspen and to travel an exceptional distance,"" said Scott Neal, senior vice president of sales and marketing.

BETHESDA ACADEMY MUSEUM, VISITOR CENTER DEDICATED
\
Bethesda Academy, an award-winning school for boys in grades six through 12, hosted an invitational ribbon-cutting event at the new William H. Ford, Sr. Museum and Visitor Center Feb. 1.
\
The state-of-the-art facility is expected to officially open in early March.
\
Bethesda Academy president David Tribble and Rollin Ford, executive vice president and chief administrative officer of Wal-Mart stores and son of William H. Ford, Sr., spoke in memory of the Rev. William H. Ford, whose legacy the museum was built to honor.
\
Ford was the only Bethesda alum who also served as superintendent. As major supporters of the new museum, the Ford family wanted to honor their father for 19 years of service at Bethesda.
\
""There are a lot of memories that rushed back as we entered the gates of Bethesda today,"" said Rollin Ford. ""Bethesda Academy represents 273 years of history of developing young men who have literally reached out and touched the world. My father saw all of us as part of the overall fabric that, if woven together, could make a difference in this world, one child at a time. Changing lives in a positive direction for young men was his mission. He loved the community and the fellowship at Bethesda. It truly was his home and his family.""
\
The museum includes 2,200 square feet of exhibition space and features interactive exhibits, photographs, video, oral histories and artifacts.

PARTNERS TO EXPORT LNG FROM ELBA
\
For more than a decade, imports of liquefied natural gas have come into the LNG terminal at Elba Island in the Savannah River to be transformed back into gas and transported along a pipeline to the Southeast U.S.
\
Now, with vast new reserves of domestic shale gas - the result of a hydraulic fracturing process known as fracking - filling the country's domestic needs, the opportunity to export natural gas has companies looking to reverse the process.
\
On Jan. 28, Shell US Gas & Power LLC and Southern Liquefaction Co. LLC, a Kinder Morgan company and unit of El Paso Pipeline Partners, announced plans to develop a natural gas liquefaction plant at Southern LNG's Elba Island Terminal.
\
Construction is expected to start in the next few years, with the first exports flowing out by the end of the decade.
\
Subject to various corporate and regulatory approvals, Shell and Kinder Morgan affiliates have agreed to modify the Elba Express Pipeline and Elba Island LNG Terminal to physically transport natural gas to the terminal, liquefy it and load it onto ships for export.
\
In June, Southern LNG received approval from the Department of Energy to export up to half a billion cubic feet per day, roughly equivalent to 4 million tons of LNG per year, from the Elba Island terminal to Free-Trade-Agreement countries. It's one of 17 facilities that have received such approval.

GPA POSTS RECORD NUMBERS FOR DECEMBER
\
The Georgia Ports Authority ended calendar year 2012 with a strong December, marking an 11.7 percent increase in total tonnage across all terminals and a 21.8 percent increase in auto and machinery units compared to December 2011.
\
The total volume of 2.27 million tons puts December among the top 10 months on record and the highest performing December ever, GPA executive director Curtis Foltz told his board Jan. 28.
\
""This figure, boosted in part by outstanding growth in sectors such as bulk and roll-on/roll-off cargo, is the result of GPA's exceptional cargo diversity and overall performance,"" Foltz said.
\
The total tonnage figure was up more than 238,000 tons, or 11.7 percent, compared to December 2011.
\
Container tonnage was 1.76 million in December, a jump of 4.2 percent. TEU throughput for the month hit 219,128 units, an improvement of 2.2 percent, or 4,656 units, over the previous year.
\
A TEU is the equivalent of one 20-foot container.
\
Colonel's Island in Brunswick and Savannah's Ocean Terminal moved a combined 54,884 auto and machinery units, an increase of 18.2 percent, making December the fifth busiest month on record for rolling cargo.
\
""Our December figures show an important uptick in total tonnage across all facilities, as well as impressive auto volumes,"" said board chairman Robert Jepson.
\
A review of the first half of fiscal 2013 - July through December - has total tonnage across all terminals up 4.1 percent at 13.3 million tons, while rolling cargo reached nearly 321,000 units for a year-over-year growth of 21.8 percent.
\
At 1.3 million tons, breakbulk was up nearly 11 percent, while bulk tonnage increased by 62 percent to reach 1.2 million tons.
\
However, the total number of TEUs was down 1.1 percent for the fiscal year-to-date, at 1.45 million. This drop was due primarily to the ongoing diversion of Asian imports to the West Coast as the threat of an East Coast strike by the International Longshoremen's Association continues, Foltz said.
\
""Savannah has lost approximately 6,000 containers per month since October, and we project this to continue until a new labor contract is ratified,"" he said.

COFFEE ROASTERS TO OPEN CAFE DOWNTOWN
\
Savannah Coffee Roasters' promised to return to the local cafe scene is nearing fulfillment.
\
Company CEO Lori Collins is purchasing the former Huskey Auto Parts store and warehouse on Liberty Street. Renovations on the 8,500-square-foot space will begin in coming weeks.
\
Collins has targeted a spring opening for a cafe, retail store and coffee roasting facility.
\
""This is what I wanted all along,"" said Collins, who purchased the business from its founder, Hayden Banks, in December 2011. ""People love our coffee once they taste it. We need to be able to brew on site.""
\
Collins has been operating Savannah Coffee Roasters as a wholesale business, operating out of a small roasting plant off Islands Expressway. Yet many of her customers remember the company's two retail locations - one on Congress Street downtown and the other in Oglethorpe Mall - that Banks closed a decade ago.
\
Collins announced her intentions to reopen a storefront last summer. She eyed several locations, including one on East Bay Street, before settling on the Liberty Street building, which has been vacant since 2006. The site, located across Liberty from the Savannah Civic Center parking lot, is highly visible and includes parking for 14 cars.
\
She envisions attracting business from neighborhood residents, tourists and Savannah College of Art and Design students. The store is within sight of SCAD's Oglethorpe House residence hall.
\
Transforming the former auto parts warehouse will require a ""significant investment,"" even as Collins plans few renovations beyond replacing the roof, installing central air conditioning and performing cosmetic improvements. She likes the space's warehouse-like feel, complete with concrete floors, and the skylights that provide natural lighting in a part of the building that will house a dining area.
\
Collins is a chef and will bake breads and pastries and also offer a light lunch.
\
Savannah Coffee Roasters won't be the only business in the building. Collins plans to lease 3,500 square feet to a ""compatible business"" and has been in contact with potential tenants.
\
The two businesses and a new apartment complex planned for a neighboring parcel will revitalize what local commercial real estate agent Jim Bryant deemed a ""blighted"" pocket of the historic district.
\
""That building has been sitting empty for too long,"" said Bryant, who's with Sperry Van Ness, the listing agent for the property. ""We've had many things planned for there and haven't been able to get them done. This will be good for that neighborhood.""

SAVANNAH ADDS 5,000 JOBS
\
Savannah-area employers added 5,000 jobs in 2012, and the growth shows no signs of slowing.
\
The total number of jobs in Chatham, Bryan and Effingham counties hit a four-year high in December even as the unemployment rate rose because of a 1,400-person increase in the labor force, according to Georgia Department of Labor statistics.
\
And with economists projecting gains in three of Savannah's biggest industries - tourism, manufacturing and professional and business services - and a 20 percent rise in building permits expected to boost construction employment, 2013 looks ""promising.""
\
""Last year was an all right year, and it gave us some momentum to carry us through 2013,"" said Armstrong Atlantic State University economist Michael Toma.
\
Toma projects employment growth between 1.5 percent and 2 percent, up from 0.8 percent in 2012 and 0.3 percent in 2011.
\
Tourism, manufacturing and construction are the likely gains leader.

""They have world-class experience and fresh ideas to help our association attract an even wider audience in 2013 and beyond.""
\
During his time with ESPN, Downs also worked as director of the network's Great Outdoor Games and won the 2004 Sports Travel Award for Best Professional Multi-Sport/Multi-Discipline Event, in recognition of his leadership at the ESPN Great Outdoor Games in Madison, Wis.
\
He formerly served as director of sports and competitions for the ESPN X Games and ESPN Winter X Games, where he developed and executed events for dozens of summer and winter action sport. Over the years, he also worked as the logistics director for U.S. Olympic Festivals in Los Angeles, San Antonio and St. Louis and as the operations coordinator for the U.S. Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs, Colo.
\
""Jim brings a wealth of world-class experience to Savannah,"" said Joseph Marinelli, president of Visit Savannah. ""I'm confident that he will be a real asset to our tourism leadership team and that he will serve as a valuable resource as the future of Savannah's riverfront experience continues to evolve.""
\
In Bligh's role with the Royals, she served as the security and stadium events coordinator in 2012 when Kansas City hosted the 83rd annual major league baseball all-star game. She also has been the director of service and development at the Arizona Biltmore Resort and Spa in Phoenix and director of account experience for the Phoenix Suns professional basketball team.
\
""We're excited to work with Jim and Carrie to help make River Street a must-see destination for travelers from across the United States and around the world,"" said Michael T. Owens, president and CEO of the Tourism Leadership Council.
\
""They have the experience, the ideas and the expertise to maximize River Street's potential.""

\
""Savannah Tire has been growing for 62 years and is still growing,"" said Frank Baylor, the company's corporate sales manager and the fill-in for his ill superiors at the luncheon. ""I'm proud to work for them.""
\

\
Savannah Tire employs 150.
\
""Over the family's three generations in business they have served multiple generations of Savannahians,"" Baylor said.

AEROSPACE, INCLUDING GULFSTREAM, CARRIES GENERAL DYNAMICS
\
Massive charges resulting from shrinking government defense spending hammered General Dynamics in the fourth quarter, as the weapons systems and aerospace giant reported a huge fourth-quarter loss of more than $2 billion.
\
Shares of General Dynamics (NYSE: GD) fell more than 4 percent in midday trading Jan. 23, rallying later to close up 1 percent as three of the company's four business units - combat, marine and information systems - reported revenue losses for the quarter.
\
Only aerospace, which includes Jet Aviation's maintenance and completions business and Gulfstream business jets, reported revenues in the black.
\
Phebe Novakovic, who took over as chairman and CEO of General Dynamics on Jan. 1, said the charges ""reflect the fact that some of our markets are contracting as government budgets shrink at home and abroad.""
\
""They also suggest opportunities for improvement in some areas of our performance, which we are addressing,"" she said.
\
The Falls Church, Va.-based company said it lost $2.13 billion, or $6.07 per share during the October-December quarter, compared with net income of $603 million, or $1.68 per share, a year earlier.
\
Revenue fell almost 12 percent to $8.08 billion from $9.15 billion.
\
Excluding the charges, the company earned $491 million, or $1.39 per share, falling far short of Wall Street expectations of $1.90 per share on revenues of $8.8 billion.
\
The charges were a necessary step given the recent arrival of a new CEO, Sterne Agee analysts Peter Arment and Josh Sullivan wrote Wednesday in a note to investors. They have rated the stock as ""Buy,"" meaning they expect it to outperform the industry during the next year, and they set an $82 price target for the next 12 months.
\
The fourth-quarter results ""reflect the difficult environment presented by defense budget dynamics partially offset by tremendous opportunity in the aerospace segment,"" the analysts wrote, adding that the stock will be under near-term pressure, but there's potential gain once it settles in the mid-$60s, because of a stable backlog of Gulfstream jet orders.
\
""Aerospace showed notable growth in 2012, with both sales and earnings increasing by double digits,"" Novakovic said in a conference call Wednesday with analysts.
\
""At Gulfstream, revenue was up $800 million, while earnings were up $110 million.
\
""In all, aerospace had a good year and delivered on its promises.""

LOCAL RESTAURATEURS SEIZE OPPORTUNITY, FIND SUCCESS
\
Brian and Jennifer Huskey spent the drive between Hilton Head Island and their home in the Smoky Mountains of Tennessee discussing the ""how"" and not the ""if"" of opening a restaurant in Savannah.
\
The couple wanted to buy the East Bay Street bakery Brian's childhood friend had turned them onto during their just completed Hilton Head Island vacation in 2006. The Huskeys found b.Matthews ""a bit dusty"" but otherwise appealing.
\
Their financing options were less promising. They had one nickel but not two ""to rub together."" Yet sensing a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, they became restaurateurs anyway, borrowing money from Jennifer's mother and opening up five unsecured lines of credit to buy the business three months after first seeing it.
\
Today, the Huskeys are the proprietors of five eateries and bars. They own not only the b.Matthews business but also the building in which it's housed as well as another property that will soon be the new home of Blowin' Smoke BBQ.
\
Huskey shared how he and his wife's burgeoning restaurant empire, known as the Gaslight Group, began so humbly only to explode despite the biggest recession since the 1930s during January's Business in Savannah Forum in the Savannah Morning News auditorium, 1375 Chatham Parkway.
\
The quarterly luncheon was sponsored by Hancock Askew, the HunterMaclean law firm, Abshire Public Relations and Marketing and Business in Savannah.

"
119," Growth-and-development legislation on the move in the General Assembly:\ TRANSPORTATION The Senate delayed action on House Bill 1295, which would shift 1 cent of a 4-cents-per-dollar retail gas tax --- as much as $70 million a year --- from the state general fund to the state transportation fund. The bill is effectively dead in the Senate. But the wording has been added to Senate Bill 425, which is still alive in the House. The money from the bill would be used to pay for road repaving and other projects. The bill also would exempt money for interstates from the state's transportation funding formula. A proposal for a new state transportation bank to finance road and transit projects passed the Senate. HB 1136 would create a bank to lend money to local governments for transportation projects, offering lower interest rates and flexible repayment terms. Eventually, the bank would be financially self-supporting, with interest earned invested in new loans. Advocates say the bank would accelerate everything from road widenings to new transit programs across the state and could enable Georgia to grab millions more in federal transportation funds for metro Atlanta's crowded roads. Wording changes between the House and Senate will force it into a conference committee when the Legislature reconvenes Wednesday.\ ENVIRONMENT Sen. Casey Cagle (R-Gainesville) has tabled a bill that would have limited the transfer of water across counties and river basins after tough questioning from some of his Republican colleagues. Sixteen counties in metro Atlanta would have been exempted from HB 1615's restrictions, thereby allowing water to be transferred from the Etowah River basin to make up for water scarcity in the Chattahoochee River basin. The bill, which also would have allowed power and mining companies and landfill operators to start operations even if opponents appealed their state permits, is most likely dead. The House already passed a version of the bill. A stream buffer bill is stuck in the House Rules Committee, which determines which bills are voted on. SB 460, authored by Cagle, would relax restrictions on the state's 25-foot stream buffer. Local governments could continue to enforce their own buffer regulations. Buffers are undisturbed areas where trees, grass and other vegetation protect the streams, serving as natural filters for polluted runoff from parking lots and streets. The bill also would make it easier for developers to pipe and pave over the state's smallest streams. It already passed the Senate 35-21. A constitutional amendment to ensure fees collected by landfill operators and tire dealers goes into cleaning up environmental messes, as intended, has not gotten out of the Senate Rules Committee. The General Assembly regularly has dipped into the hazardous waste and solid waste trust funds to balance the budget, particularly during the last two years. House Resolution 1425 already passed the House 160-2. HB 1095 would allow spearfishing in the Savannah River and would make it easier for hunters to use dogs to chase deer. The bill is opposed by House Game, Fish & Parks Chairman Bob Lane (D-Statesboro) because it removes many of the restrictions he helped put in place last year to keep dogs from chasing deer off of private property. The bill would decrease the acreage required to run dogs on a hunter's own property from 1,000 acres to 200. The Senate already passed the bill. The House has yet to take up the latest version. HB 1185 would require Department of Natural Resources conservation rangers to have ""probable cause"" before stopping a boat on a lake and boarding it to check for life preservers and perform a breath analysis on the operator. It was approved 162-2 in the House, and is in the Senate Rules Committee.\ Credit: STAFF"
120," President Bush may be the nation's Decider-in-Chief, but in dealing with the current energy crisis he has been more like Mr. BadWrench --- all thumbs. Meanwhile, Congress, which is just as complicit in getting us into this mess, has proved equally inept.\ With gasoline prices breaching the $3-a-gallon mark for the second time since Hurricanes Katrina and Rita struck last year, what the nation really needs is a brutally honest mechanic with a firm grasp of the problems and a clear vision of how best to solve them. Blaming money-grubbing oil companies at home and shifty petroleum cartels abroad may make us feel good, but only for the moment. Heck, it might even help some politicians get re-elected this fall.\ But finger-pointing and shameless pandering will do nothing to put us on the road to recovery from what the president has correctly diagnosed as our collective addiction to oil.\ Curing that destructive dependence will involve hard choices and probably mean higher gasoline costs in the near term. But facing those challenges in a timely fashion will pay long-term dividends by reducing our reliance on fossil fuels, which threatens our economy, our environment and national security. Despite the hardships that higher gasoline prices impose, especially on low-income and working- class households, they should provide the right stimulus to curb our seemingly bottomless appetite for fossil fuels while encouraging greater conservation.\ That's why it would be a mistake to be fooled by the quick fixes touted by disreputable shade-tree mechanics on Capitol Hill. Senate Republicans suggested (but later withdrew) a proposal to give every American taxpayer a $100 gasoline rebate. That would have paid for about two fill-ups of the family sedan and some slushies for the kids, but then what? A windfall tax on oil company profits or granting approval for oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, as others have suggested, would also have little long-term impact on prices.\ What we need are leaders who aren't beholden to big oil companies and who can also muster the political fortitude required to level with the public about the tough, but worthwhile, sacrifices we must be prepared to make in the years ahead. Listed below are a few lightly used options lying around in the nation's energy policy toolbox. The only question now is, who's capable and courageous enough to use them?\ > Raising CAFE standards: Adopted by Congress after the 1970s Arab oil embargo, corporate average fuel economy requires automakers to meet federal mile-per-gallon standards for their fleets of passenger cars and trucks. But the 27.5 miles-per-gallon standard for cars hasn't been raised since 1985. Increasing CAFE standards to 36 mpg is technically feasible without compromising safety. It could save a million gallons of oil a day while also eliminating 240 million tons of heat-trapping carbon dioxide emissions from the atmosphere every year. President Bush is now asking Congress for permission to do so, but what took him so long?\ > Lower the speed limit: Like CAFE standards, the 55 mph speed limit was an outgrowth of the '70s fuel crisis, and should also be reprised. In 1983, the lower speed limit was credited with helping to save 2.5 billion gallons of gasoline, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group. That's about the same amount produced in a year by a midsized oil refinery.\ > Rescind oil company tax breaks: The Energy Policy Act of 2005 lavished about $2 billion in various subsidies to encourage oil and gas exploration in coastal waters and on federal lands. Given the record high profits and increased demand for their products, those breaks clearly aren't justified --- if they ever were.\ > Increase investment in mass transit: Public transportation saves an estimated 855 million gallons of gasoline every year. The American Public Transportation Association, a trade organization, estimates that the nation could reduce its fuel consumption by 40 percent if it used public transportation for at least 10 percent of its travel needs. Despite the increasing popularity of buses and trains for commuting, they're not easily accessible to about 25 percent of Americans. A larger portion of the national gas tax should be allocated for public transportation.\ > Expand tax incentives for hybrid vehicles: Purchasers of vehicles that can run on both gasoline and electric batteries qualify for a one-time tax break that was recently increased from $2,000 to $3,400. But the tax break is reduced by 25 percent increments for every quarter after any given manufacturer sells 60,000 or more of them until 2010.\ Confusing? Absolutely. A more straightforward incentive program would send clearer market signals to consumers while encouraging carmakers to ramp up production of vehicles that will speed the nation's transition from inefficient gas-guzzlers.\ > Raise the national gas tax: This may seem counterintuitive, even a bit masochistic, at a time when gas prices are reaching record highs. But the 18.4 cents national gas tax hasn't increased since 1993 and, as a result, transportation infrastructure improvements and mass transit systems that are funded with the tax have gone begging. An incremental increase, perhaps 10 cents a year, could be used to finance much-needed research and expedite the development of alternative and renewable fuels. Besides, the quickest way to promote conservation is to increase the price of gasoline. Low-income households could receive an ""energy credit"" to help ease the burden.\ --- Lyle V.

CONGRESS GOP trying to punish unions In Georgia and Washington, Republicans are trying to bar unions from participating in the political process by passing ""paycheck protection"" bills. The purpose of this legislation (at least five bills were introduced by state Republicans this session) is to keep unions from spending money during elections. Republicans seldom support the enhancement of workers' programs and thus are not often endorsed by labor. In 1996 the GOP lost seats in Congress, and ""paycheck protection"" is its punishment to labor.
\
Corporations outspent unions 11-to-1 in 1996. (In '94 it was 10-to-1; in '92, 9-to-1. Do you see a trend?) These bills would not tie the hands of corporations, the National Rifle Association, the American Medical Association or anyone but labor organizations. Besides, most of the money used by unions does not come from dues but from voluntary contributions. R.S. ""BO"" MARLOW Marlow is chairman of the Georgia State United Auto Workers political action committee, and vice president of Local 882 in Hapeville. He lives in Fairburn. 'Fierce dispute' exaggerated The article ""A bipartisan minute"" (March 15) reported that House Speaker Newt Gingrich and I once ""had to be separated during a dinner because of a fierce dispute."" This suggests Gingrich and I were nearly engaged in a physical altercation. This is not the case. Although he and I have strong and contrasting views, we have never had to be separated. I have devoted my life to promoting nonviolence. U.S. Rep. JOHN LEWIS Washington Reinvigorated in Conyers The March 15 Perspective photo essay on the Monastery of the Holy Spirit in Conyers was wonderful. This place has been a little piece of heaven for me since I moved to Georgia 15 years ago. The sense of peace I receive when I visit is beyond words. My first inclination, having seen the coverage, was one of dismay to think that the secret is exposed. However, I realize that many people can benefit from this place and the wonderful people who live there. PATTY BRANDON Conyers Evolutionists proven obsolete Regarding the article ""Minds that matter"" (Perspective, March 15): When you talk only with evolutionists, you're certain to conclude that evolutionism has gone from triumph to triumph in recent years. The opposite is true. Evolutionary theory has suffered significant setbacks in recent decades. The most recent blow has come by way of the field of molecular biology, documented in Dr. Michael Behe's 1996 book ""Darwin's Black Box: The Biochemical Challenge to Evolution."" Behe introduces the concept of irreducible complexity through biochemical mechanisms that would fail to operate if just one piece of the puzzle is absent. Darwin has achieved the same fate as Sigmund Freud and Karl Marx --- they are obsolete. MARK C. NOVAK Alpharetta PRESIDENT CLINTON Presidential cowering enough to sway his most loyal supporters Cynthia Tucker's column ""President's most loyal aides deserve better than blame"" (Perspective, March 15), concerning Betty Currie, was long overdue. Even the most partisan of Democrats must have been disturbed by the leader of the free world hiding behind the skirts of this genuine and honest lady. No one should be shocked, however, by the lack of spine demonstrated in this most recent of President Clintons' attempts to wriggle out of responsibility. Even Patricia Ireland, the president of the National Organization for Women, has responsed to his scandalous action. As each new brick falls on the increasing pile of evidence, the momentum will force every American to confront what many of us have known all along. Cynthia, welcome to the ""vast right-wing conspiracy.""

Willey wishes to publish a book covering her ordeal with President Clinton. How long could such a book be? No one cares about her life other than her experience with Clinton. Perhaps the book could cover the stages of her experience: her breakfast the morning of, shower (potential for a good movie scene). Then the drive to the White House (suspense builds), and parking the car. Then the meeting (was something left out on ""60 Minutes""?) and the aftermath. Could there be a sequel? Bless whoever buys her book. ALLEN ANDERA Atlanta Chelsea deserves more It is fine and dandy that President Clinton denies allegations of sexual misconduct and that Hillary still stands by her man, but, as a parent, I cannot help but think about Chelsea --- the embarrassment she feels every day. For her sake, why can't Clinton come clean? Is anything more important than showing your true character to your child? I think not. The country would forgive his past deeds and move on. He has done well as our president. RAYMOND H. SUH Dunwoody Stealing is a big deal Some comments by teenagers in the front-page article "" 'Scamming' is popular teen rebellion"" (March 8) made me mad. Stealing isn't ""minor."" It makes prices at the store go up to compensate for the loss. I work to buy things I want, and when prices go up because some punk stole from the store, it makes me mad. What makes them think they are better than me? Are they too good to work for their money? MICHELLE PLANCK Michelle, of Fayetteville, is a junior at Fayette County High School. ATLANTA'S AIR Atlanta's transportation plan needs work Regarding the editorial ""Choked to a standstill"" (March 15): Coming from Washington two years ago, I was surprised a growing metropolis like Atlanta had such a poor public transit system. Given a choice, most people would leave the driving to someone else as long as they get to their destination on time.

gasoline in the United States. Atlanta also has one of the worst projected air- and water-quality dilemmas. The solution seems almost too simple, even for contentious partisan legislators: A small, say, 5 cents-per-gallon temporary surcharge on gasoline in metro Atlanta would not only raise more than enough money to address Atlanta's water and sewage problems, but also discourage marginal automobile trips that congest and pollute our city. TIMOTHY O'KEEFE Atlanta Solutions are simple I moved to Norcross for a job and a better quality of life three years ago. I have since developed asthma, I have witnessed thousands of acres of old growth stripped clear (just on my drive to work), and I often sit in traffic for 45 minutes for an 8 1/2-mile drive. I'm not the only one questioning whether this is the environment in which I want to raise my children. Everyone I've talked with about the subject would use MARTA. We would walk to the mall or corner store if there were sidewalks. More children could ride their bikes to soccer practice if there were bike lanes. What prevents elected officials from implementing these simple solutions? TAMYRA HYATT Norcross

123,"Many conservative voters are quick to adopt a ""no-new-taxes"" mindset. While this is a legitimate argument in our current federal environment, a smarter exercise is to decide ""what is"" and ""what is not"" a legitimate constitutional function of government, and how do we pay for it?\On July 31, a regional transportation sales tax referendum will give Georgia voters a historic opportunity. Residents, region by region, will vote on a local tax, for local transportation projects, with 100 percent local control. It likely will pass in some regions and not others. It is a classically conservative approach to funding a legitimate, core function of government.\This referendum is a bottom-up, local solution to our transportation budget crisis. Locals decided the project lists with public input, the voters decide at the ballot box, and then local residents benefit from their own investments.\Transportation investments have long been an essential responsibility of state and federal governments. Our Founding Fathers understood the importance of transportation to our security and economic well-being.\Beginning with Presidents George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, through Dwight Eisenhower's interstate highway system, our leaders have long realized that transportation drives economic activity and saves lives. The last time the federal gas tax was increased strictly for transportation was under Ronald Reagan in 1982. He characterized it as ""not a tax increase,"" but a ""user fee"" adjustment.\Despite the fact that Georgia is the third-fastest growing state in the nation, it is 49th in per-capita spending on transportation.\State gas tax revenue, our primary source of transportation funding, continues to decline. We face a transportation funding crisis.\Addressing this crisis will enhance our economic competitiveness, make roads safer and bring jobs.\According to the Federal Highway Administration, every $1 billion invested in highway construction supports 27,823 jobs and generates up to $2.5 billion in economic activity. This accounts for 9,537 construction jobs, 4,324 jobs in industries that directly or indirectly supply materials and services for construction projects, and 13,962 jobs supported when those employed spend their incomes.\Of the revenue raised in each region, 75 percent will go toward the lists of regional projects and 25 percent will go back to cities and counties for local transportation projects. Every penny raised locally will be spent on local projects with local oversight.\Solving this crisis with a consumption-based, fair-tax mechanism, voted on by the people, limited in time and with accountability and oversight is not only the right direction, it's a conservative solution.\Jared Thomas is former Georgia director for Americans for Prosperity\CAPTION: mARGARET SCOTT / NEWSART\Credit: For the AJC"
124," Speaking of the environment . . .\ Consumer and environmental advocate Ralph Nader said Sunday he will meet with Democratic candidate John Kerry next month to discuss the effort to prevent President Bush from getting re-elected. While stressing that he is still a competitor in the race, the independent presidential hopeful said he views his candidacy as a ""second front against Bush, however small.""\ Nader described the Republican incumbent as ""a giant corporation residing in the White House camouflaging as a human being."" In response to Nader's comments, Bush campaign spokesman Reed Dickens said only that the president welcomes the debate.\ Nader was in town for a lecture hosted by the Georgia Environmental Organization, a group that does not endorse candidates. About 100 people listened as Nader encouraged activists to put up a united front against polluters.\ She's back . . .\ President Bush's confidante Karen Hughes returned to the public stage Sunday with plans to weave her combative defense of the White House into a six-week book tour, then go on the campaign payroll in mid-August.\ Hughes, 47, attracted news coverage in July 2002 when she gave up her West Wing office and title of ""counselor to the president"" and moved back to Texas so her son could go to high school there. The memoir, to be published Tuesday, is called ""Ten Minutes from Normal,"" referring to an announcement from the conductor on Bush's campaign train about a town in Illinois.\ You're so money, John . . .\ John Kerry, running far behind President Bush in the campaign finance department, will turn to some star power this week when he launches a multistate fund-raising tour in California.\ Celebrities such as Ben Affleck and Leonardo DiCaprio will be on hand to promote Kerry as he seeks to reach into some of the Democratic Party's deepest pockets.\ First up: a luncheon today in Sacramento hosted by state Treasurer Phil Angelides, who has raised more than $50,000 for Kerry; then a San Francisco reception organized by the area's top high-tech moguls.\ On Tuesday, Kerry lunches with donors in San Diego before hitting a gala at the Los Angeles home of billionaire supermarket mogul Ron Burkle, with Affleck, DiCaprio and Barbra Streisand. Singer James Taylor will perform.\ Ad war continues . . .\ The Bush campaign's TV ad barrage against John Kerry continued late last week, as it launched a new spot accusing Kerry of being a proponent of taxing Social Security benefits and raising gasoline taxes.\ Expected to be aired in key battleground states (as we've noted before, Georgia's not among them), it is the fourth Bush ad to attack Kerry by name since the Bush campaign began running TV spots three weeks ago.\ ""John Kerry's economic record --- troubling,"" the ad's narrator says, citing Kerry's past support for a 50-cent gas tax and taxes on Social Security benefits.\ Kerry's camp issued a flurry of rebuttals, saying the senator discarded the gas-tax proposal years ago and that a tax enacted in 1993 on wealthy Social Security beneficiaries was part of a Democratic budget policy grounded in fiscal responsibility.\ --- Staff writer Brenden Sager and and wire services\ Credit: STAFF AND NEWS SERVICES"
125,"Georgia needs to look at its 2009 State Rail Plan and begin deploying commuter rail in metro Atlanta immediately.\Less than three inches of snow should never shut down a major American city and leave thousands of motorists stranded on frozen roads over night; but that happened in Atlanta Jan. 28-29.\When people, not used to driving in snow, tried to be responsible and get home before too much accumulation occurred, bad road management combined with the lack of any transportation alternative to create gridlock.\But the trains kept running.\Georgia boasts one of the most extensive freight rail systems in the country. According to the Georgia Department of Transportation, 5,000 miles of track serve most counties in the state, yet passenger rail service is almost unheard of.\That could change, and it could change relatively quickly. GDOT's 2009 Rail Plan estimates that if Georgians were offered quality passenger rail service, they would take advantage of it in huge numbers.\The report estimates that a commuter and intercity passenger system stretching to Athens, Canton, Macon and other cities would carry ""10.7 million commuters and 2.1 million intercity passengers in 2030.""\If GDOT's commuter rail plan, using currently operational tracks, was fully realized, the region would be transformed for the better. Residents would breathe cleaner air, drivers would see less congestion and shorter commute times, and people would no longer face being stranded in frigid temperatures because of snow.\Prior National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) analyses have already concluded with a ""Finding of No Significant Impact"" for both an Atlanta-to-Athens route and an Atlanta-to-Macon route, clearing one hurdle and ensuring that the project would not degrade the environment.\Indeed, commuter rail would improve the environment by getting cars off the roads and helping the cars that stay on the roads burn less gas because of the reduced congestion.\The biggest challenge to commuter rail in metro Atlanta comes from the state's apparent disinterest in the project. The 2009 Rail Plan begins by explaining that a more comprehensive plan was due out in 2011, but despite that assertion, a new plan has not emerged. The 2009 Plan is still the plan promoted on GDOT's Rail page as the ""State Rail Plan.""\Also, the 2009 plan explains that the Georgia Constitution restricts revenue from the state gas tax to use on roads and bridges and calls for the creation of a new fund to finance freight projects.\The state needs to face up to the necessity of funding passenger rail service.\Building healthier, more logical, and more sustainable cities makes all the sense in the world, but metro Atlanta needs immediate relief. Getting people in and out of the city is the region's biggest problem on a daily basis. Commuter rail service, built on existing tracks with relatively modest improvements, can fix that.\CAPTION: William Tomlin is an attorney at King & Spalding in Atlanta.\Credit: For the AJC"
126,"According to the Sierra Club, the regional transportation referendum is ""anti- urban."" The project list, the Sierra Club proclaims, ""is too heavily focused on sprawl-inducing road expansion.""\Their prescription? A ""parking tax"" that penalizes metro Atlantans for driving. And a ""multimodal gas tax"" that will never see the light of day under the Gold Dome.\We need practical, not pie-in-the-sky, approaches if we're ever to untie the traffic knot strangling metro Atlanta. We need a mix of road and transit improvements that do the best job of getting people out of traffic and to jobs and school and ballet recitals. We need a transportation system that allows for the movement of goods and services throughout our region in a way that is cost-efficient for businesses and doesn't raise prices for the delivery of everything from pizza to pine straw. And we need more transportation options that reduce air pollution from engine idling, which makes the Sierra Club's opposition particularly strange.\What we don't need are extremes: those who advocate for all transit and no roads, and their odd bedfellows who advocate for all roads and no transit. To get our region unglued, we need a healthy investment in both. The regional transportation referendum strikes that balance.\We flat-out disagree with the Sierra Club that we should penalize drivers. We think the goal should be to relieve drivers --- and this plan does so with an $8.5 billion investment that not only relieves traffic congestion --- but creates and supports 200,000 new jobs, generates $19 billion in new income and addresses one of the main reasons companies don't move here and college grads don't want to stay here.\Of course, we can't fix our transportation woes for free. But as opposed to a punitive ""parking tax"" or a brand-new ""multimodal gas tax,"" a one-penny sales levy actually helps offset the fuel we waste and valuable time we lose stuck in traffic. That ""congestion tax"" costs the average metro commuter $924 a year. The one-penny sales levy can reduce the congestion tax over time --- and most consumers won't come close to spending $924 in additional sales tax (that would require annually buying $92,400 worth of stuff).\As for the Sierra Club's criticism that the project list is a ""hodge-podge of conflicting priorities,"" we're proud that it doesn't reflect the priorities of one group with one agenda. Instead, it reflects the voices of more than 200,000 people who participated in compiling the project list --- some of whom wanted more roads and others who wanted greater mobility through transit. The project list reflects the needs of the people of metro Atlanta.\We applaud the Sierra Club for the work they've done to protect Georgia's environment. But on this issue they're dead wrong: Some transit is better than no transit. By voting this down, they will get no transit.\Che Watkins is campaign manager for Citizens for Transportation Mobility.\Credit: For the AJC"
127," He is a dreamer, sure. But at least David Cheney of Reidsville has big dreams. On his way to join the Vidalia Onion Cyclists, who are biking this month along the old C & O Canal near Washington, Cheney stopped by my office to give me his spiel about turning old rail beds into bike trails. He'll do more lobbying than biking in D.C.\ Shoving his thick, curly hair back in sync with his excited rhetoric, the son of a south Georgia state court judge waved his arms back and forth across a map of Georgia as if conducting the final movement of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.\ ""From Brasstown Bald to Sapelo Sound,"" he said, extolling his dream of one historic rail-to-trail corridor from the Appalachians to the Georgia coast, ""We could rival the Tour de France.""\ Well, maybe not the Tour de France, but Georgia could do a lot better than it has with bike trails. The problem has always been money. A poll last year by the Georgia Conservancy showed that 78 percent of Georgians believe some gas-tax revenues, limited now to road and bridge funding, should go for passenger rail, sidewalks and bike paths. It also showed 54 percent would be willing to pay a 2 cent higher gas tax for such alternatives.\ Rails to Trails is not a new idea. National and state groups have been thrashing around for years about converting old railroad beds to trails for years. A few small stretches of such conversions exist around Georgia ---in Rome, Moultrie, Savannah and in southeast Cobb County, thanks to group known as GRITS (Georgian Rails into Trails Society). It's a cost-efficient idea to use the old rights-of-way. Many states have actually reaped a profit on such scenic trails.\ The reason Cheney and other biking advocates are so exercised about their cause right now is that Congress must reauthorize the federal highway transportation act this fall. And there's a hot debate over possible restructuring of ISTEA (Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act) money, which directs federal transportation grants to local governments and others for alternative forms of transportation. The Georgia Department of Transportation has joined other state transportation departments in lobbying Congress to let them control that money at the state level.\ But it's not just cyclists and environmentalists who don't like the state DOT's position. Representatives of the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce, MARTA, the Association County Commissioners of Georgia and the Georgia Municipal Association are meeting with U.S. Sen. Paul Coverdell's staff on the subject today.\ DOT has plans for bike trials along highways in some parts of the state, but only, say its critics, because the federal law demands them. Few have been built. Cheney's dream relates more to preserving the state's culture and environment for hikers and bikers than it does to providing alternatives to get to work.\ The state needs both.\ And the DOT had better watch out. This time around, advocates from opposite ends of the political spectrum are lining up to oppose its highway myopia. The message is that the DOT doesn't speak for all Georgians, not even the majority of them, any more.\ E-mail: mezzard@ajc.com.\ We want to hear from you, but are unable to acknowledge every message.\ Martha Ezzard is a member of The Journal's editorial board.

Every other federal government activity --- from national defense and homeland security to transportation and energy --- will have to be paid for with borrowed money.""\On its current course, the U.S. can expect a low---growth economy with higher interest rates, limited private sector expansion, tepid job creation, fewer resources for investment and emergencies, increased possibility of inflation and greater risk from foreign investors, who already hold more than half of U.S. national debt. And this scenario does not include a shock to the economy such as might result from further violence and instability in the Middle East.\This is not just a ""budget deficit"" problem but a crisis of U.S. economic security.\Americans are mostly unaware of the scope and consequences of this crisis. The current budget debate has focused mostly on the need to cut nonsecurity discretionary spending, which is only 12 percent of the president's proposed $3.7 trillion fiscal 2012 budget. What Congress eventually decides about funding for discretionary programs such as National Public Radio or Planned Parenthood is mostly irrelevant to the crisis at hand, although it makes good fodder for the media and the political bases of both parties. The real problem is elsewhere: mandatory spending on entitlement programs, a bloated defense budget, and a broken tax code.\A good start is legislation being drafted by Sens. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and Mark Warner, D-Va., and four of their colleagues (known as the ""Gang of Six""), which uses as a baseline the recommendations of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform. The commission's balanced, detailed and realistic proposals include discretionary spending cuts (including defense), comprehensive tax overhaul, health care cost containment, Social Security changes (including increasing the retirement age), mandatory savings and changes to the budget process.\This effort by the ""Gang of Six"" should not be taken lightly. Compromise carries political risk, especially heading into the 2012 election cycle. Democrats generally consider entitlement changes, and especially Social Security, as third rails. Republicans find it difficult to support tax increases or cuts in defense spending. Both need to give ground.\An encouraging letter last week from 32 Republican and 32 Democratic senators praised the commission and urged Obama ""to engage in a broader discussion about a comprehensive deficit reduction package,"" including ""discretionary spending cuts, entitlement changes and tax reform.""\In search of revenues, one place to start is a tax on gasoline. New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman is a champion of this idea, and its time is overdue. A gas tax may seem heresy given the spike in oil prices because of the volatility in the Middle East. But it would provide revenues for the budget, create incentives for alternative energy development and reduce carbon emissions, which is good for the environment.\Over time, it also should reduce U.S. dependency on Middle East oil, an Achilles' heel of U.S. energy security and foreign policy. The tax could be phased in slowly, even deferred in the first year or two.\Some argue that a gas tax, budget cuts and entitlement changes might stymie a fragile recovery. But there are no pain-free solutions or short-term fixes to the U.S. economic crisis. The failure to date of the $787 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act is case in point. Marketed as a ""stimulus"" to create jobs, unemployment since passage of the Recovery Act in February 2009 has risen from 8.2 percent to 8.9 percent exactly two years later, while contributing to an unprecedented projected $1.5 trillion deficit for 2011. The Recovery Act passed with no Republican support in the House and only three Republican votes in the Senate, an example of the perils of hard-edged partisan economic policy.\The budget process should provide the means to set U.S. economic policies on a sustained track of fiscal responsibility, growth and international competitiveness. The deficit must be addressed, but is symptom not cause of a larger crisis and broken process. The national commission and the Senate ""Gang of Six"" have given us a road map for action. Bipartisanship in pursuit of U.S. economic security can and should be both good principle and good practice.\Andrew Parasiliti is executive director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies-U.S.\Credit: For the AJC"
129," Sally Flocks started out as a reluctant pedestrian. In 1978, she was diagnosed with a brain tumor that was causing epileptic seizures so she no longer was able to drive a car.\ ""I was walking because I had to,"" Flocks says. ""I would complain to myself wishing I could drive.""\ For the next 17 years, Flocks experienced all the dangers and obstacles that pedestrians face trying to walk in Atlanta. Cars that wouldn't stop for pedestrians at crosswalks. Cars that would make turns without looking out for pedestrians. Cars swerving around MARTA buses without paying attention to someone who may be crossing the street.\ Then in 1995, Flocks went to her home near Palo Alto, Calif., to have brain surgery at Stanford University, her alma mater, to remove the tumor. The successful procedure meant she could start driving again.\ But Flocks could never forget the plight of pedestrians in Atlanta.\ On somewhat of a lark, she decided to form a grass-roots organization --- Pedestrians Educating Drivers on Safety, or PEDS for short, and she wrote a guest column for The Atlanta Journal- Constitution to push for more support for walking as a mode of transportation.\ That was 10 years ago.\ Today, Flocks is president of one of the most active advocacy organizations in metro Atlanta. And she has become a strong voice for walkers, a constituency that had been virtually ignored in transportation planning for decades.\ ""There's no question that PEDS in general and Sally specifically have raised the consciousness of pedestrians as a mode of transportation,"" says Tom Weyandt, director of comprehensive planning for the Atlanta Regional Commission, which includes transportation planning.\ Then Weyandt jokingly adds: ""She can be a pain in the neck, but that's fine. We need to have people who are committed to making Atlanta a more humane environment. She's very persistent. She probably understands more about the issues related to pedestrians than anyone, and she's absolutely unafraid to keep that message boldly in front of people.""\ It has been on-the-job training for Flocks, 54, who has a Ph.D. in history from Yale. She readily admits that she had no idea what she was launching 10 years ago.\ For starters, the organization is now just PEDS. ""I learned very quickly that so many of the problems were not just the drivers,"" Flocks says. ""There were so many other people who needed to be educated, such as developers and engineers.""\ She also realized that the issues were so much more complex than just being able to focus on pedestrians. Land-use, transit, schools, health, safety and well-maintained sidewalks all play a role in making communities pleasant places to experience on foot.\ And for Flocks, it has become a life-and-death issue. In 2003, 25 pedestrians lost their lives in the city of Atlanta --- reaffirming Atlanta's reputation as one of the worst cities for walking. In 2005, there were only 10 fatalities. ""Nintey-five percent of fatalities happen when people are crossing the street,"" Flocks says. ""I think our in-street crosswalk signs have had the greatest impact. A lot of drivers didn't know they were supposed to stop.""\ That's the good news. The bad news is that pedestrian fatalities in the suburbs are on the rise --- which has led PEDS to start focusing on communities outside the city limits.\ ""In Cobb and Gwinnett, it's shocking to see how rapidly fatalities are increasing in those communities,"" she says.\ Another priority is to install a median along Buford Highway, a treacherous corridor for pedestrians, particularly for immigrants who have few choices on how to get around.\ Flocks has had her own near-death experiences. She was doing a television shoot while crossing Peachtree Street at 13th Street. A car nearly ran her down, eerily close to the same spot where ""Gone With the Wind"" author Margaret Mitchell lost her life.\ ""I was right where she was hit,"" Flocks says. ""That was really frightening.""\ She then goes into solution mode. ""There could be a median refuge island at the crosswalk,"" she says. ""It's extremely cheap, about $20,000.""\ That's just a fraction of a fraction of the hundreds of millions that the Georgia Department of Transportation will pay to widen 14th Street. But because the state's gas tax is limited to roads and bridges, funding for sidewalks, bike paths, pedestrian enhancements and transit is negligible.\ And in the city of Atlanta, property owners must pay to maintain the sidewalks --- a program that Flocks says is not working. By comparison, the city of Charlotte pays for sidewalk maintenance --- a program Flocks would love for Atlanta to adopt.\ Still, Flocks is amazed at the ""tremendous impact"" PEDS has had in its 10-year history. ""You see a lot more people walking now than you did 10 years ago,"" she said.\ And Flocks is no longer a reluctant pedestrian.\ While she appreciates owning a car when she needs to buy groceries or when it's raining, her primary modes of transportation are walking, cycling and transit. She said she puts only about 3,000 miles a year on her car.\ ""It's so much more relaxing to walk somewhere,"" she said. ""You are so much more in tune with the environment, and you observe so much more.""\ msaporta@ajc.com\ CAPTION: KEITH HADLEY / Staff Sally Flocks arranges signs in her downtown Atlanta office.

130,"In the weeks leading up to the July 15 primary election, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution will pose questions to candidates for the U.S. Senate seat held by Republican Saxby Chambliss. Candidates are given 150 words to answer. The winner of the Democratic primary will face Chambliss and Libertarian Allen Buckley in November.\The Republican incumbent\Saxby Chambliss: Every day I hear from Georgians who are tired of high gas prices. Make no mistake: Congress and especially the Democrats in Congress are to blame.\In Congress, I have voted for four things we must do to bring prices down: explore and drill for oil in the United States; increase our refining capacity; research and develop alternative fuels; and promote conservation.\I have co-sponsored the American Energy Production Act that will increase domestic oil and gas production. I have co-sponsored S. 2890 that will temporarily suspend the federal gas tax. I will continue to work with like-minded Democrats and Republicans to enact a comprehensive energy policy that will bring prices down.\America is dependent on foreign countries for 62 percent of our oil, but Democrats in Congress are blocking efforts to increase domestic production. So the next time you fill your tank, thank a Democrat for the high gas prices.\U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss is a former representative and attorney from Moultrie.\The Democrats\Josh Lanier: Solving high fuel costs requires honesty, leadership and courage. We must be honest that oil is a commodity traded on open markets, that any real solution is long-term, that our future is linked to a mix of traditional and new alternative fuels and technologies, and that the reason we have failed to produce a national energy policy is the paralyzing influence of money and special interests.\We know that raising average mileage requirements will dramatically reduce demand for and imports of oil. We know that Georgia and America can lead the world in new fuel alternatives, new technologies and new jobs. And we know that our automobile industry can produce breakthrough high-mileage cars and trucks to meet a world demand.\We must be honest with the American people and lead with the courage to act in our national interest and not on behalf of special interests.\Josh Lanier is a retired businessman and former U.S. Senate staffer who lives in Statesboro.\Rand Knight: If we are to save our way of life, then we must transition to domestic sources of renewable energy for economic and national security reasons. Drilling for oil domestically is not an immediate solution --- it will take almost five years to get the new oil rigs to market and operational. For less money, and in less time, we can create more jobs and cheaper gasoline and diesel right here in Georgia. In less than 30 months we can build 30 medium-size gasoline and diesel facilities in Georgia that produce fuel from agricultural wastes at a cost of less than a dollar per gallon. Every acre of Georgia's unused agricultural land can produce 20,000 gallons of gasoline and diesel per year by growing algae for fuel in 2- to 4-foot-deep ponds. These solutions build jobs and revenue for Georgia and are good for the environment and our health.\Rand Knight is an Atlanta businessman.\Dale Cardwell: Congress can't be trusted on issues that pit oil interests against your interests. Why? Politicians are addicted to oil industry ""PAC"" money that controls their votes and America's energy policy. If we elect new leaders who refuse special interest ""PAC"" money, we can move forward on our most pressing challenges, including ending our dependence on foreign oil. I support the launch of a patriotic nationwide conservation effort to dramatically reduce demand. This will burst the speculation ""bubble"" that's driven prices above $100 per barrel and will cut pump prices by one-third. We must also eliminate subsidies to oil companies and commit those dollars toward research and expansion of ""green"" based domestic energy sources. Georgia Tech's Dr. Sam Shelton and I will work together to fast-track legislation to convert 20 percent of Georgia's gasoline use to cellulosic pine-based ethanol. This will lower gas prices and create jobs in Georgia's rural communities.\Dale Cardwell is a former investigative reporter for WSB-TV in Atlanta.\Vernon Jones: With our soldiers defending Iraqi oil fields, it is inconceivable and unacceptable that the American people are paying at least three times as much for fuel as the Iraqi citizens. Our first priority is to end subsidies for major oil companies. Although environmentally safe drilling is an option, I strongly disagree with Bush, McCain and Chambliss to end the 27-year moratorium on offshore drilling. We must require the automobile industry to produce cars that will average more miles per gallon. Alternative energy sources, such as wind, solar and biofuels are essential. This will drive down fuel costs, increase our independence and create thousands of green energy jobs.\The government should invest in providing incentives to the private market for research and development of alternative energy sources. As CEO of DeKalb County, I have a record of partnering with the community and Georgia Power to capture methane gas at one of our landfills, where we are now providing green usable energy. The final solution is, there must be a change in Washington.\Vernon Jones is CEO of DeKalb County and a former state legislator.\Jim Martin: Skyrocketing gas prices are a crisis for Georgia families, and the shortsighted policies of George Bush and Saxby Chambliss are putting our economic and national security at risk. We have to end their $17 billion in tax breaks to oil companies and invest that money in developing new alternative fuels. We have to close the loopholes that let oil speculators drive up prices --- as much as $1 a gallon according to some experts. We should require oil companies to put their record profits in new, clean refineries to increase supply. And lastly, we need to say no to the special interests and require utilities to get more of their energy from renewable sources. Ending our dependence on foreign oil and lowering gas prices won't come easy, but we have to start by doing what Bush and Chambliss won't do: stand up to big oil and demand relief for middle-class Georgians.\Jim Martin is a former state legislator and former head of the state Department of Human Resources.\The Libertarian\Allen Buckley: Accelerate hydrogen fueling or similar clean-burning fuel by not taxing purchases and providing a reward for development. According to the U.S. DOE, hydrogen burns cleanly, will cost 63 cents to $1.50 per gasoline gallon equivalent and could be produced for U.S. vehicles using natural gas with only a 3 percent/year increase in natural gas consumption.\The less a vehicle's CO2 emissions, the less road tax it should bear. A $7 billion reward should be offered to the first company or venture that produces, in each U.S. metropolitan area with 3 million or more people, 10 filling stations and 1,000 hydrogen or similar clean-burning cars that are safe and reasonably expected to cost less than $2 per gasoline gallons equivalent to fuel.\Ethanol is a waste that drives up food costs. Oil drilling should be permitted in areas now off-limits provided safeguards exist to effectively protect the environment.\Allen Buckley is an attorney/CPA who lives in Smyrna.\CAPTION: Chambliss\CAPTION: Cardwell\CAPTION: Jones\CAPTION: Knight\CAPTION: Lanier\CAPTION: Martin\CAPTION: Buckley\Credit: STAFF"

Final
\
Washington - The massive highway and mass transit bill that gained final congressional approval Friday will increase federal transportation spending in Georgia by nearly 70 percent, the second largest increase of any state.
\
The House and Senate endorsed the legislation decisively, the biggest highway and mass transit bill ever. It's a six-year, $203 billion package that promises to create tens of thousands of jobs and help restore the nation's crumbling infrastructure.
\
The House passed the bill 297-86 shortly after the Senate's 88-5 vote --- the last major piece of business before Congress leaves for the Memorial Day recess. Georgia Republicans Bob Barr, Saxby Chambliss, Mac Collins, John Linder and Charlie Norwood, and Democrat Cynthia McKinney voted for the bill. Republican Nathan Deal and Democrats John Lewis and Sanford Bishop voted no. Republicans Newt Gingrich and Jack Kingston did not vote. Georgia Sens. Paul Coverdell (R) and Max Cleland (D) both voted in favor. President Clinton, while saying the legislation should have taken a tougher stand against drunken driving, said the road-building funding would ''keep our country strong and vibrant.'' He said he would be ''pleased to sign it into law.''
\
The new law includes $719 million to encourage states to crack down drivers who drink, but Clinton was ''deeply disappointed'' the final version did not accept Senate language that would have penalized states not enforcing a stringent .08 percent blood-alcohol content level for drunken driving.
\
The bill, popular because it distributes money throughout the country in an election year, nonetheless drew criticism from some in Congress who complained that it busted the budget --- and siphoned money from child welfare programs and disabled veterans to pay for road-building.
\
Lewis said he opposed the bill, in spite of the funding for downtown's multimodal terminal, because he fears cuts in social programs will help pay for the new spending on roads and mass transit.
\
""In the end, it's going to cut into much-needed people programs,"" Lewis said.
\
Bishop opposed $15 billion in cuts in veterans' health benefits that were used to compensate for the additional transportation spending.
\
Collins said he had misgivings about the bill's extension of the subsidy for ethanol and the veterans' issue, but he decided to support it because it gives the metro area sufficient funding for a variety of mass transit programs. ""The growth is not going to stop, and we have to find a way around air pollution problems,"" Collins said. Deal said his reason for voting against the bill was because of the more than 1,800 special projects that lawmakers from all over the country inserted into it.
\
Sen. William Roth (R-Del.), one of the five senators voting against it, said, ''The American people will no doubt be surprised, as I was, to learn (the bill) makes massive and permanent reductions in an important program used by states to provide day care, adoption services, meals for elderly Americans, and protective services for children and adults.''
\
In all, about $1.8 billion was stripped from federal social services subsidies to states to help pay for the extra spending in the highway bill. Lawmakers also made up for some of the highway spending by cutting veterans' programs by $15.5 billion, part of it coming from accounts set up to treat former service members whose ailments stemmed from tobacco addiction begun while in the military. That savings estimate, however, assumes almost 71,000 veterans will seek the benefit every year, compared to the current rate of about 7,000 claims a year. Still, the veterans' lobbies nearly succeeded --- falling short by five votes in the House --- in forcing the bill back to a House-Senate conference to delete the $15.5 billion in offset funding.
\
But the legislation comes just in time for several states whose highway building programs had been jeopardized by congressional delay. At issue was how to treat the billions of dollars a year that flow into the federal highway trust fund.
\
The bill's chief House sponsor, Transportation Committee Chairman Bud Shuster (R-Pa.), and Senate Public Works Chairman John Chafee (R-R.I.), hailed it as breakthrough legislation to begin expanding and repairing the nation's heavily used transportation systems.
\
The final measure, hammered out by a House-Senate conference committee, increases highway funding by 40 percent over the previous six-year plan, rewrites the formulas for distributing money to help ensure that each state gets its fair share, and substantially boosts mass transit spending, to $36 billion over six years.
\
The legislation revamps the formula that fast-growing states in the South and West have argued for years cheats them out of their fair share of federal transportation dollars. Under the new formula for distributing federal gasoline tax revenues, Georgia will be guaranteed 90.5 cents in federal highway aid for every $1 in federal gas taxes its motorists pay. For the past six years, Georgia has been getting just back 76.8 cents on the dollar. Coverdell said the new highway bill ''represents an enormous victory for Georgia taxpayers. This proposal will help provide our state's citizens with a much better return on the money they send to Washington every year.''
\
''It's certainly going to be an enhancement for Georgia,'' said Lauren ''Bubba'' McDonald, president of Georgians for Better Transportation, which represents paving, engineering and related industries. ''But in reality its going to present some tremendous challenges.'' Although Georgia will be eligible for more federal money, McDonald said, it may need more state gasoline tax money to match it. McDonald, whose group supports raising the gas tax, says those state funds are already strained, because Georgia has one of the lowest gas tax rates in the nation, 7.5 cents a gallon. The state also collects a 3 percent sales tax on fuel purchases.
\
Georgia fared better in the final compromise worked out by House and Senate negotiators than it did in either bill passed earlier by the separate chambers. The original House bill would have provided Georgia $897.7 million a year in federal highway funding, while the Senate version would have provided $773.6 million.

There have been improvements in Atlanta's schools, but instead of minimal praise, or the usual apathy, the writer of the letter ""Schrenko flunks basic math"" has to be a naysayer. Where are his recommendations and efforts to improve schools?
\
While the writer is worried about students understanding the gap between C-minus and B-plus, he is obviously unaware that when improvement is shown, students (and Schrenko) need encouragement. They should not be thrown out for not getting an A after struggling hard to improve.
\
A positive impact Last Saturday's Local News section included the ""feel good""
\
articles ""He was her angel"" and ""Family who lost it all finds reason to celebrate,"" about the actions of Atlanta Police Officers Bill Cooper, Lynn Daniel and James Calhoun. This is exactly the type of reporting that should dominate what we read in the newspaper or see during TV newscasts. The impact of these types of stories is just as strong as the reporting of crime, drugs and hate ---but the results are much more beneficial to our community. Congratulations to the officers, whose actions have had an immeasurable, positive impact, and to the Journal-Constitution for running the articles.
\
Prisons are for punishment
\
Finally, in the person of Georgia Department of Correction's Commissioner Wayne Garner, we have someone who understands that prisons were built for the punishment of criminals, not their rehabilitation. Until now we have sent the message to criminals that they can commit a heinous crime and taxpayers will provide them shelter, food, medical care, an education, computers, TV, a library, clothing, a gym and much more ---free of charge. In addition, we have allowed them free attorney access in order to file their frivolous and ridiculous lawsuits. How many of us hard-working, law-abiding citizens are given any of these things?
\
When a person makes a conscious decision to violate the rights of someone else, his freedom and all rights he had as a free citizen at that point should be lost. Perhaps Garner will make some changes in the process that now allows criminals to file lawsuits. Criminals should be treated as just that ---with all rights removed until full time has been served for their crime. This in itself might be rehabilitation. Taxpayers do not owe criminals a free ride, nor do we owe them rehabilitation. As Garner is showing, prisons should be run in such a fashion that once there, no one would want to go back. Simply being incarcerated is not sufficient punishment for criminals.
\
Race shouldn't be a factor in appointment to board of pardons and paroles Your ""Short Takes"" editorial ""Wise appointment,"" concerning the appointment of Betty Ann Cook to the Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles, reveals the typical liberal bias so prevalent in your newspaper. You state ""As one of two African-Americans, she will broaden the perspectives of a parole board working with a prison system that is 67 percent black."" This is liberal code for going easy on black criminals. I consider this offensive to Cook, for it assumes that because she is black, she will be more lenient toward blacks in the system. In fact, her priority should be to treat all inmates equally. If we accept that race should not be a qualifying or disqualifying factor in decisions of the parole board, then the skin color of Cook should have no bearing on her pe This is a perfect example of how liberal good intentions, i.e., rooting out racism, tend to aggravate a problem rather than solve it. Racism in the prison system will not be eliminated by giving preferential treatment to black inmates. The fact that 67 percent of the prison population is black doesn't mean the system is racist; it could simply mean that blacks commit 67 percent of the crimes. To pretend otherwise in the name of ""(broadening) perspectives"" is to do a disservice to the people of Georgia by putting dangerous criminals back into our neighborhoods.
\
I wish Cook well in her new post. But I ask her to forget about social agendas and concentrate on one thing only: keeping criminals off the street and in jail, regardless of their skin color.
\
SUPPORTING OF HOV LANES
\
Faulty reasoning I question the views in the letter ""Open HOV lanes to all.""
\
Underlying both the gasoline tax and the idea of an HOV lane is the all- important idea of an economic incentive, which in this case is the reduced gasoline consumption attendant to either proposal. A gasoline tax is not an arbitrary expense intended only to reduce standards of living; as the gas tax rises, so too does the expenditure necessary to travel by car. This extra expense serves as an incentive for commuters to travel less. The individual driver thereby saves money, and the community as a whole benefits from reduced pollution.
\
The observation that HOV lanes are ""vacant while the other lanes are choked with slow-moving vehicles"" misconstrues the relationship between HOV lanes and slow-moving traffic. Such reasoning overlooks that the error lies with the drivers, not the highway developers: The empty HOV lanes are a clear and evident message that, should drivers decide to carpool and take advantage of those lanes, they will be able to get home much faster. Dismissing HOV lanes as useless because you refuse to use them is absurd.
\
Goodman, home in Atlanta for the holidays, is a senior economics major at Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania.
\
HOV lanes work
\
My cross-town commute to school every morning would take 45-50 minutes in the regular lanes; by carpooling, we make it in less than half an hour. Many of my friends now carpool to save themselves time. The congested lanes are filled with solo drivers. All it takes to use the HOV lanes is sharing a ride with one other person. Opening the HOV lanes to all traffic makes no sense. It would remove all incentives for carpooling, and we'd be stuck with more clogged-up lanes.
\

Doesn't anyone realize that people from all over the state come into Atlanta polluting our air and that we're wasting our money trying to clean up? Either abolish emission inspections entirely or make it a statewide requirement. Otherwise, what's the point?
\
Language of money
\
The Oakland, Calif., board of education has recently declared that its African-American students come from an environment that is linguistically different enough from mainstream America to warrant teaching them English as a second language. This has caused great uproar with educators seeing this as multiculturalism run amuck, and with African-Americans seeing it as an affront to them, sensing this as an effort to belittle their ability to master standard American English.
\
The unspoken agenda here, however, is money. Public schools in America receive additional funding to teach students English as a second language, so it is profitable to have as many students categorized as such as possible.
\
A great deal of money is at stake. While initial reports indicated that the money was not a motivating factor in arriving at this decision, I question whether the Oakland board would have reached the same conclusions about African-American English if additional funding had not been available.
\
Inexcusable waste
\
As a new purchaser of CD-ROM software, I've been surprised to find that the software comes in a large paper box with only a single disk enclosed. This is a huge waste of paper and is inexcusable in these environmentally conscious times. For the environment's sake, I hope the software manufacturers take the initiative to adopt the music industry's standards on reduced packaging, which has saved thousands of trees and acres of landfill space during the past decade.

The formula change increases Georgia's annual allotment of federal highway spending to $918.8 million, compared to $541.4 million a year that the state has been receiving since 1992. The 69.7 percent is second only to South Carolina, which will see its federal share of highway dollars jump by 79.3 percent. ''It's certainly going to be an enhancement for Georgia,'' said Lauren ''Bubba'' McDonald, president of Georgians for Better Transportation, which represents paving, engineering and related industries. ''But in reality it's going to present some tremendous challenges.'' Although Georgia will be eligible for more federal money, McDonald said, it may need more state gasoline tax money to match it. McDonald, whose group supports raising the gas tax, says those state funds are already strained, because Georgia has one of the lowest gas tax rates in the nation, 7.5 cents a gallon. The state also collects a 3 percent sales tax on fuel purchases. With air pollution problems forcing the Atlanta area to look for alternatives to automobiles, a host of rail studies received funding. In addition, two proposed rail lines --- between Atlanta and Athens, and between Atlanta and Griffin --- won designation that will make them eligible for federal transit money, an essential precursor to construction. The bill earmarks more than $200 million for about two dozen other special projects in Georgia that were designated by members of the state's congressional delegation. Several of the special projects, however, had repeat listings in the bill, and it was unclear Friday, with lawmakers and aides rushing to leave for the Memorial Day recess, exactly how much actually was authorized for each of them. The bill, for example, provides three separate allocations --- $17.25 million, $23 million and $9.5 million --- for construction of the Fall Line freeway from Bibb to Richmond counties, one of the top priorities of the Georgia Department of Transportation. Similarly, the measure provides a total of $11.25 million in three different allocations for a study of transportation alternatives in the northwest Georgia corridor between Atlanta and Chattanooga, a proposal that has received strong backing in recent months from city and local officials in both areas. It also was unclear Friday whether the legislation included a special exemption from clean-air laws for a 17th Street bridge across I-75/85 and interstate access necessary for redevelopment of the Atlantic Steel site near downtown Atlanta. Developers Jim Jacoby and Charles Brown had enlisted Linder's help in getting around air quality laws, but the bridge is in the heart of Lewis' district, and Lewis was opposed to it.
\
Georgia fared better in the final compromise worked out by House and Senate negotiators than it did in either bill passed earlier by the separate chambers. The original House bill would have provided Georgia $897.7 million a year in federal highway funding, while the Senate version would have provided $773.6 million.

"
134,"
There have been improvements in Atlanta's schools, but instead of minimal praise, or the usual apathy, the writer of the letter ""Schrenko flunks basic math"" has to be a naysayer. Where are his recommendations and efforts to improve schools?
\
While the writer is worried about students understanding the gap between C-minus and B-plus, he is obviously unaware that when improvement is shown, students (and Schrenko) need encouragement. They should not be thrown out for not getting an A after struggling hard to improve.
\
A positive impact
\
Last Saturday's Local News section included the ""feel good"" articles ""He was her angel"" and ""Family who lost it all finds reason to celebrate,"" about the actions of Atlanta Police Officers Bill Cooper, Lynn Daniel and James Calhoun. This is exactly the type of reporting that should dominate what we read in the newspaper or see during TV newscasts. The impact of these types of stories is just as strong as the reporting of crime, drugs and hate ---but the results are much more beneficial to our community. Congratulations to the officers, whose actions have had an immeasurable, positive impact, and to the Journal-Constitution for running the articles.
\
Prisons are for punishment
\
Finally, in the person of Georgia Department of Correction's Commissioner Wayne Garner, we have someone who understands that prisons were built for the punishment of criminals, not their rehabilitation. Until now we have sent the message to criminals that they can commit a heinous crime and taxpayers will provide them shelter, food, medical care, an education, computers, TV, a library, clothing, a gym and much more ---free of charge. In addition, we have allowed them free attorney access in order to file their frivolous and ridiculous lawsuits. How many of us hard-working, law-abiding citizens are given any of these things?
\
When a person makes a conscious decision to violate the rights of someone else, his freedom and all rights he had as a free citizen at that point should be lost. Perhaps Garner will make some changes in the process that now allows criminals to file lawsuits. Criminals should be treated as just that ---with all rights removed until full time has been served for their crime. This in itself might be rehabilitation. Taxpayers do not owe criminals a free ride, nor do we owe them rehabilitation. As Garner is showing, prisons should be run in such a fashion that once there, no one would want to go back. Simply being incarcerated is not sufficient punishment for criminals.
\
Race shouldn't be a factor in appointment to board of pardons and paroles
\
Your ""Short Takes"" editorial ""Wise appointment,"" concerning the appointment of Betty Ann Cook to the Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles, reveals the typical liberal bias so prevalent in your newspaper. You state ""As one of two African-Americans, she will broaden the perspectives of a parole board working with a prison system that is 67 percent black."" This is liberal code for going easy on black criminals. I consider this offensive to Cook, for it assumes that because she is black, she will be more lenient toward blacks in the system. In fact, her priority should be to treat all inmates equally. If we accept that race should not be a qualifying or disqualifying factor in decisions of the parole board, then the skin color of Cook should have no bearing on her pe
\
This is a perfect example of how liberal good intentions, i.e., rooting out racism, tend to aggravate a problem rather than solve it. Racism in the prison system will not be eliminated by giving preferential treatment to black inmates. The fact that 67 percent of the prison population is black doesn't mean the system is racist; it could simply mean that blacks commit 67 percent of the crimes. To pretend otherwise in the name of ""(broadening) perspectives"" is to do a disservice to the people of Georgia by putting dangerous criminals back into our neighborhoods.
\
I wish Cook well in her new post. But I ask her to forget about social agendas and concentrate on one thing only: keeping criminals off the street and in jail, regardless of their skin color.
\
SUPPORTING OF HOV LANES
\
Faulty reasoning
\
I question the views in the letter ""Open HOV lanes to all."" Underlying both the gasoline tax and the idea of an HOV lane is the all- important idea of an economic incentive, which in this case is the reduced gasoline consumption attendant to either proposal. A gasoline tax is not an arbitrary expense intended only to reduce standards of living; as the gas tax rises, so too does the expenditure necessary to travel by car. This extra expense serves as an incentive for commuters to travel less. The individual driver thereby saves money, and the community as a whole benefits from reduced pollution.
\
The observation that HOV lanes are ""vacant while the other lanes are choked with slow-moving vehicles"" misconstrues the relationship between HOV lanes and slow-moving traffic. Such reasoning overlooks that the error lies with the drivers, not the highway developers: The empty HOV lanes are a clear and evident message that, should drivers decide to carpool and take advantage of those lanes, they will be able to get home much faster. Dismissing HOV lanes as useless because you refuse to use them is absurd.
\
Goodman, home in Atlanta for the holidays, is a senior economics major at Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania.
\
HOV lanes work
\
My cross-town commute to school every morning would take 45-50 minutes in the regular lanes; by carpooling, we make it in less than half an hour. Many of my friends now carpool to save themselves time. The congested lanes are filled with solo drivers. All it takes to use the HOV lanes is sharing a ride with one other person.
\
Opening the HOV lanes to all traffic makes no sense. It would remove all incentives for carpooling, and we'd be stuck with more clogged-up lanes.
\

\
What's the point?
\
Doesn't anyone realize that people from all over the state come into Atlanta polluting our air and that we're wasting our money trying to clean up? Either abolish emission inspections entirely or make it a statewide requirement. Otherwise, what's the point?
\
Language of money
\
The Oakland, Calif., board of education has recently declared that its African-American students come from an environment that is linguistically different enough from mainstream America to warrant teaching them English as a second language. This has caused great uproar with educators seeing this as multiculturalism run amuck, and with African-Americans seeing it as an affront to them, sensing this as an effort to belittle their ability to master standard American English.
\
The unspoken agenda here, however, is money. Public schools in America receive additional funding to teach students English as a second language, so it is profitable to have as many students categorized as such as possible.
\
A great deal of money is at stake. While initial reports indicated that the money was not a motivating factor in arriving at this decision, I question whether the Oakland board would have reached the same conclusions about African-American English if additional funding had not been available.
\
Inexcusable waste
\
As a new purchaser of CD-ROM software, I've been surprised to find that the software comes in a large paper box with only a single disk enclosed. This is a huge waste of paper and is inexcusable in these environmentally conscious times. For the environment's sake, I hope the software manufacturers take the initiative to adopt the music industry's standards on reduced packaging, which has saved thousands of trees and acres of landfill space during the past decade.

An angel dispatched to the rescue
\
Thank you, angels, whoever you are! You found us late one Saturday night, with our battery dead in an unfamiliar neighborhood. I had hardly opened the hood when the first two angels arrived and gave us directions to nearby late-night service stations. I was still deciding which way to walk to when the third angel drove up and said, ""I'll bet your battery's down.""
\
Without asking how she knew, I gratefully accepted her offer of jumper cables. ""We had the same problem a week ago,"" she explained, and added, ""my husband told me to take these along tonight because someone might need help.""
\
As I began to connect her car to ours, a third car of angels drove up and offe red to help finish the job of starting our car. They said, ""Oh, yes, we know her from work, and she is just the sort of person who would stop to help someone in need.""
\
In a few minutes we were on our way again, too overwhelmed by this instant kindness to ask, ""Who are you, and where do you come from?"" There was only time to mumble, ""Thank you, angel,"" and to promise to pass on the gift of good will. If you have been on the receiving end of such ""random acts of kindness,"" please pass it on, too.

135,"The last half of the 20th century belonged to Atlanta. But this is a different century. Where is the luster of the '90s? Some of it appears to reside in Texas. As metro Atlanta suffered during the recession, Dallas pulled ahead and didn't look back.\DALLAS --- Big A, meet the even Bigger D. But keep a hand on your wallet.\By too many measures --- size, jobs, transportation, economic development, future prospects --- Atlanta has fallen behind Dallas.\The Sun Belt sisters, once neck and neck for New South supremacy, have diverged, with DFW racing ahead.\Consider size: Dallas/Fort Worth is bigger than metro Atlanta by a million-plus people. Water: North Central Texas is buying land and planning reservoirs to take care of Dallas' needs for decades; North Georgia hasn't built a reservoir in 50 years. Transportation: Dallas has built almost three times more regional rail lines than Atlanta, with more on the way, and taps toll road money to help pay for it. Atlanta, well, we're still thinking about maybe running light-rail lines into the burbs.\Perhaps the most telling measure: DFW created more jobs --- 73,000 --- between June 2009 and June 2011 than any U.S. metro area. Atlanta lost 42,200.\""The things they are doing in Dallas are breathtaking,"" Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed said. ""You can't go there and see what they're doing, and the speed with which they're doing it, and not be impressed.""\Tale of two cities\In many ways, Atlanta and Dallas mirror each other. They each rode the late-20th century population and investment waves that transformed regional business hubs into globally renowned cities. As skyscraper-filled, traffic-clogged, suburb-spreading megalopolises, Atlanta and Dallas epitomized the nation's push southward.\Dallas is a gateway to Latin America, astride I-35 --- or the ""NAFTA Superhighway"" --- that links Canada, the U.S. and Mexico. Atlanta has the world's busiest airport, with nonstop flights to Shanghai, Dubai and Moscow. Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport is big, but not that big.\Atlanta is Coke, Delta, UPS and nine other Fortune 500 companies. Dallas is AT&T, Exxon Mobil, American Airlines and 17 other corporate stalwarts. Atlanta boasts top-notch universities that churn out thousands of job-hungry graduates every year. Dallas-Fort Worth has Southern Methodist, and that's about it.\Neither city is dependent on one industry, instead welcoming a range of logistics, manufacturing, financial, high-tech, energy and services businesses. Lower-cost living and (mostly) good weather make them the envy of old-line Northern and Western competitors.\""More and more we compete with Dallas than any other city,"" said Hans Gant, a top business recruiter at the Metro Atlanta Chamber. ""They are a formidable competitor.""\Dallas and Atlanta compete for virtually every major corporation looking to come south. Atlanta has been no slouch the past few years, attracting Fortune 500 companies like NCR and First Data.\Dallas, though, in head-to-head competition, has taken the lead:\*In 2007, financial services giant Comerica moved from Detroit to downtown Dallas. Texas gave the company $3.5 million from its Texas Enterprise Fund, also known as a ""deal-closing fund,"" to seal the deal. Georgia does not have a similar fund. A year later, in a blockbuster relocation, AT&T chose downtown Dallas over Atlanta. The former Southwestern Bell was based in San Antonio.\*The Dallas Morning News reported that AT&T was attracted to Dallas in part by ""the concentration of telecommunications engineers and experts and the cluster of tech firms.""\*This year, the Golden Living health care conglomerate left Arkansas for Plano, a northern Dallas suburb. The state's deal-closing fund ponied up $2.1 million to snare that deal.\*And Nylo, the boutique hotel chain, announced in March it was moving its corporate headquarters from Atlanta to Dallas. Nylo CEO Michael Mueller said, ""The Dallas-Fort Worth region has a growing economy, a cost-effective environment with great transportation, and is central to the entire United States.""\What, no taxes?\Each city is victim of its own excess. Dallas commuters suffer the sixth-worst traffic in the nation, according to the Texas Transportation Institute. Atlanta is No. 8. The recession left thousands of platted yet unbuilt home lots across the cities' exurbs.\Dallas' core city and inner-ring suburbs, like Atlanta's, bear the brunt of the region's problems. Regionwide, the poverty rate was 14.5 percent (Dallas) and 13.4 percent (Atlanta) in 2009.\Dallas' poor, though, could be in a tougher bind, particularly in the inner city.\Texas legislators, facing a massive $27 billion state budget deficit, recently cut $4 billion from public education. One-thousand fewer Dallas teachers will return to school this month, most victims of budget cuts.\Texans don't pay income taxes; neither do corporations. It's a powerful draw for newcomers, but the twin tax breaks further deplete state and local treasuries.\""I moved here from New York and I love not paying state income taxes. But we sent our kids to private schools because I wanted them to get a good education,"" said Bernard Weinstein, an economist at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. ""And, even though our tax burden is low, we still give tax breaks to anybody who wants one. It's absurd.""\Dallas is exiting the economic doldrums more rapidly than Atlanta. The region's unemployment rate is 8.7 percent, nearly two points lower than Atlanta's. The U.S. Conference of Mayors reports that Dallas should return to prerecession levels of employment by year's end. Atlanta won't get there until the fourth quarter of 2014 --- at the earliest.\""Atlanta really went nuts over the last decade with housing and commercial construction,"" Weinstein said. ""We had our really bad times in the 1980s with bank closings and house foreclosures, so this time around bankers and builders were a lot more cautious.""\The Gwinnett of Texas\At 4:57 a.m. June 20, mass transit officially invaded Dallas' suburbs when the A Train left Hebron Station en route to Denton.\Denton could be Suwanee, thought Charles Emery, a developer and chairman of the county's transportation authority, a bedroom community at the edge of Dallas' inexorable northward push. Emery built industrial parks in Gwinnett, Cherokee and Henry counties in the '80s and '90s before moving to Dallas to do the same.\""Denton County had the same growth, traffic and air quality problems as Gwinnett County,"" Emery said. ""It was a frustrated commuting population. The vast majority of people were just sitting in traffic jams just like I-85 in Gwinnett.""\Emery and others realized a decade ago that the Dallas Area Rapid Transit system wouldn't reach the city of Denton until 2025 at the earliest. So they formed a local transit authority and set about designing a system and persuaded enough county residents to financially support it.\In 2003, the county held a referendum in eight cities requesting the transfer of a half-penny of the local sales tax to pay for commuter bus lines and light-rail transit --- not an increase, just a shift of the current tax. Only three of the eight cities approved the measure. But Lewisville, Highland Village and Denton --- well-populated cities with a heavy mix of college students and commuters --- provided enough votes (and revenue) to help build the 21-mile, six-station light-rail system.\""It's something we've needed for a long time, especially with the traffic on the highways and roads,"" said Mary Birdon, a retired elementary school teacher in Denton. ""We really do need to be connected to the Metroplex, especially to keep people commuting to Dallas. It's the way we have to go in the future.""\The A Train, which parallels the eastern leg of traffic-clogged I-35, cost $320 million. North Dallas car-lovers covered 75 percent of the cost.\Innovative finance\Washington, which has funneled billions of dollars of federal gas-tax money to help build and maintain the nation's highways, warned cities nearly two decades ago that the money would one day run dry.\Dallas took the admonition to heart. Facing the same traffic and air-quality problems as Atlanta, Dallas shopped around for innovative ways to pay for highway and rail enhancements.\The North Texas Tollway Authority sold the rights to build the Sam Rayburn Tollway, which runs through Dallas, Denton and Collin counties to a private company for $3.2 billion. Denton got $250 million of that amount for its rail line. Sales tax money and bonds paid the rest.\North Texas is building two other toll roads in similar fashion, with the profits used for highway reconstruction, bridge repair and other light-rail lines. It also partners with private builders to add express toll lanes to long-standing freeways. The road builders pocket the tolls, rail lines get built and commuters decide which mode of transportation suits their needs and wallets.\""People in Dallas and Atlanta can no longer assume that national and state interests will continue to fund growing needs for new roads, maintenance and rail. Those days are over,"" said Michael Morris, transportation director for the North Central Texas Council of Governments.\""Plus, national and state governments are horribly conservative. There's no way they're willing to address these revenue needs from a political standpoint. So our region decided to try every way possible to do it.""\Toll road profits, with some federal and state gas-tax money, fuel the ongoing, $10 billion reconstruction of six major highways and two bridges across the Dallas-Fort Worth region.\DART vs. MARTA\DART opened the 28-mile, 20-station Green Line last December. A 14-mile Orange Line, which will run from downtown Dallas to the main airport, is set to open in 2014.\MARTA hasn't added a line or a station since 2000. Struggling financially, the transit system has been slashing service and raising fares for three years.\Denton's Emery recalled how Gwinnett (twice) and other counties voted against joining MARTA\""I kept thinking of MARTA quite frankly. We ran into, 'This will bring bad elements into our community,' "" Emery said. ""We finally convinced employers, though, that there will come a time when they won't be able to get workers for the hospitals and businesses up and down Interstate-35 East. Overall, the message was, 'This will not create a bad element for us.' ""\Now that the A Train is running, Emery and others are contemplating another decadelong campaign to persuade voters to run rail along I-35 West.\Timothy Bray, director of the Institute for Urban Policy Research at the University of Texas at Dallas, is amazed at the willingness of anti-tax, anti-government Texans to pay for mega-dollar infrastructure projects.\""It may be just part of the Texas ethos,"" he said. ""You tell somebody that you want to spend a billion dollars on something and people will say, 'When will you get it done?' ""\Credit: STAFF"

Sacrificing energy use
\
Readers respond to call for Americans to reduce their fuel- guzzling ways.
\
Cutting oil use has myriad benefits
\
I want to thank Martha Ezzard for her column last Sunday on energy conservation. Long before Sept. 11, my husband had said something very similar, that with all the rhetoric about energy crises, the one thing no one was urging was that we simply cut back in our use of energy in general and foreign energy in particular.
\
Ezzard is right. Americans haven't a clue what sacrifice and austerity mean.
\
Does no one see the connections in the entire web of life, that a reduction in oil consumption likewise means a reduction in pollution, re-use of resources, and healthier bodies for those who walk or ride bikes in lieu of driving? Not to mention the development of a sense of community and the preservation of precious green land.
\
Don't give up, Ezzard. The gentle but steady influence you exert is needed now more than ever.
\

\
Drill for oil in Arctic; don't sign Kyoto pact
\
I see little sense in the conservation method Martha Ezzard suggests. I think people should always strive to reduce consumption by planning their errands and other short trips to minimize driving. And I hope the president makes no such request of us.
\
I see no reason why drilling for oil in the Arctic can't be done in a way to protect the environment. There are areas in the Gulf of Mexico where oil is buried so deep that special equipment must be developed to get it. Obtaining it could substantially reduce the price per barrel.
\
As for the Kyoto treaty, I hope the president doesn't sign it. Treaties such as this limit the actions we can take to protect ourselves. Every time we enter into a treaty we give up a part of our national sovereignty. The costs to us would be staggering, and there's no conclusive proof that the planet is in that bad a shape, unless you believe the media.

Bush's oil buddies prevent him from making right moves
\
If America had begun making energy sacrifices years ago --- also known as conservation and transportation alternatives --- would our reputation and relationship with so many of the Middle Eastern countries be just a tad different?
\
It will take the American people to initiate the changes in our current lifestyles.
\
Unfortunately, I do not think we can look to our president to take the lead in this important issue --- he has too many powerful friends in the oil business.

\
Find alternative ways to keep U.S. running
\
I agree that we need to cut our energy use. The one thing we cannot do is tell Americans who have no other way to get to work that they cannot drive one day a week. Why not phase in a gas tax increase of 25 cents or offer government rebates for devices or new vehicles that reduce gas use? Why not build the new fail-safe nuclear reactors? They have never killed anyone outside of the plants in the United States, use no oil and eliminate air pollution. In this national emergency, we should start drilling immediately everywhere we can and let the terrorists choke on their oil.
\
GARY WEBSTER, Atlanta

We can contribute by supporting MARTA
\
I agree with Martha Ezzard 100 percent. I have ridden MARTA every day for the past seven years. Let's reduce gasoline consumption. Let's help the environment. Let's show we respect members of all races. Let MARTA riders walk freely through our neighborhoods.
\
GREG STREIB, Atlanta
\
Americans sacrifice lives before gasoline
\
Martha Ezzard's column about sacrifice was exactly right. There have been many analyses about why the United States is so involved in the Middle East, but few have acknowledged our dependence on foreign oil.
\
There has been an outpouring of emotion in this new war but all too little rational thinking. One of the most reasonable and easiest reactions would be to conserve gasoline consumption so that we do not need to protect obscure sheikdoms anywhere in the world, thus becoming involved in their murderous way of life. Instead, the residents of metro Atlanta (and probably Los Angeles and others) seem more intent on driving about the city and suburbs in their large automobiles with flags flying.
\
I guess it is easier for us to send our young people off to die in a godforsaken country than it is to give up one ounce of gasoline or that all-important trip to the mall.

CYNTHIA McKINNEY: Representative kowtows to Communists, despots

\
McKinney appears to have never met a communistic or despotic regime that she doesn't like, and it is refreshing to know that Tucker has the intestinal fortitude to take her to task, black woman to black woman.

Behavior was definition of 'money-grubbing'
\
I read the Sunday letters about Rep. Cynthia McKinney with interest. The correct term for the core of her message would be money- grubbing. This is more than merely an example of bad taste and trashy behavior. Literally, the modern word ""grubbing"" means to dig for food. The origins of the term are, in middle English, ""grubben."" That word came from the Old English ""grafan,"" meaning to dig at a grave, which of course is exactly what McKinney is doing --- digging for money at the graves of all who died Sept. 11, 2001.

Georgia Power nuclear waste could yield catastrophe
\
Regarding the column on nuclear power plants (""Nuclear power plants vulnerable to terrorists,"" Oct. 21): Their dangerous nuclear waste also makes us vulnerable. Southern Co.'s Plant Hatch in South Georgia is overflowing with nuclear waste. The company has placed highly radioactive waste on an outdoor cement pad enclosed by a chain link fence near the banks of the Altamaha River. An attack on these computer-tested storage containers could result in a catastrophe that could decimate the region. Yet plans are in the works to extend the aging plant's life for 20 more years --- allowing it to make even more nuclear waste.

MLK MEMORIAL: Next, King family will seek royalties on street names
\
The King family members should be ashamed of themselves for trying to hold the Martin Luther King Jr. National Memorial hostage. The King family should be highly honored that a national monument is recognizing MLK Jr.'s accomplishments.
\
I certainly hope that American citizens do not have to pay a royalty for every street named after King. If so, I would vote to change every street named after MLK Jr. and replace them with the likes of Wal-Mart Way, Disney Drive or KMart Court. At least we could charge these companies a royalty for naming rights to our streets.

Terroristic tactics employed by Georgia's governor
\
Maybe we are going after the wrong terrorist. Gov. Roy Barnes is doing his own thing, cutting deals behind closed doors, using unheard- of power to get the items he wants regardless of whether they make sense or whether the people want or need it. He has even drawn a map so that those who do not think or vote like he does will not have a voice in the government.
\
The flag (yes, it should have been changed) being done behind closed doors, strong-arm tactics for his education reform --- I guess we will now be 55th in the standings --- to the redistricting maps to gambling to the latest transportation plan, Osama Roy Barnes will stop at nothing to get his way.

Experts aren't doing jobs in protecting the public
\
What did the experts know about the current anthrax threat? First, they knew from the Boca Raton case that anthrax was being sent through the mail; second, they knew that envelopes are not tightly sealed. Third, they knew that mail is sorted through high-speed machines causing any powder to be released. And yet they did nothing to protect the mail handlers in Washington after anthrax was detected there. They continued to tell us not to worry.
\
Yes, my analysis is aided by hindsight. But we pay these people to protect us and to connect the dots as they appear. Someone is not doing that job effectively.

UGA admissions
\
Readers debate whether the school should give weight to legacy or race in considering applicants
\
Race not a factor in debate over use of legacy
\
Cynthia Tucker is completely misguided in her campaign against legacy as a factor in college admissions (""Want fairness at UGA? Then boot legacy,"" @issue, Nov. 18). Not every critic of affirmative action is a proponent of merit strictly defined as performance on standardized tests. Critics of affirmative action ask only that admissions factors apply to everybody equally. Legacy fits this criterion; affirmative action does not.

While the consequences of past discrimination skew the demographics of affected applicants, legacy is not inherently discriminatory. It may be inherently unfair, due to the fact that people cannot choose their parents, but Tucker didn't cite this reason. She's injecting race where it doesn't belong. She obviously has nothing else to offer in her asinine support of affirmative action.

\
Bush an example of why legacy shouldn't matter
\
I agree with Cynthia Tucker regarding legacy programs. The lack of disdain at legacy programs unveils the conservatives for who they really are --- elitist racists. While they sneer at attempts to admit qualified minority students, they fail to peep at unfair standard practices that allow intellectually lazy, unqualified, spoiled, rich, white kids admittance without as much as an entrance exam.
\
Exhibit A --- President Bush, who benefited from his father's legacy at Yale University. It should be noted that a qualified minority student was probably denied admittance at Yale University in favor of the less gifted and intellectually mediocre son of a wealthy man.

\
Both practices provide an unfair advantage
\
Regarding Cynthia Tucker's column on legacy admissions at the University of Georgia: I would be interested in knowing the actual number of unqualified students admitted to UGA because of legacy. I would guess that it has had an equally small effect in the total picture. Is either practice fair? Of course not! They both give an advantage to a student because of race or birth into a family with money.
\
The practice of legacy obviously does not extend to all graduates' children. Our friends' son was denied admission to UGA almost six years ago. His SAT exceeded 1000 and his grade-point average was well above 3.0, and both parents were Georgia alums. It was very tough for him to watch a high school classmate admitted with a lower SAT score and GPA and know that the deciding factor was race; he was white, and she was black.

\
Affirmative action accounts for high rate of failure
\
In attempting to support affirmative action in her column Sunday, Cynthia Tucker completely misses the point when she provides the irrelevant statistic that minority graduates admitted through affirmative action earn advanced degrees at higher rates than their white counterparts.
\
A more meaningful fact is that 74 percent of minority applicants nationwide have failed to graduate five years after entering college, due mostly to the fact that affirmative action policies result in a systematic shifting of minority students from institutions where they could succeed to higher ranked institutions where they are more likely to fail.

Three faiths: Full of ignorance and half-truths
\
The article on the supposed commonalities and imagined oneness of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam is completely appalling for ignorance and half-truths (""Divinity & divisions,"" @issue, Nov. 18). While we all may be children of Abraham in the historical and naturalistic sense, God said to Moses long ago, ""Jacob have I loved, but Esau I have hated.""
\
Anyone who denies or ignores the fact that Jesus taught himself as the only way to God the father, and God the father as the only source of revelation of himself, is a liar and no true Christian.
\
One day, God will destroy the Journal-Constitution just as he has done the World Trade Center. Remember the world of Noah.

No sign Jews were superior
\
The @issue section in Sunday's newspaper on the three great religions was excellent. As a lay person, however, I wish to comment on three things.
\
In Judaism, the issue of the Jews believing that they were selected as the chosen people is unclear. It does not refer to any suggestion of superiority. Jews believe that they were chosen to carry an extra burden, to follow God's commandments, to be extra considerate of their fellow man, to repair the world and to eventually be a light unto the nations in exemplary behavior. A Jew, then, chooses to be chosen for this extra task.

Airport security: Blame Hartsfield management
\
The recent incident at the Atlanta airport should bring some new light into the inept management. Michael Shane Lasseter showed a lack of common sense at best, but what scares me more than a Lasseter is that management is purely reactive than proactive. Everyone is doing a great job of creating long lines to find tweezers, combs, etc. But they can't seem to do the job when serious breaches of security occur. Who is the greater threat --- Lasseter or those running the airports?
\
It is not the terrorists who scare me; it is those running the airports. They take my tweezers because they are sharp, but leave my pens and pencils alone. They take my 1 1/2-inch-long nail clippers, but let one man walk past security, then shut down the whole airport. They explain that they had to shut down the airport because one man goes past security that, by design, could not stop him. This event was all but planned!
\

\
Federalizing workers will add to ineptitude
\
Regarding federalizing airport security: Since when have the words ""competent"" and ""efficient"" come to describe federal employees? Where have I been all these years to miss that interesting characterization? Call me Rip Van Winkle; I must have been asleep for years!
\
Besides getting 28,000 new union members and Democratic voters with the bill to federalize airport security, we are also demonstrating a dangerous concept --- telling people that federal workers are the only ones who can keep us safe and do the job right.

Privacy: Concerns are selective
\
Martha Ezzard quotes Judge Jim Thurman from Leesburg about whether we would want ""our daughters"" to have attorney/client privacy if they were innocent of a drug charge (""Ashcroft's curb of rights sets scary legal precedent,"" @issue, Nov. 18). I do not think that would be too important. What would I fear would be overheard, that she is innocent? But most of us would probably want her to have privacy, if she were guilty.
\
If our daughters, or any other relative or friend had worked in the twin towers, would we have wanted a potential terrorist to have had attorney client/privilege on or before Sept. 11, if knowledge might have saved them?
\
It is mostly lawyers who make the laws. It is mostly lawyers who prosecute the cases. It is mostly lawyers who defend the cases, and it is mostly lawyers who oversee the lawyers and disbar unethical lawyers.
\
Is it any surprise we never hear an attorney complain that people who commit crimes do not go to prison?
\
RICHARD CLANCY, Suwanee
\
Ezzard wrong about Ashcroft
\
Regarding Martha Ezzard's column on Attorney General John Ashcroft: Would Ezzard's attitude differ had she had a relative in the World Trade Center?
\
Ashcroft has never tried to substitute his name for God. He is known to be about the most God-fearing person in Washington. Here we are trying to be a united nation when along comes a liberal atheist such as you to make up lies concerning a man of God trying to do his job to the best of his ability.
\
PAUL DONOVAN, Atlanta
\
Clinton, Reno ignored law
\
Regarding Martha Ezzard's column on Attorney General John Ashcroft: I agree that the recent changes in the laws are dangerous. I do not think the government should have such powers, and I do not see how any conservative could support this.
\
I would feel better if Ezzard had shown any inclination along these lines when Bill Clinton was president and Janet Reno was attorney general. Their total disregard for the law was what I hated most about that administration.
\
One of the main reasons I hate the new law is that we never know when another Bill Clinton will be elected or another Janet Reno will be named to a post that is supposed to enforce the law.

Animal care: Zoo Atlanta needs assistance
\
It is wonderful that Bernard Marcus is pledging $200 million toward an Atlanta aquarium. It's great that Ted Turner has given $1 billion to the United Nations. It is also very wonderful that Arthur Blank has donated millions to the arts.
\
Let us not forget Zoo Atlanta, however. I stayed overnight with a Girl Scout troop and couldn't help but feel embarrassed and saddened by its condition. It is so short of funds that many exhibits are closed. Many others desperately need work.
\
See for yourself. Atlanta's zoo is in bad shape. Please give generously!

Homeless pets left out in cold
\
Atlanta is celebrating a $200 million contribution for a new aquarium while the city's homeless dogs and cats await their death in a disgrace called Fulton County Animal Control.
\
It is unfortunate that Bernard Marcus and the city choose to build such a landmark for aquatics, who belong in their own natural habitat, when no one cares enough about our city's pets to build clean, modern facilities.

Locke's wardrobe excesses sad
\
After reading the article on Star 94 DJ Vikki Locke's closet, I am disgusted (""Organized Chic,"" Nov. 18). What a waste of ink and paper! Do you really think readers care about her overpriced clothes and idiotic spending habits? I sure don't.
\
Her dependency on high-priced designer clothing strikes me as sad and pathetic. At a time when unemployment is increasing and people are scrambling to put food on the table, how can she possibly feel OK about telling us that her ""worst buy"" was a $525 purse that she bought only because she felt stupid asking the store clerk what the price was? And what on earth does she do with 77 pairs of shoes?
\
If, as your article says, this series is designed to give readers ""a glimpse into the private spaces of public figures to see what makes them tick,"" I'm sorry I found out about this one --- and I'll skip the rest of the series.

Higher gas tax a bad idea
\
I cannot believe the state is seriously considering upping the gas tax to pay for road maintenance. Maintenance should always come before new roads and definitely before behavioral experiments such as HOV/T lanes.
\
After they squandered millions on HOV lanes on Georgia interstates, they want to tax us more for more foolishness?

Population boom will backfire
\
Ignoring the effect of population growth on Atlanta's future is a prescription for disaster. Metro Atlanta residents are already finding that population growth is overcrowding schools, threatening the environment and causing them to spend more time in traffic and less with their families.
\
If you think it's bad now, what will it be like when Georgia gains another 3 million people, which census figures indicate will happen by 2025?
\
Because the region has no plan to limit population growth, it should expect further strains on already overcrowded highways and schools.

Arabia Mountain a gem
\
I and two close friends enjoyed last Sunday's meteor shower from atop Arabia Mountain. As I drove along Klondike Road early Sunday morning, trying to escape the city lights, I wondered how many knew about this other granite monolith in DeKalb County.
\
I was pleasantly surprised to see new signage and a visitor's center at the park. There were even descriptions posted of the rare plant life found on the mountain. Arabia Mountain's moonlike surface was more beautiful than I had remembered it.
\
We stayed for a little over an hour, until 6 a.m. I thought about the significance of this once-in-a-lifetime light show. But I thought even more about the many people, especially DeKalb residents, who should visit and enjoy this park.

I've fought Atlanta's fiscal irresponsibility
\
My life's work has been to end divisiveness and misunderstanding among people. From my days in the Peace Corps to my work with nonprofit organizations to my tenure on the Atlanta City Council, I have sought to bring fairness, equality and opportunity to all. I believe Andrew Young and Jesse Hill Jr. know this (Letters, Nov. 23).
\
The city is facing a financial crisis that may have a disproportionate impact on services to the poor, senior citizens, disadvantaged youth and others, as well as creating job losses. Bloated budgets presented by the incumbent mayor created this crisis. I voted against three of the mayor's last four budgets because they were fiscally unsound and put us in the financial straits we now face. My opponent was the mayor's leader on the council and voted for these budgets.
\
My promise to Atlanta is independent, inclusive and honest leadership.

Credit: FOR THE JOURNAL-CONSTITUTION
"
138,"Georgians overwhelmingly support greater access to buses and trains to improve transportation in the state, but they have very little interest in increasing taxes to pay for them, an exclusive new poll for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution found.\The poll, conducted Monday through Thursday, found nearly 60 percent of Georgians believe improving transportation is important and nearly 70 percent support new bus and rail lines. Yet only 36 percent of respondents said they'd pay higher taxes to fund any kind of transportation project.\That split in opinion exposes the challenge lawmakers will face when they return to Atlanta for the 40-day legislative session that begins Monday. A special study committee late last month released a report that shows the state needs at least $1 billion a year in new revenue just to handle routine maintenance and up to $5 billion a year to expand roads, fix bridges and create new rail lines for mass transit.\An increase in the state's gas taxes and a general sales tax increase are among the options the committee identified to raise the money. But the AJC's poll shows lawmakers have much work to do to persuade Georgians to go along.\Laura Caceres-Nall, 47, of Peachtree Corners feels certain the state can find the money it needs from existing sources.\""They should allocate the money better and be more responsible with the way they manage it,"" she said. ""Anything that increases the cost of living I don't agree with. No more taxes.""\Some of the resistance to new or higher taxes is certainly related to Georgians' continuing concerns about the state's economy, availability of jobs and a lack of trust in the state's leadership.\The poll found that Georgians are more concerned about the economy and jobs than any other issue, just as they have been each of the past three years that the AJC has conducted its pre-legislative session survey. And confidence in the state of Georgia's economic situation has stagnated.\A year ago, 59 percent of respondents were satisfied with how things are going in Georgia. This year, 57 percent were satisfied. Last year, 40 percent said Georgia's economy was good. Now, 42 percent believe the same. An additional 54 percent described the state as not doing so well or doing poorly economically.\That antipathy also shows itself in Georgians' opinions of Gov. Nathan Deal and the General Assembly. A year ago, Deal enjoyed a 54 percent approval rating in the AJC poll. Today, 47 percent give him the highest marks. The Legislature fared worse, with a 39 percent approval rating this year compared with 45 percent last year.\Deal, of course, was just re-elected with 53 percent of the vote, and only a handful of legislative incumbents lost elections.\Howard Walden is among those worried about the economy.\The 54-year-old Thomasville resident said jobs should be plentiful.\""But the people that have the money won't create them,"" Walden said. ""It's everybody's problem.""\Walden also doesn't put much trust in government and therefore isn't keen on raising taxes to pay for transportation projects.\""They should have figured that out already,"" he said. ""There's got to be another way.""\April Stanford of Gainesville would love to have a transit option to get to Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport.\Stanford, 41, has studied the issue. She says it takes an average of 2.3 minutes per mile to drive through metro Atlanta.\""If I had to go to the airport, it's not going to be 2.3 for 60 miles,"" she said. ""I could jump on a train and get there and the airport (would be) more accessible.""\Unlike many, however, Stanford is willing to pay for improved transit and said she supports raising the gas tax.\While the transportation study committee identified a gas tax increase as one way to pay for new roads, it's unclear whether the Legislature will actually consider it. House Speaker David Ralston, R-Blue Ridge, who has great say on those issues, would not commit to any funding plan last week.\""The one thing we can't do is do nothing,"" Ralston said. ""I'm not sure what the something is going to look like yet. This is one of those issues that comes along every once in a while where we have to look down the road. This can is too big to kick down the road anymore.""\Georgians also have little interest in lowering the state income tax in exchange for paying higher state sales taxes, including any new tax on groceries. A solid 62 percent oppose the idea, compared with 34 percent who supported it.\How to raise cash to help fix Georgia's aging transportation system will likely dominate the legislative session, but a number of hot-button issues have already sprung to life.\An overwhelming 84 percent of respondents supported legalizing a limited form of medical marijuana to treat certain conditions. The backing comes as state Rep. Allen Peake, R-Macon, has pushed legalization of cannabis oil to treat certain seizure disorders in both children and adults --- afflictions that can cause hundreds of seizures a day and often lead to death.\The oil is harvested from the marijuana plant but does not create the high that recreational users of marijuana seek.\Peake was pleased with the poll results.\""This just confirms that Georgians are ready for safe, legal and timely access to medical cannabis,"" he said, ""and now it's our job to find the right regulatory structure that is the most prudent and expeditious for the benefit of our citizens that are hurting.""\Meanwhile, a near majority in the poll also support going further: legalizing marijuana for recreational use. Nearly as many respondents, however, aren't so sure. Forty-nine percent support fully legalizing marijuana, while 48 percent disagree.\Those results come after state Sen. Curt Thompson, D-Tucker, has proposed to provide Colorado-style access to marijuana at licensed retail shops while also allowing its use through medical providers for treatment of conditions including cancer, glaucoma and HIV/AIDS.\Efforts last year to allow Georgians to vote on Sunday also received overwhelming support, with 70 percent throwing their weight behind the concept. The backing comes after 11 counties joined in an effort for last year's midterm election by holding early voting on Sunday, which has traditionally been an off day at the ballot box in the Peach State.\More than 12,800 voters took advantage of that decision, beating expectations. Deal and other GOP leaders, however, frowned on the practice since not all voters statewide had an opportunity to participate. There is no ban on the practice in state law, and other states also allow Sunday voting.\Many of those who took advantage of Sunday voting last year applauded its convenience.\""It just gives everybody that extra day, if that was the only time you had to go vote,"" said Covington's Kelly Boswell, 29, a stay-at-home mom of three who participated in the AJC poll.\Georgia law only sets a 21-day early-voting period and mandates that it include at least one Saturday. Otherwise, the schedule is left up to local officials. Those rules remain fine for a majority of respondents in the poll, with 52 percent saying there is no need to make any change to the state's voting laws.\It was not unanimous, though.\Kalven Burton, 50, lives in Gwinnett County, and he would like to see Sunday set aside.\""I oppose Sunday voting,"" Burton said. ""Sunday is supposed to be a day of peace and worship. That's the way I was raised. The way I was raised you went to church, then you came home and spent time with family, got ready for the week ahead and rested.""\Outfitting all police officers with body cameras received the highest ranking among Georgians in the poll, with 89 percent backing the idea. Senate Democrats are prepping legislation that could require both body cameras and vehicle cameras for all local police agencies. Many local officials, however, have asked for it to be voluntary because of the expected cost, which the state estimates to be as much as $125 million over three years for local agencies.\Georgians in the poll split on local issues, backing local control of minimum wages but nixing the idea of creating new cities.\A significant majority --- 77 percent --- said they liked the idea of allowing cities and counties to raise the minimum wage above the state's current $5.15-an-hour rate. That can't happen unless lawmakers loosen the reins. The Georgia General Assembly more than a decade ago barred local governments from requiring a minimum wage higher than the federal standard.\Milledgeville resident Henry Boyle, 70, was among those who liked the idea, saying that there should be some provision for local communities to decide what works for them.\""It's getting back to community-based government,"" said Boyle, a retired manager for the Colonial Bread Co. who still works a part-time job. ""I don't think the Legislature or the federal government should dictate as much as they try to. What works in one community might not work in another.""\Only 25 percent of respondents said they supported the creation of more metro Atlanta cities, an idea that has gripped some communities in DeKalb and Fulton counties. Sixty-nine percent gave the idea a thumbs-down.\Staff writers Rosalind Bentley and Richard Halicks contributed to this article.\Contact legislators\Find yours\Use the secretary of state's poll locator service to identify your House and Senate districts and who represents you: http://mvp.sos.state.ga.us.\In person\Look for lawmakers in the House or Senate chamber or in their offices. Volunteer pages (usually schoolchildren) will carry messages to legislators in the chambers.\The public is not allowed on the House or Senate floor while in session.\Legislators often will leave the chamber to meet with voters, especially their constituents. Page desks are directly in front of the main doors leading to both chambers on the third floor of the Capitol.\Top lawmakers' offices are in the Capitol. The rest are across Mitchell Street (officially known as Capitol Square) in the Coverdell Legislative Office Building. Be prepared to pass through metal detectors.\Online\The General Assembly's home page (www.legis.state.ga.us) links to House and Senate members by name and by district. The directory lists the legislator's office phone and email. Some legislators also list home addresses and district phone numbers.\Track bills\In person\Find copies of bills in the House clerk's office (Room 309) and the secretary of the Senate's office (Room 353). Each has a desk where you can request a bill. Committee hearing notices are posted daily on a bulletin board outside both offices, and meeting calendars appear on monitors in the Legislative Office Building. You can also contact by phone. House clerk's office: 404-656-5015; secretary of the Senate's office: 404-656-5040.\Online\Go to www.legis.state.ga.us and click on ""Legislation"" at the top of the page. There, enter the bill number (if you know it) and whether it's a House or Senate bill. This allows you to view the bill in its entirety, track it through committees and see roll call votes. Listings of committee meetings may also be found on the websites of both the House and Senate.\Heading to the statehouse\If you plan to visit:\Take MARTA. The Georgia State University station on the east/west line is a short walk from the Capitol. Most people drive, nonetheless, even though parking is limited. Lots generally charge a minimum $5 daily for parking.\Some options: No. 1 Capitol Lot at Capitol Avenue and Memorial Drive, Pete Hackney Parking Deck (162 Jesse Hill Jr. Drive), Steve Polk Parking Plaza (65 Martin Luther King Jr. Drive), 90 Central Parking Lot (accessible from Central Avenue and Courtland Street).\While you're there\Wheelchair-accessible restrooms are available on the first, third and fourth floors of the Capitol, and other facilities are also on the second floor. There are vending machines on the first floor, where coffee, sodas and snacks are available; a cafeteria on the sixth floor of the Legislative Office Building serves breakfast daily until 10 a.m. and lunch from 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m.\A food court in the bottom of the Sloppy Floyd Building keeps similar hours. Dozens of monuments dot the Capitol grounds and the building's interior. Find a description of each here: http://georgiainfo.galileo.usg.edu/monument.htm.\New this year is Liberty Plaza, the public gathering space across Capitol Avenue from the Gold Dome.\The plaza features an outdoor amphitheater and several statues, including the replica Liberty Bell and Statute of Liberty. This is where most rallies and protests will now be held.\Follow the money\Go to http://georgia.gov/agencies/georgia-government-transparency-campaig -finance-commission, the website for the Georgia Government Transparency and Campaign Finance Commission (formerly the state ethics commission), to see campaign finance disclosures, lobbyist disclosure reports and lawmakers' personal finance disclosures.\Lobbyists are required to file disclosures twice a month during the session. You can also request hard copies at the commission's offices in the Sloppy Floyd Building. Call 404-463-1980 for information.\Speak at the hearings\The real work on bills is done in committees and subcommittees, and that's the place to weigh in. Contact committee members by phone, mail or email to make your voice heard. Speaking in person before a committee, though, is one of the most effective ways to reach legislators. The experience can be a little daunting, but legislators often appreciate hearing from taxpayers. Most committees have a sign-up sheet for speakers. Try to keep your remarks short and to the point.\Watch the action\In person\Business begins at 10 a.m. most days in the House and Senate chambers, but legislators often arrive before that. If you want to catch a legislator before the day's session, try waiting at the velvet ropes outside the chamber. Each chamber also has a gallery on the fourth floor of the Capitol. The hallways on the third floor have monitors that carry live feeds from the House and Senate. You will have to jockey with the lobbyists crowding the hallways for a good spot.\Online\The live video feeds are also available online. Go to www.legis.state.ga.us and look for the links under ""Live Broadcasts"" on the left. Many House committee meetings also stream live online. Look for the links at www.house.ga.gov/communications/en-US/VideoBroadcasts.aspx. Almost all House committee meetings --- but not subcommittees --- stream live online. The Senate does not provide the public this opportunity.\A dinner, a lunch: A group meal sponsored by lobbyists.\A good bill: Commonly used by lawmakers to start debate and let colleagues know they are not, in fact, presenting a ""bad bill"" that will, say, destroy the environment, triple income taxes or reintroduce child labor. Example: ""This is a good bill that heps the chil'ren of Georgia."" See: A li'l hep. See: For the chil'ren.\A li'l hep: Usually when a legislator asks for more money for a local program or constituent. Sometimes also used to help an industry or group pay fewer taxes.

Something legislators say when they want to drive home the point that something, such as more money for education or parks, etc., will benefit children.\Fiscal note: Estimate of a bill's cost. Often mispronounced ""physical note."" Legislators are supposed to get to see fiscal notes before they vote on bills, but they often don't.\Fiscal year: The year covered by the state's budget, July 1 to June 30. Often mispronounced ""physical year.""\Friends in the hall: Also known as ""people in the hall"" or ""folks in the hall."" Lobbyists. Example: ""Our friends in the hall support this bill."" Possibly because they wrote it.\Gallery: Where members of the public sit and watch the goings on.\Gentleman from, lady from: How lawmakers refer to one another in debates. As in, ""The gentleman/lady from Gwinnett County (or any county) knows of what they speak."" Which isn't always true.\Hand vote: Allows lawmakers to vote on bills without a record of how they voted (the number of hands are counted, not whose hand is raised).\Housekeeping bill: A bill that fixes small or technical problems in law. Occasionally bigger changes are slipped in when nobody is looking.\Industry bill: A bill brought by lawmakers on behalf of a particular industry, often written by lobbyists for that industry.\Init not true: Georgia version of the double negative ""isn't it not true,"" used in the form of a question. Example: ""Init not true that this bill will hep the chil'ren this physical year?""\Leadership: The House speaker, Senate president and the leadership team of the majority party who make the big decisions.\Little budget: The midyear spending plan for the final few months of the current fiscal year.\New information: In budget speak, it means ""new information"" on a particular agency's needs has been given to leaders that persuades them to cut or add money to a program. ""New information"" can simply be used by lawmakers as an excuse to shift money from one priority to another, regardless of the ""data"" or ""information.""\Not ready: As in, ""That bill is not quite ready."" It usually means the bill is being held up, often as a hostage to be used in a later trade for passage of other legislation.\Point of personal privilege: A time when lawmakers get to talk about pretty much anything, from war to the history of bond ratings in Georgia.\PORK: Or Project of Regional Concern (PORC). Project slipped into the budget to help one area or legislator.\Recognition: When local lawmakers parade in their local football team, checkers champion or Rattlesnake Roundup queen.\Reconsideration: When a bill or amendment is brought up for another vote.\Recommit: To send a bill back to a committee.

Coined by the late Associated Press statehouse legend Dick Pettys.\Rules: The committee that decides whether a bill will be debated by the full chamber. Later in the session, it sets the daily calendar. Like appropriations committees, a big deal.\Sine die: Latin for adjournment without recall. On the last day of the session, the House speaker and lieutenant governor adjourn ""sine die"" and slam down their gavels.\Sponsor: Legislator who files a bill and generally promotes it through the legislative process.\Study committee: Where bills often go when lawmakers aren't ready to act on them. Sometimes the bills are refined by the study committee and will come up the next year. Sometimes they are never heard from again.\Sunset: When a law or agency expires. Usually legislation or an agency about to sunset gets renewed before it dies.\Supplemental budget: See: Little Budget.\Unfunded mandate: When the federal government tells the state what to do and the state has to pay for it. Similar to when the state Legislature tells cities and counties what to do and the cities and counties have to pay for it.\Unlock the machines: What the chamber leader says before members vote on a bill. The ""unlocking"" allows members to have their vote registered.\Vehicle: A piece of harmless legislation used by lawmakers to carry another measure they really want to pass. The bill they want to pass gets amended onto the vehicle. See: Christmas tree.\Well: The front of House and Senate chambers where lawmakers speak on bills or amendments.\Transportation\Perhaps the biggest issue at the Capitol this year will be transportation.\For the first time in more than a decade, the Legislature intends to raise serious money to prop up Georgia's ailing transportation network. Step No. 1 might be raising the state's gas tax.\High-ranking legislators spent months traveling the state last year studying the issue and, in December, issued their findings: Commutes are congested --- no surprise --- and expanding Savannah's port will only add more highway traffic. The report called for raising a bare minimum of $1 billion to $1.5 billion more annually.\A big unknown is how much public transit they might include and how they would do it. Transit needs go from major systems such as MARTA and Xpress down to the state's 100-plus tiny local systems, including on-call special-needs vans.\Without question the money would go to repair bridges and highways, and hopefully build more to cope with the state's expanding population and commerce. But while the report openly declared that ongoing funding of mass transit is in the state's best interests, it didn't suggest how to do that.\Budget/Taxes\When it comes to the state's $21 billion budget, lawmakers face a session of great expectations. Revenue is growing, so after years of austerity, everybody wants something. But most of the extra money will go for the basics, such as paying for increased school enrollment or higher public health care expenses.\Teachers and state employees may get raises, although it could depend on the financial shape of their school districts and agencies. Backers of private school scholarships --- popular with the Republican majority --- are vowing to press for a fourfold or fivefold increase in funding.\Expect the usual parade of special-interest tax breaks. While Gov. Nathan Deal has urged caution on doling out business tax breaks, it's been pretty much business as usual in recent years.\Ethics\After the meltdown at the state ethics commission in 2014, including judgments against the state of nearly $3 million and the firing of the agency's director, Deal proposed a sweeping set of changes.\He and lawmakers are expected to propose changes to the state agency formally known as the Government Transparency and Campaign Finance Commission that could include expanding the board from five to 12 members. The legislative, executive and --- for the first time --- judicial branches would each get four appointments, and the full board would choose a chairman.\While the agency has, in recent months, begun to recover, it is still without an executive director as the current board appears willing to wait to see what lawmakers have in store.\Outside interests, including the watchdog group Common Cause Georgia, have called for broader changes, including a boost in the agency's budget and tweaks to the 2012 ethics bill that sought to rein in lobbyist spending on elected officials. It is unclear, however, whether lawmakers will agree.\Uber, Lyft, Tesla\Ride-sharing services Uber and Lyft, as well as high-end electric carmaker Tesla, all vroomed into January on lawmakers' minds, thanks to public hearings and, in Tesla's case, a looming court case. It's just not clear what they want to do about it.\Efforts last year to regulate companies such as Uber failed, causing state House Public Safety Committee Chairman Alan Powell, R-Hartwell, to form a special study committee that is expected to soon weigh in about whether more regulation is needed and how so.\While the companies and their supporters don't oppose some new rules, the state's taxicab and limousine companies have adamantly pressed for strict oversight including requiring drivers to be fingerprinted and pass a state criminal background check --- the same standards they have to meet.\Tesla, meanwhile, is battling just to be able to sell its cars in Georgia after being sued by state auto dealers who say the California company's business model to sell directly to consumers --- bypassing a third-party dealer --- violates state law.\Both sides await a decision by a state administrative judge. The battle, however, has already jumped to the email in-boxes of state lawmakers, who heard last week from the National Auto Dealers Association about how local dealers provide an economic boost to their communities.\Look for car dealers to press that point in the General Assembly especially if the judge's decision doesn't go their way.\K-12, higher education\Gov. Nathan Deal has pledged a multiyear effort to rework Georgia's two-decade-old school funding formula, known as the Quality Basic Education Act. He's assigned a task force of superintendents, teachers, lawmakers and community advocates to meet over the next year to begin drafting recommendations.\He also hopes to give the state new powers to intervene in struggling school districts, similar to experiments in Louisiana and Tennessee. More conservative legislators may try to revive efforts to make the state cut ties with national academic standards known as Common Core.\The state's Democrats also want to revive proposals seeking to expand access to Georgia's popular HOPE scholarship program.\The state's colleges and universities, meanwhile, are focused on securing pay raises for employees. University System of Georgia Chancellor Hank Huckaby has indicated that years of austerity cuts to state agencies and stagnant wages have taken a toll and are becoming a hurdle in retaining and drawing top talent.\Cityhood\New cities could be formed across metro Atlanta if state lawmakers agree to let residents vote on incorporation, an issue that has divided residents over what's best for their areas.\Cityhood supporters want more local control of their government, but opponents say additional cities would further fracture the region.\In DeKalb County, the communities of LaVista Hills and Tucker are furthest along toward becoming cities after a legislative subcommittee voted last month to set their borders. LaVista Hills would cover about 65,000 people living mostly between the eastern edge of I-285 and I-85 while also including some residents outside the Perimeter near Spaghetti Junction. Tucker would include about 35,000 residents from the Perimeter to Stone Mountain and beyond.\Several other areas are also pushing for local governance by founding cities, including Stonecrest, south DeKalb and south Fulton. Additionally, a group in the Druid Hills community is seeking to join the city of Atlanta in hopes of gaining more control of its schools.\Economic development\Look for tax credits to again be on the agenda to spur economic development --- including a possible expansion of Georgia's perks for Hollywood.\The new year could bring proposals to lower the $500,000 threshold for film and TV projects to qualify for incentives, or incentives could be expanded to cover more post-production, such as special effects and editing.\Other new tax breaks for various industries are likely, but these one-off perks make it more difficult for lawmakers to enact a sweeping tax overhaul. And some critics say Georgia doesn't do enough to ensure it gets enough of a bang for all the tax breaks. There may be a push for a tax break review system to see whether the perks indeed work.\Other bills may address the minimum wage --- whether through a statewide increase or proposals that would allow counties and cities to increase the minimum wage within their boundaries.\But such proposals could face stiff opposition from Republican leaders, including Gov. Nathan Deal, who has previously said an increase in the minimum wage is not on his legislative agenda.\Rural hospitals\Earlier this year, Gov. Nathan Deal created a committee of hospital executives, state lawmakers and industry experts to address the financial crisis dozens of rural hospitals face.\Eight rural hospitals have closed since 2001, and dozens more are losing money at an alarming rate. Aging populations, disproportionate shares of uninsured patients and new regulations under the Affordable Care Act are among a host of challenges increasingly putting these facilities in dire financial straits.\The state Rural Hospital Stabilization Committee has been studying possible solutions, such as allowing struggling hospitals to downsize into free-standing emergency departments; employing telemedicine; and coordinating efforts among federally funded health centers, regional hospitals, urgent cares and other types of providers.\The group is expected to present recommendations as early as this month, which may be used in developing legislation aimed at helping keep rural hospitals afloat. Rep. Terry England, R-Auburn, and Sen. David Lucas, D-Macon, both serve on the committee.\Certificate of need\Hospitals and doctors could possibly clash yet again this session over the state's so-called ""certificate of need,"" or CON, process, which requires health care providers to prove to the state there is a genuine need in a community for the services they want to offer.\In 2013, proposed legislation aimed at allowing multiservice outpatient surgery centers to avoid the CON process ultimately failed to pass, but legislators and hospital officials continue to debate the idea.\Hospitals say making such stand-alone facilities exempt from CON would put small community hospitals at financial risk by draining away paying patients that help make up for the cost of caring for the poor and uninsured. Unlike hospitals, they say, the surgery centers don't have the overhead costs of operating an emergency department and aren't required by law to accept patients who can't pay.\Supporters of changing the CON process, however, say that multispecialty surgery centers are able to offer consumers lower-priced care at a time when paychecks are stagnant while health care costs and deductibles are rising. Currently, single-specialty practices are exempt from the ""certificate of need,"" or CON, process.\Religious liberty\Georgia's powerful business community has already issued a warning over efforts to revive ""religious liberty"" legislation, which it helped defeat last year after hometown heavyweights Coca-Cola, Delta Air Lines and Home Depot all spoke out against it.\Backers are basing their effort on federal legislation passed by Congress in 1993 and signed by President Bill Clinton. It asserts that government has to show a compelling interest for why its policy should override an individual's religious freedom. In the years since, 18 states have adopted their own version of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, and nearly a dozen others have adopted the same legal standard through court decisions.\But the issue flared here last year in the wake of national attention over lawsuits against businesses who refused to provide goods or services for gay weddings or gay advocacy groups.\Critics say passage would open the door for private business owners to discriminate against gays and other minorities --- by citing religious beliefs --- and make the Peach State a national laughingstock and economic pariah. When the issue sparked up last year in Arizona, Gov. Jan Brewer vetoed similar legislation that had brought widespread condemnation along with the possible loss of this year's Super Bowl.\Medical marijuana\Lawmakers came close to passing legislation in 2014 that would have legalized the use of cannabis oil to treat certain seizure disorders, but the bill failed in the session's final moments.\State Rep. Allen Peake, R-Macon, has spent the interim gathering support for another effort this year. While it seems certain Peake will again get the bill through the House, it's unclear whether he can succeed in getting it to Gov. Nathan Deal's desk.\Also unclear at this point is whether lawmakers will consider a broader medical marijuana bill that would allow patients with diseases such as cancer and glaucoma to use a more potent product. Peake's original measure allowed only the use of a marijuana derivative that does not produce the ""high"" most closely associated with the drug.\But others are pushing for legalization of more nonsmokable forms of marijuana, and a recent poll showed a vast majority of Georgians agree. But getting the Republican-dominated House and Senate, not to mention Deal, on board will be tricky.\Complete coverage\The Atlanta Journal-Constitution will have Georgia's largest team covering the Legislature in January.

140,"My thanks to all those who commented on my two holdover items from last week's column. As to the plastic bag bill, there were not initially that many comments. But being the community we are, there was apparently some independent research being done, which resulted in a number of comments late in the week.\Obviously, this is not just an issue of home rule, but also about protecting the clean and green environment that brought most of us to the Lowcountry. \As to the second matter, the road bill, aka the gas tax user fee of eventually 10 cents per gallon, I was surprised and heartened with the response. Apparently, there is an understanding of the connection between good, safe roads and bridges, and the dollars necessary to create and maintain both. \In fact, my friend and delegation partner Rep. Weston Newton and I were pleased to be able to speak with our friends at the Sun City Republican Club. We were able to lay out the rationale for the increase in the user fee, along with the purpose of the fee, as well as the last time the fee had been increased, with a summary of how our roads and bridges had deteriorated since the last increase. \We were prepared to counter the carpet-bombing of misinformation and ideological nonsense by, unfortunately, local sources. The unsurprising thing was that folks seemed to understand the origin of the tainted information, appreciating it for what it was, and were anxious to hear the real deal. \When Weston and I provided the real facts and figures, a show of hands indicated that reality has a 10 to 1 advantage over the ideological opposition. For us, it was a watershed moment. \Relative to the pension reform bill, it came back from the Senate with amendments they surely knew would be unacceptable. I have asked the body to not concur, so it will go to a conference committee, where I'm confident we can move forward. The pension system will be on the way to a healthier future. \In that same vein, I have had ongoing conversations with the Retirement Investment Commission. We were able to ascertain that the fund, for this year, will accrue a little more than 9 percent return. \While this is great, and a full 2 percent above our assumptions, the markets are volatile. That said, we are confident we will produce a little more than 7 percent for the out years. This modest assumption will give us a certain cushion as we start at above expectation. \We were pleased to have the Association of Landscape Architects up for a visit. My good friend Josh Tiller was here, along with Kathleen Duncan, project manager with J.K. Tiller and Associates. Josh has been involved in the Bluffton community for many years, with good work on many boards and commissions in the town of Bluffton. In fact, Josh has been under scrutiny for some time as a potential candidate for public office. \Finally, the House is going to be off for the week of April 10, so as to let the Senate catch up with our productivity. \As this is going to be Heritage time, I would like for all of us to be on our best behavior, especially on the roads. There will be folks here who don't know their way around, and may find themselves in the wrong lane or driving too show as they look for our obscure signage.

SINCE 1997, Chatham County taxpayers have spent nearly $300,000 to determine the best way to move traffic across downtown Savannah. Unfortunately, a solution appears years, if not decades, away.
\
The study being conducted by consulting firm HNTB of Kansas City must not be allowed to collect dust on a shelf like so many others over the years. Yet that's a real danger. Solving the east-west traffic problem won't be easy, cheap or universally popular. Someone, or some neighborhood, is going to get angry over whatever plan is agreed upon. But a decision must be made.
\
In 1997, the Metropolitan Planning Commission agreed to commission one more study on the problem, vowing that the final report wouldn't be filed away and forgotten. It paid $250,000 to HNTB to come up with one or more solutions.
\
The money ran out in 1999, but not before the consultants had found eight potential alternatives:
\
* Bay Street bypass with a new bridge over the Savannah River, diverting commercial traffic to Hutchinson Island. Cost: $250 million-330 million.
\
* Bay Street tunnel. Cost: $95 million-130 million.
\
* Liberty Street tunnel. Cost: $210 million-270 million.
\
* Bay and Broughton Street one-way combination. Cost: $7 million-10 million.
\
* Broughton Street truck/rail tunnel. Cost: $160 million-210 million.
\
* Tunnel under Gwinnett Street. Cost: $80 million-110 million.
\
* Improvements to Henry and Anderson streets. Cost: $5 million-7 million.
\
* DeRenne Avenue expressway. Cost: $80 million-110 million.
\
No option is without problems, from high construction costs to serious impact on neighborhoods or the environment.
\
Last year, county commissioners agreed to put another $30,000 into completing the study. An executive summary was expected earlier this month, but officials say now that the final report won't be ready until May. That report is expected to recommend one of those eight options.
\
That's when the serious work - and the vigorous debate - will begin. Whatever the recommendation, there will be those who say it is too expensive, too difficult and too disruptive. And that's fine. Such is the nature of a project of this magnitude.
\
But even the toughest critics can't stop the inevitable. Transportation experts predict that by 2020 traffic on Bay Street will increase by 45 percent. It's expected to nearly double on DeRenne Avenue. It could take that long to get a solution identified and built, once time is added to secure funding, complete the design and environmental impact studies, and then finish construction.
\
Whatever solution is chosen, it must ease an existing problem without creating some major new ones.
\
Take, for example, the proposal to turn Bay and Broughton streets into one-way thoroughfares. Instead of easing the flow of traffic on Bay Street, this proposal would in effect create two Bay Streets, one through the middle of what has become a vibrant downtown.
\
Related problems exist with the Henry/Anderson or DeRenne proposals. They would destroy the neighborhoods that have grown up along those streets.
\
But all is not dire.
\
Funding for whatever solution is pursued may be a little easier than in the past. The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, a federal program signed into law in 1998, changed the way gas tax revenues are returned to the states.
\
It also helps that the Georgia Department of Transportation is headed by a former Savannah alderman, county commissioner and legislator. DOT Commissioner Tom Coleman isn't about to make Chatham County the DOT's priority, but at least he will listen and consider any proposals.
\
The real challenge will be to put the recommended solution into effect. Officials can't skim through this study, agree that something must be done, then forget about it. If they think residents are complaining now about congestion, the roar will be even louder in another decade of so - provided people can hear themselves think above the traffic noise.

U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston is using the energy independence plan President Bush is to unveil tonight to push a similar proposal of his own.
\
Bush has said he'll advocate such a plan in his State of the Union speech and Kingston was leveraging that Monday in hopes of getting more colleagues to back his measure.
\
Kingston, a Savannah Republican, is teaming up with Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., on a bill aimed at reducing American dependence on foreign oil.
\
The proposal has 34co-sponsors, including Reps. John Barrow, a Democrat who represents most of Savannah, and Sanford Bishop, another Georgia Democrat.
\
On Monday, Kingston e-mailed colleagues a partial transcript of a CBS interview during which the president said he would talk about the issue ""big time"" in his speech.
\
A member of the House GOP leadership team, Kingston urged members of Congress to sign on as co-sponsors before the speech. Kingston spokesman Rob Asbell predicted that four or more additional members will do so.
\
In the interview, Bush declined to go into details, saying, ""I don't want to tell you what's in the State of the Union.""
\
But the president said his strategy involves using ""new technologies"" - such as making ethanol fuel from corn - to reduce U.S. dependence on oil.
\
""He's basically going to describe Jack's bill without saying it's Jack's bill,"" Asbell said.
\
One major feature of Kingston's legislation would increase tax breaks for developers of alternative fuels, especially ethanol.
\
He and other backers say the measure could shrink U.S. dependence on imported oil by 10 percent over the next decade.
\
The bill also would provide tax breaks for automakers to produce more gas-miserly vehicles and to induce more motorists to buy them.
\
Such ideas are not new, but have gained momentum in the wake of last year's gas-price surge and increasing instability in the Middle East.
\
In any case, the bill ""would strengthen our national security, improve American competitiveness, and protect our environment,"" Kingston said Monday,
\
Although many experts support ethanol as an alternative fuel, some say so much energy is needed to produce it that little energy is saved.
\
Kingston said he began working on his bill late last summer, after Congress passed a major energy bill that failed to deal with American reliance on overseas oil.
\
He said he got together with Engel and others who shared similar concerns and reached a consensus about what could be done.
\
Engel is a member of the House Energy Committee and a leader in a group that supports energy independence.
\
Two divisive proposals, oil drilling in environmentally sensitive areas and requiring automakers to meet minimum gas-mileage standards, were deliberately omitted.
\
Another much-discussed proposal, raising the federal gas tax, also was not included.
\
Bush restated his opposition to that idea in the CBS interview.
\
The Kingston-Engel plan is expected to be opposed by automakers and by sugar interests worried about a provision to lift the tariff on imported ethanol.
\
AT A GLANCE
\
Major features of Kingston-Engel energy bill
\
- Double the consumer tax credit for buying more fuel-efficient cars.
\
- Provide tax credits to American manufacturers to produce more efficient lightweight materials and produce advanced technologies needed by modern alternative fuel efficient vehicles.
\
- Provide other tax incentives to corporate and taxi fleets to switch to more fuel-efficient cars.
\
- Require fuel-efficiency labeling of tires to help consumers choose the most efficient models.
\
- Provide tax incentives to gas stations to install required pumps for alternative fuels.
\
- Set a goal to replace 10 percent of gasoline usage with ethanol in 10 years.
\
- Lift the tax on ethanol imported from Brazil to make it more widely available in the U.S.
\
- Require an internal audit of the federal government's usage of fuel and based on those findings, develop a plan to save more fuel.

Before citizens decide how to vote on T-SPLOST, they should consider the facts on why it's being proposed and if it is in their best interest.
\
Let's admit that we have a traffic problem. Every half hour we sit in traffic on Abercorn, 144, I-516, I-16 or Highway 21 is time we are not spending with our family or at work.
\
Unless something is done, it will keep getting worse and worse and worse. Imagine Abercorn in 10 years. When the harbor is deepened, West Chatham will be a nightmare.
\
In addition to lost time, maintaining existing jobs and enticing new jobs here depends on interconnectivity. Time is money in logistics and service delivery. And almost 3,000 of Georgia's bridges are functionally obsolete or structurally deficient.
\
Second, let's check if we have enough funding to handle the need. Roads are built and maintained with state and federal motor fuel taxes (MFT). The federal government distributes MORE than they collect from federal highway taxes back to the states.
\
When Congress finally is forced to deal with the deficit, we can expect a 25-30 percent cut in future federal highway spending. Revenue from the MFT is based on vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and vehicle fuel efficiency.
\
Georgia's VMT is flat due to the economy and increased use of the computer to shop and be entertained. Fuel efficiency is being steadily improved due to technology and reaction to higher gas prices. Fifty percent of all of Georgia's road funding goes simply to maintain and operate our existing roads. Another 25 percent goes to debt for past and present construction.
\
That leaves very little for job creation, safety improvements and increased capacity. Those are the facts.
\
So Georgia faces three choices: We can do nothing and let traffic get worse and roads deteriorate. Or we can cut spending somewhere else (like education and health care) and reallocate existing funds to transportation. Or we can figure out a fair way to take care of ourselves.
\
From shipping cotton out of Savannah to the railroads in Atlanta, Georgia was built on investments in transportation. Two generations ago, state leaders decided to build an airport in Atlanta and expand the ports on the coast. Those were controversial decisions at the time, but we now have the world's busiest airport and the nation's fastest growing port (and the jobs they generate).
\
Our area cannot rely on more money to rain down from Washington or Atlanta. We must take matters into our own hands. So, with insufficient funds and a critical need, the legislature created a mechanism for voters to decide if additional revenue is warranted.
\
They ruled out increasing the gas tax by 25 cents in favor of a 1 cent general sales tax.
\
A simple, broad and fair source of funding was preferred to higher income or property taxes. Herman Cain calls this the ""Transportation FAIR Tax."" And, in a nod to ""local control,"" the projects were publicly determined by a regional committee, not the Georgia Department of Transportation.
\
If passed within our 10-county region, all funding stays here. None of it goes to Atlanta or grows the bureaucracy. It will be accountable to a citizens' committee and, if it works, we can continue it in 10 years. If it doesn't, we can defeat it.
\
In 17 years of public service, I never voted for a tax increase. But I always supported referendums and personally vote ""yes"" when I believe they are targeted, necessary and temporary.
\
Passage in our region will create 43,000 jobs plus establish a better environment for future economic success. Even in this economy, I would rather pay taxes now to help my children and grandchildren have the infrastructure in place for their jobs, safety and quality of life.
\

As a conservative, I believe in ""pay as you go."" I believe in local control. I believe in taxes that are fair and broad and efficiently used. And I believe in leaving a better community behind when I'm gone.

If you want to vote ""no"" because you can't afford it or better roads don't matter to you, those are valid arguments.
\
But don't vote ""no"" thinking that traffic will improve by itself. It won't.

We are being sold a bill of goods by our Georgia legislators who did not want to be responsible for increasing the gas tax 25 cents a gallon to meet the transportation needs.
\
If you use the roads, then it is only fair to pay the cost.
\
It's easy to see why engineering companies and road-building companies would jump on board in favor of T-SPLOST, but if you do the math you might see things different.
\
I know in my case we go about 8,000 miles per year at 20 miles per gallon, which amounts to $100 at 25 cents per gallon. We spend approximately $30,000 on taxable items, which amounts to $300 at 1 percent.
\
If T-SPLOST passes and you are not happy with the results, you have no one to blame but yourselves and that was the way it was planned.
\
I know which way I am going. Why don't you do the math for your particular situation? They say there is no plan ""B,"" but there will be one next year if need be when the legislature convenes.

CONSUMERS SHOULD DRIVE HEALTH-CARE SYSTEM
\
Dr. Robert Pawlicki's July 19 column highlights a problem with the current health care industry in that it does not adequately address the medical needs of patients with mental illness.
\
He may be correct in his assessment of the situation, and one certainly has empathy for his daughter and many others who suffer from a mental illness. But the idea that ObamaCare will rectify this is irrational.
\
The doctor states, ""Because the public does not experience these costs directly, they go unnoticed as hospitals... bear the brunt of these expenses and pass the charges on to the rest of us.""
\
Exactly where does he think the costs will be passed to with ObamaCare? The costs of adding 30 million plus individuals to the health care roles will cause a reduction in available care. Without additional doctors, hospitals and nurses to administer care, the obvious result will be rationing. Simply because a person is added to an insurance program doesn't mean that adequate care will be received.
\
The rational answer to the health care dilemma is a consumer-driven health care system with catastrophic insurance for those caught in the situation that Dr. Pawlicki's daughter finds herself, not a complete overhaul of the existing system.

CITY COUNCIL CREATED POOR PRECEDENT FOR BUILDINGS
\
The recent decision of our Savannah City Council to allow an exception in the height requirement for the proposed hotel on the site of the old SEPCO building is an unfortunate breaking of a long tradition that has preserved the primary appeal of this community to tourists - namely, that it is an historical city with an historical appearance.
\
The granting of this exception creates a precedent that will make future exceptions easier to obtain and more difficult to resist.
\
Crossing this line creates a crack in the foundation of what our historic association has fought so hard to maintain. The economic gains from this project, while significant, may well damage the long-range perception of Savannah's uniqueness.
\
Roger Scruton reminds us in his work on beauty that buildings are not separate from the landscape. Buildings are part of the landscape; they help define it. Buildings help define how we perceive the landscape.
\
Once we violate the tenants of design that preserve our historical heritage, that heritage's future is in jeopardy.
\
There are certainly ways a hotel can exist there without violating the height rules. It is the builders who should be subject to our standards, not we to their whims.

WHY NO NICE CONTAINERS FOR RECYCLING IN HOMES?
\
The curbside, single-stream recycling system is useful in bolstering citizen commitment to the environment.
\
People in Savannah who you'd never expect to participate in an environmental effort are dutiful in properly disposing of their recyclables.
\
What is blatantly problematic about the system that helps sustain opposition to it is its lack of incorporating attractive, ergonomically designed household containers, especially in a city as ostentatious as Savannah is.
\
If you're going to force people to recycle, which the city of Savannah has effectively done, at least remove some of the easily identified obstacles associated with it. It's strange entering into the homes of friends, family, associates and others, or vice versa, and seeing makeshift containers for recyclables.
\
Walking back and forth to those carts can be exhausting and potentially life-threatening for the elderly citizens doing what they have been tasked to do.
\
The containers don't have to be grandiose and bombastic in design. But they should be better than huge black garbage bags sitting on the back of kitchen chairs, or deformed cardboard boxes stowed away in corners.

CONSERVATIVES DISTORT OBAMA'S WORDS
\
I have to laugh whenever someone writes or calls in to your paper, accusing you of liberal bias. The only thing I can think of is that they read the paper on a day when you wrote something even mildly moderate, which doesn't happen very often.
\
I am tired of the (mostly) far right conservatives taking President Obama's words out of context to distort the meaning of what the president was saying, such as ""...you didn't build that...""
\
You'll notice those little ellipses, those dots, before and after those words. He said lots of important things around those words. The ""around"" parts are really good. You should read/print the whole speech.
\
All of you people who started and built businesses, if you sprang fully formed from your mother's womb, already possessing all the knowledge you would ever need to be successful in this world, if you never attended school, or even had a teacher encourage you, then yes, you built it all on your own.
\
And those streets you walk and drive down so that people can get to your business, did you pave those? Did you already have all the money you would need for your business, no loans necessary? No one is successful all by themselves. No man is an island.

146,"
Georgia's plan for a $2 billion network of commuter and high-speed rail lines could soon have a new chief engineer --- the governor.
\
Five years ago, the state's rail proposals were part of the charge of the then little-known Georgia Rail Passenger Authority. Then a year ago, the purse-string-holding state Department of Transportation board adopted a policy paper saying it would decide whether, when and how train service would be launched in Georgia.
\
Now, Gov. Roy Barnes and his ultra-powerful Georgia Regional Transportation Authority likely will have swaying influence.
\
""The governor wants to be able to have direct input in the future direction that transportation is going to take in the state, rail being a part of that,"" Barnes' spokeswoman, Jocelyn Butler, said. ""He feels it's a very appropriate thing for GRTA to be a part of, with these three groups (GRTA, GRPA and DOT) working in conjunction.""
\
This past week, during a two-day workshop, the DOT board talked of hiring a ""program manager"", a kind of rail czar, to oversee the entire program.
\
According to a 44-page report outlining each of those rail line projects and the responsibilities DOT and GRPA would have, the rail czar would be guided by a DOT-created panel made up of representatives from those two groups. The DOT was to vote on the issue next week.
\
But that has been put on hold because the governor's office wanted input.
\
Deputy DOT Commissioner Steve Parks said he doesn't have specifics on how the arrangement will work. But Barnes' office is proposing a team of two members from three groups, DOT, GRPA and from GRTA. The governor would appoint the chairman.
\
""The intent was never to omit GRTA out of anything,"" Parks said. ""The idea of an implementation plan was a second step. We started on this idea before GRTA ever existed. And it's simply a matter now of recognizing where they are.""
\
The 15-member GRTA board --- with its array of representatives from environmentalists to developers to planners --- most likely will go beyond transportation and make decisions based on issues such as economic development and the image of the region, said Michael Meyer, director of Georgia Tech's Transportation Research and Education Center.
\
""The politics of it are such that the GRTA board would have broad perspective,"" he said. ""The DOT would consider those things, but would look (more narrowly) at the transportation aspects of it. Believe me, in both environments, the politics are going to be significant""
\
Plans for a statewide system, which has become increasingly popular in metro Atlanta and Georgia as communities struggle to come into compliance with federal clean-air standards, call for six commuter lines from Atlanta to Athens, Bremen, Canton, Covington, Gainesville and Senoia. It also includes high-speed links to cities in nearby states, as well as studies of suburb-to-suburb links on metro Atlanta's north side. If everything stays on track, lines from Atlanta to Macon and to Athens are likely to be the first ones built, by 2004.
\
DOT Programming Director Paul Mullins said the agency hopes to hire a consultant by the end of August. Three studies are now unofficially under way, one looking at work on a rail line from Atlanta to Macon, another examining the environmental impact on the line to Athens, and the third looking at the effect rail would have on freight traffic in the Atlanta area.
\
Here's a quick look at some of the projects:
\
Commuter rail: Includes suburb-to-city trains on six lines with a total of 39 stations in 22 counties expected to contain more than 70 percent of the entire state population by 2010. Cost is roughly $550 million. A seventh line from Atlanta to Griffin is being considered.
\
High-speed rail: Includes daily trains at speeds up to 110 mph on seven lines with 15 stations and 790 miles of upgraded railroads. Cost is estimated at $905 million. A ""first-priority"" network would be from Atlanta to Albany, Savannah and Jacksonville. Later lines will go from Atlanta to Macon, via Griffin; Griffin to Columbus; Greenville, S.C., to Atlanta; and Atlanta to Augusta.
\
Multimodal passenger terminal: Would be built in the heart of downtown near Five Points and be the major terminal of the high-speed and commuter services. It would provide facilities for Amtrak, connections to MARTA rail and bus service. The cost is about $164 million.
\
Other rail corridors: A 40-mile Marietta-Lawrenceville line is being studied with $2.4 million in federal money and $600,000 in state money. It is supposed to be complete in 2001. A 100-mile high-speed line from Atlanta to Chattanooga would be studied with $5 million from TEA-21 and $1.25 million from the state. It's supposed to begin in 2001 and end a year later.
\
The department says it has found the potential for using up to $100 million a year for rail passenger projects from federal money in the so-called TEA-21 law. But it can only be used with matching funds, of about $32 million a year. And the state will have to ask Congress for other money that is needed for rail activities that don't yet fit the TEA-21 rules.
\
Those holes in funding mean GRTA could play an even more crucial role. The DOT constitutionally is restricted from using the state's gas tax for roads and bridges. But the Legislature gave GRTA immense powers to raise and spend money for virtually any transportation project.
\
The success of commuter rail, GRTA spokesman Charles Walston says, is going to depend on how well it's integrated with the rest of the transportation system in the region. That means webbing it to park-and-ride lots, MARTA and express buses --- all things within GRTA's purview.
\
""Commuter rail is part of the big picture, it's not a solution standing out on its own,"" Walston said. ""The governor is a big picture guy.""

"
147,"Mass transit, long a no-go with Georgia legislators, is quietly gaining traction at the Statehouse.\For the first time, many lawmakers, including key conservatives, say the state's economic vitality depends in part on sustained funding for rail and buses. But as the session begins Monday, the big question --- how much funding --- is anyone's guess.\A legislative study committee that voiced a precedent-setting commitment to transit was mum on the scope of that commitment or where the money should come from. Interviews with legislators who control the budget levers found nary a whisper of consensus.\Hammering out the details could be a long, tortuous process.\State Rep. Jay Roberts, the Ocilla Republican who chairs the House Transportation Committee and co-chaired the study group, said he's moved from ""if"" on funding transit to ""how much.""\But he wouldn't venture even a ballpark number, saying the amount his colleagues might agree on ""is still a question that's up in the air.""\About the only thing that's sure is that any money that's allocated won't be nearly enough to buy, say, a major new rail line, at least not on its own.\Here's one way to think about the gap that separates the cost of big-ticket projects from the money that's even conceivably available:\One possibility occasionally floated is taking a portion of the gas tax, called the ""fourth penny,"" which currently goes to the state's general fund, and redirecting a portion of it to mass transit. In recent years the fourth penny has generated, at most, about $180 million a year. Taking half of it (a number mentioned in the past) might generate a max of $90 million for transit.\By comparison, one of the most oft-discussed potential projects, an eastward expansion of MARTA rail service along I-20 in south DeKalb County, could cost $1.4 billion. That's not including what it would take to run it after it's built.\Besides, in recent interviews Gov. Nathan Deal didn't express enthusiasm for diverting money from the general fund.\""My main concern at this point is that we not jeopardize the general revenue of the state, because there are too many other things that depend on that revenue,"" Deal said.\Starting small\Some projects are cheaper, like the proposal to extend MARTA just over a mile, into Gwinnett County. A 2012 estimate put the cost at $140 million. But battle-scarred transit fans aren't necessarily setting their sights even that high.\""I'm talking about one step at a time,"" said Edward Lindsey, a former legislator and advocate for mass transit who served on the study committee.\An initial amount in the single-digit millions in the metro Atlanta area could make a difference, he said, if devoted to creating a governance umbrella agency for the welter of transit agencies there. (However, House Speaker David Ralston on Thursday said he knew of no plans to include that idea in the current negotiations over transit funding.)\One thing's sure: To garner enough votes to pass, any proposal will have to promise benefits to a bunch of legislative districts both inside and outside metro Atlanta.\""They're going to try to build support in Columbus, in Augusta, for this initiative,"" said Charles Bullock, a UGA political scientist. ""There's always a pushback from the out-state against things being seen as just for Atlanta.""\In one sense, just doing something may be more important than what that something is. Allocating some state money to transit will give advocates more leverage to impress federal officials who dole out grants in Washington. And for MARTA, which has long bemoaned that it's the only transit agency of its size in the nation without ongoing operations funding from the state, any commitment would be a victory.\""If the Legislature were to create a substantial funding source on a long-term, ongoing basis, it would attract the (feds') attention in a way we haven't been able to attract it in a long time,"" said Cain Williamson, division manager of mobility services at the Atlanta Regional Commission.\A new day\Less than a decade ago, House Republicans waged a political war on commuter rail at the state Department of Transportation. Further back than that, when Democrats were in charge, the majority represented rural regions and had little interest in transit.\As recently as last month, Gwinnett County Commission Chair Charlotte Nash cautioned against even mentioning transit in the discussion over how to solve the state's transportation challenges.\""I think making the conversation about this too much about transit is going to doom the entire thing from a statewide perspective,"" Nash said. ""Count the votes. Where is that an issue?""\Now, though, key legislative posts are increasingly filled by suburban Republicans. Business groups are crying out for mass transit as a way to funnel employees past congestion and entice new recruits. Firms like State Farm and Mercedes are deliberately moving near MARTA stations.\Everybody seems eager to woo millennials, the young, tech-savvy demographic increasingly drawn to transit-friendly environments, and decreasingly drawn to Georgia.\""When I moved to Alpharetta 22 years ago, everyone was against mass transit,"" said state Sen. Brandon Beach, R-Alpharetta. ""Now I'm hearing constituents who want bus, rail --- they want the opportunity to get from Point A to Point B in an efficient manner.""\Counting votes\Perhaps most importantly, Republicans cannot count on their entire caucus to get behind the all-important roads package, because the most conservative members won't countenance any tax increase at all. So GOP leaders will have to deal with Democrats. And Democrats want transit.\The Democratic caucus is still trying to determine what type of mass transit commitment it will demand, said state Rep. Calvin Smyre of Columbus, a veteran lawmaker who is trying to hammer out a consensus between factions within his party.\""Transit has to be in the mix. And it's critical that Georgia increase its financial commitment to MARTA,"" said Smyre. ""To what extent, we're not sure yet.""\Even with so much still unanswered, it's clear that the ship is laboriously changing course. In speaking recently about the future of transit, Republican Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle invoked the resurrection of Grady Memorial Hospital, which went from the brink of collapse to fiscal stability. Similarly, MARTA's improved financial performance has encouraged Republicans, he said.\""We cannot avoid the issue of transit,"" Cagle told an Athens crowd at a transportation conference. ""I believe very strongly that we have an infrastructure that exists with MARTA that can be capitalized on.""\Mass transit costs vary widely, depending on what you want to build, buy and run\> A county bus system: Cobb Community Transit costs about $19 million annually and brings in $5.5 million in fares.\> A major new rail line: Estimates to extend MARTA along eastern I-20 are $1.4 billion to build it, and more to run it.\> Borrowing to build: Costs vary with time and conditions, but for each $1 million annual income, MARTA may borrow $12 million to repay over perhaps 30 years.\> Call center: The T-SPLOST project list included $17 million over 10 years to establish a regional Atlanta center the elderly or disabled could use for cross-border trips to doctors and other destinations.\Sources: CCT, ARC, MARTA, TIA Atlanta Roundtable\Credit: STAFF"
148,"Because of space limitations, the names of 17 people could not be included in the Byline field. Please check the Text field for them.\ ""Managed lanes"" are lanes of traffic for which use is restricted in some way. For example, a toll may be charged, or the lanes may be limited to use by trucks or car pools, or a combination.\ The Georgia Department of Transportation favors such lanes as a way to create long-term, free-flowing capacity on interstates and freeways, rather than simply building new general-purpose lanes that could clog up as the metro area grows. With ""managed lanes,"" when congestion increases, the state can further restrict the lane to keep more drivers out, perhaps by raising the toll or increasing the number of passengers required for a car pool.\ AJC Gwinnett Opinions asked members of our Voice of Gwinnett panel: What do you think of the idea of ""managed lanes""? Would you pay a toll or join a car pool so that you could take advantage of such lanes?\ Here are some of the responses:\ If I could be assured swift passage through the traffic, I would certainly be willing to pay a toll. However, with the ever- increasing population and at least two cars per household, I really don't know if this will lessen the swell. I notice singularly occupied cars in the HOV lanes all the time.\ I just have too much to do after work and a varied schedule, so car pooling would not work for me; although I wish it would. What a joy it could be to just sit back and relax as the designated driver braves the morning creepers and road-raged drivers on our journey to and from work. That would give the term ""rush hour"" a whole new meaning.\ CRYSTAL OLIVER\ Lawrenceville\ Atlanta was built on the premise of cheap gasoline: Work downtown and drive home to the suburbs. I see people commuting to work driving trucks, SUVs and large cars with V-8 and V-6 engines. No one is willing to give up their ""ride.""\ The metropolitan area, however, in no way offers encouragement toward mass transit; there is none! MARTA does not go far enough out and in my opinion is not safe enough. The first step is to fix MARTA and run it from Athens to Douglasville and Gainesville to Peachtree City and all other major cities in the area. I don't think anyone has the political guts to do that anytime soon, so it is simply not going to happen until gasoline becomes $10 a gallon, and the Atlanta economy is in the empty fuel tank.\ The car pool lanes are a joke. Almost no one uses them because we would rather drive in our ""one-to-a-vehicle"" cars and trucks. Open these lanes up to cars like hybrids or other cars that the EPA certifies to get over 35 mpg, or, of course, regular gas guzzlers with two people in the car. What a sad state of affairs to see a Hummer cruising by with two people in it in the car pool lane while a hybrid sits stuck in traffic in the non-car-pool lane.\ Use the gasoline tax for transportation and not just roads. Build more bicycle lanes, build more sidewalks to walk on, buy smaller, more fuel-efficient buses and run them more often to encourage use.\ There is no magic to transforming one of the most auto-centric economies in the country to a long-term sustainable economy that would thrive with $5 per gallon gasoline, it just takes political guts. Do we have any here?\ MIKE FLORES\ Grayson\ I don't see the benefit. Managed lanes sound good in theory but you're catering to a specific pool of drivers or type of vehicle (depending on the regulations the state adopts), and chances are that pool would be a very small percentage of the drivers/vehicles that use that road. How is that an improvement on congestion?\ There are only two viable options for Gwinnett: Develop a real mass transit system (and I do not mean MARTA --- that system is a joke), and put growth limit laws into effect.\ BRIAN RIEMAN\ Norcross/Doraville\ I think that rather than make more ""managed"" lanes, they should try to manage a major mass transit system (metro Atlanta and metro counties with one system) to cut down on traffic, congestion, pollution and stress. Make it accessible with routes on major roadways, not crazy side streets, and of course, timely --- every 10- 15 minutes, not every 20 or 30.\ MICHELLE A. MUNOZ\ Lawrenceville\ If tax money is used to build ""managed lanes"" and then the payer of that tax is not allowed to drive upon those lanes, I believe that this is a misuse of tax monies.\ SCOTT HESPRICH\ Grayson\ Yes, I favor the managed lanes as a way to help manage our terrible traffic in Gwinnett. I like the adjustability of it.\ For the long term, I favor attaching a rail service to MARTA, but these managed lanes are something that's more immediate and shouldn't cost a lot of money.\ ROBERT CARROLL\ Lawrenceville\ I am not a big fan of the managed lanes. In my opinion, they reduce capacity since they take up just as much space but contain fewer vehicles.\ In addition, I have noticed since they were installed on I-85 that they create more issues (traffic slow downs and sometimes accidents) either when vehicles fail to obey the law about crossing the double white lines or when vehicles in the HOV lanes wait until their exit to leave the lane. By not planning ahead, they expect everyone to slow down or even stop to let them over to get to their exit on the far right of the highway.\ I believe we would move more vehicles per hour with less accidents by converting the HOV lanes to normal lanes.\ KEN WATKINS\ Lawrenceville/Collins Hill\ The concept of managed lanes is probably the best long-term solution to the traffic situation in the metro area. However, for it to work, there must be two lanes devoted to trucks and buses and one expensive toll lane for cars and one free lane for HOV (three or more occupants per vehicle) in addition to three regular lanes. Then there must be guaranteed electronic enforcement with significant fines for registered owners of vehicles that violate the law.\ PATRICK MALONE\ Snellville\ Managed lanes are fine when built in addition to existing lanes. I am not in favor of the proposed changing of the rules for existing HOV lanes requiring two or more riders to be allowed to use HOV lanes that up until now had been designated for use for one or more riders.\ Building Truck Only Toll lanes should be public policy. Traffic would improve greatly if we just got slow-moving trucks off the roads. While the trucks move slowly because of safety concerns in heavy traffic, they add to slow-moving traffic issues during heavy traffic times of day.\ Additionally, freight moving long distances should be going via rail, as this is a more efficient use of energy and thus cost savings to the consumers in these days of high fuel costs. By creating TOT lanes we help freight companies make the proper choice to send shipments via the most cost-effective method. Eventually, as the companies start making the cost-effective choice, capacity will open up on the TOT lanes so additional non-truck traffic would be able to use these lanes.\ I would use toll lanes or join a car pool if the start and ending locations made sense and there was time savings involved.\ ART SHELDON\ Duluth\ I'm in favor of the managed lanes as I do believe it does help, as the current car pool lane has shown.\ Atlantans as a whole, however, need more schooling on the difference between a car pool lane and the fast lane. There could also be more education provided on when you can enter and exit from the car pool lane.\ As far as being able to use it as a single driver for a fee, I think that is absurd. That's like the fast pass at amusement parks. Only those who have expendable cash can afford to do that, and that is what the ""luxury"" lane would be as well. Use the lane for trucks, buses, car pools and motorcycles, period. And enforce it!\ LAURIE SMITH\ Lilburn\ I think having a lane for car pooling is a complete waste. Many people do not car pool or take advantage of using the lane for such. Therefore, our roads are completely jammed and that car pooling lane is hardly used. I think the lane for car pooling should be eliminated.\ I do know that we have to do something about the traffic here in Gwinnett and all the surrounding counties but no one seems to want to take charge and make it happen.\ REGINA AMBROSE\ Lawrenceville\ I now live in Dallas, Ga., and work in Midtown. I agree with the use and addition of managed lanes.\ When I lived in Gwinnett County I car pooled to make use of the HOV lane on I-85. There needs to be more managed lanes, especially on I-20.\ Trucks should only be able to use the far right lane. Having them in all but the far left lane creates a lot of traffic backups because they cannot get up to speed, especially in stop-and-go traffic. Also, I believe many accidents occur because of cars trying to get around these trucks. I don't think adding or increasing tolls would help ease the congestion very much.\ MICHELE YAGER\ Dallas, previously of Gwinnett\ No. I do not favor paying a toll or participating in a car pool. My work schedule varies too much.\ The dishonest and arrogant behavior of the Georgia Department of Transportation of continuing to propose roads of any sort vs. increased emphasis on other modes of transportation is disgusting.\ I sometimes catch the train at the Doraville station. When I arrive shortly after 7:30 a.m., the lot and the deck is nearly full. All of the tags indicate ""Gwinnett"" County. Who are these people and where are they coming from? Might they also make use of lots and decks that are farther up in Gwinnett County, when/if the MARTA line is extended?\ BESSIE SHAVERS\ Norcross\ Yes, I definitely support managed lanes, and I would be willing to pay a toll to use an express lane (I support car pooling and would love if I could actually take advantage of it).\ However, I am curious as to why a pregnant woman cannot use the HOV lane, but a parent with an infant or young child can use it? One would think that the purpose of a car pool lane would be to reduce the number of cars on the road, by having ""drivers"" ride in the same car.\ JABRIL ALEXANDER\ Tucker\ I think ""managed lanes"" are a very bad idea. This is an instance of using taxpayer money to discriminate.\ I have no alternatives but to drive to work in my own car; my hours and location make the current public transportation system and car pooling impossible. I do not want my tax dollars going to lanes that I am not allowed to use. Take that money and create a mass transit system that makes sense for people.\ The only way I would support managed lanes would be if they were set up for the big trucks and buses. Getting them out of the way would help people commute and would probably cut down on accidents.\ Otherwise, no, I am totally opposed.\ KATHY DUNN\ Norcross\ No managed lanes. The Atlanta-area police can't seem to enforce their use, and Atlanta-area drivers are too self-centered and impatient and entitled not to cheat. They cannot seem to use those lanes properly --- just as the HOV lanes now are used so often by solo drivers going 80 mph.\ The only answer for the Atlanta area (at least the main five- county metro area) is more MARTA ---rail, not bus --- that spirals out from Five Points like a spider web, and has five or six intermediate ""rings"" to encircle the city at different distances from city center. That means the pathetic metro counties where people are afraid of MARTA, unless they want to go to the Dome or Turner Field, would have to ""get over"" their anti-MARTA phobia.\ Raise state and county taxes. Get over it. It has to be done.\ TERRY WOOD\ Lawrenceville\ I would pay a toll if it was tax-deductible. However, I would not be in favor of limited-use lanes.\ MARQUES ADAMS\ Snellville\ We have reversible lanes in Snellville, and they don't work, so why would ""managed lanes"" work when all they are is a fancy way to create revenue.\ Like those stupid cameras at the intersections. To fight them, you have to take off work and spend a day waiting your turn. I don't know about you but my time is worth more than $70 a day, which is what the ticket costs. The cities know this and are counting on you not to fight it.\ Who is going to pay the people to manage the managed lanes and make sure people are following the rules? Although I have no suggestions for the traffic in Atlanta (I live and work in Gwinnett), I can't imagine a lane causing that much of a difference! Has anyone looked at the other big cities to see what they have done to help their traffic??\ CYNDI DAVIS\ Snellville\ Adding managed lanes to the structure to control traffic flow is not a good solution. Putting those type of rules into the existing traffic flow will only serve to induce confusion that will eventually create more clogging on our limited lanes of traffic.\ In case the planners did not understand the problem, the population is growing in all areas of metro Atlanta. In traditional thinking, there are only two solutions possible, you either stop the population growth, which is not happening, or you add more lanes for the traffic to flow. To add more lanes, we need to look at moving lanes above ground and creating one-way traffic flows.\ There is another possibility that I purposely failed to mention that is perhaps a more workable solution, and that is to create a mass transit system that works.\ We need to be able to shift the paradigm of motion from one of an independent state to one of dependent state. What I mean by that is we are very independent in our need to move from point A to point B. As we move from point A, we often add a point C, D, E, F, or more. We need dependent travel options that offer flexibility and diversity in destination possibilities or stops so that it becomes an equal or better alternative than the independent modes of travel.\ Such a mass transit system, which I have already dubbed MAITS for ""Metro-Atlanta Integrity Transport System"" would be energy- efficient, using solar and other alternative means for motion, safe to the environment and appreciated by its ridership due to its impeccable record of being on time every time and versatile in range and destinations. The result will not limit the population, but shift some of it out of the traffic lanes and into a motion domain that is flexible, affordable, efficient and effective.\ To solve a transportation problem in an environment where traditional thinking is clogging the breakthrough, similar to how the increasing traffic is clogging lanes on our expressways, there needs to be a commission established to look at creative mass transit possibilities outside of the apparent traditional mode of thinking.\ KARL BRYANT\ Lawrenceville\ I support them when they are strictly for the purpose of reducing car count (increased passenger load) or supporting the Clean Air Act by the use of cars with low emissions, i.e. hybrids or biofuels.\ If a traffic engineer could figure out a way to make a trucks- only lane work, that may have value in terms of speeding up the flow of traffic.\ I would not support trucks (tractor-trailers) and passenger cars mixing in a ""managed lane.""\ I am vehemently opposed to the use of tolls because roads are already taxpayer supported by both income tax and gas tax. Citizens who have already paid to have the road built are being prohibited from using them and deriving no benefit from them. Paying an additional fee to use them would benefit only those who can afford to pay it and not encourage development of sustainability. To put it another way, it is a shortsighted solution that only benefits a few rather than a solution which contributes to everyone's long-term welfare. There is a limit to how many cars can fit on a road, and charging a toll does nothing to solve that problem.\ Personally, I would consider joining a car pool if I could find one that went to the same location as I need to go (Lawrenceville to Buckhead) and whose members worked the hours I need. I have not found that doable as I frequently work long hours.\ And, although you didn't ask this, I strongly support rapid transit, preferably light rail. I would love to see MARTA extended to Gwinnett Place mall, Discover Mills and/or the Mall of Georgia, as well as a train to Athens that would connect with MARTA at Lawrenceville.\ If MARTA was available to me, I would use it on a regular but not daily basis, despite having to walk a mile to the nearest station in Buckhead. This would be our best option to reduce the volume of traffic.\ CHARLOTTE ALLEN\ Lawrenceville\ Managed roads? That's a joke.\ The money they collect would be taken out of the fund set up for repairs, just like they did with the funds for Ga. 400. They cannot be trusted.\ The cars are already here --- managed lanes won't help the congestion at all.\ The HOV lane is a joke, a third of the cars that use it are single users. I have been driving downtown since HOV was put in and I have yet to see the law enforced. ... I also sort of thought when HOV was approved it was meant for more than one licensed driver so that we could keep more single drivers off the road. We have too many soccer moms blocking drivers in the HOV lane.\ If they want people to get out of their cars, they need to make it so people can get from their homes in a timely manner. I live 27 miles from downtown. If I drive, it takes me between 30 and 40 minutes. I work at the civic center area. If I ride our transportation system, it takes me 1 1/2 hours-plus.\ So it takes me now 80 minutes a day travel time to drive to work, while riding the transportation system it takes a minimum of 180 minutes. That means I lose 100 minutes of time with my family. That equals out to 8.3 hours per work week. That in my mind is a negative factor to not driving myself.\ If we can get public transportation where it supports itself and can get us to our work places within 10 minutes of our drive time, people would ride it. Managed lanes will not accomplish this, just as HOV has not really worked.\ BILL WRIGHT II\ Lilburn\ I don't think restricting the use of certain lanes on interstates or freeways will do much to help traffic congestion. Traffic is so heavy that I feel the one and only solution is for business and government to go to telecommuting. By having people stay at home and work, traffic will be reduced, and much less gasoline will be consumed.\ I live in Lilburn and work near Roswell. My hours are not set, so car pooling wouldn't work, and public transit could not get me to and from work in a timely manner.\ Car pooling might work with government workers who have set hours, but would not work for others.\ JOEL ARMISTEAD\ Lilburn\ I drive 52 miles each way to work on I-85. Car pooling with fellow workers is just not easy anymore --- our workloads are all so different with last-minute projects coming up often that can easily extend the workday. And then, how does the other rider get home?\ The workplace has changed, and employee productivity is way up. As a result of this new dynamic, demanding workplace, nobody leaves work at the same time anymore.\ Also, with so many sickos out there hacking and kidnapping, I don't want to share my car with anyone I don't know very, very well. That really cuts down on people available with whom to car pool.\ Car pooling is a folly, an idealistic dream. We need to come up with real solutions for the way people really drive today. Toll lanes for commuters will make the state money, but it will do nothing. I would pay any cost to get into the commuter lane --- as would everyone else, and then there is no advantage to the lane.\ Mandatory toll truck lanes --- that is the way to go!\ J.B. BREWWER\ Suwanee\ I like the idea of managed lanes --- anything to improve traffic flow and car pooling would be welcome.\ I would be willing to pay a toll or car pool to be in a managed lane.\ JUDITH TAYLOR\ Duluth\ I was born in the land of toll roads (New Jersey). HOV lanes never worked there, and whatever you would like to call them, they will not work here.\ I moved here the first time in 1974 --- pre-Spaghetti Junction. I also lived in California --- guess I must have this thing for high occupancy traffic states --- where there is marginal improvement in their lanes if you realize that in five minutes, it will be a parking lot no matter what you do. It's usually just a phenomenon -- - no reason for it at all.\ Atlanta needs to get serious soon and realize that an Outer Perimeter will help alleviate some of the traffic considerably if everyone would just get over the NIMN (not in my neighborhood) mentality. ...\ Do what's right for the state, counties and tourism. Let's do something positive.\ The state government will never make everyone happy, no matter what you do, but it's time for Atlanta to stop being a joke with reference to our traffic problems.\ BARBARA LIGHT\ Hamilton Mill/Dacula\ I am not in favor of the managed lanes, mainly because I am not familiar with how they work.\ Would I pay a premium to use a managed lane as a single occupant in a vehicle and get to work in the 35 minutes that it should take to travel 35 miles, vs. the 65 to 90 minutes it usually takes?\ How much? Fifty cents? One dollar? What cities are using the managed lanes now? Are they anywhere near as sprawled out as metro Atlanta?\ Since my work schedule is always in flux, I am a horrible candidate for a car pool. The commuter bus is my best option, and I watched the last bus leave without me this morning after I sat in uncommon traffic from my home to the bus park-and-ride.\ Looks like I am changing my mind about managed lanes.\ REGINA ROBERTS\ Lawrenceville\ No, I do not support ""managed traffic lanes."" I would not pay any additional money to use roads or lanes that were built using my tax money already.\ I view the Georgia DOT with a skeptical and jaded eye as a group of ""good ol' boys"" who like to lay asphalt. (Probably infiltrated by a pack of ""ol' Dawgs"" who can't or won't learn any new tricks and a hive of a few ""Yella Jackets"" that got stung themselves for suggesting transit technology too complicated for the Dawgs to figure out).\ More revenue, less disruption, smoother flow of traffic --- all just another ploy to distract the driving public and put off recognizing the inevitable.\ To become a truly international city, the Atlanta Metropolitan Statistical Area (25 counties) needs an international city quality transportation infrastructure that includes an integrated, coordinated and affordable bus transit system and rapid rail connections to the farthest suburbs. We do not need a system that costs 10 percent of a person's minimum wage paycheck to be able to ride it to work.\ The Atlanta MSA also needs to have a more pedestrian/bicycle- friendly mind-set with sidewalks, major and secondary roads and feeder streets wide enough to permit lane set-asides for bikes. As well, in line with other major U.S. cities and overseas major metro areas, Georgia needs to subsidize the Metropolitan Area Rapid Transportation Authority system. Change the law that restricts gasoline taxes and road taxes to permit it to be used for rail and bus service and infrastructure.\ LOU NELSON\ Stone Mountain, Gwinnett County\ Once again, we plan to provide services that benefit the wealthier members of our community.\ Why not have one lane for two or more passengers, another lane for three or more, and allow trucks (18-wheelers) to use only two lanes? On a seven-lane road, this would leave three lanes for one- passenger cars and would encourage car pooling. Additionally, the HOV lanes should be required from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Monday to Friday only.\ BOB BERLON\ Buford\ You reported that with ""managed lanes,"" when congestion increases, the state can further restrict the lane to keep more drivers out (perhaps by raising the toll or increasing the number of passengers required for a car pool).\ I like the concept of managed lanes, but not how the state currently defines the long-term future of these lanes. As need increases for the lane, I get kicked out into the slow lanes for some other yahoo just because I do not meet some moving target of a criteria. Fooey!\ I think there has to be enough long-term planning that the state knows how to expand the lanes as demand increases. (Big hint to the state: Keep the customers happy, keep the customer base growing, not keep the customer guessing if he is in or out every morning.)\ My schedule does not adapt to car pooling, but I do not mind spending for tolls. I spend a lot of the year in the Orlando area, and they have more toll roads to avoid the free expressway I-4. People gripe, but love the openness of using the toll roads!\ GARY VON BEHREN\ Lawrenceville\ I was born and raised in metropolitan New York. I have been in Atlanta for 36 years. Managed lanes are a joke!\ From what I understand, there is only one person on the Atlanta Regional Commission who takes MARTA or car pools.\ The ARC is a lip-service joke! The ideas from the DOT are a joke. DOT stands for ""Delusions of Transportation""!\ Until you take all the cars out of the peoples' hands, like we did during the '96 Olympics by closing down all the downtown exit ramps during rush hour, nothing will ever improve our metro traffic flow. Unless truly functional mass transit becomes a reality for everyone in Atlanta, traffic congestion will only get worse. ...\ If a fee is charged to use the HOV lane, everyone --- thinking that you will get places faster --- will be trying to use that one lane. That will be good for me, because I will then be able to use the other four empty lanes for free!\ BILL RUBIN\ Suwanee\ I cannot join a car pool because of my hours, and I cannot afford to pay for the privilege of driving on an unclogged road --- somehow that would seem to be something along the lines of discrimination. More affluent folks could afford the extra money, but not someone of lesser means.\ Is it right for the government to do that on public access --- not to charge tolls, but to charge them with the idea of keeping those who cannot pay off those lanes of the road?\ DIANE M. CASEY\ Lawrenceville\ This does not seem a solution in that the traffic will be just as crowded, even more, in the other lanes. We need something to improve everyone's life, not just a select few.\ DICK CLANCY\ Suwanee\ I would pay a toll or join a car pool to lessen my traffic experience. The traffic coming northbound to Gwinnett, Cobb or Fulton counties all are such parking lots. We need to limit cars --- and trucks --- in the lanes. It's taking forever to get anyplace --- not to mention the many accidents we have due to congestion. Buses and trucks --- tractor-trailers --- will pass cars and go under the speed limit or speed, causing havoc --- especially during rush hours, which now last all day.\ You cannot go anyplace without having a long line of traffic. A fee for a toll is nothing if you get where you are going on time, since we all know time is money, so this move would be money well spent.\ PHYLLIS R. CHAMBERS\ Lilburn\ Yes, I'm all for managed lanes. I'm from Chicago where the expressways are divided into local and express lanes.\ This is an excellent way of keeping a steady flow of traffic.\ MELANIE WINSTON\ Buford\ LEND YOUR VOICE\ The Voice of Gwinnett is a panel of Gwinnett residents who answer online questionnaires on various topics.

149,"ENVIRONMENT\Hamilton's death a loss to cause of conservation\The sudden death on Feb. 20 of Sam Hamilton, director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and former head of the service's Southeast Region in Atlanta, is a great loss to the cause of conservation.\I worked with Sam for several years. He was passionate about protecting and managing habitat for fish and wildlife, and had a unique ability to get important and tangible conservation projects accomplished.\A key to his success was his enthusiasm for working with widely different interests to find common ground. In Sam's case, it was the key to his leaving a remarkable and lasting legacy of exceptional natural areas conserved forever, and of strong and constructive relationships among people who, without Sam, would never have worked together.\Sam had great promise. All of us at The Nature Conservancy are profoundly saddened that his tenure was cut short. It is up to us and other organizations dedicated to habitat conservation to carry on in Sam's positive spirit --- to value our beautiful wetlands, rivers, forests and beaches and to be good stewards of our heritage of fish and wildlife for the benefit of this, and future generations.\Bob Bendick, The Nature Conservancy\HEALTH\Families need health coverage they can afford\""Georgians hit by hikes for health insurance"" (Metro, Feb. 24) says Georgia provides less oversight for individual health insurance policies than other states, and has no mechanism for providing coverage for chronic medical problems. These problems include heart disease and stroke, the No. 1 and No. 3 killers of Georgians, and the largest slice of the pie for health care costs in the U.S.\The biggest barrier to affordable coverage for most Americans is their monthly premium. Too many people with heart disease and stroke, including children born with congenital heart defects, either cannot purchase or simply cannot afford the premiums insurance companies charge for care.\The American Heart Association supports meaningful health care reform that offers affordable, adequate care. Simply providing people access to an insurance plan is meaningless if families can't afford the premiums and the policy doesn't cover the care they need. M. Ballasiotes, Evans\TRANSPORTATION\Update 'user fee' to pay for better highways\Regarding ""A transit solution: Raise the gas tax"" (Opinion, Feb. 23): having some 20 years on C. Shiflett, I can remember an older joke in the Southeast --- Georgia did not need a state line sign or speed limits because of their numerous potholes. My generation chose to pay the freight, repair, build and rebuild. Being 49th now is a crying shame.\Ignoring the mass transit, anti-road venters, I strongly agree with putting more money into our roads. Understanding current Republican semantics, we need to increase our road ""user fee"" --- preferably on a cost-per-gallon basis to at least the national average. This would more correctly reflect current construction costs, and encourage benefits of more fuel-efficient vehicles.\Palmer Fletcher, Dawsonville\Credit: FOR THE JOURNAL-CONSTITUTION"
150,"A bill to free the state Department of Transportation from water pollution fines expanded Wednesday, adding a proposal that allows Georgia to use the Tennessee River as a water source for metro Atlanta.\House Bill 131 still gives a huge break to DOT, leaving the agency responsible only for a tenth of the penalties it now faces, and only after a 30-day reprieve to fix a problem.\But a last-minute amendment also makes any transfers out of the Chickamauga Valley and Lookout Mountain areas exempt from restrictions or regulations on interbasin transfers.\""It became an interbasin transfer bill,"" said Donna Sheldon, R-Dacula, one of six lawmakers on the House Transportation Committee who voted against advancing the proposal for consideration of a full chamber vote. ""I'm not quite sure how that relates to GDOT.""\Tom McCall, chairman of the House Agriculture and Consumer Affairs Committee, succeeded in getting his amendment attached and the bill passed. The amendment reads exactly as Senate Bill 132, which on Wednesday moved out of the Senate Natural Resources and Environment committee. He argued the issue was related to transportation.\""Haven't you ever heard the solution to pollution is dilution?"" McCall, R-Elberton, said in reference to pulling more water out of the basin.\The change shares state code with the original purpose of the bill and little else.\Sponsor Bubber Epps, R-DryBranch, initially wanted DOT to be exempt from hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines for polluting Georgia's waterways with its projects. The department is the state's largest polluter, racking up $2 million in fines in the past decade.\The agency paid $800,000 of the fines, and contractors on the projects settled the rest.\Epps agreed to changes that drop daily fines from $50,000 to $5,000 after including language that gives the agency seven days' notice of a problem. The agency and its contractors would have a month to fix the problems before the Environmental Protection Division can fine either DOT or any of its contractors.\Opponents, ranging from environmental groups to EPD Director Allen Barnes, warned that reductions will lead to more problems and make water quality worse. The changes, no longer requiring separate plans for erosion control, will be especially harmful for downstream properties, they said.\""Take a look at the price of some of these big projects, and $5,000 a day in fines becomes the cost of doing business,"" said Kevin McGrath with Georgia Trout Unlimited. ""I just don't think that's right.""\Epps said current fines hamper the department's ability to do roadwork throughout the state. He also has argued against allowing the department to pay fines with money from the state's gas tax, which is designated only for roadwork.\That argument, and the interbasin tangent, head to the House Rules Committee for more debate and questions.\Credit: STAFF"

Eugene Callaway, the stealth candidate for House District 81, made a tough sales call last week. Callaway attended the Republican Advance --- the state GOP's more positive approach to holding a retreat --- on Jekyll Island last weekend. John Dunn, second vice chairman of the Gwinnett GOP, spotted Callaway and spent a half hour getting to know him. ""He's green politically,"" said Dunn. ""But after meeting him I can say he's a fiscal conservative and social conservative. I hope he will get more involved with the party, since he is the nominee."" How Callaway became the uncontested Republican candidate for District 81 has had county politicos buzzing all month. State Rep. Ralph Johnston handpicked Callaway and then worked to install him in office without opposition. So how did Johnston meet Callaway, a political unknown?
\
""It was Linda Carsten, I think, who introduced us,"" said Johnston. ""I asked a lot of people to find a candidate, but I think it was her."" Carsten, wife of former county sheriff Jim Carsten, has worked with Johnston for six years. She ran two of his three election campaigns and served as his legislative aide. Johnston has urged Callaway to hire Linda Carsten if he is elected. ""She has six years of experience and a lot of energy,"" said Johnston. Callaway keeps in touch with the Carstens, calling them for political advice. Jim Carsten is advising Republican gubernatorial candidate Guy Millner on crime and prison issues. Callaway said he would not make staffing decisions until December. Two residents named to Libertarian slate The 900-member Libertarian Party of Georgia nominated two Gwinnett residents to the party's candidate slate. Michael Cartwright, a Shiloh High School teacher, was selected as a candidate for state school superintendent, and Duluth resident Allen Stewart was chosen as a candidate for House District 81. She's not counting on developers' backing
\
It was a bit of surprise when Mary Squires got a letter from the Council for Quality Growth. She's one of two Democrats vying to challenge State Rep. Ron Crews (R-Tucker) to represent House District 78. The council sent her a questionnaire about her positions on issues ranging from water protection to the state using the gas tax for purposes other than road-building. She's not optimistic about getting the development group's endorsement. ""I feel strongly about protecting the environment,"" said Squires. ""I don't think they would like my answers."" Democrats court bucks even if votes elusive Gwinnett may vote Republican, but the county remains a major campaign fund-raising stop for Democrats. A get-together for Roy Barnes, a Democratic gubernatorial hopeful, was held Tuesday in Shakerag community on the north Fulton side of the Chattahoochee River. The fund-raiser was sponsored by influential lawyer Rick Chandler and real estate developer Wayne Mason, who did not attend. Mason's brother, Jimmy Mason, was being flown out of Sao Paulo, Brazil, where he had fallen ill. Jimmy Mason arrived at Gwinnett County Airport/Briscoe Field on Wednesday morning and was taken to the intensive care unit at Gwinnett Medical Center in Lawrenceville.

152,"Rail legislation good for U.S.\The state of our economy and what to do about it is a primary subject discussed by both presidential candidates. But neither Barack Obama nor John McCain has paid serious attention to our jammed and wreckage-prone land transportation systems.\Legislation [to be] jointly proposed by U.S. Sens. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) and John Kerry (D-Mass.), representing both sides of the aisle, calls for extensive fast electric rail tracking between the Northeast and the South (""Isakson puts his street cred on the rails,"" Metro, Sept. 8).\The Isakson-Kerry venture is a significant example of sensible legislation on behalf of our country too often ill-served by its leadership.\WARD PAFFORD\Decatur\Give more to transit, less to roads\On Wednesday, the Federal Highway Trust Fund got a bailout of $8 billion from the federal government's general fund. Why the deficit? The trust fund is supplied with money from a gas tax. With high gas prices and congestion, people are driving less while the cost of new highway projects increases. What I'm left wondering is why we are increasing the supply of highways when the demand for driving is falling. New highways and roads alleviate some congestion, but they don't lower the cost of gas, price of insurance, or the impact driving has on our environment. The trust fund allocates about 80 percent of its money to highway, road and bridge projects. Only about 20 percent goes toward transit projects. At a time when people are looking to drive less, why are we spending their money on more roads and not more options?\ADRIENNE TECZA\Tecza is the transportation associate with the Georgia Public Interest Research Group, which advocates on behalf of citizens.\Connect headlines to reveal troubled nation\In today's 24/7 news cycle it is difficult for the average reader to connect the dots between related items. However I thought I would try on Thursday, which was the seventh anniversary of 9/11.\Between the front page and business section, I found seven articles that exemplify the difficult times we are in and the lack of leadership that will be required to get us out:\DeKalb County students may lose busing because of rising fuel costs, among other reasons (""5,600 may lose bus service,"" Page One); ""Georgia No. 3 in late home loans"" (Page One); big oil companies linked to bribery with Department of Interior officials (""Graft alleged in feds' ties with big oil,"" News); FEMA shells out billions in no-bid contracts without any oversight (""New audit faults FEMA contracts,"" News); ""Study says speculators caused surge in oil prices,"" (Business); ""Afghan war getting tougher, Pentagon says,"" (News); ""Obama calls McCain ads false outrage,"" (News); and ""Habitat founder rips greed,"" (News).\My attempt to sew these stories together: Our society continues to place wants above needs. This greed corrupts our free-market system and encourages poor decision-making from the working-class homebuyer to the CEO of the biggest companies.\Government intervenes, attempting to stanch the bleeding, resulting in short-term relief but actually making things worse. The only viable political parties bicker like children avoiding meaningful debate and are goaded on this path by the media.\Clearly our system is not operating as designed.

153,"METRO FINAL TODAY'S NEWS This article appeared in both The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta Constitution.\Spreading money throughout America, the Senate approved a $214 billion transportation bill Thursday that will finance everything from subways and superhighways to ferry boats and covered bridges and bring tens of thousands of jobs to communities across the country. The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, or ISTEA passed 96-4, and now goes to the House. Highway proponents and balanced-budget hawks remain deadlocked there over a proposal by Transportation Committee Chairman Bud Shuster (R-Pa.) to spend more than the Senate for transportation projects.\The giant bill also would crack down on drunken driving and preserve a program helping women and minorities win government construction contracts.\The amount of transportation funding for Georgia totals more than $884 million over six years, a 66 percent increase over what the Peach State had at its disposal between 1992 and last year. The proposed increase would bring Georgia's highway funding much closer to what its motorists pay in gasoline taxes. The bill guarantees so-called ""donor"" states at least 91 percent of what their drivers pay into the federal highway trust fund. Under the last six-year bill, Georgia got back only 74 cents for every $1 of gas taxes paid into the trust fund. Authorization levels for Georgia under the bill, according to the office of Sen. Max Cleland (D-Ga.), are: $390.3 million for the National Highway System. $278.9 million for the Surface Transportation Program. $22.1 million for Congestion Mitigation Air Quality. $4.4 million for Metro Planning. $49.7 million for ISTEA Transition. $138.9 million for Minumum Guarantee. It took two weeks for the Senate to hammer out the final version of the 800-page bill, as lawmakers made sure their states got a fair share of the huge pot and fought for money.\""It really gives a major boost not only to jobs, not only to the environment, but really for quality life across the board,"" said Sen. John Warner (R-Va.), a chief architect of the legislation. ""This was a mountain to climb, and we're at the top."" The only dissenting votes were from Wisconsin's two Democrats, Herbert Kohl and Russ Feingold, and Pennsylvania's two Republicans, Arlen Specter and Rick Santorum. House Republican leaders Thursday reached what Speaker Newt Gingrich said was the ""framework"" for the House version of the bill. Aides said they would go along with a Transportation Committee bill seeking $217 billion, $3 billion more than the Senate. Congress must get the completed bill to President Clinton before May 1, when the current short-term highway spending law expires. In the gallery for the final vote was Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater, who praised the Senate for doing a ""great job."" The legislation carves out $173 billion for highway construction and safety programs through 2003, up 38 percent from the six-year plan that ended last fall. Mass transit would get $41.3 billion, a 31 percent boost. Supporters said the bill could have a major impact on the economy, citing figures that every $1 billion in transportation money creates 42,000 jobs. The increased amount of money authorized reflected both the prospects of future budget surpluses and pressures to do something about the nation's crumbling infrastructure. The new money in part will come from a decision that 4.3 cents of the federal gas tax previously reserved for reducing the budget deficit would go exclusively to transportation needs. Supporters insisted they could stay within budget caps by cutting other programs, though no one specified where those cuts would be made.\Credit: From our news services"

155," A quiet piece of legislation working its way through this General Assembly session could do the most for cleaning up Georgia's rivers and streams.\ H B 285, known as the erosion and sedimentation bill, sets up a two-tiered fee system to help state and local governments pay for training builders and inspecting construction sites. The goal: Keep as much dirt on the project site as possible.\ State officials acknowledge the present system doesn't work. The bill talks about the ""widespread failure"" of construction crews to properly install and maintain erosion controls such as silt fences, hay bales and retention ponds. The result is polluted streams and rivers.\ The bill has widespread support from builders, local and state governments, and environmentalists. It passed the House 166-3, and got a favorable review from the Senate Natural Resources and the Environment committee.\ The bill would:\ > Set up development fees. Developers would pay $80 per disturbed acre where the state runs erosion-control programs and $40 an acre in cities and counties that operate their own programs.\ > Increase inspections and educate construction workers. With the new revenues, estimated at about $5.5 million a year, the state would hire inspectors and train builders, developers, general contractors, site planners and reviewers. For the first time, everyone who works on a construction site would be given the same set of rules. The Georgia Soil & Water Conservation Commission would set up the curriculum.\ > Reduce paperwork. Most developers would still have to apply for two permits to bulldoze at least 1 acre of land, but the land- disturbing permit required by cities and counties that run their own erosion-control programs would nearly mirror the stricter state permit. Also, mandatory state reviews of a development's erosion- control plan would be eliminated.\ > Get tough. Mandatory stop-work orders would replace mandatory fines for violators.\ Contingency plans\ With the Georgia Supreme Court's decision on the legality of $822 million in proposed bonds for transportation projects expected any time, legislators are hard at work on a proposal to keep some projects on track if the ruling goes against the state.\ A House appropriations subcommittee has voted to approve a proposal for $790 million in ""blended-revenue bonds"" that would be used to replace the court-challenged funding.\ Unlike the challenged so-called Garvee bonds, the blended bonds would use both state and federal gas tax revenue to repay the bond debt. And, more significantly, the bonds would have the blessing of the General Assembly.\ Debt service on the bonds would be about $71 million per year for the next 20 years.\ The proposal is accompanied by a list of projects the bonds would keep on schedule toward completion. The list includes almost $300 million for rural highways, $94 million for metro HOV lanes, $29 million for Atlanta's downtown multimodal station, $10 million for commuter rail to Macon, $111 million for regional express bus service and $23 million for pedestrian and other metro Atlanta community improvement districts.\ ""We see this as an economic development tool and a measure that can promote economic development throughout the state,"" said state Rep. Tommy Smith (D-Nicholls), chairman of the subcommittee.\ The proposal is now under consideration by the budget subcommittee, which will decide whether to recommend it to the full appropriations committee next week.\ State Sen. Tommie Williams (R-Lyons), chairman of the Senate Transportation Committee, said he's glad to see an effort to keep transportation funding on track, but stopped short of endorsing the blended bond plan.\ ""For the most part, conceptually I think it's a good idea,"" Williams said. ""But we have to make sure where this $71 million would come from every year.""\ Credit: STAFF"
156,"Georgia's three most powerful state politicians sent a clear signal Tuesday that they will put their clout behind a growing effort to raise new revenue for transportation that could lead to increased taxes or new fees to fund infrastructure projects.\What's lacking is a consensus on how to raise the new funding.\Gov. Nathan Deal, House Speaker David Ralston and Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle all voiced their support for raising funds to maintain and expand the state's system of roads and rails, an endeavor that one state report said would require at least $1 billion in new funds each year.\Ralston and Cagle used remarkably similar phrasing when they told more than 1,000 attendees at the Eggs & Issues breakfast that doing nothing on transportation this year is ""not an option."" And Deal said he wanted to make it ""clear here this morning that I support increasing funding for strategic transportation investments.""\The venue for their remarks was important. The event was sponsored by the Georgia Chamber of Commerce, and corporate forces are outspoken in their support for new revenue. Executives with UPS, Delta Air Lines and other Fortune 500 firms have all expressed support for the change. Georgia Power Chief Executive Paul Bowers said Tuesday that he was heartened to hear that a need for more funding was a theme running through the speeches.\The debate is likely to put a bloc of Republicans, many who campaigned on a platform of fiscal conservatism with a vow not to raise taxes, in an uncomfortable position. Democrats hope to wind up in the driver's seat of the debate if a faction of conservatives revolts, and they hope to push for an influx of transit funding and other priorities in exchange for their support.\The governor, who has previously been largely silent on the issue, said he expects to use a section of his State of the State address today to make a case for why Republicans, particularly those outside of metro Atlanta, should support new ways of raising transportation revenue.\""Things change, and sometimes they change rapidly. We have been in a rapidly changing environment in this state, and fortunately it's been good,"" he said. ""And changing circumstances require that you re-evaluate your stance on the issues.""\Expect the governor to invoke the deepening of Savannah's port to make the case to rural lawmakers to boost infrastructure to handle an expected increase in shipping through Georgia's highways. He also said he would pay particular mind to the plight of Northern Arc commuters between Gwinnett and Cobb counties, an area that has attracted much new development.\The state's leaders are confident they can strike an accord before the session ends in the spring. Deal and his aides have held behind-the-scenes discussions with legislative leaders about forming a unified plan, although none seems to have yet been reached. For now, he said, ""all of it is on the table.""\Likely options include shifting the fourth penny of a motor fuel sales tax back to transportation projects and raising the gas tax. It could be harder to secure support for a statewide sales tax increase, particularly among lawmakers who represent metro areas that have already voted to increase sales taxes to fund MARTA or other local projects. Some want to propose another increase in the cigarette tax to fund the projects.\Cagle, who has previously stressed the need for mass transit funding to be involved in the solution, told the crowd that it's as much about people stuck in traffic for Little League games as it is about far-flung communities that need more access to economic development opportunities.\""Those people are why we can't afford to put the issue on the back burner,"" the Gainesville Republican said.\And Ralston, who comes from the North Georgia town of Blue Ridge, recalled childhood trips that took a full day to reach Atlanta. That trip now takes about 90 minutes thanks to a new state highway, he said, opening up the mountainous region to tourism and jobs. He urged lawmakers to view the debate through a ""long-term lens"" lest Georgia fall behind other states.\""A fixation on the rhetoric of 'no' won't get us to the next level of greatness in Georgia,"" he said. ""Now is not the time for naysaying.""\Transportation funding levels\A report released late last month by a joint legislative committee offered three options to maintain or build on the state's transportation system:\> $1 billion to $1.5 billion per year in new revenue to maintain existing infrastructure.\> $2.1 billion to $2.9 billion per year in new revenue to expand existing programs, including interstate capacity and transit.\> $3.9 billion to $5.4 billion per year in new revenue to meet a ""full universe"" of transportation needs, including passenger rail.\Source: Joint Study Committee on Critical Transportation Infrastructure Funding\Credit: STAFF"
157,"Metro Atlanta's transportation problems have long seemed to mirror traffic here at rush hour(s). Anybody on the roads knows we have issues, and possible fixes can seem even farther away than our final destinations after slow, aggravating daily commutes.\It's heartening that there are some substantial fixes now in the works and others on the planning board that should reduce congestion here over time.\We encourage any productive collaboration and cooperation among the agencies that have a role in helping metro Atlanta move. A growing, prosperous region needs an infrastructure to match.\Among the notable moves on the mobility front was 2015's passage of a gas tax increase that fuels an additional $750 million to $1 billion annually for road and bridge improvements. As the Atlanta Regional Commission noted in an update last week, that resulted in ""effectively doubling the state's transportation budget."" As a result of lawmakers' courage in the face of anti-tax opposition, work is now underway on a variety of road improvements across the region and state.\Progress also continues to extend variable-rate highway toll lanes intended to provide congestion relief. The latest toll project, the I-75 South Metro Express Lanes, opened in January on a 12-mile stretch in Henry County.\A sales tax win last November also creates a stable new funding venue for transportation and transit improvements in the city of Atlanta. Voters in Fulton County also approved their own tax hike last fall for road fixes. Fulton commissioners also voted to help pay for an ARC transit study. In Clayton County, MARTA buses have been rolling since shortly after voters there approved a sales tax measure.\These all point to an increasing commonality of purpose among agencies and jurisdictions. That makes great sense in an area where many people cross boundaries each day in their travels. One big factor that's still an outlier at this point is what's next for state government in supporting the next phases of transportation improvements. Encouraging words were heard from the Gold Dome during a kickoff hearing late last month of the new House Commission on Transit Governance and Funding.\House Speaker David Ralston, R-Blue Ridge, spoke frankly and refreshingly about what should lie ahead. ""Taking bold action requires more than words, it requires action,"" he said.\""There's a great deal of data that tells us that transit must play a role in our transportation planning in the years ahead,"" said Ralston, noting that millennials ""place a premium on having the option to take a bus, a train or a bike to work."" Ditto for many of today's big job creators, we'd add.\Ralston assigned the work of ""undertaking a ""thorough discussion and assessment of transit in Georgia. I further charge this commission to work with stakeholders to recommend ways to integrate transit into this state's transportation future.""\And toward a big point, the Speaker said that, ""your recommendations may also include reasonable state funding to support our transit systems, subject to appropriate controls.""\That's an exciting acknowledgement of a big missing piece. Direct, ongoing state fiscal support for transit would be a long-overdue force multiplier for congestion relief in Georgia. It should come to pass soonest, we believe.\And in words aimed at staving off possible turf squabbles, Ralston added that ""to be clear, I am not of the opinion that the state must wholly control or take over a transit system in order to provide funding. This is not a zero-sum environment. Rather, I encourage you to work with transit operators and local governments to achieve mutually beneficial outcomes.""\He's right. Working collaboratively among agencies and entities will likely yield the best results for taxpayers and commuters alike.\We urge the committee to speedily get after its important work. Done well and with foresight, innovation and courage, Georgia and all its cities stand to greatly benefit from the result.\Credit: Andre Jackson, for the Editorial Board."
158," There they go again, proving their critics right.\ Just over a year ago, the politicians who sit on the Atlanta Regional Commission were desperate to get back to road-building after a two-year federal ban related to air pollution problems. At long last, they thought they had come up with a plan that would pass the required emissions test.\ The 25-year program tried to curb smog-related pollutants in part by providing an array of new options to solo driving, especially to and from work. Computer models indicated it would work. But advocates for the environment and for transportation choices nearly torpedoed the plan. They pointed out to federal officials that, while all the highway projects had earmarked funding, there was no guaranteed money to create and operate buses, trains and other alternatives.\ No problem, said Wayne Hill, chairman of both the Gwinnett County Commission and the ARC. Trust us, echoed Bill Byrne, chairman of the Cobb County Commission and an ARC member. When the time came, they assured the feds, the ARC and other agencies would come through and find the money.\ The federal officials took them at their word and approved the plan. Imagine how chagrined the feds must feel this week after the Hill-Byrne performance at Wednesday's ARC meeting.\ The planning commission had just been presented with details of the enormous bond package Gov. Roy Barnes is proposing to speed up funding of projects in the long-range plan: HOV lanes with express bus service, a rail connection from Midtown to Cobb County, commuter rail to the south, shuttle service in congested edge cities and more.\ Though all the projects came from the ARC plan, Hill and Byrne reacted as though they had never heard of this stuff before. Why, they sputtered, weren't we consulted on this plan? Who, they demanded to know, is going to pay the operating subsidies on these transit services?\ That last is a darn good question, as incisive this year as it was when environmentalists asked it last year. Only now the governor has moved the issue from the realm of vague promises to imminent reality.\ Rather than fuss at Barnes, or he at them, all parties --- the governor, ARC, Georgia Regional Transportation Authority, Department of Transportation and key legislators --- need to sit down and start hammering out clear funding arrangements, with Barnes taking the lead. It's an essential task, and not one likely to be accomplished by finger-pointing.\ Perhaps Byrne believes dissension will be more helpful to his planned gubernatorial race against Barnes. Maybe his advisers are hoping to let Barnes figure out alone how to pay for transit service so they can tar him with criticism that he's ""forcing people to pay for transit they don't want.""\ Such a strategy will backfire, however. After all, Barnes is merely helping Byrne and his ARC compatriots fund the plan that they came up with. And voters will want to know what Byrne plans to do about transportation problems, apart from shoot down other people's attempts to take action.\ Somewhere amid his convoluted bluster, though, Byrne did unearth the kernel of a point Wednesday. The five-year borrowing package is probably too large; the plan is to sell $8.3 billion in bonds for both metro Atlanta projects and rural highways, to be repaid through the state's annual allocation of federal gas tax money. But the troubling result, should the full package be funded, is that six years from now, debt payments could consume nearly all of the annual federal allocation, leaving little for new needs that may arise.\ Of course, it's unlikely all the money will be spent in five years because some of the projects inevitably will hit snags, either temporary or fatal. But the best solution would be to drop one ill- considered, and expensive, project altogether --- the Northern Arc highway.\ Transit funding is a darn good question, as incisive this year as it was when it was asked last year.\ Credit: STAFF"
159,"This is the second in a series of editorials examining statewide issues and how the candidates for governor and the General Assembly in the Nov. 7 general election may respond to them in the next four years.\ While driving to work, a typical Georgia commuter sees, and sometimes ignores, a variety of posted road signs: Stop. Yield. No turn on red.\ But in order for the next governor to begin steering Georgia's lopsided transportation policy in the right direction, he must pay special attention to a different kind of marker: dollar signs.\ As always, money, and how it's spent, will be critical in determining the future of transportation across the state and particularly in metro Atlanta. If we continue operating under the collective delusion that just expanding existing roads, or building new ones, will magically fix our problems, we're guaranteed at least four more years of worsening gridlock.\ Remember, traffic congestion isn't only annoying, it's also expensive. The fast-growing Atlanta region routinely ranks in studies as one of the nation's worst metro areas for road tie-ups, a dubious distinction that costs us more than $2 billion in lost productivity and fuel every year. Relying on familiar but hopelessly outdated road maps will put further strain on our economy and quality of life.\ Adopting a more balanced approach to transportation spending may improve our chances of developing the kind of long-term solutions we need to help save time, money and the environment.\ Next month's elections offer a prime opportunity to start making those changes but, at the moment, the dollar signs don't look good. The 7.5-cents-excise tax that Georgia collects on each gallon of gasoline purchased and the 4 percent sales tax are among the lowest in the nation. By law, all of the excise tax and 75 percent of the sales tax must be spent on roads and bridges, with the rest of the sales tax going into the general fund. That constitutional strait- jacket --- coupled with political cowardice --- has in the past prevented the state from making any significant investments in transportation alternatives, such as commuter rail, buses, trolleys or light rail.\ Those dedicated revenues also cannot be used to help pay for the operating expenses of MARTA or, for that matter, any of the increasingly popular commuter bus lines being run by local governments and the Georgia Regional Transportation Authority.\ The federal funding that launched some bus systems will soon run out. Since the state has no viable plans for replacing those funds, the fate of those lines is in jeopardy. On top of that, fairly recent changes in the formulas used by the federal government to select which states get money to help pay for congestion-relieving initiatives has made competition for those already limited startup funds much more intense.\ While money is important, it's not the only factor that will shape Georgia's transportation outlook. The next governor's leadership on these issues, or the lack of it, will matter just as much. In principle, the governor defers most policy-making to the Georgia Department of Transportation or regional planning agencies. In practice, however, those agencies and their respective boards rarely, if ever, defy the governor's transportation mandates.\ That's why Georgia's next governor must work diligently to break the vise-like grip the road-building lobby continues to exert over the DOT. (Getting the DOT to finally stop dithering on the long- delayed commuter rail service connecting Atlanta to Lovejoy and, eventually, to Athens would be a good start.)\ Another true test of gubernatorial leadership will entail mustering the requisite courage to speak frankly about the need to identify some new sources of transportation funding. While it seems politically unpalatable, the next governor must use his bully pulpit to advocate for raising the gas tax or rallying public support for regional taxes that can be used for roads, transit and other commuting options.\ Georgia voters are urged to elect a governor with a keen understanding of the financial challenges we face and the backbone to show leadership on transportation issues. The choice we make will dictate whether we chart a better course or continue following the signs leading to more dead ends.\ --- Lyle V. Harris, for the editorial board (lharris@ajc.com)\ This is the second in a series of editorials examining statewide issues and how the candidates for governor and the General Assembly in the Nov. 7 general election may respond to them in the next four years.\ CAPTION: COLLECTING TAX REVENUE FROM DRIVERS The states with the lowest state motor-fuel tax rates, in 2000, in cents per gallon: Georgia......7.50 Alaska.......8.00 New Jersey..10.50 Florida.....13.10 Wyoming.....14.00 Source: Bureau of Transportation Statistics\ CAPTION: WHERE GEORGIA'S ROAD MONEY COMES FROM Sources of highway funding in Georgia, 2003: Federal aid...........55% State fuel taxes*.....37% Other sources..........8% *excise and prepaid Source: U.S. Census Bureau\ CAPTION: HOW WE GET TO WORK ................................Georgia....U.S. Car, truck, van --- drive alone..79.0%....76.3% Car, truck, van --- carpool......12.8%....11.2% Public transportation*............2.6%.....5.2% Walk..............................1.3%.....1.3% Work at home......................3.0%.....3.2% *Includes taxis Source: Bureau of Transportation Statistics\ Credit: STAFF"
160," As Kmart mulls offers from Michigan and Georgia for a headquarters move, it could come down to more than just money.\ Georgia officials trying to sell Kmart on the area figure Atlanta's image, lower costs, quality of life --- and a lower probability for snow --- ultimately could pluck the retailer from the Wolverine State.\ Michigan, however, has its own pluses: less crime, lower personal income taxes, summers with less humidity --- and it rains half as much in January and July.\ Georgia officials have crafted an incentive package that falls short by $28 million of Michigan's offer to keep Kmart, state documents have said. Michigan officials have offered the company about $45 million in tax breaks and other incentives.\ ""We seem to have an advantage on wages, unemployment insurance, workers' comp, education levels and airport access,"" said Brenda Robbins, senior project manager of Georgia Power's community and economic development, in an e-mail to John Gilman, vice president of business recruitment with the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce.\ ""Michigan appears to be advantaged by lower personal income tax,"" she added. ""Corporate income tax could be a significant variable.""\ Robbins' e-mail offers a rare, behind-the-scenes look at the Georgia vs. Michigan race to land Kmart's headquarters and a data center. The documents were obtained by The Atlanta Journal- Constitution under Georgia's open records law.\ Experts say there's more to luring a company than incentives.\ ""Incentives are only a small part,"" said J. Mac Holladay, formerly the chief operating officer for the Governor's Development Council of Georgia who now runs Market Street Services.\ He added, ""Georgia may be a better bargain in the long term for Kmart.""\ For one, general operations managers would earn an average of $89,250 annually in Atlanta, compared with $105,000 in Detroit. While that's not good for the wage earners here, it's great for Kmart, which has been watching costs since exiting bankruptcy in May 2003.\ Michael Shore, spokesman with the Michigan Economic Development Corp., said his state also has an excellent quality of life, with all the Great Lakes accessible within hours of Detroit. And there are more than 1,000 golf courses in the state.\ ""There's nothing to compare with the natural environment of Michigan,"" Shore said. ""Housing costs are marginally more expensive, as are labor rates in Michigan --- and we own up to that --- but Michigan in the summer is about as good as it gets.\ ""I don't think the Kmart folks will find a better quality of life in Atlanta than here,"" Shore said.\ Detroit also has potentially cheaper office space rents, no state net worth/franchise tax and slightly lower health care costs.\ Some pluses in Atlanta's column are housing. A new 2,400-square- foot house in metro Atlanta goes for about $235,820, which is $79,000 cheaper than in Detroit. Rents also run $134 cheaper per month than in Detroit.\ A deeper pool of talent in metro Atlanta could nudge Kmart, which could add 1,900 jobs to metro Atlanta. Those jobs include 900 workers for a data center, in addition to the corporate headquarters. Salaries would begin at about $65,000, with executive pay substantially higher than that.\ ""For any headquarters looking at the area, there are many benefits, including diversity and transportation,"" said Maria Mullins, director of DeKalb County's office of economic development. ""In DeKalb, we have 100 different countries represented. And from downtown or the Perimeter, you could be at Hartsfield in well under an hour and be off to Beijing, China.""\ Kmart's move, be it Michigan or Atlanta, is expected to take place in June 2005, according to one e-mail passed between Georgia economic development officials. Kmart is seeking a fresh start, after years of downsizing and a reorganization under Chapter 11 court protection, the documents said.\ ""It's a bit of a different culture in Detroit,"" said retailing analyst Richard Hastings, with Bernard Sands. ""Detroit is a relatively sophisticated place, but it's also an automobile place.""\ The retailer is now equipped with $3 billion in cash, is profitable, and recently hired a new president and chief executive officer, Aylwin Lewis, to lead the chain's future.\ Lewis, a native of Texas, is the first African-American to run a national retail chain. Formerly, Lewis was president and chief multibranding and operating officer of Yum Brands restaurant company, whose brands include Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut.\ ""Atlanta is viewed as one of the most welcoming communities with great success from Herman Russell and Andy Young,"" Holladay said. ""A new CEO would certainly feel welcomed into a community like that.""\ Credit: STAFF"
161," When told how much it will cost metro Atlanta over the next 25 years to improve regional transportation by even a smidgen, Roswell Mayor Jere Wood was not amused.\ ""What I've heard is that if we spend $50 billion, we'll only be a little worse than if we do nothing,"" he said recently. ""As a politician, I can't take that back to my constituents.""\ But he should.\ Everyone in the 13-county region who is enduring life-sucking highway gridlock, riding a mass transit system that's awaiting its last rites or risking life and limb crossing busy local roads needs to hear this loud and clear: Money alone, even $50 billion, can't buy us out of this mess.\ That princely sum was arrived at by the Atlanta Regional Commission as part of its comprehensive transportation plan for the next quarter century. It's an evolving document that must be finalized by year's end. Among ""Mobility 2030's"" key objectives is matching specific projects to respective sources of local, state and federal funding.\ The numbers don't look good. The region's population is growing faster than at any other time in modern history. By conservative estimates, the region will add about 2 million residents in the coming two decades. That population boom threatens to overload the existing transportation system. The ARC plan predicts an actual increase in ""severe"" congestion --- defined as bumper-to-bumper highway traffic moving slower than 30 mph --- of about 12 percent. And that's the good news. But here's the real kick in the head: even if the region had an additional $24 billion to get all the transportation bells and whistles local officials desired, overall levels of severe congestion wouldn't improve much --- maybe 10 percent, tops.\ So if throwing massive piles of money at the problem won't do the trick, what will?\ Changing the region's helter-skelter land-use patterns is paramount. The most well-intentioned transportation improvements --- road widenings, HOV lanes, bicycle and walking paths --- won't do much good unless they're integrated with carefully considered commercial, residential and recreational land-use planning.\ For decades, relatively cheap land prices and few natural impediments to growth have been a blessing to the regional economy. But the curse of unchecked growth has struck with a vengeance. Not only is it taking a toll on the environment and our quality of life, it's downright expensive.\ Traffic congestion accounts for more than $2 billion a year in lost productivity and wasted fuel, according to the Texas Transportation Institute. A more thoughtful approach that links private sector development and public sector transportation investments is critical to healthier, sustainable growth.\ While it would require a historically unprecedented level of regional cooperation, ARC planners say the payoff from adopting better land-use strategies would be substantial, possibly reducing traffic congestion by another 10 percent.\ In the same vein, elected officials must ultimately learn to think locally but act regionally about other transportation issues as well. Highway congestion is bad enough, but some surface streets that cross city or county boundaries (think Johnson Ferry Road between Fulton and Cobb counties) are among the worst traffic chokepoints. The ARC mobility plan calls for the creation of a ""grid system"" that increases east-west as well as north-south connectivity. That too will require local governments to surrender a share of their autonomy in order to improve inter-county traffic flow.\ And while more money wouldn't hurt, the importance of changing the way we spend what's already available can't be overstated. Commuting by car will probably remain the dominant mode of travel for the foreseeable future, but rigid state funding formulas that prohibit gas-tax revenues from being spent on anything other than roads and bridges are woefully obsolete. Those limits have put mass transit and other alternatives at a disadvantage.\ Making some of these cultural and institutional changes will be difficult, if only because they'll require regional leaders to find new ways of looking at transportation. But doing so will be a lot easier than fumbling to explain why we keep spending so much on transportation and getting so little in return.\ Credit: STAFF"
162," The most urbanized area of metro Atlanta could be completely transformed if all the innovative rail projects now being contemplated actually see the light of day.\ The Peachtree Streetcar would stop every several blocks along a 10.7-mile corridor connecting West End to downtown to Midtown and to Buckhead --- picking up and dropping off people along the way.\ The Belt Line would encircle the central city, creating a wonderful way to travel --- by rail and multipurpose pathways --- between rejuvenating urban neighborhoods. The line would link commercial centers, parks, tourist destinations and residential areas.\ The C-Loop, along another rail line, is being proposed to link MARTA with the Emory University complex, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and eventually the communities in south DeKalb.\ The city of Atlanta strongly supports a light-rail line along the northwest corridor that would connect MARTA to Marietta and knit together many of the communities along the way.\ There are also exploratory discussions about a host of other potential rail links, including bridging the Atlanta University Center with Auburn Avenue and maybe even the Carter Center. And while we're dreaming, wouldn't it be wonderful to finally get a rail line that would serve the southeast part of the city --- joining downtown with Turner Field and on to Grant Park and Lakewood?\ Such an extensive rail system would fill the gaps that now exist in the skeletal MARTA rail network, the transit backbone of the region. At long last, people inside the Perimeter would have reasonable alternatives to circulate around the city without having to drive a car.\ And, of course, more transit encourages walking, cycling and other forms of transportation that are much kinder to the environment than our automobile-dependent society.\ Transportation investments in rail, pedestrian and bicycle systems also stimulate more dense developments around town centers, where people are within walking distance of jobs, shops, restaurants and parks.\ Of course, such developments are not limited to places inside the Perimeter. Countless municipalities around the region are busy instituting quality-growth principles in their development plans. How wonderful if those centers could be connected with an extensive commuter rail network that could tap into a comprehensive transit system inside I-285.\ Sounds good, right?\ But looking at the Mobility 2030 plan --- and most of the discussion occurring at our state and regional transportation agencies --- light rail, streetcars, commuter rail, MARTA, sidewalks and bikeways are all being shortchanged for new HOV lanes, express buses and extensive investments in arterial roads in the suburban areas of the region.\ And the transit that does exist in the plan is in trouble because there's limited long-term funding from the state or federal governments for capital, operating and maintenance costs of the various systems.\ At this rate, we're on a path of same old, same old --- investing in roads and road-based transportation systems --- where we'll end up with continued sprawl, long commutes and polluted air.\ When the Atlanta Regional Commission held public hearings on its Mobility 2030 plan --- estimated to cost at least $50 billion --- people repeatedly said the region should invest in transit (preferably rail over bus); more money should go into pedestrian/ bicycle facilities; sources of funding for transit must be identified; and that there should be regional equity in how transportation dollars are spent.\ Sounds reasonable, right?\ But the ARC seems to be skirting the regional equity question. A staff paper to the board last week stated that imposing ""a rigid regional equity standard"" on transportation funding would ""undermine the concept of needs-based planning.""\ The paper went on to say that ""considering the complexity of the question and potential amount of disagreement which could result from attempting to identify a formal definition of regional equity,"" ARC's staff then makes ""no recommendation . . . on how regional transportation equity should be defined.""\ By saying regional equity can't be defined or measured, the ARC staff basically is saying that metrowide fairness in transportation spending shouldn't be considered when making funding decisions.\ Here's the danger: The area within I-285 most likely will not get its fair share of transportation money.\ After all, the kind of transportation funding needed in the urbanized areas of the region is transit (from MARTA to light rail to streetcar) combined with pedestrian/bicycle facilities. As long as the state's gas tax money can't pay for those alternative modes, our transportation structure is inherently flawed.\ It's bad enough that local governments have to provide almost 50 percent of the funding for regional transit projects, compared with an average of 25 percent for roadway projects.\ It's even worse that communities trying to develop with quality- growth standards are being penalized rather than rewarded in the way Georgia distributes its transportation dollars.\ If we keep going down this same road, we'll be spending $50 billion on transportation plans that will repeat the same mistakes that have plagued this region for the past 35 years.\ --- Maria Saporta's column appears every Thursday in Business and every Monday in Horizon.\ msaporta@ajc.com\ Credit: STAFF"
163," State leaders on Monday hailed Georgia's share of a massive federal transportation funding bill that adds $286 million a year in road and other improvements to the state's transportation budget.\ ""These are real numbers,"" said Gov. Sonny Perdue after exultant speeches by U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) and state Transportation Board chairman David Doss at a news conference. ""When everyone has their act together, this is the kind of benefit that we can enjoy and put together for meaningful projects.""\ The bill, approved Friday by Congress, designates $7.55 billion for Georgia over six years, adding an additional $286 million a year in transportation funds that the state didn't have before, according to state figures. President Bush is expected to sign the bill into law soon. It is unclear when the projects would begin.\ Included in that $7.55 billion are up to $350 million in ""earmarked"" projects that legislators got specifically written into the bill to bring home to their constituents. Transportation officials could not say which projects would have been funded with or without the bill. The money earmarked for work on Ga. 400 and I- 285 at Ashford Dunwoody Road relieved Yvonne Williams, president of the Northside Community Improvement Districts. She said that she can't count the number of times she has been to Washington lobbying for the bill in the past five years.\ ""Businesses in here need to have this work completed in the near term, to get their workers moving,"" she said.\ The scores of other projects laid out in the bill include $18 million for work on the I-285 interchange at Atlanta Road in Cobb County to relieve what an Isakson aide called the ""parking lot"" that forms there at rush hour; $21.8 million for improvements to the U.S. 411 Connector from U.S. 41 to I-75 in Bartow County; and $2 million for the interchange at I-285 and I-20 west.\ Some beneficiaries raised eyebrows among activists who think of the earmarked projects as pork barrel spending. Tom Schatz, president of Washington-based Citizens Against Government Waste, said allocations of $250,000 and $400,000 for pedestrian and streetscape improvements in rural Ellaville in Schley County and Glennville in Tattnall County ""raise the question about why federal gas tax money is being used for such local nonhighway projects.""\ Isakson hit back at the criticism, saying the allocations were ""meaningful projects that all of us have recognized for years needed to be prioritized in this state.""\ Officials touted the transit projects, including facilitating cleaner buses for MARTA, studying bus lanes for I-285 and rehabilitating the Amtrak train station in Jesup, saying Georgia's share of mass transit funding increased by more than 60 percent.\ Controversy might have been stoked by the funding of a study for two proposed interstates leading from east Georgia, one north to Knoxville and the other westward. The north-south highway, I-3, has attracted opponents who fear that the highway could endanger the environment and ruin the local character of mountain communities.\ U.S. Rep. Charlie Norwood, an Augusta-area Republican, said no one can know whether to support the highway until the studies are done. ""We all have in a position of leadership some responsibility to think about the future,"" he said.\ Officials were buoyed that Georgia will be getting more of its tax money back. The money comes from fuel tax dollars paid across the country, and Georgia's drivers historically have paid more into the federal pot than Georgia gets back. This year, the state is receiving 90.5 percent of its contribution, and with the bill, it will rise to 91.5 in 2007 and 92 percent in the next two years.\ ""Some years, you're going to be down,"" said Isakson, who served on the conference committee that worked out the final bill. ""But 14, 15 or 16 percent is unacceptable.""\ CAPTION: THE ROAD AHEAD FOR CONSTRUCTION Here are a few of the metro Atlanta road projects that federal funds are earmarked for: > $18 million for the I-285 interchange at Atlanta Road in Cobb County. > $1 million for I-575 from I-75 in Cobb County north to Sixes Road in Cherokee County for HOV (car pool) lanes. > $1 million for upgrades to Ga. 316 from I-85 to the Ga. 10 Loop, including new interchanges and HOV lanes in Gwinnett, Barrow and Oconee counties. > $2 million to rebuild the interchange at I-285 and I-20 west. > $4.5 million for widening Johnson Ferry Road and Glenridge Drive from Abernathy Road to Hammond Drive in Fulton County. > $3 million for land acquisition for wildlife preservation at Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield Park. > $6.6 million for reconstruction of the I-75 and Windy Hill Road interchange in Cobb County. > $1.6 million for intermodal passenger facility improvements in Atlanta. > $3 million for interchange capacity improvements at I-285 and Ashford Dunwoody Road. > $21.8 million for transportation improvements to U.S. 411 Connector from U.S. 41 to I-75 in Bartow County.

164," Wal-Mart: Responses to ""Avondale debate pits Wal-Mart jobs vs. blight,"" Page One, Nov. 29\ Quick fix a bad idea\ As a resident of the ""other side of the tracks"" referred to in the article, I consider it inappropriate to characterize this as a racial, or jobs-related, issue.\ The possible annexation of the former Avondale Mall site for a Wal-Mart Supercenter will stall DeKalb County's ""smart growth"" plans for the Memorial Drive corridor, endanger Avondale Estates' downtown master plan and not provide the long-term revitalization our area sorely needs.\ Our communities do not need divisiveness. We need the long-term benefits that smart growth will provide, not the limited quick fix of big-box giants such as Wal-Mart.\ ANDREW PIERCE, Decatur\ Rural formula not transferrable\ I am from ""south of Memorial"" and have attended the meetings with my Avondale neighbors. Local resident Alfonso Mallory is the only one who has brought up the topic of race, and more than once.\ There is a better way to revitalize the area I call home, and a 24-hour Wal-Mart is just a quick fix, not a long-term solution. If Wal-Mart wants to do business inside the Perimeter, then let them work with Perimeter neighborhoods. What works in rural America will not work in a metropolitan area.\ The area is changing; it takes time and vision. It is not black vs. white, but neighborhoods vs. the giant.\ JULIE BAILEY, Decatur\ Opposition not rooted in racism\ DeKalb NAACP Chairman John Evans is trying to make this a racial issue. How does not wanting a Wal-Mart in my back yard make me racist?\ I bought a home here so I would not be living in a suburban Wal- Mart environment. If I wanted that, I would move to Alpharetta.\ Contrary to what the article suggests, we are not a group of crazy racists; we are just regular people who don't want Wal-Mart in our community.\ ALAN BLEVINS, Avondale Estates\ Politics and religion: Responses to ""Christians must focus on God, not politics,"" @issue, Nov. 29\ Place faith in God, not leaders\ The Rev. Franklin Graham could not have said it better.\ Though I am thrilled that President Bush was re-elected, I am disheartened by the boasting and arrogance of some Christian leaders. Sadly, one leader I greatly respect suggested that if Bush does not accomplish all we would like for him to, then we should all stay home on Election Day 2008.\ Graham reminds us that our hope is in God alone, and that Christians should be remembered more for our good works and love than for our political muscle.\ MOLLY BLASS, Marietta\ Observations came too late\ I agree with the Rev. Franklin Graham's premise that ""Christians must focus on God, not politics"" --- but his remarks would have been more credible before the election to temper remarks made by Christian clergy and to prevent the placement of misleading ""voting guides"" in many houses of worship.\ I also agree that God isn't a Republican or a Democrat; he's the God of the universe. But the universe includes people of many faiths, so therefore, God is not only a Christian, either.\ JEAN McDANIEL, Marietta\ Gas tax preferable\ I find it incomprehensible that anyone would think a mileage tax would be more popular than a gasoline tax (""Mileage tax idea has drivers on edge,"" News, Nov. 25).\ The two methods are basically taxing the same thing (the amount of driving you do), except that the mileage tax does nothing to encourage conservation and, to make matters worse, it involves the expense, inconvenience and intrusion of car monitoring.\ If more money is needed for road maintenance, a gasoline tax is the sane choice.\ LORI O'NEAL, Kennesaw\ Tree tower in Cobb didn't meet buildup\ It is a shame that Gwinnett County residents have been fooled by T-Mobile into allowing a 135-foot cellphone tower to be built near the Chattahoochee River (""Disguised cell tower gets good reception,"" Metro, Nov. 29).\ In east Cobb, we were told the same thing about a cellphone tower being built near an elementary school. What we got was a tall, ugly pole with some fake-looking pine needles at the top. It's an eyesore, and it emits radiation.\ The Chattahoochee needs all the preservation help it can get, and although T-Mobile says this tower will look like a pine tree, it will not.

CORRECTION, ATLANTA CONSTITUTION, 960222, PAGE A/02:; COBB PARKWAY WAS MISIDENTIFIED WEDNESDAY ON A MAP DEPICTING TRAFFIC; GROWTH. THE MAP SHOWED A 22 PERCENT INCREASE SINCE 1992 IN TRAFFIC ON; INTERSTATE 75 BETWEEN WINDY HILL AND DELK ROAD.
\
Atlanta's freeway traffic seems worse these days because it is worse. And it won't get better when Olympics construction is finished because traffic volumes are rocketing skyward even during the plague of orange barrels.
\
In just three years, the daily volume of cars and trucks on I-75/85 in Midtown rose nearly 40 percent to 335,000, up 10 percent in just a year, according to the Georgia Department of Transportation. It has soared on other segments of the freeway system as well.
\
""Wow!"" said Cesar Perez, a federal highway engineer in Sacramento. ""In California, a 40 percent increase in 20 years is considered phenomenal growth.""
\
""It's astounding,"" said Marion Waters, a top DOT engineer. ""This is the growth rate we can't deal with. There is no way any Department of Transportation anywhere in the world can deal with this type of growth.""
\
Individual monitoring sites, such as I-75/85 south of I-20, can vary greatly from other locations because of construction activity or other reasons, said DOT's Darrell Elwell.
\
Why is traffic increasing so dramatically?
\
""More people are entering the labor force, more vehicles are being bought per household, people are driving more and trip lengths are getting longer,"" said Georgia Tech transportation expert Michael Meyer. ""These things combine to provide the tremendous increase in congestion that we are seeing in our transportation system.
\
""It's going to be very, very congested,"" Meyer said.
\
Traffic has overwhelmed the highways that were widened to accommodate it. At a cost of $1.5 billion, DOT rebuilt Atlanta's freeway system to postpone the congestion we now have.
\
""We're back to square one,"" said Jeff Rader, manager of transportation programs for the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce.
\
DOT soon will try to manage traffic:
\
-In April, it will introduce the $137 million Advanced Transportation Management System, with message signs, cameras to locate wrecks and synchronized traffic signals.
\
-In May, it will open 24-hour High Occupancy Vehicle lanes on I-75 and part of I-85 inside the Perimeter - a decade later than it could have. Almost nobody car pools now - average occupancy is 1.1 person per car.
\
We are a society that zooms around alone in cars. MARTA's paying ridership fell about 1 percent between fiscal 1992 and 1995.
\
And commuter trains are glaringly absent in a city that grew up with the railroad. DOT opposes using the state gas tax for anything other than roads.
\
""The state of Georgia is going to have to get serious about its commitment to commuter rail,"" said Sen. Steve Thompson (D-Powder Springs), chairman of the Senate Transportation Committee. He thinks the best hope is for a political leader to catch fire about transportation.
\
""I think (Gov.) Zell Miller is writing history with what he has done for education, the environment and economic development,"" said Thompson. ""I really wish he would make a spirited move into transportation.""
\
For the future, Atlanta commuters increasingly will have to weigh ""the pain factor.""
\
""Who's willing to sit in traffic long enough? Who's tough enough to sit it out?"" asks Rader. ""That's the pain factor.""
\
The ""toughest"" will keep getting stuck in traffic. Others will find ways to shift work schedules, car pool, use MARTA, telecommute or move away, he said.
\
""Look at the reason people move out of Los Angeles,"" Rader said. ""They can't stand that rat-race type of existence. A lot of that has to do with traffic.""

166," Bad data on corporate jets\ As a corporate pilot, I am amazed at the wealth of bad information when it comes to the debate of general aviation ""paying their fair share"" and that ""globe-trotting CEOs"" are just flying around for fun (""Small airports take in billions as airlines sag,"" Page One, April 16).\ The ""experts"" never seem to mention how often general aviation planes and corporate jets are rerouted or slowed down to give priority handling to the airliners by air traffic control. They fail to mention that when corporate aircraft fly into airports such as Boston Logan International Airport, we pay close to $400 in fees and taxes on top of the fuel taxes.\ Without maintained smaller airports, corporate aircraft cannot access these towns where their passengers wish to do business in.\ As to the list of Georgia airports and who benefits from them, what corporate pilots are going to fly into Canton's airport in Cherokee County if their passengers have business in Atlanta? As for Daniel Field in Augusta, the Masters is one week of the year. Finally, Peachtree DeKalb is self-sufficient with no resident tax dollars going to the operation of the airport.\ STEPHEN McQUADE, Smyrna\ Toll roads have better potential than gas taxes\ Popular Science magazine this month predicts that gasoline-only vehicles will retain just 35 percent of the U.S. market in 2027, because of technology developments, energy policy, consumer demand and international politics.\ It doesn't bode well for a gas-tax-financed transportation infrastructure. Yet Jay Bookman considers that a ""rational step""? (""Leases on toll roads a rip-off,"" @issue, April 16)\ Public-private partnerships are vital for the future of transportation infrastructure in a cash-strapped nation. When that involves toll roads, government's job is to ensure that the process is transparent and the public isn't ripped off.\ Tolls are not paid just by locals, either. Best of all, projects that would have taken years to complete on a pay-as-you-go funding basis are expedited, enhancing capacity and relieving congestion earlier.\ And private partners are dependent on tolls to recoup their investment, which means that they have a vested interest in expediting the project and ensuring quality construction.\ BENITA M.

Why not focus on the cost of medical care? Why is it so high?\ I'm in my 60s. When I was a youngster, my parents, who had minimal paying jobs, were able to pay for our own medical expenses. Why is it so expensive to go to a doctor or why does a minor surgery cost in the thousands? Could it be that the lawyers and insurance companies are keeping the costs so high?\ TOM COTTON, Senoia\ Nardelli delivered and deserved his severance pay\ I have never seen such wealth envy over Bob Nardelli's severance pay in the last few months in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution (""Nardelli's pay $131 million,"" Business, April 14).\ First, most of this $131 million was his signing bonus. Nardelli was a highly recruited executive at General Electric and Home Depot went after him with promises of stock options, severance pay and large pay and bonus. This was just to get him.\ He delivered on sales (they doubled); he cut costs; he opened thousands of stores; the only thing wrong is that the stock didn't go up. Nardelli is a highly skilled executive whom many companies will be glad to put at the helm.\ Home Depot had a freelance management and store style that does not work in the new environment and needed new disciplines to make it profitable for the future. Nardelli did that.

Their parents grieve as wholly as the parents of the students who were slain. Further, the cartoon appeared to me to be a reminder that we have, perhaps, become complacent once again concerning our national security. It would be beneficial if our first response to any stimulus was to open our minds and thoughtfully consider what the person may be trying to say.\ JEANETTE JENKINS, Morganton\ Irony misunderstood\ I have to comment after reading the April 18 letters grouped under the heading ""Luckovich cartoon"" that were filled with righteous indignation over the Mike Luckovich cartoon of the previous day.\ Obviously, these letter writers are too ""knee-jerk reactionary"" to comprehend the irony that Luckovich successfully and tastefully imbued in just a simple statement. The cartoon was neither insensitive nor exploitative. But the letters against it certainly were.\ CARLTON WYATT, Atlanta\ Hypocrisy displayed\ Mike Luckovich provided an excellent observation with his April 18 cartoon of the Virginia Tech-filled Iraq map.

167," A 1-cent regional sales tax for transportation will top the wish list for the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce when it holds its annual meeting Friday.\ The chamber, combined with several other regional organizations, views the regional sales tax as one way the area will be able to fund transportation improvements and help alleviate congestion.\ ""Congestion is one of the unintended consequences to our success,"" said Dick Anderson, a BellSouth executive who will take over as chair on Friday. ""Our concern is making sure funding will be available to metro Atlanta.""\ Most of the individual county chambers and the Regional Business Coalition also are supporting a penny special purpose local option sales tax for transportation. The business organizations will propose to the General Assembly that enabling legislation be passed that would permit any two or more contiguous counties to pass such a tax; that the counties would have a proposed list of transportation projects; that there would be an oversight committee; and that the tax would sunset after a fixed period.\ There isn't unanimity on this approach, however. Georgians for Better Transportation has been advocating a statewide sales tax for transportation.\ But Anderson said one concern is that metro Atlanta is a donor region --- the amount of gas tax revenues generated in the region is greater than the transportation funds metro Atlanta receives.\ The chamber's outgoing chairman, Mike Garrett, who is president of Georgia Power, said his top priority this past year was to develop closer relationships between the metro Atlanta chamber and the major county chambers.\ ""We've always known we needed to pull this region together, but up to now, we haven't been able to do it,"" Garrett said. ""My goal all along was to at least get a regional approach started.""\ By the way, it looks as though BellSouth's Anderson will stay put for at least one more year --- despite the uncertainty of the proposed merger with AT&T and future executive assignments.\ ""I do have a role with the new company,"" Anderson said. ""And I will be here in Atlanta so I will be able to fulfill my role with the Atlanta chamber in 2007.""\ Committee assignments\ The Atlanta chamber's annual meeting also will unveil a list of several new board members and committee assignments.\ The chair-elect will be Bill Linginfelter, CEO of Wachovia- Georgia. He also will continue to chair the transportation committee. His co-chair will be Phil Hickey, CEO of Rare Hospitality International.\ Developer Pam Sessions (Hedgewood Properties) and AGL Resources CEO John Somerhalder will co-chair the environment committee. Kessel Stelling, president of the Bank of North Georgia, will chair the economic development committee. And IBM executive Lee Torrence will chair the logistics committee.\ Janie Maddox of Post Properties will chair education. Jerry Belle of Merial, Ken Cornelius of Siemens and Jim Whitehurst of Delta Air Lines will co-chair the global commerce committee. The technology committee will be co-chaired by attorney John Yates and Georgia Tech President Wayne Clough.\ As for the board, Chamber President Sam Williams said: ""We are reaching out to new companies and new leaders as well as nonprofits as well as university presidents. It is a very experienced team of highly engaged leaders, and we will expect them to work.""\ Among some of the new board members are Louise Allen, CEO of Ivan Allen Workspace; Dr. Helene Gayle, the new president of CARE; John Krenicki, CEO of GE Energy; Penelope McPhee, president of the Arthur M. Blank Family Foundation; James Tally, CEO of Children's Healthcare; and Tom Gallagher, CEO of Genuine Parts.\ Interestingly enough, Home Depot will now have a representative on the board, Brad Shaw, senior vice president of corporate communications and external affairs.\ Dinner conflict\ The Georgia Chamber of Commerce will celebrate reaching the $1.7 million goal for its membership campaign this evening after having recruited more than 530 new members for a total of more than 4,000.\ But it does look as though the Georgia chamber's annual dinner on Jan. 8 will happen at the same time as Gov. Sonny Perdue's inaugural. Both events will be occurring at the Georgia World Congress Center, so chamber officials hope to work out some complementary arrangement.\ By the way, the same conflict occurred four years ago at the governor's first inaugural ball.\ Also, the Georgia chamber has selected its leadership through 2009. The chairman in 2007 will be David Allen, a dental surgeon with Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery Associates. Charles Tarbutton, an executive with Sandersville Railroad Co., will chair the organization in 2008.\ And Georgia Power's Mike Garrett will be the Georgia chamber's 2009 chair. Although Garrett is ending his year at the Atlanta chamber, he will be chairing the United Way campaign in 2007 and will chair the Woodruff Arts Center campaign in 2008.\ Garrett joked that after he completes the Georgia chamber job, he'll be done.\ Owner-in-waiting\ Ron Terwilliger, CEO of Trammell Crow Residential, hasn't given up on his dream to own the Atlanta Braves. He said he's been waiting for the proposed deal with Colorado-based Liberty Media to be sealed, but in case that falls through, he is still interested.\ In fact, he called Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank about a month ago to explore the two of them teaming up to make a local bid for the baseball team. ""I'm certainly open to it,"" Terwilliger said. ""I would love to be a partner with Arthur. Regardless, I believe there should be local ownership.""\ msaporta@ajc.com\ Credit: STAFF"

Others include the speaker of the House, the House and Senate majority leaders, the Senate Rules Committee chairman and the heads of several other top legislative committees.\While few appear to be in real danger of defeat, the mere fact that many are being made to defend their records indicates a mood of anti-incumbency among voters.\""I think people are maybe riding the wave of public unhappiness with incumbents, dissatisfaction with the status quo,"" said Senate Majority Leader Bill Cowsert, R-Athens, who faces a Republican primary challenge Tuesday for the first time in years. ""I think that frustration is largely aimed toward Washington.""\In fact, a poll conducted last week for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution found that 42 percent of Georgia's registered voters disapprove of the job the Legislature is doing. And it isn't getting better: A similar poll conducted in January 2015 found the same percentage of voters frowning on lawmakers' performance.\One reason incumbents in leadership are likely to be re-elected? A massive advantage in fundraising. An AJC analysis of campaign finance records in these key matchups found incumbents raised more than $3.85 million through March 31, the most recent data available. Their opponents brought in just $242,000.\England, of the Barrow County town of Auburn, said that while he hasn't had to campaign this hard in a while, it's been ""refreshing.""\""It's been, actually, a lot of fun to go out and run a race and talk to folks,"" he said. ""We've never really stopped doing that, but it makes you concentrate a little bit more on it than you normally do.""\His opponent, financial manager Lucretia Hughes of Winder, said she's having fun, too. But, she said, she's running for serious reasons.\""I decided to run and take my eyes off the federal government when he raised that gas tax,"" Hughes said, referring to the 2015 law that increased motor fuel taxes to help raise$900 million annually for roads and bridges.\""That was a slap in the face to every working person in the state of Georgia.""\England said his support of the transportation tax does come up when he's talking to voters.\""When you talk to them about it, tell them what we've done is $900 million to a billion,"" he said. ""We're still falling short of where we need to be, but what we've done is really going to make improvements to places that have needed improvement for a long while.\""Once you explain it past a sound bite, people get it.""\In Blue Ridge, House Speaker David Ralston faces retired wrestling coach Sam Snider for the second election in a row. Ralston won handily in 2014. This year, however, Snider has tried to hang the transportation tax and Gov. Nathan Deal's veto of a ""religious liberty"" bill around Ralston's neck.\""We didn't work too hard for that (religious liberty bill) in my personal opinion,"" Snider said at a recent candidate forum.\Earlier in the campaign, Snider accused Ralston of colluding with Deal to pass the bill knowing the governor would veto it.\But Ralston said the bill the Legislature passed this year was solid.\""I thought (it)was fair, reasonable and hit the sweet spot that everyone could agree on,"" he said. ""We passed that bill this year, and I suspect we'll have a bill next year, too.""\House Majority Leader Jon Burns, R-Newington, faces corrections officer and Marine Corps veteran Daniel Almond. Other House committee leaders facing opposition in this year's Republican primaries are Human Relations and Aging ChairmanTommyBenton, R-Jefferson; Information and Audits Chairman Mike Cheokas, R-Americus;Education Chairman Brooks Coleman, R-Duluth; Health and Human Services Chairwoman Sharon Cooper, R-Marietta; Regulated Industries Chairman Howard Maxwell, R-Dallas; Banks and Banking Chairman Greg Morris, R-Vidalia; State Planning and Community Affairs Chairman Jimmy Pruett, R-Eastman; Governmental Affairs Chairman Ed Rynders, R-Albany; and Defense and Veterans Affairs Chairman John Yates, R-Griffin.\In the state Senate, powerful Rules Chairman Jeff Mullis, R-Chickamauga, has quipped that the only negative thing his opponent has said about the race is that Mullis has raised too much money.\But that opponent, teacher and former Trion Mayor Lanny Thomas, said there's nothing wrong with a little competition. Local issues, such as whether Walker County should expand from a sole commissioner governance structure, have dominated the race.\The same is true in other districts, including Senate District 54 in Dalton. There, Senate Insurance and Labor Chairman Charlie Bethel -- who voted for the transportation bill--has drawn a GOP primary challenger from community volunteer and first-time candidate Conda Goodson over the effect of taxes on a community still hurting from the recession.\In North Fulton and Cherokee counties, Economic Development and Tourism Chairman Brandon Beach is in a tough race against Milton investor Aaron Barlow. And the list goes on for Republicans facing primary challenges, including Agriculture and Consumer Affairs Chairman John Wilkinson, R-Toccoa; Higher Education Chairman Fran Millar, R-Dunwoody; Judiciary Non-Civil Chairman Jesse Stone, R-Waynesboro; and Natural Resources and the Environment Chairman Frank Ginn, R-Danielsville.\Up near Athens, home to the University of Georgia, retired university administrator Patricia Daugherty said she decided to take on Cowsert because the Republican activist thought the state senator was too focused on Atlanta and not present enough in Senate District 46 -- which includes Oconee County and parts of Clarke and Walton counties.\Both candidates tout conservative credentials, including from anti-abortion groups as well as gun rights organizations.\""Everybody knows it's hard to unseat an entrenched incumbent,"" said Daugherty, who has focused on\door-to-door and community events,\and says she also hears a lot of frustration from small business owners over regulations, fees and taxes.

169,"Breaking promises made 20 years ago, the State Road and Tollway Authority, led by Gov. Sonny Perdue, voted Friday to continue the 50-cent toll on Ga. 400 until 2020.\In order to satisfy the original promise that the tolls would come down in 2011, Perdue said, SRTA will see if it can suspend the tolls briefly in 2011. When they resume, he said, they would be a ""new"" toll.\Perdue likened Ga. 400 to a house whose family has outgrown it beyond all expectations. ""There are vastly needed projects we need to do sooner rather than later"" with the new toll money, he said. He said he knew he might be portrayed as breaking a promise, but people could trust the promised projects would be the ones built with the new toll revenue.\""There are people who feel strongly about that,"" Perdue said, speaking of the promises. ""If we're going to grow, we can make a decision. We can either decide to provide for the people who are coming to our house to live in our state, or we can decide that we're not going to have enough seats at the table.""\Not all agree with that view. ""I think it is a travesty that they go ahead and go back on their word,"" said Bob Engstrom, a retired chemical company manager who drives Ga. 400. He agrees with Perdue that Ga. 400 needs work, and he understands Perdue's plan is to use the extended toll to fund a list of them, including a completed interchange at I-85. However, he said, ""It is not an issue relative to need for that area. It is an issue of public trust.""\Others decried the rushed and secretive run-up to the decision. SRTA Executive Director Gena Evans said she had met with numerous elected officials and interest groups over the previous eight months. But over the past week SRTA declined to release information about the suggested projects and proposal to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution until the paper invoked the Georgia Open Records Act. Evans said the projects will go out for public comment.\Evans and SRTA may have spoken to chosen people about the extension, said Robert Coleman, an Alpharetta businessman who pays the toll daily, but for him that was not enough.\""If I want to do something, I'm not going to seek out opponents; I'm going to talk to the people that are on my team,"" he said. ""When are these people going to realize you've got to keep your promises?""\Asked about the secretiveness, Perdue said, ""I think your allegation of secrecy is a fabric of your imagination.""\Some commuters have commented in favor of keeping the toll, if it means alleviating congestion around the unfinished interchange at I-85 and Ga. 400 or other parts of the corridor.\The state doesn't need the extended toll to finish the I-85 interchange, since the project would cost perhaps $40 million, and SRTA would have had $42.5 million in reserves after the final bond payment next year. However, other than that, the state is strapped.\Most transportation funding comes from gas taxes paid to the state and federal government. But most of that is paid as cents per gallon, not cents on the dollar. That means that as inflation and the cost of road building goes up, gas tax revenues mostly don't. And as people drive more fuel-efficient cars, the amount they pay can even go down.\Local governments have tried to fill the gap with special local sales taxes, and one is likely to be on the ballot for the 10-county Atlanta region in 2012. But even those revenues are expected to fund just a fraction of the road projects that regional planning officials say are needed to free up congestion.\The presidents of the North Buckhead Civic Association and the Buckhead Coalition spoke in favor of the deal, with an eye on the I-85 interchange. That ""crippled"" interchange dumps expressway traffic onto local streets that are occasionally paralyzed because of it, said Gordon Certain, who leads the north Buckhead group.\Spokesmen for House Speaker David Ralston, Speaker Pro Tempore Jan Jones and Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle said they opposed the vote. Ralston noted that the speaker's appointee to the SRTA board who voted to extend the toll was appointed by his predecessor. Cagle's appointee was the lone dissenter in the 3-1 vote. As chairman, Perdue did not vote because there was no tie.\Gubernatorial candidate Nathan Deal issued a statement against the vote. A statement from Roy Barnes said he would take the toll down ""if there is not a need for improvements on that corridor,"" but he didn't feel officials had made a strong enough case for the projects. When Barnes was governor he drew criticism when SRTA used Ga. 400 toll revenues to buy land near Atlantic Station.\At the news conference more than 20 officials stood behind Perdue in support of the vote, including Tad Leithead, chairman of the Atlanta Regional Commission.\""From a general perspective in this difficult funding environment, to take down the one toll we have seems like a step in the wrong direction,"" Leithead said before the vote.\Some opponents of the vote were there, too. GOP Rep. Chuck Martin, who represents Alpharetta and parts of Roswell and Johns Creek, said he'd met with Evans earlier on the issue, but he had no idea the decision was moving forward or what the projects were.

170,"Here's a fact maybe not generally appreciated by commuters gazing at Atlanta's smudgy, smoggy skyline: Georgia has the second most electric vehicles in the nation.\Here's another fact:Not for long. Georgia has about 25,000 electric cars on the road, mostly in metro Atlanta and largely funded by what was one of the most generous state tax incentives in the nation -- a $5,000 state income tax credit. But state lawmakers, many of them conservatives who are predisposed against consumer tax credits anyway, canceled the credit in 2015 and installed a $200 registration fee instead.\That whipsaw effect pushed new electric vehicle purchases off a cliff. In July 2015, the state registered 1,426 electric vehicles purchased as the tax credit expired. The next month, just 242 were registered -- that's an 83 percent drop and sales have not rebounded.\The impact also can be seen in the decline of specialty license plate sales for alternative fuel vehicles, which are tied to the registration fee. Every all-electric vehicle --as well as some other alternative fuel vehicles--is subject to a $200 fee. Owners of such cars can opt to get the specialty license plate in return, giving them access to Atlanta's HOV lanes.\However, since the change in state policy, monthly license plate sales are down nearly 60 percent.\For champions of the clean-fuel cars, the statistics are sobering.\""We should be around 40,000 vehicles now,"" said Jeff Cohen, founder of the Atlanta Electric Vehicle Development Coalition. ""We're not growing.""\Backers of alternative fuel vehicles like Cohen have complained that lawmakers turned one of the friendliest states to the electric car into one of the least hospitable.\""According to the Georgia Department of Revenue, sales and leases have dropped over 90 percent,"" said Public Service CommissionerTimEchols, aproponent of the tax credit and owner of two electric cars. ""The tax credit was key to our growing this market.""\No one disagrees with that, but it made some conservative lawmakers uncomfortable. Sen. Butch Miller, R-Gainesville, served on a special joint study committee created last year to look into alternative fuel vehicles and said the dramatic decline shows the tax credit only propped up an industry that didn't have wide consumer support.\""Our previous electric car tax credit was too generous, too rich. We have to strike a balance on what is good for the economy, what's good for the environment and what's good for the consumer,"" said Miller. ""It should be market driven, and a free-market approach answers a lot of questions.""\Credit not likely to be revived\Attempts last year to reinstate a version of the tax credit failed, and the joint study committee met three times last year and issued no recommendations. And Miller made it clear the committee was taking a wait-and-see approach to any new measures.\""At this point it's really fluid because we are still working on trying to develop the right kind of policy that will move us forward,"" Miller said. ""With energy prices at their current state, it's difficult for people to justify the investment in alternative energy and that has slowed the pace of our exploration.""\Advocates hoping the state would consider new incentives got little encouragement from the study committee.\""I'm going be as generous as I can,"" said Don Francis, director of Clean Cities Georgia, a federally supported initiative. ""I was disappointed at how they approached it and what the output was.""\Francis testified at the final meeting of the study committee that the elimination of the tax credit was costing both consumers and the state money as drivers spent more on gasoline and most of those dollars left the state.\Francis said it was pretty clear the committee wasn't interested in revisiting the tax credit and instead focused on what the state could do to support business uses for alternative fuels while supporting refueling and recharging infrastructure.\There are no disinterested parties here. Miller, for example, is a car dealer and not for Tesla. Cohen is North American sales manager for General Electric's vehicle charging stations. Car companies like Chevrolet and Nissan, which produce the most popular all-electric cars, are weighing in as well.\Registration fee highest in nation\But there are legitimate policy questions too.\Should the state put a thumb on the scale to entice consumers to buy one type of car over another? Are consumer tax credits bad policy generally? Doesn't the state have an obligation to address air quality and climate change by encouraging clean energy?\Francis, Cohen and others who want more state support for electric vehicles are retooling and focusing heavily on the annual registration fee. The fee, which this year will be slightly above $200, is meant to offset the gas tax which electric vehicle owners obviously do not pay but go to fund repairs on the roads everybody uses. However, the indexed fee, which this year will be slightly above $200, is the highest in the nation and there appears to be some support for lowering it.\""I think that's a realistic priority,"" Cohen said.\Cohen is bullish on electric cars (he owns three) and believes that sales will slowly rebound on their own, particularly if the lawmakers reduce the penalty to something less punitive.\""I'd rather see the registration fee addressed to maintain our population,"" he said. ""I'd rather not fight for a tax credit that market data may not prove we need.""\Cohen said there may be a way to return a portion of the tax credit's incentive by giving buyers a break on sales tax at the point of purchase.\""A lot of states are doing sales tax exemptions rather than credits,"" he said.\Whatever the outcome, unless policy changes soon, Georgia's unlikely position as No. 2 on the electric car rankings (way, way, way behind No. 1 California) likely is doomed.\Credit: STAFF"

Call it the greening of Georgia.
\
Gov. Roy Barnes' recent declaration that he would like to see 20 percent of the state's urban areas dedicated to green space reflects a growing sentiment among Georgia leaders that development and public park land must go hand-in-hand.
\
A coalition of environmental organizations is working with Barnes to find a way to multiply the state money that will go toward acquiring green space.
\
Those close to Barnes believe he wants to make land conservation a hallmark of his administration.
\
""Understand that this parade doesn't go anywhere without the governor at the head of it,"" explained Jerry McCollum, president of the Georgia Wildlife Federation and chairman of the Georgia Legacy Coalition.
\
The coalition of seven organizations began working a couple of years ago in an effort to pass a constitutional amendment that would have created the Georgia Heritage Fund. The fund would have levied an increase in the real estate transfer tax, generating about $30 million for green space acquisition.
\
Coalition members believe Georgia needs to ""think big,"" according to John A. Sibley, president of the Georgia Conservancy.
\
Nearby states already are thinking big. Florida is investing $3 billion over 10 years towards land acquisition. Even Alabama has an oil and gas tax that generates $15 million a year for land conservation.
\
Currently, in Georgia, 8 percent of land is publicly owned; the state owns 1 percent.
\
""We ought to be as good as our neighbors in protecting the land,"" McCollum said. ""It's a shame that we haven't had the funds to acquire more land for green space and wildlife habitat.""
\
If the coalition has its way, that will change.
\
The coalition includes the Georgia Wildlife Federation, the Nature Conservancy, the Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation, the Georgia Conservancy, the Conservation Fund and the Georgia Parks and Recreation Association. As originally proposed, two-thirds of the dedicated fund would have gone towards land acquisition, one-sixth would buy historic sites and another sixth would buy land for recreation.
\
""I think Georgia should have a program of $100 million a year or more,"" Sibley said. ""We are working with the governor to find the best way to accomplish that.""
\
Barnes said he would love to invest $100 million a year into a land conservation fund, but given his other initiatives, he doesn't know if that will be possible.
\
""I can't tell you if that's reasonable or likely,"" Barnes said. ""That seems a little high. I would like to do it, if I could.""
\
""The next 10 years are a window for us,"" said Tavia McCuean, state director of the Nature Conservancy. ""If we don't get in there now and protect our natural resources, we may never have that opportunity again. But we will need the money behind it to do it.""
\
The coalition is hard at work on a variety of financing schemes that could be used to raise money for land conservation. But the group has no plans to propose new taxes or a tax increase.
\
""The magic here would be if we could create a dedicated fund,"" McCollum said. ""A dedicated fund is the only way you know there's a legacy that continues through various administrations. And the coalition has committed itself to researching every conceivable source of funds for land acquisition, which also includes private funds.""
\
While work still needs to be done on how such a program would be financed, a consensus seems to be developing among the governor, environmental groups and even developers that something needs to be done to ensure that Georgia does not lose the qualities that have made it attractive to residents and newcomers alike.
\
Barnes remembers growing up in rural Cobb County where as a boy he had places to hunt and fish or just roam.
\
""These are the things that make greatness --- solace for the soul,"" said Barnes, who is concerned that sprawl has swallowed up his former haunts.
\
A multi-tiered package for the environment likely will emerge when Barnes presents his proposed budget and legislative package near the year.
\
Money for land acquisition will be critical. Barnes said he expects to allocate a significant amount of money to continue the effort to buy land along the Chattahoochee River for a 160-mile park from Helen to Columbus.
\
So far, the state has invested about $15 million in the Chattahoochee project.
\
The governor said he likely will recommend an appropriation out of the general fund, probably from state surpluses, to develop a matching program for local governments.
\
If a city or county wants to acquire money for green space, then it would be able to receive matching funds from the state.
\
At the same time, Barnes is listening to Joel Cowan, chairman of the Georgia Regional Transportation Authority, about how the state can develop a far-reaching network of greenways.
\
Cowan, who developed Peachtree City, believes the planned community can serve as a model for the rest of the state.
\
Peachtree City has a network of 80 miles of greenways and paths that follow along waterways. Those lands already are off limits for development because they lie in a flood plain.
\
In Georgia, many landowners have fenced their property all the way to a river's edge, making flood plains inaccessible to the public. Cowan believes that through acquisition and easements, Georgia could turn floodplain areas into public park land.
\
""This is not radical,"" Barnes said. ""I'm not anti-growth. I want developers to make money. And this was not done without taking the temperature. The No. 1 attraction for new homeowners is passive park areas where you can walk, jog and bike.""

172," State flag\ Barnes: With business leaders worried about potential boycotts and image problems for Georgia, the governor last year pushed through legislation changing the state flag. Flag loyalists criticized Barnes for redesigning the flag in a closed-door deal with Democratic leaders that reduced the size of the formerly dominant Confederate battle emblem.\ Perdue said during the campaign that he supports a referendum on the flag change. He argues that Barnes' action last year opened a wound that has not healed. In more practical terms, Republicans say the new flag is ugly.\ What's to come: Perdue has also said that the flag change is not his top priority. However, some Republicans think something must be done to satisfy opponents of the new flag, who helped beat Barnes. Also, Perdue and lawmakers can expect flag protesters at the Capitol every day during the 2003 session unless the General Assembly acts.\ Ethics\ Barnes banned state employees from accepting gifts from lobbyists. Pushed to change state law to make candidates file more contribution reports and to let them file electronically. Also increased the limits on how much candidates can raise.\ Perdue promised an ethics package during his campaign, including a measure making lawmakers and state employees who leave their posts wait for a set period before becoming eligible to lobby the General Assembly and state agencies. Also has pledged to appoint an inspector general to root out fraud and abuse; supports a law allowing grand juries to investigate allegations of corruption.\ What's to come: Perdue can probably create the inspector general post without legislative approval. But the lobbying measure would require the support of the General Assembly, which has killed such measures before.\ Redistricting\ Barnes and the Democrat-led General Assembly redrew political lines last year to create as many Democrat-leaning state House and Senate and congressional districts as possible. Those boundaries split many cities and counties among several political districts, a move that confused many voters.\ Perdue wants new district lines that are more compact, putting cities and counties into single state legislative districts when possible.\ What's to come: Perdue has promised that the first bills he pushes in January will be on redistricting. To pass them, he will need to break the Democratic dominance in the state House and convince enough conservative Democrats that sticking with Barnes' districts will eventually hurt them.\ Northern Arc\ Barnes supported proposed construction of the Northern Arc highway between I-75 and I-85 north of Atlanta, but he backed off once newspapers began reporting that decision-makers involved in the road plan had potential financial interests in the route.\ Perdue didn't fight the road while serving in the state Senate, but during his campaign, he opposed it. Instead of building the Northern Arc, Perdue suggests making improvements to existing east- west routes, such as Ga. 20 and Ga. 140.\ What's to come: As governor, Perdue could push for widening projects on existing roads to ease traffic flow. And while the Northern Arc is probably dead as long as Perdue says it is, he could look for another route north of the current Northern Arc plan.\ Taxes\ Barnes pushed through bills lowering property taxes by increasing the homestead exemption and making it a little harder for local boards and commissions to raise taxes by increasing property assessments. He also backed legislation granting consumers two sales tax holidays this year for purchases of back-to-school clothes, supplies and computers.\ Perdue wants to make the sales tax holidays an annual event. He also supports eliminating income taxes on earnings other than wages for Georgians over age 62, a move that could cost about $70 million in the first year. He thinks that could help make Georgia a retirement haven.\ Transportation\ Barnes created the Georgia Regional Transportation Authority to develop regional traffic plans and solutions. He also worked to speed up road and transit improvements by using bonds that will be paid off with the state's anticipated share of future federal gas- tax revenues.\ Perdue is dubious about borrowing money based on future revenues. Before the election, Perdue said he hadn't seen any results from GRTA. Additionally, Perdue wants to improve traffic by encouraging more telecommuting among government employees. He would use tax incentives to reward the same approach in the corporate world.\ What's to come: Perdue can address many of his transportation concerns in the budget or through his appointments to agencies such as GRTA.\ Environment\ Barnes earmarked $90 million in state money over three years to buy green space in Georgia's fastest-growing counties. He favored a system of state-funded regional reservoirs to meet North Georgia's water demands, and he sued the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, demanding more water from Lake Lanier for metro Atlanta. Barnes' negotiators in the so-called ""water wars"" over the use of water in rivers shared with Alabama and Florida were perceived as favoring metro Atlanta's interests.\ Perdue supports the green space program and agrees with Barnes' position on reservoirs and the lawsuit. But as the owner of a fertilizer business, he is expected to pay more attention to South Georgia farmers than Barnes did.\ Budget\ Barnes, like every governor, used the state's $16 billion budget to set his priorities and reward loyal lawmakers. He pumped $1 billion into school construction and borrowed heavily, but he demanded cutbacks when times got tough, and he should be leaving Perdue with a full rainy-day fund. Georgia was one of few states that didn't have a major budget crisis during the recent recession.\ Perdue has promised to audit state spending and steer money to human needs, like programs for the disabled. He said he will use the audit to determine what needs to be beefed up and what needs to go.\ What's to come: Expect education to continue getting the biggest share of funding. But overall, the budget, pinched by falling revenues, will be a major battleground between the Republican governor and legislative Democrats. Republicans will want a bigger share of the local goodies the Democrats have long controlled.\ Education reform\ Barnes passed two major education laws, creating an accountability system to grade schools and hand out teacher bonuses. Students in some grades will have to pass reading tests to win promotion.\ Perdue wants to reduce the bureaucracy built into Barnes' 2000 school reform law and give local systems more leeway in spending state funds. Kathy Cox, the new state school superintendent, also wants to change the accountability plan.\ What's to come: Perdue probably will try to shift all or some of the duties for grading and improving schools to the state Department of Education, which Barnes partially dismantled while it was under the outgoing Republican superintendent, Linda Schrenko. In addition, expect some kind of new career ladder that would pay top teachers extra to mentor less-experienced colleagues. The General Assembly probably would support such a measure.\ Credit: STAFF"
173,"40 days, hundreds of bills: For 40 days, members of Georgia's House of Representatives and Senate battled over myriad issues, everything from the state's budget to a prohibition on the involuntary implanting of microchips in humans. All of this being done in the wake of a troublesome ethics scandal involving the former speaker of the House and the worst economic environment in generations. The following is a sampling of some of the legislation that passed, plus a few bills that did not. There were hundreds of pieces of legislation.\For a complete review of this year's legislation, please visit the Georgia General Assembly's website at www.legis.state.ga.us\State budget\Lawmakers OK'd Georgia's $17.9 billion budget for 2011. It trims about $600 million from education and is likely to mean furloughs, layoffs and increased college tuition. Included in the 2011 budget, which kicks in July 1, are about $96 million in fee increases and a tax on hospital revenue designed to raise more than $200 million.\Ethics\SB17 is considered a sweeping piece of ethics legislation by Georgia lawmakers. The bill would broaden the authority of the state Ethics Commission; tighten reporting requirements for lobbyists and legislators; increase lobbying fees and fines for lobbyists and legislators who break the law; make it a crime to use state agencies or authorities to attack or harass someone; and prohibit sexual harassment.\Transportation\HB 277 would allow regions such as metro Atlanta to submit a transportation project list and a 1 percent sales tax to voters in 2012 for their approval. The bill is a victory for business groups that fought years for transportation funding. It's a mixed bag for mass transit advocates, who said it treated MARTA unfairly but were glad it would create a major funding source that could be spent on projects other than roads, unlike the state gas tax.\HB 1446 and part of HB 277 would raise the tax cap so Clayton County, which canceled its bus service this year, could call a referendum and have the County Commission vote on whether to raise a sales tax to join MARTA, said Rep. Roberta Abdul-Salaam. Some commissioners who voted to cancel the service expressed concerns about such a move.\SR 821 would go to the voters for a referendum on whether the state Department of Transportation should be allowed to sign multiyear contracts without having the money for the entire contract amount set aside at the beginning. Sponsors say it could free up millions of dollars, but the governor's office expressed fiscal concern.\SB 305 would raise the cap for the amount of ""design-build"" work that the DOT can contract by bundling the design work with the construction contract, rather than bidding out the construction alone by low bid. The DOT's planning director says it would make for more efficient and cheaper projects when engineering can be done simultaneously with construction, saving time.\Water\SB 370 calls for state standards requiring water utilities to detect leaks. And beginning in 2012, builders would be required to use ""efficient water fixtures"" in all new residential and commercial construction. Builders would also be required to use ""submetering"" for new apartment buildings to measure water use for each unit.\HB 406 was intended to help build a reservoir in south Fulton County, but it was broadened late Thursday. Atlanta lost assurances it would hold onto $125 million a year in new sales taxes to make up for the loss of revenue from water customers in south Fulton.\Additionally, the Water Stewardship Act would direct eight state agencies to develop incentives for communities to conserve water. For example, water-saving communities could find it easier to obtain lower-interest state loans and apply more frequently for state grants.\Education\SB 84 would tighten ethics and training requirements for local school board members. It would give the state power to step in when a school system risks losing accreditation, including the removal of board members.\HB 977, a feel-good political bill, would bar school systems from using state funds to raise administrators' pay if they furlough teachers and other employees the same year.\SB 299 would change the state's policy on ""zero tolerance"" discipline in schools, giving them more discretion in how they handle disciplinary cases. It was inspired by the case of a Morgan County student who was kicked out of school after accidentally bringing a fishing knife to class.\HB 908 is a budget-related bill that would allow school systems to expand class sizes over the next three years to save money.\Driving and texting\HB 23, sponsored by Rep. Matt Ramsey (R-Peachtree City), would ban Class D drivers, mostly teenagers, from talking on cellphones while driving.\SB 360 would ban texting by all drivers. Sponsored by Sen. Jack Murphy (R-Cumming), the bill will be known as the Caleb Sorohan Act, named after a Morgan County teenager who died while texting and driving.\Carrying a firearm\SB 308, sponsored by Sen. Mitch Seabaugh (R-Sharpsburg), would let licensed gun owners carry them in bars where the owners allow it and in the parking lots of colleges, courthouses and jails. It would eliminate the ban on guns within 1,000 feet of schools and colleges.\Property tax reform\SB 346, written by Senate Majority Leader Chip Rogers (R-Woodstock), would require that every property owner receive an annual Notice of Assessment guaranteeing a right to appeal. Assessment notices must contain an estimated property tax. The appeal period is widened from 30 days to 45 days.\Seat belts\HB 22 would require pickup truck drivers to abide by the same seat belt requirements that have applied to car drivers in Georgia since 1988.\Animal cruelty\HB 788, known as Grace's Law, would prohibit the use of gas chambers at animal shelters in Georgia effective Dec. 31. It would mandate euthanasia by injection, which supporters of the bill said is more humane.\Roadkill\SB 474 would allow drivers to keep any bear or deer that they run over. The so-called ""Roadkill Bill"" was written by Sen. Don Thomas (R-Dalton).\Health care\This bill would prohibit mandatory participation in any federal health care system and was attached as an amendment to SB 411, the Healthy Georgians Act of 2010. The amendment was part of language originally crafted by Sen. Judson Hill (R-Marietta), who said his amendment would protect Georgians' rights on their health care choices.\Bills that passedBills that failed\Online\For a complete review of this year's legislation, go to the Georgia General Assembly's Web site at www.legis.state.ga.us and the Georgia Politics page on ajc.com.Abortion\A revision of a controversial abortion bill was thought to have gotten a big final push on Thursday from House Speaker David Ralston (R-Blue Ridge). The legislation, however, never got to the floor. Ralston told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution last week that an abortion bill that was before the House, SB 529, was unacceptable as written. He proposed an alternative he thought was more constitutionally sound and not designed to encourage a court fight.\It has been at least five years since abortion was a dominant issue during a legislative session. In February, Georgia Right to Life began a push for legislation that would make it a 10-year felony for a physician to perform an abortion if the patient discloses that she is having the procedure because of objections to the race or gender of the fetus. It also would make it a crime for the physician to perform an abortion if the patient were coerced into ending a pregnancy.\The original bill, HB 1155, never made it out of House committee. Supporters in the Senate, however, picked up the mantle and in late March passed SB 529.\Microchips\Sponsored by Sen. Chip Pearson (R-Dawsonville), SB 235 sought to prohibit the requiring of a person to be implanted with a microchip. It did not make it past Crossover Day.\Education\HB 521 was a key initiative of Gov. Sonny Perdue that would have made student performance part of teachers' job evaluations. Perdue initially also wanted to mandate that teachers' pay depend on how students performed on tests, but that bill, SB 386, failed to get out of committee.\Taken together, HB 1121/HB 1111 would have made it unlawful to tamper with state tests or help others cheat on them. Perdue endorsed the bills, but lawmakers balked at some of the penalties, which included finding violators guilty of a misdemeanor and taking away their pensions.\Milton County\HR 21 would have allowed for the re-creation of Milton County out of what is now north Fulton County.\CAPTION: Speaker of the House David Ralston swings his gavel to adjourn the Georgia Legislature's 2010 session Thursday.

174," Mother did not commit murder\ Responses to ""Murder charged in fire death,"" AJC Gwinnett News, April 15.\ Gwinnett County District Attorney Danny Porter should reconsider the charges against Sherita Jones. He should try to understand why a mother might leave her children so she could financially provide for them.\ Although I do not know Ms. Jones, I do know women forced to take a chance with their children's safety so that they can maintain a roof over their head and so that they will not face starvation or the humiliation of abject poverty, which is another form of death.\ I have witnessed situations where the responsibility for providing for the family financially and caring for the child has fallen squarely on the woman's shoulders whether a man is present or not. This is especially prevalent in low-income communities.\ I am by no means excusing child endangerment. But I am shedding light on what I believe is this woman's humanity. She did not murder her child.\ Imagine for a moment, a young woman struggling to care for her children. She finds a job making barely above minimum wage. Child care is $300 a week for two children who are barely above toddler age. She can't afford child care; but maybe she doesn't have the skills or education that would allow her to quit her job and replace it easily. Perhaps she makes a choice, a bad one, to go to work and leave her children alone. She might tell herself that they will be fine, that they won't even notice that she is gone. They'll just be sleeping, she says to herself.\ This is happening all over the country. My mother left me alone so that she could keep us from homelessness and starvation. My mother was lucky. Ms. Jones was not.\ The district attorney should not charge this woman with murder because she made a mistake and her lucky ran out.\ BEVERLY AARONS, Stone Mountain\ Murder charge not warranted in fire death\ Sherita Jones should not be charged with murder. Someone needs to start a petition to get these charges dropped.\ If the United States had a system set up where day care was free, we would not have to worry about a tragedy as this one is described to be.\ I make only $28,000 a year. I'm a single parent with two children. I receive no child support. Most of my income goes for day care, leaving me and my kids short in many other areas such as clothes, money for trips at school, recreational activities. We are barely above the poverty line.\ Some women might see no other way but to leave their children and go to work.\ Child care is a major dilemma for single moms.\ HEATHER WASHINGTON, Marietta\ Re-entry programs need to be changed\ We read every year the same story about the RN [registered nurse] shortage.\ It's old news that does not relate the entire story.\ Hospital administrators and others bemoan the fact that almost 20 percent of RNs nationwide choose not to work in their profession. More than 15 percent choose to leave it each year. Hospital administrators, such as Linda Matzigkeit, Children's Healthcare senior vice president for human resources, say they are ""relentless"" in getting these individuals to come back. They ask, ""How can we get them?""\ Yet, the state nursing board and the hospitals make it extremely difficult and costly for RNs who have not worked for a number of years in the profession to ""re-enter"" it. The existing re-entry programs put in place by administrators require RNs to essentially work without commensurate pay for a month, if not longer, to get re- certified.\ What incentive is there for these ""soccer moms,"" as Ms. Matzigkeit calls them, to dedicate so much time and money to go back to a profession that underpays and underappreciates their efforts?\ When hospitals and the state agencies finally understand that they need to be less bureaucratic, maybe they will be able to dip into the RN pool that left the profession.\ JOEL GOOBICH, Duluth\ State needs to fund schools for expansion\ Thank you for your article regarding the critical nursing shortage.\ I am currently taking pre-nursing courses at Kennesaw State, and will be attending Vanderbilt's nursing school in the fall.\ I believe state nursing schools lack the funding to expand their programs to educate more people who want to be nurses.\ Clearly, training as many new nurses as possible is the best way to combat the nursing shortage. Why don't state legislatures see this as a priority?\ I was told by an administrator that only 10 percent of the 600 applicants to Kennesaw's nursing school were accepted last year. The situation is such that a person needs all As to get into the nursing school. I know many Kennesaw students who have re-taken courses they get Bs or Cs in to get into the nursing school after they have been denied admission. Does this not sound like a huge waste?\ There are plenty of capable, intelligent people who may have a couple of Bs --- or even a few Bs, and one or two Cs --- but would make great nurses. There is no space for these people, eager to be nurses.\ Most people I know cannot afford to attend private nursing schools.\ Why the lack of space? I have heard there are not enough instructors and that schools have been denied funding to expand the nursing programs.\ If we want to prevent the baby boomers from facing an absolute health care crisis as conditions in hospitals worsen due to the RN shortage, state funding must be provided to allow all qualified applicants to become educated.\ NATALIE FINK, Marietta (East Cobb)\ Cycling cuts into revenue\ A very good article on bicycling in metro Atlanta.\ I moved from Dunwoody, in DeKalb County, to Forsyth County. Granted, the roads are less traveled, but most lack any ""traffic calming lanes,"" (TCLs).\ TCLs are 2- to 3-foot-wide shoulders painted on the roadway edge. The good thing about TCLs is that there is no fuss, no public hearings, etc. --- just paint. A major advantage of TCLs is that they do slow traffic down because the [driving area] is narrower.\ If the truth be known, the DOTs around the country don't want bicyclists on state roads because it will cut into their gas tax revenue. Imagine, 10,000 bicyclists riding to work every day will save about 1.5 gallons of gas per day per cyclist. That's 15,000 gallons of gasoline.\ But of more concern is the $3,500 per day or $750,000 per year loss of state and federal gasoline tax.\ DICK GELLNER, Cumming\ Tough to bike without car, rack\ I read Rick Badie's column twice the other day --- once with my morning coffee and once after I returned home from a ride on the Alpharetta greenway.\ What a shame that from the intersection of Spalding Drive and Holcomb Bridge Road in Peachtree Corners there are no sane-risk bike routes that connect anywhere.\ Holcomb Bridge Road/Jimmy Carter Boulevard ought to have one. Peachtree Parkway and Peachtree Industrial Boulevard ought to have one, too.\ As Rick found out, it takes tremendous faith in your own invincibility to brave any of those routes.\ From where I live, it doesn't make a great deal of sense to try getting anywhere on a bike without a car and a bike rack. How stupid is that?\ Although I was an urban bike warrior in St. Louis, when I was in my 20s and immortal, the arrival of kids and the significance of the word ""orphan"" pretty much limit my local bicycling to the Silver Comet, the Alpharetta Greenway or the Roswell River Road. What terrific assets those are.\ Maybe $3 gas will generate some pressure on planners to reconsider.\ I suspect the successful models for bike paths in metro D.C., Portland, Ore., and the Bay area of San Francisco are dismissed by our local leadership as blue state liberalism run amok. We'd never want to make any low-cost transportation alternatives available to people in Gwinnett or Cobb who are going less than 10 miles each way.\ Just super-size that order, keep sending troops to the Middle East, and don't stop cranking $75 a tank into those Suburbans with two people in 'em.\ Keep up the good work.\ VERN HERR, Norcross\ Road improvements needed\ Thank you for a well-written article on how unfriendly Atlanta's roads are to cyclists.\ Many people think that it's the motorist that is unfriendly, when it's really the road.\ It's a chicken-and-egg problem: People don't bike because the roads aren't bicycle-friendly, and the politicians don't improve the roads because people don't bike on them.\ I would love to bike to work (I work off Sugarloaf Parkway and Ga. 316), but while Sugarloaf has bike lanes, Old Peachtree is too scary to ride during rush hour.\ I have even considered taking my bike on the Gwinnett bus system, except with the routes they have, it would take me 90 minutes to get to work, whereas I can get there in 15 minutes by car.\ So, I'm forced to drive.\ KINNEY BACON, Collins Hill area\ Bicycle commuters 'feel your pain'\ From one of many bike commuters out there who know what you're talking about, thanks for giving it a try, and thanks for the press. We ""feel your pain.""\ MIKE GOODMAN, Decatur\ Side road minimizes risks\ Thank you for attempting to commute to work by bike! It really can be a lot of fun.\ Before I changed buildings at work --- which affected my access to a shower, important when you work in a professional environment - -- and then a move to Cobb County with virtually no mass transit, I regularly rode to the North Springs MARTA station from my home.\ I miss those early morning rides. With gas prices on the rise, I am thinking about driving halfway into work and then riding the other half.\ More needs to be done to encourage cycling to work. It's environmentally friendly and a whole lot of fun.\ I agree there are roads that one should not ride down. I've ridden down many of them myself --- Holcomb Bridge Road, Jimmy Carter Boulevard, etc.\ If you can find side roads that parallel the main arteries, there is often less traffic. This makes cycling to work safer and more enjoyable.\ TRISH ALBERT, Smyrna\ CAPTION: Bicycle safety gear.\ CAPTION: Sherita Jones"
175,"Teachers' excuses don't add up\While I agree with some of what Scott Allen says regarding the responsibilities of middle schools, he trots out the tired mantra I hear from many teachers: Blame the parents (""Stop excuses; require pupils to master math,"" @issue, May 30).\When did it become the responsibility of parents to teach their children math? I know it's not being taught in school, because I was forced to teach both my sons basic math when they went through the system. It wasn't my job, but clearly someone had to teach them.\I tire of hearing from teachers that somehow it's no longer their job to teach. I am the product of an early-1960s Catholic education. We had one teacher, no teacher aides and classroom sizes of up to 50 students. Yet somehow we were taught well, with little or no homework. I still remember basic algebra and geometry and am thankful for the education I received.\Before any teachers write back, I do agree that discipline in our schools needs to be enforced and parents need to stop viewing their children as victims when they misbehave in class.\J. KEITH CONTARINO\Marietta\Good math teachers make the grade\The 40 percent failure rate on the eighth-grade CRCT math test is not uniform all over the state. My child's excellent eighth-grade math teacher told her classes last week that she was delighted that all her students had passed the test, every one. It takes a competent mathematician to teach this new curriculum. The state Department of Education needs to work on helping our less successful math teachers get up to speed.\ANN JACKSON\Roswell\Adverse societal factors affect students' performance\Failing schools? Ineffective teachers? Why does society continue to put its head in the sand when so many other factors scream at us from the pages of the AJC?\In Sunday's paper alone: Sexual abuse is a reality for 20 percent to 33 percent of our youth (""A forum for abused girls,"" Metro, June 1); substance abuse is part of daily life for 30 percent to 50 percent of students in grades eight to 12 (""Teenage drinking,"" Page One, June 1); lack of medical care is a reality for 1.7 million Georgians and emergency rooms can turn away almost anyone unable to pay (""Primary-care predicament,"" @issue, June 1).\While the present and former governors play the blame game, symbolizing the political posturing that is always at work (""The right road for schools,"" @issue, June 1), schools and teachers are left to frantically chase test scores that do nothing but provide a scapegoat for society's frustrations. Students who are sexually abused, on drugs and/or alcohol or are sick and/or hurting care little for math, science, history, test scores or their future. What many teachers do provide, along with education --- an encouraging word, concern, a smile --- is seldom reported and never measured.\DONNA DOUGLASS\Marietta\Quantifiably counterproductive\The CRCT and other standardized testing all sounded very good. Its principles were supposedly grounded in solid research and testing, so say the experts. The models would create a revolution in learning. America's children would gain the competitive advantage in the world of the learned. \After many years and billions of dollars, it hasn't happened. School systems are struggling to understand why children are not learning at predicted rates. The paradigm shift from the principles of a qualitative learning environment to quantitative was very subtle. It has not gone well.\Business management models do not work well within educational curricula systems or the classroom. When will we learn that everything cannot be quantified? Teach kids how to read, how to write, how to think and how to reason, not just how to test. The results will surprise you.\RONALD JOHNSON\Austell\---\Gas tax\Funds needed for transit\Once again our governor has proved his inability or unwillingness to see anything beyond his nose. Halting the tax increase of 3 cents per gallon of gasoline will do nothing because the oil companies will keep increasing their profit and yet convince their paid lawmakers to give them subsidy at the expense of the taxpayers.\Earmarking the increase to plan, fund and operate a comprehensive and people-friendly public transport system would have done more good in the long run and prepared our state to prosper in the future.\How long will we be able to attract business without improving our infrastructure? Absence of a viable transportation system from Hartsfield-Jackson airport alone is estimated to cost business over $3 billion a year. I do hope that we elect a governor who does something for all of Georgia and does not just listen to the special interests.\PAVITTAR SAFIR\Roswell\Gimme a break --- a real one\Dear Gov. Perdue: Thanks so much for the 3-cents-a-gallon tax break!\I calculated if I drive 12,000 miles a year at 17 miles per gallon, your tax break would save me a whopping $21.18 a year. Oh, by the way, my check for $169.41 for the 2008 ad valorem tax is in the mail. Thanks again for the 3-cents-a-gallon tax break.\BOB CUDNIK\Cumming\---\Maybe term limits will make lawmakers more courageous\I've read several articles and letters lately citing a lack of leadership in Georgia as the primary reason nothing significant is being done to relieve traffic congestion. Much of the progress our civilization and nation have made is attributable to great leaders and not-so-great leaders who made courageous decisions in the face of anger from the voting public. We constituents occasionally need a dose of ""tough love"" to save us from our own shortsightedness and willingness to delay spending until a crisis erupts.\Today's career-minded politicians are most likely to make the more popular decision, whether or not it best serves their constituents. One solution might be to impose term limits, so a politician can make good decisions knowing with certainty that he or she is going to be thrown out of office regardless.\BIRNEY A. MONTCALM\Douglasville\Less commentary enhances game\Last Saturday, as I was watching the Braves vs. Reds game on Fox, audio technical problems prevented the commentary from being transmitted, and the only sounds came from the field --- the fan noise, crack of the bat, etc. It was a delightful experience, almost like being in the stands. It forced me to concentrate on the game more, follow the pitch count, and I felt like I was in Cincinnati.\I am not suggesting that play-by-play commentary should be dropped. However, it was refreshing, and maybe Fox should consider scaling back on the talk and emphasizing more skillful camera video and stadium audio.\EMANUEL ROTH\Atlanta\More parents need to confront their kids\Kudos to Bonnie Clotfelter and her parents for telling their story in an open forum (""Substance abuse trap,"" Page One, June 1). A deeper question is, where are the parents of Bonnie's friends with whom she drinks in a friend's basement where everyone was playing drinking games ""with a lack of supervision""?\Can and will the parents of Bonnie's friends and the parents of their friends' friends have the same strength and courage to confront their own kids' drinking and drug (ab)use, or will they remain in denial? It's uplifting to read Bonnie's story on the front page and sense the deep hope for recovery, instead of on the obituary page, where hope is gone and only despair and denial remain.\Life is choices. Hopefully, many of these other parents will make equally wise and courageous choices.\PETER VAJDA\Sandy Springs\Wanted: Politicians with vision of future\The articles on debt that connected some of our state legislators with financial ties to the banking industry (""No rush on debt relief in Georgia,"" Page One, June 1) and the article by former Gov. Roy Barnes on North Carolina's proven map for success in education (""The right road for schools,"" @issue, June 1) had something in common. In both articles, North Carolina had an excellent track record with regard to the use of public money for public welfare.\It would require a little intellectual curiosity to inquire as to how that state and others have done so well by their citizens. But in the more than 45 years that I have lived in Georgia, I have been amazed at the narrow and self-serving mentality of many state legislators.\They care more about fishing tournaments, golf courses and making a quick buck for themselves. They seem to have no larger vision as to how to improve this state for the larger community of citizens, many of whom are students and all of whom are consumers. Georgians, please consider how you vote this November.\ANNETTE BURDGES\Roswell\CAPTION: LOUIE FAVORITE / Staff Corey Richardson helps prepare a fifth-grade classroom for CRCT summer school.

Metro Final
\
When it comes to managing the side effects of metro Atlanta's manic march across the landscape, the buck never stops. No issue has pointed that out as clearly as the area's efforts to come to grips with its air pollution. State and regional officials' inability even to make a plan for clearing up lung-burning ozone smog has put 13 counties off limits to federal funds for new road projects, and will mean increasingly strict limits on new or expanding industry and large commercial developments. The situation could last ""from two years to forever,"" regional planner Joel Stone said.
\
At stake is nothing less than the region's economy and quality of life, which have made metro Atlanta a middle-class mecca, economists and planners say. As a result, some of the region's political and business leaders, who had been either dismissive or ignorant of the potential penalties, suddenly are in a panic mode. ""Post-Olympics, we're one of the most attractive areas in the country to do business,"" said Sam Williams, president of the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce. ""But with our inability to manage growth and respond to environmental challenges, we will forfeit that Olympic dividend --- and more.""
\
The state, local and federal officials who must deal with the air quality problem, meanwhile, are in blame-shifting mode. The state Environmental Protection Division (EPD) concedes that its own plan for improving air quality in the region doesn't comply with the federal Clean Air Act, largely because officials at the Atlanta Regional Commission haven't done enough to cut car emissions. The ARC, which makes plans but has no power to implement them, says the EPD itself made that impossible by rejecting its recommendations. The former chairman of the ARC, lieutenant governor candidate Randy Poynter, is trying to score political points by threatening to sue the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to stop it from enforcing air pollution laws. At the same time, a coalition of citizens groups is contemplating a suit against federal agencies for being too lenient on Atlanta.
\
The state Department of Transportation (DOT), aware since the early 1990s that this day was coming, sought to build as many roads as possible before the spigot was shut off, and it fought moves to shift money to rail and other modes. Critics say that led to more vehicle emissions and made the problem harder to solve.
\
With state agencies doing little more than pointing fingers at each other, and with powerful development interests loathe to slow the growth engine, virtually every knowledgeable observer points to Gov. Zell Miller as the one official with the power to demand a coherent state strategy.
\
But Miller doesn't want to touch this one.
\
He has been an enormously popular governor, and even one willing to take an occasional unpopular stance, but he has been unwilling to step into this mess and force the hard decisions that will anger metro Atlanta commuters or development interests, or both --- especially with his political retirement only months away. Informed of the subject of this article, Miller refused to be interviewed. ""Dodging issues is not what he was elected to do,"" said Bill Byrne, chairman of the Cobb County Commission. ""When our economic machine is about to come to a screeching halt and the governor won't address it. . .to say I'm disappointed in Zell Miller, a man for whom I had great respect, would be a major understatement.""
\
Byrne and other members of the ARC are perturbed because when Miller finally ended his long silence on the issue in December, it was to belittle the ARC's call for the clean-burning type of gasoline used in California.
\
Likening the cleaner fuel's additional 26 cents a gallon cost to a tax increase, which he opposes, Miller instead called for reductions in solo driving by state employees during the summer ozone season. He also lifted his previous opposition to funding a plan for a rail line to Athens, and advocated tax credits for low emission vehicles.
\
But the governor's plan would get the region nowhere close to the emissions reductions needed by 1999 in order to go on spending federal road money, while the ARC plan would. Either way, neither the state nor the ARC acted early enough to plan and lay the political groundwork for the sacrifices that would be needed from motorists in time to comply with a federal mandate.
\
It's almost impossible to fix the air quality problem without major sacrifices, environmental officials say, because at an average pushing 35 miles per day, metro Atlantans drive more than motorists anywhere else in the world --- and the mileage is rising. The ARC projects that in 20 years, metro motorists will drive a total of 170 million miles a day, or 70 percent more than they do now.
\
All those vehicles spew emissions that produce ground level ozone, which sends asthmatics to the hospital and is especially harmful to children, the elderly and those who exercise outdoors. The short-term measures required to clean up cars and Georgia Power's coal plants --- some of which are among the dirtiest in the nation --- are tough enough to impose, given the voting power of car-loving commuters and the political power of the state's biggest utility. Thornier still are the long term issues of how to cope with the area's growth.
\
But after two decades of wildfire expansion, the federal government has given the region an ultimatum: Learn how to manage growth in a sustainable way, or lose the federal largesse that has helped to fuel it.
\
""When are we going to have the discussion about how we want to grow, how we want to accommodate all the people coming to take our terrific jobs?"" said Helen Tapp, executive director of the Regional Business Coalition, an alliance of metro business organizations that has made the air quality problem its top priority. ""What we're really talking about is how we all want to live, not regulation for the sake of regulation.""
\
Donald Ratajczak, director of the economic forecasting center at Georgia State University, agreed.
\
""If we don't find a solution for accommodating the people coming in, we'll find that the solution is to choke off the growth by deteriorating quality of life,"" he said. ""That's one way of solving the problem: to stop being attractive.""
\
The effects are already being felt, noted Randy Cardoza, commissioner of the state Department of Industry, Trade and Tourism. Harley-Davidson recently cited air quality limits in its decision not to build a motorcycle plant in the metro area, and Lucent Technologies in Gwinnett had a months-long struggle to get clearance for an expansion.
\
""In the future we are going to lose out to Charlotte and other cities that don't have this problem,"" Cardoza said.
\
But there is no sign that anyone is ready or able to lead the region out of the dangerous corner it drove itself into.
\
The state Legislature has spent more time in the current session pushing to weaken trout stream protections than debating any measure aimed at mitigating growth-related problems. DOT Commissioner Wayne Shackelford, himself a former shopping center developer, has said he believes the ban on road-building in the 13-county air pollution zone will only fuel suburban sprawl by sending developers to the next tier of counties outside the restricted zone. ""Obviously, road improvements will be made in those areas,"" Shackelford said, adding that it will be up to local governments to manage the development that comes as a result. ""We don't make land use decisions. We're going to continue to invest in roads and let the local governments make those decisions."" That is bad news to Harold Reheis, the director of EPD. ""If we start concentrating activities just outside the 13-county area, that doesn't help solve the problem on the inside, and may just spread it,"" Reheis said. He would prefer to see metro Atlanta take advantage of a provision in the Clean Air Act that allows federal money to be spent on regional rail, express bus service and other alternatives, if they're shown to help air quality.
\
But metro Atlanta has no agency empowered to plan and implement transit regionally, and no funding source for the required local match to federal money. Such an agency would have to be created by the state. Currently available transportation money, from the state's gas tax, is limited to roads only, and Shackelford has fought every initiative to change that. In the last year of his last term as governor, Miller is not likely to resolve those contradictory impulses within his administration, political observers said. After all, Miller chose Shackelford and installed him through a power play against the DOT board in his first year as governor.
\
""We need some leaders to talk about these issues, some real, new leaders,"" Williams said.
\
The state will get a new leader in January in the form of a new governor, who will inherit this huge problem. But whoever wins the gubernatorial election is not likely to have nearly as much political clout as Miller does, especially in the early going.
\
In states that have sought to plan for their growth, the move usually was led by a governor. Most recently, Maryland adopted a Smart Growth law aimed at restricting state dollars to targeted growth areas. Gov. Parris Glendening pushed the law through.
\
But in Georgia, none of the 14 announced candidates for governor have made metro Atlanta's crisis a central issue. And one leading candidate, Republican Guy Millner, is pushing to make it cheaper to drive by lowering tag fees.
\
But priorities will change after the election, Democratic and Republican party officials predicted. ""If it's not part of the campaign, it'll be part of the agenda afterward,"" said Joe King, executive director of the Georgia Republican Party. ""For metro Atlanta, managing its growth has got to be top priority, especially as it affects quality of life, public health and the environment. You have to have some leadership from the top, and it would have to be the governor."" And that governor will have to overcome serious obstacles at the local level, said Peter Katz, a nationally known urban theorist. ""One of the flaws in the system is that developer money is so pervasive in local government,"" Katz said. ""That undermines all the good intentions a politician may go into office with. I'm not sure how you fix this. It usually takes a crisis.""

"
177,"
In 1952, rebounding from a World War and facing a wide-open future, planners hatched grand designs for Atlanta and its emerging suburbs.
\
Along with proposals for building mass transit, creating a loop around town (eventually called I-285) and opening Stone Mountain Park, the plan they called ""Up Ahead"" went like this: lure new development in concentrated areas around existing cities and leave lots of land open or underdeveloped in between.
\
The last bit was a problem.
\
""That idea was not well received by the general public and leaders at the time. So ill-received, some people feared for their lives about being ridden out of town on a rail,"" said Harry West, director of the Atlanta Regional Commission (ARC), the agency now in charge of planning for the 10-county metro area.
\
Two years later, the concentrated growth idea was abandoned and replaced with ""concentric"" patterns ---planning and dividing development in circles out from Atlanta's center. The idea stuck around for 43 years. Today, Atlanta and its suburbs have more than 3 million people and ring after ring of shopping centers, office parks, malls and cul-de-sac subdivisions. It's a land of Little League fields and pollution-causing, car-clogged roads.
\
Now, planners are at it again. And at least one of their designs sounds eerily like what their postwar predecessors tossed out four decades ago.
\
Assessing the future
\
Beginning Wednesday in 12 forums in every county and the city of Atlanta, the ARC will hold ""future forums"" to ask for residents' input on specific projects that fall under two different philosophies:
\
One ---assumes future growth will continue as it is, primarily in spread-out suburbs. Some examples of projects that would apply: commuter rail lines radiating from Atlanta; express bus service and incentives to use MARTA; additional gas tax to push motorists to drive less; but no real change in land-use policies or zoning.
\
Two ---assumes most of the future growth will be restricted to concentrated pockets around cities or already urbanized areas. Some examples of projects that would apply: more heavy rail transit such as MARTA; people-mover systems; increasing the requirements for car emissions; and changes in development policies to support the heavier development in some areas and less in others.
\
The forums and proposals are part of the work the ARC is scurrying to accomplish on three plans to chart the region's water supply, transportation and development through the next 20 years ---while at the same time accommodating 1 million more residents. Approval for the development and water plans are set for December. But ARC officials this past week said they expect the transportation plan will be delayed until March.
\
Environmental concerns
\
The ARC must show its list of transportation projects and policies for the region can reduce pollution from car and truck traffic enough to meet federal air quality standards. If not, the metro area could lose $600 million in federal money for road-building projects.
\
""It's a daunting challenge,"" said Julie Keeton, a community relations director for Technology Park/Atlanta Inc. and a new citizen representative on the 39-member ARC board of local elected officials and business people. ""I feel certain there's a solution, but I'm sure we won't make everyone happy. We have to have clean air and we have to have clean water and we have to find a place to put a million more people. ... We also have to deal with what's in place. It's not like you can start from ground zero and say, `Here, build a new Atlanta'.""
\
That's why Sally Flocks worries pedestrians will get lost in the shuffle. As president of the nonprofit Pedestrians Educating Drivers on Safety, she thinks cars and buses are already the region's first priority. Flocks is part of a core group of about 100 residents, each with their own interest, helping the ARC with its plans.
\
Making roads safer
\
""As the city has grown, motorists have seen a need to drive faster and faster,"" said Flocks, who has lived in Midtown for 19 years and not been able to drive because of epilepsy. She received her driver's license six weeks ago. ""The more sprawl, the harder the access.""
\
Changing the mindset, if that's what residents say they want, won't be easy. Gary Lawrence, director of the University of Washington's Center for Sustainable Communities, said regions across the country are rethinking their fate. But many are finding politics gets in the way.
\
""Some elected officials really prefer to be forced by the feds,"" Lawrence said. ""This idea that you are giving up local control as part of the metropolitan solution, it's really hard for some to do. ... In order for metro strategies to work, you have to have incentives and disincentives to change behaviors. People have learned not to listen to words but to follow the power and to follow the money.""
\
Public must have a say
\
All of that is what makes Roger Hale skeptical. Hale, who owns his own computer documentation and training company in Lawrenceville, took part in the ARC forums this spring, but doesn't believe the ARC is really listening and wonders whether it will have any impact on how greater Atlanta grows.
\
""It's more of a pep rally type of thing that says, `Here's what we are going to do for you whether you like it or not',"" said Hale, who thinks the agency's stamp of approval early this year on the new Mall of Georgia at Mill Creek near Buford was flawed. ""Why patronize us?""
\
Federal rules require public participation in choosing transportation projects for the region. ARC Planning Director Joel Stone emphatically says the public's feedback will get to the politicians: ""We're not playing games with the public just for the sake of being able to check off a box.""
\
ARC FUTURE FORUMS A TIME FOR YOU TO SPEAK UP
\
Dates and locations for the second round of the ARC Future Forums ---and a few thoughts on what each county has at stake in planning for the future. Each forum will be held from 7 to 8:30 p.m. For more information, call the ARC hotline at 404-364-4228.
\
WEDNESDAY Henry County Commission Room 345 Phillips Drive, McDonough One of the fastest-growing counties in the state, tiny Henry County has been feeling a major housing boom. New-home sales for 1996 were up by 58 percent. The county, with about 92,000 residents, is expected in mid-1998 to exceed 100,000.
\
THURSDAY DeKalb County Manuel Maloof Auditorium 1300 Commerce Drive, Decatur Infill development is important to this very urban county. Its new homestead option sales tax, one that no other county in the country offers, is supposed to give homeowners more than a 35 percent cut in property taxes beginning in 1999. Local leaders hope it will prompt a boom in homeownership.
\
AUG. 25 Gwinnett County Justice and Administration Center Auditorium 75 Langley Drive, Lawrenceville The fastest-growing county in the United States during the 1980s, it is still adding large numbers of residents at a fast clip. Its population already has more people than the city of Atlanta and is expected to double that by 2020. Its chairman, Wayne Hill, wants to be ARC chairman next year.
\
AUG. 26 Fayette County Public Meeting Room, Administrative Complex 140 W. Stonewall Ave., Fayetteville The once-rural county has become a full-fledged suburb. Peachtree City, whose 26,000 residents can navigate a network of nearly 70 miles without ever getting in a car, is often cited as a model planned community.
\
AUG. 28 Cobb County Board of Commissioners' Meeting Room 100 Cherokee St., Marietta With booming areas along the Cumberland/Galleria area, posh neighborhoods in east Cobb and huge planned developments such as Towne Lake, the already-large suburban county is still a magnet for growth. Together, Gwinnett, Fulton and Cobb counties account for nearly 60 percent of the region's net increase in houses and apartments since 1990.
\
SEPT. 3 Cherokee County Canton Justice Center, Jury Assembly Room 90 North St., Canton Cherokee has embarked on a giant reorganization of how it views zoning and planning. It has hired a new planner to classify land into special village districts, which restrict development to certain areas and lays guidelines for how buildings look, and decide on everything from green space to the size of signs.
\
SEPT. 4 Clayton County Board Room, Administration Building 112 Smith St., Jonesboro As home of Hartsfield International Airport, the county is divided between the more urban northwestern end and the less developed southern end. Residents and planners are revising the comprehensive land-use plan to call for larger new homes in developing areas in the panhandle and northeast.
\
SEPT. 8 Rockdale County Nancy Guinn Library 864 Green St., Conyers This tiny eastern suburban county has been slowly prepping itself for growth, laying the groundwork by building a major water reservoir. Officials have even sponsored a contest to suspend zoning rules to a developer who can create an ideal community on about 300 acres. SEPT. 9 Douglas County County Water and Sewer Authority 8761 Hospital Drive, Douglasville Planning for a proposed new mall that it hopes will herald a growth spurt, county officials have complained that the western suburbs have been ignored by the prosperous northern arc. Several large projects proposed near and around the mall site are pushing it to full-fledged suburban status.
\
SEPT. 10 South Fulton County South Fulton Service Center (Annex) 5600 Stonewall Tell Road, College Park Officials have been working to attract what they say is ""quality development"" to the Southside, and residents have been in battles of late to fend off a truck-train facility from Fairburn. The south Chattahoochee River, largely undeveloped and with various industrial sites, is the focus of an ARC study.
\
SEPT. 11 North Fulton County Roswell City Hall, Council chambers, second floor 38 Hill St., Roswell Explosive housing growth has lured office towers and a mall to north Fulton, bringing with them both a crush of cars and a demand for more services. Ga. 400 and the Chattahoochee River have been golden corridors for the area, sewing together the new growth. But zoning clashes over apartments and more growth have been escalating.
\
SEPT. 18 City of Atlanta Antioch North Baptist Church 540 Kennedy St., Atlanta The city is projected to lose population in the coming decades, and is trying to fend off the loss of major downtown employers. Atlanta has 12 percent of the region's population, but 65 percent of the area's public housing and 78 percent of its impoveri; business growth in trendy Buckhead is booming.
\
THE MAJOR PLANS
\
Atlanta Regional Commission planners are working fast and furious to wrap up three major regional plans that will chart metro Atlanta's growth into the next two decades. The plans are supposed to create a big-picture vision for greater Atlanta's future in terms of air, land and water.
\
After a series of public forums in the next month, the 39-member ARC board is scheduled to sift through the plans at a retreat in October, and then vote on development and water plans by Dec. 3. The road plan will be finished next year.
\
Transportation: Required by federal law, the plan sets how federal money is spent in the 10 metro counties represented by the ARC during the next 20 years.
\
It must include: projected demand for transportation; solutions to handle traffic congestion; the ability to meet the Clean Air Act's air quality standards; and a strategy to pay for projects. It must show its projects can reduce air pollution, primarily nitrogen oxide, from car and truck emissions by enough to meet standards beginning 1999, through 2020.
\
Development: Called ""Detailing the Vision,"" the plan is part of the Georgia Planning Act of 1989. It requires local governments ---and then the ARC ---to create comprehensive plans to chart land use, environment, economic development, housing and human services. The development plan's policies are supposed to guide growth through 20 years. It is updated every 10 years.
\
Water supply: The state Department of Natural Resources uses the plan when issuing permits to local governments who want to withdraw water from rivers and streams or use the waterways for sewage treatment. It also helps local utility managers plan their water supply systems. It describes existing water supplies and forecasts future demand. The plan also will play a role in the so-called ""water wars"" among Alabama, Florida and Georgia over water rights in the Chattahoochee and Coosa river basins. Negotiators must determine how much water each state is allowed.
"
178," IMMIGRATION: Proposals seek to tighten loopholes\ Last year legislators drew national attention by making Georgia a less hospitable place for illegal immigrants to live. Now they might try to make the state a less inviting place for them to drive, too.\ Several lawmakers want to increase fines for motorists who drive without a license, use fake documents to obtain a license or secure license plates through fraudulent means. Sen. John Wiles (R- Marietta), who has proposed making driving without a license a felony on the third offense, said while he's not specifically targeting illegal immigrants, they would be most affected.\ ""I'm informed by law enforcement that the majority of the people who are charged with this are in the United States illegally,"" he said.\ More difficult will be preventing those motorists from driving Georgia roads undetected in the first place. In many counties, people claiming to be newcomers to Georgia now can obtain a tag if they furnish out-of-state or foreign driver's licenses. They're supposed to apply for a Georgia driver's license within 30 days, but many don't.\ Sen. Chip Rogers (R-Woodstock), who plans to introduce legislation that would tighten tag restrictions, said the trick will be closing the loophole without placing an undue burden on all Georgia drivers.\ Driving won't be the only privilege in the Legislature's cross hairs when it comes to illegal immigration, however. One bill pre- filed last month would try to eliminate tax exemptions on property owned by illegal immigrants, though the measure was vague on how that would be accomplished. Another proposal would make Georgia less accommodating of immigrants --- both legal and illegal --- who struggle with English. It would prohibit state and local governments from issuing official forms such as driver's exams in languages other than English.\ --- Brian Feagans\ EDUCATION: Dropout rates and vouchers on radar\ Vouchers will be the watchword in education policy this year. Already, Republican leaders are pushing two bills critics say open the door for taxpayer-funded support of private schools.\ Gov. Sonny Perdue has promised he'll once again try for a constitutional amendment to allow state money to go to religious groups that serve the needy. Lobbyists who represent teachers, administrators and school board members firmly oppose the plan, unless the amendment specifically prohibits money from going to private schools in the form of tuition vouchers.\ Senate President Pro Tem Eric Johnson (R-Savannah) also is promoting legislation that would create a state scholarship program for children with disabilities --- ranging from a speech impediment to autism --- so that they may attend private schools of their parents' choosing. Several education groups fear the program will drain funds from a public school system already struggling after years of cutbacks.\ Among other top education issues, expect some push back on long- awaited class size reductions, the rules of which became more inflexible and difficult for principals to manage this year; a call for an increase in the mandatory school age from 16 to 17 or 18 in an effort to reduce the number of dropouts; and a possible reappearance of a bill to restore a traditional academic calendar by requiring schools to open in late August.\ ""A great many people ran for office saying that education was their highest priority,"" remarked Tim Callahan, spokesman for the Professional Association of Georgia Educators, one of the state's largest teachers groups. ""Now we'll have to wait and see if that's really true.""\ --- Bridget Gutierrez\ TAXES: Ideas call for cuts and exemptions\ Major tax cuts are in the air, but it may be 2008 before lawmakers do more than talk about them.\ House leaders are talking up the idea of eliminating state income taxes, a favorite issue among Republicans. But the price-tag --- about $9 billion --- isn't doable without raising taxes in some other areas or eliminating sales tax exemptions much-prized by businesses and shoppers.\ Senators don't think the state can afford a major tax cut this year, but they'll almost certainly push for Gov. Sonny Perdue's proposal to eliminate retirement income taxes on well-to-do retirees. The change, which would, for instance, affect retired couples if their income is more than about $90,000 to $100,000 a year, would cost the state about $142 million. With Perdue's easy re- election win in November, lawmakers are likely to fulfill one of the few promises he made to voters.\ Slower revenue growth this year --- combined with rising school and health care costs --- means there won't be any new big-ticket programs this year. Perdue is likely to stick to his policy of spending what's needed, socking away money in reserves, and borrowing heavily to build more schools, college facilities and roads.\ --- James Salzer\ SUNDAY SALES: Uphill battle for looser alcohol laws\ One of the most contentious issues of the session may be Sunday beer and wine sales. The issue pits convenience stores and grocers against some Christian conservatives and liquor store owners.\ Convenience and grocery stores argue Georgia is one of only three states with a complete ban on Sunday beer and wine sales. They say Sunday is one of the busiest shopping days of the week, and polls show strong support for allowing Sunday beer and wine sales, especially in the Atlanta area. They also note that many restaurants and bars already are open on Sunday, selling beer and wine.\ Social conservatives say Georgians have enough days to buy alcohol without doing so on Sunday. They say Sunday is the Sabbath and should be reserved for honoring God. Liquor stores aren't open now on Sunday, and industry officials don't think they would make enough on Sundays to make it worth their while. Also, supporters are pushing only for beer and wine sales, not liquor sales. Convenience and grocery stores aren't allowed to sell liquor. Without allowing for liquor sales, liquor stores would be at a disadvantage on Sundays.\ Backers face two major hurdles. One is getting a bill past a Republican-led General Assembly that is squeamish about offending the religious right, no matter what the polls say. The other is Gov. Sonny Perdue, a Republican who doesn't drink and has vetoed legislation loosening Georgia alcohol laws in the past.\ --- James Salzer\ LOCAL GOVERNMENT: Incorporations pose financial toll\ For the past 15 years north Fulton County residents have talked about breaking off and reforming Milton County from Fulton's northern suburbs.\ This year, legislators hope the idea finally moves. They have reason to be optimistic.\ State Rep. Mark Burkhalter (R-Alpharetta) has made a career out of criticizing Fulton County and pushing for splitting the county in two. Now, he's speaker pro tem, and his party, the Republicans, are in charge of the General Assembly. They have already succeeded in getting three new northside cities formed --- Sandy Springs, Johns Creek and Milton --- a task once considered politically impossible.\ The debate over government representation has spread to nearby DeKalb County where Tucker and Dunwoody are both considering forming cities and CEO Vernon Jones has even floated the idea of incorporating the county as a city. In nearby Cobb County, residents of Vinings are toying with incorporation. In south Fulton, a June referendum is already set for two new southside cities.\ Rep. Jan Jones (R-Alpha-retta) plans to file legislation that would allow all of Fulton County north of Atlanta to break off and form the new county of Milton. Georgia is at its constitutionally mandated limit of 159 counties, but Jones' bill is expected to create an exemption that allows for the re-creation of a county that previously was merged into another county.\ That exception would apply only to Milton in north Fulton and Campbell in south Fulton. Both of those counties were merged into Fulton during the Depression because they didn't have enough money to fund their operations.\ Jones hopes to get the measure approved in the 2008 General Assembly and on the ballot as a statewide referendum in November 2008. Before that happens, Jones, Burkhalter and others will have to address major concerns such as funding for Grady Hospital and MARTA. Complicated legal and financial transactions from Fulton County would have to be resolved. Bonds already issued pledge the tax revenue from the entire county to repay them. The court system would have to be addressed. And, the financial impact to not only Fulton County but Atlanta would also have to be considered.\ --- David Bennett and Paul Kaplan\ DEVELOPMENT: Private companies want tax authority\ State lawmakers this session may consider giving subdivision developers certain quasi-governmental powers, such as the right to tax homeowners to pay for roads, schools, pools, golf courses and other projects.\ Two bills creating such projects, or ""improvement districts,"" were proposed during last year's General Assembly, but both stalled before they could win final approval.\ Proponents believe such measures will encourage development in rural areas, while critics worry about stoking sprawl and giving public powers to private developers.\ In short, such laws would allow developers to raise money to build their neighborhoods from Wall Street, rather than borrowing the money from a bank.\ Developers could issue and sell tax-free bonds based on the value of the taxes they will be able to collect from homeowners.\ Developers could in turn use the money to build roads, sewers and amenities for their projects such as clubhouses and swimming pools. Developers would also have the authority to collect taxes from homeowners and pay the bonds off over a number of years.\ Florida has allowed neighborhood improvement districts since 1980, and more than 360 neighborhoods have been built there using them.\ But a 2005 study showed many of those neighborhoods were built in suburban areas around cities such as Tampa and Orlando, rather than in rural communities.\ --- Walter Woods\ HEALTH CARE: Array of items add to funding requests\ Health care may have its noisiest legislative session in years.\ The biggest debate will involve proposed changes to the state's health care regulatory structure, known as certificate of need, or CON. The battle will largely pit hospitals against doctors.\ CON controls health care construction and expansions in the state, along with medical services such as obstetrics and heart surgery. Physician groups want looser regulation --- if not elimination of the rules --- while hospitals will generally fight for the status quo.\ Legislators might also consider proposals to shore up financing of medical services, from a statewide network to care for trauma patients to funding for financially ailing Grady Health System. Problems with Medicaid HMOs' payments to medical providers likely will also draw scrutiny.\ Wild cards include how to fund the state's tab of up to $20 billion to pay for the health care of retired teachers and state employees in coming years.\ Insurance legislation may surface that would strengthen consumers' abilities to get information on pricing and quality of medical providers.\ And advanced practice nurses may push for legislation that improves their authority to prescribe drugs.\ --- Andy Miller\ ENVIRONMENT: Conservation and efficiency resurface\ The state Board of Natural Resources is handling this year's most controversial environmental issues, including rules for coastal development and stream protections. If the board can satisfy pro- development interests, that should leave the governor and General Assembly to figure out how much money to spend on environmental matters. Look for these numbers:\ > How much money will be spent on land conservation?\ More than half the $100 million Perdue offered for land conservation in 2005 is tied up in a revolving loan fund that hasn't attracted much interest. The rest has been mostly spent on projects that were already in the pipeline, leaving only about $4 million.\ > Will the state fully fund the soil police who make sure construction crews keep the dirt out of streams?\ It's been three years since the erosion and sedimentation law passed, and still less than half the promised 80 state inspectors are on the job. This year, about a third of the money collected from developers to fund those positions is being spent on other state services.\ > Will the state spend money on energy efficiency and renewable energy?\ The Governor's Energy Policy Council has recommended several possible options to consider, including a revolving loan fund that would give state and local governments the money they need to invest in energy efficient buildings and equipment.\ --- Stacy Shelton\ TRANSPORTATION: Safety, transit measures return\ Transportation funding advocates have dreamed of this moment for months, maybe even years. Like others who back hot-button issues, they see the 2007 legislative session as their best chance, a non- election year when a secure party majority in both houses and a lame- duck governor will have less to lose in backing taxes to pay for transportation.\ Metro Atlanta chambers of commerce and the lobby Georgians for Better Transportation have come out with a couple of different scenarios. The business groups have backed a regional special purpose local option sales tax, or SPLOST, where the Legislature would allow counties to group together and propose that voters approve limited tax hikes for designated projects. GBT would prefer a statewide tax that doesn't expire and has proposed eliminating the gas tax and raising the statewide sales tax by 1 percent, which would be permanent and raise much more money. In either case, backers say the measures could be set up to include public transit, if that's what the voters or the legislators want.\ Other issues that may come before the lawmakers include bills to discourage speeding and make pickup drivers wear seat belts.\ --- Ariel Hart\ PUBLIC SAFETY: Drug, sex offenses remain as targets\ Getting ""tough on crime"" never goes out of vogue at the Capitol.\ In spite of the Georgia prison system's status as the fifth largest in the nation at an annual price tag of more than $1 billion, members of the General Assembly never seem to tire of finding new ways to incarcerate people. That's because voters, by and large, approve of such measures.\ Last year, lawmakers passed sweeping legislation cracking down on where sex offenders can live and work. Expect that trend to continue this year.\ Senate President Pro Tem Eric Johnson (R-Savannah) has already pre-filed a bill making it illegal for registered sex offenders to take a picture of a minor. Legislators might also continue to address the growing methamphetamine scourge, which is sending astonishing numbers of users, manufacturers and sellers to prison every year.\ --- Carlos Campos\ CAPTION: BEN GRAY / Staff Legislators, including Rep. Sharon Cooper (R-Marietta) (left), began settling into their offices at the Capitol and gearing up for the new session. Issues on various topics, such as education, immigration, health care and transportation are expected to surface. Legislative bills will seek to increase fines for those driving without a license. And, more restrictions on sex offenders will likely be pushed.\ Credit: STAFF"
179,"10 Names did not fit in byline field: LOU NELSON, BILL RUBIN, BOB GRIGGS, CYNDI DAVIS, BILL WRIGHT II, SUSAN CATER, LEIGH RODGERS, R. WAYNE CARMAN, JOHN BEAVIN, CYNTHIA KOSKELA\ Gwinnett Opinions asked the Voice of Gwinnett panelists: ""As the 2006 session of the Georgia General Assembly gets rolling, what would you like for your legislators' top three state lawmaking priorities to be?"" Here are some of the responses:\ Readers' legislative to-do list: Illegal immigrants Eminent domain Development Health care Education Traffic\ 1. Our education system should be embarrassing to the General Assembly. We play chicken with Alabama for the bottom of the national pile every year. Georgians have many more resources at their disposal in this decade than they've had before. Changes to our education can and should be first and foremost on the agenda.\ 2. Address our social services, including DFCS, WIC, Babies Can't Wait and other programs or agencies established to assist our most in need. If we can help so many Hurricane Katrina displaced, then we must be able to offer the same assistance to our fellow Georgians.\ 3. Assemblymen from metro Atlanta need to seriously look at our ridiculous development and put a pin in it. Someone, somewhere needs to put a stop to the number of Krogers, Wal-Marts, Home Depots, Publixes, etc., being thrown up on every corner at an alarming rate. Our state has gone from being beautiful to becoming an eyesore in many areas due to unfettered development. It's time someone realized the short-term financial gains are not worth the long-term, irreversible damage.\ DEBORAH CHOSEWOOD, Snellville\ 1. Immigration needs to have a clearer understanding of what services can be offered to those entering the country illegally. I hesitate to cut off essential medical services, but we should send a bill to the government of Mexico to cover these costs.\ 2. Eminent domain abuse needs to be defined clearly in light of the Supreme Court decision so that NO local government (city or county) can condemn property for economic revitalization.\ 3. Not on the agenda, but high on mine, would be a law to cut the House membership by one-third. This was done in Illinois several years back (with much weeping and moaning) and has cut down on silly bills instead of great legislation.\ GARY VON BEHREN, Lawrenceville\ 1. I want voting registration with picture IDs.\ 2. I want eminent domain corrected and landowner rights returned.\ 3. I want no Georgia driver's license issued without legal immigration confirmed.\ STEVE RAMEY, Lilburn\ If the good old boys at the state Capitol want to do something to help Georgians, then come up with a plan that will guarantee affordable health care to all Georgians! We do not have that now.\ RANDY COLLINS, Doraville\ 1. Improving the Georgia public education system. This especially includes the schools that seem to just be ignored because of their location and demographics.\ 2. Limiting the number of non-English signs.\ 3. Getting approved the photo ID for elections. I have NO problem showing a photo ID to vote.\ ROBIN SCHMIDT, Norcross\ 1. Greatly strengthening consumer protections in this state --- particularly with regard to used cars.\ 2. Improving the state ""safety net"" for the poor (WIC, Medicaid, etc.)\ 3. Development of a comprehensive transportation plan for the metro Atlanta area that includes Gwinnett, Clayton, Henry, Rockdale, Douglas and Cobb counties.\ KATHLEEN POPE BINGAMAN, Mountain Park/Lilburn\ 1. Initiate a new constitutional amendment that gives voters the power to vote for ""None Of The Above"" (NOTA) (see www.freelythinking.com/nota.htm).\ 2. Reform the criminal justice system to focus on restitution instead of incarceration (see www.freelythinking.com/restit.htm).\ 3. Restrain county district attorneys who continue to distort the long-standing legal principle mens rea (criminal intent) (see www.freelythinking.com/resplaw.htm).\ WES ALEXANDER, Lilburn\ 1. The eminent domain law needs to be abolished to protect private citizens from being robbed by people under the excuse of the greater public interest. The woman in the news whose flower shop was seized by some real estate developers is an example of how honest, hardworking people can be hurt by such an excuse.\ Under any condition, private citizens' property rights take first priority over the so-called greater public interest.\ In Communist China, there is no law to protect private property, and the government can always take away any land, houses or villages any time. I don't want to see that America is becoming like China.\ 2. Replace Georgia income tax with sales tax so Georgia will be more economically sound, and it will be able to attract more companies.\ 3. No ILLEGALS should receive any government aid. The employers who hire illegals should be put into jail for assisting illegals who have broken the law to stay in this country. And illegals should be DEPORTED right away.\ MINGHU SHEILA YAO, Tucker\ 1. Illegal aliens\ 2. Voter ID\ 3. Less state government = less tax load\ JAMES F. VAN VALKENBURG, Snellville\ 1. Immigration laws\ 2. Gangs\ GAIL FARRELL, Norcross\ 1. Enabling school impact fees should be the first priority. I have heard talk about education being a priority, but surprisingly there has been no mention of the Legislature proposing to add schools as recipients of impact fees.\ 2. Gwinnett needs to set up rules for using transfer of development rights, or TDR, but according to a county commissioner, we need some modifications to the legislation. A request has been made, but nothing has been mentioned about this being acted upon this session. Having TDR in Gwinnett will help preserve our open space and rural character.\ 3. The Legislature needs to address transit. It should pass the two bills that MARTA has requested, including continuing the use of 55 percent of revenues for operations. The Legislature should also work on funding for additional transit development to help get traffic off the roads.\ ART SHELDON, Duluth\ 1.Institute an auditable, verifiable paper trail, preferably with receipts that can be retained, for all voting in Georgia. Voters' faith in the process is too important an element in the foundation of a democratic republic for us not to make this top priority.\ 2. Eminent domain should be limited to being exercised only for public works and projects, and the exercising authority should be barred from selling or leasing any property acquired through eminent domain to any private owner, user or occupant for a minimum of 10 years after acquisition.\ 3. The voter identification issue must be resolved constitutionally to the satisfaction of the courts.\ MARLA CALDWELL, Snellville\ 1. To end the freeloading rights of illegal aliens and require them to qualify for benefits under the same rules and regulations that govern our legal citizens.\ 2. To secure our state borders because our nation's border states are not. If that is not possible, devise another method of keeping terrorists out of the state of Georgia.\ 3. The reduction of crime in all areas. For example, a 5-month- old relative was the recent victim of a violent crime because of soft Georgia child care laws. The laws in place need to be strengthened.\ ROY McCREARY, Dacula\ 1. Raises for teachers. We need to do whatever we can to get Georgia schools at the top of America's public school systems. Paying more for teachers would be a key first step. Raising requirements for teachers would be another good step.\ 2. Voter ID. Anyone wanting to cast a vote in Georgia should have a photo ID. To cash a check at any business, you must have picture ID. To identify yourself at any mortgage closing, you must have a photo ID. To purchase a car, you must have picture ID. What's the problem?\ 3. Make English the official state language. In Georgia, and in many other states, we are fast losing our historic American identity with so many people speaking Spanish. We are encouraging them to continue speaking Spanish by offering Spanish as an option everywhere you turn. If you want to live here, learn the language.\ JOEL ARMISTEAD, Lilburn\ 1. Illegal immigration\ 2. Traffic\ 3. Development\ GERALD NIDY, Grayson\ 1. Machine-readable paper ballots for elections. Last year, Gwinnett County used a large single sheet of paper with all the ballot choices. This sheet was then fed into a slot on a tabulating machine, from which the election results were forwarded in electronic fashion to the appropriate destination. If there had been any discrepancy, they had a paper record of the actual ballot, not some cash-register type tape scrolling inside some computer system cabinet.\ 2. Rebuilding and maintaining the state infrastructure. Hundreds of roads are in need of repair across the state, and the governor's recent announcement of gas tax excess revenue going to that issue is encouraging. But they must also consider the rural bridges, unguarded rail crossings and small, unregulated dams.\ 3. Focus on elementary and middle school education. Success must be accomplished at this level for the student to compete at the high school and collegiate level. Stop social promotions. Stop ""teaching the test."" Concentrate on creating an environment where the student wants to learn. It is not the teacher's job to GIVE a student an education, it is the student's job to GET an education.\ LOU NELSON, unincorporated Stone Mountain Gwinnett County\ Members of this year's Georgia General Assembly need to start each day by leaving their egos and special interest money at the front door, pulling their common sense out of that part of their bodies where it seems to always be hiding and strongly improving the following three critical issues:\ 1. Increase the pay scale across the board for teachers and law enforcement. (Counties and cities should do the same for police personnel and firefighters.) Can you think of a better way to make this a better state?\ 2. Fix the health care system in Georgia. Affordable family insurance, adequate hospital emergency care and benefits that encourage doctors to practice in Georgia.\ 3. Start a statewide war on juvenile gang crime.\ BILL RUBIN, Suwanee\ 1. Property taxes are going through the roof, especially in fast- growing counties like Gwinnett. I have talked to and written the governor and state reps with a solution --- a simple change in the law that would result in an immediate tax cut for most Georgia property owners and ensure, going forward, that local government never takes more property tax dollars than it needs to fund its budgets.\ The governor replied with a form letter. A majority of Gwinnett's legislators have shown no interest in simple and significant tax reform.\ Other legislators are either pushing their own pet tax bill or gearing up for re-election.\ You can read about this simple solution at www.millagerate.com.\ Beyond that:\ 2. Illegal immigration\ 3. Meaningful ethics reform\ BOB GRIGGS, Loganville\ 1. Illegals. Mexican, Bosnian --- they are having gang wars in my neighborhood. This is the new black/white war of the decade. It seems that the Bosnians feel more acceptance by Americans, and it is now a power struggle.\ 2. Drug use. Meth is the pot of this generation. The problem is that the drugs of today are cut with stuff that is deadly. Also, kids need no money for these drugs as they sell the drugs to their network of friends and that keeps them in the drug. You have 15- year-old dealers in very upscale schools. More and more kids are being sent to rehabs. The new catch phrase is, ""I am in recovery.""\ 3. Traffic. It is crazier on side roads. It used to take me 20 minutes to go 14 miles. I am lucky if I can do it in 45 now.\ CYNDI DAVIS, Snellville\ 1. Fix eminent domain.\ 2. Voter fraud.\ 3. Welfare fraud.\ And putting responsibility for a child's education/discipline back where it belongs --- the parents' lap.\ BILL WRIGHT II, Lilburn\ Are we going to allow hiring of illegals and supporting their families in our health, education and safety? Seeing the growing numbers of people who are non-English speaking and illegal pour into our county, I can only see the huge burden it is putting on the taxpayers of this state. I feel like it would be easier to just send them home (it would be cheaper in the long run, since the goal is now to have a U.S.-born baby).\ Being it is not supported by the federal government to send them home, we should at least make it uncomfortable for them to stay, cut off the money supply (enforce the law on hiring illegals) and all the taxpayer-supported services.\ Go to any hospital emergency room or state health office in Gwinnett County and you will see the line of illegals waiting for services. This is now putting our lives at risk. Our already overburdened jails and police forces now have to handle a population that is poor, undereducated and breaking federal law just being here.\ The schools have a hard enough time guessing at each year's population growth to keep up with staff. Why should we teach illegals or their children English and skills if they are just going to turn around and take Georgia jobs?\ Remove all secondary languages from public buildings and services; this is not helping people to be integrated into American culture. This is an outrage to Americans who have pride in being American.\ America has lost its identity.\ SUSAN CATER, Snellville\ Figure out why we are allowing people with tuberculosis to stay in this country.\ Gwinnett County has more TB than [many] other counties in the country! I'll be moving!\ LEIGH RODGERS, Duluth\ 1. Improve Ga. 316\ 2. Improve Ga. 316\ 3. Improve Ga. 316\ Do whatever it takes to make Ga. 316 limited access, at least to the Barrow County line.\ R. WAYNE CARMAN, Lawrenceville\ 1. The system for providing medical care needs to be fixed. My doctor serves on a county committee looking into the problems and told me that the system is going to collapse because of the care being provided to illegal immigrants and others who cannot pay. We can't turn people away, but we can't crash the system for everyone. Fix it, or we all lose.\ 2. Our teachers need help. I have spent time as a substitute teacher and parapro. The students are, simply put, out of control. Make it a requirement that EVERY parent who has a child enrolled in school spend one full day per semester following their child to every class and activity. Do parents really not care that their kids are treating teachers like they do? It is criminal in many instances.\ 3. Out of every 100 students who graduate from high school, only 25 earn a college degree. Yet the message to students is, ""You must get a college degree or you are a failure!"" Baloney. A college degree is a worthy goal. But it's not the only way to have a rewarding career. The schools must encourage students to look into technical colleges, apprenticeship programs, employer-provided training and military training as viable choices for furthering their education.\ JOHN BEAVIN, Lilburn\ 1. Illegal aliens living/working/using the resources of Georgia.\ 1a. Eminent domain restrictions.\ 2. Tax decisions taken out of the hands of the Department of Education.\ 3. Health care in Georgia for all children born or naturalized in the United States and who are residents.\ CYNTHIA KOSKELA, Buford\ CAPTION: The Georgia State Capitol dome"

Kudos to Bluffton Rotary for the tremendous job on the Bluffton Village Festival. Miss Babbie must be proud of what has become of her creation. More reports continue to come in, but from what I've heard business was good and a great time was had by all.
\
I was out of town most of last week attending a business development conference in Florida. The conference was concerned with attracting businesses from outside the country to locate or expand to this part of the country. It was impressive to see what is out there and how much of it is a perfect fit for the Lowcountry, especially Beaufort and Jasper counties.
\
My criteria in researching these prospects have to do with whether they are on the leading edge of information, energy or transportation technologies. We need environmentally clean industries that will create not only jobs for today but help to invent the jobs of tomorrow.
\
One of the businesses I was particularly interested in at the conference was a manufacturer of different solar panels and controllers for managing solar-generated electricity. Not only do they currently have efficient production, they also have an incredibly robust research-and-development effort under way. These folks seem to have a clear vision of the post-oil economy and want to be the ExxonMobil of solar.
\
There are many reasons why companies with great business models and bright futures need to look closely at our area. We have low taxes, a good, available work force with a strong work ethic, and a location near a major transportation hub. I was impressed with them and they are interested in visiting and taking a closer look at what we have to offer.
\
Fortunately, not all the business creativity is going on overseas. There is much happening in our local community that is innovative, forward-looking and run by hard-headed business guys that know how to build things and turn a profit.
\
HybridHouse is a Bluffton company owned by Blufftonians Andy Fishkind and Roger Gump. They consult and subcontract on renovations or new commercial or residential construction to plan and produce a building that will be as close as you want to energy self-sufficiency. Using high-efficiency solar panels and state of the art HVAC, insulation and appliances, Andy and Roger put your building into the energy-production business. This saves their clients a ton of money and Santee-Cooper burns tons less in coal.
\
Incidentally, HybridHouse was the beneficiary of strategic pressure from the Beaufort County legislative delegation several sessions back to allow net metering in South Carolina. This allows you to sell back your excess power to the utility company, making solar panel installation less costly and more attractive to home and business owners, especially with the increasing federal tax benefit. Currently, SCE&G has net metering and the co-ops do not, but it's only a matter of time before they come around.
\
When you hear me talk about creating a favorable business environment, this is what I'm talking about. Ideally, government helps to unlock the creativity and productivity within the private sector, not stifle it with unnecessary regulation and paperwork.

"
181,"A bulk purchasing program that aims to make rooftop solar easier
and more affordable got off to a roaring start after its June
launch in Coastal Georgia, but Solarize Savannah may soon be facing
a hurdle because of solar's popularity.\Lydia Moore, who lives in Parkside, was among the first 10
homeowners to sign a contract with the program. Last year, she and
her husband bought their house, with its sunny southern exposure,
with solar in mind.\""We are trying to live as sustainably as we possibly can,"" Moore
said. ""So, trying to reduce our carbon footprint. Solar panels just
seemed to make sense.""\As of Friday, 145 households in Chatham, Effingham and Bryan
counties had expressed interest in Solarize Savannah. That's a
better turnout than the Solarize Atlanta program, which launched a
week earlier and has only 107 households signed up.\And in Savannah, the first 10 contracts are already pushing the
price down into the second tier of discounts for the bulk buy, or
$2.85 per watt. If enough people sign up, the price could drop
about 8% more.\""We're helping the planet for sure, by reducing our carbon
footprint, but we're also helping each other in the community by
making it cheaper for everybody,"" Moore said. ""And that just seemed
really cool to me, too.""\But there's a potential snag in how quickly those new rooftop solar
owners will recoup their costs. The Georgia Power program that
reimburses customers at market rate for the energy their rooftop
solar sends back to the grid -- a monthly net metering program --
only allows 5,000 customers statewide to participate. It's about to
reach that cap.\\
Reaching the limit\""(On Wednesday) Georgia Power was reporting that there are 366
spots left in their open applications before they meet the 5,000
cap,"" said Seth Gunning, sales director of Creative Solar USA,
which won the contract for the Solarize Savannah project.\The Georgia Public Service Commission, an elected five-member board
that regulates Georgia Power, established the monthly net metering
program in late 2019. Commissioner Bubba McDonald proposed it and
Commissioner Tim Echols suggested the cap on the number of
customers that could benefit from it. The idea was to see how a
limited program worked.\""I chose 5,000 homes or 32 megawatts because I felt like it would
take us three years to fill that capacity,"" PSC Commissioner Tim
Echols said.\It took more like one year. Georgia Power began enrolling customers
in its monthly net metering, also called its ""Renewable &
Nonrenewable Tariff"" or ""RNR"" in mid-2020.\""Because net metering reduces the payback period on a solar
investment by around 30%, rooftop solar business has accelerated
beyond my original projections and the program is now reaching
capacity,"" Echols said.\Some Solarize participants have already signed up for the monthly
net metering, but organizers fear the space will run out before
demand does.\""We have been signing people up last week and earlier this week,""
Gunning said. ""We're getting interconnection agreements signed, and
submitted really quickly. So we are still able to get people into
the queue for the program.""\The cap is too restrictive, argued Russell Seifert, CEO of Creative
Solar USA.\""Now isn't the time to put a cap on Georgia's solar opportunity,""
he said in a prepared statement. ""Neighboring southern states
already have many times more than Georgia Power's 5,000 customers
with on-site solar: South Carolina with over 20,000; Florida with
almost 60,000.""\It's not only about residents who want to benefit directly from
solar. It's also a jobs issue. The Georgia Solar Energy Association
warns that hundreds of solar jobs are at risk as companies
re-evaluate their presence in the state.\According to the Solar Energy Industries Association, Georgia is
currently ranked 9th amongst all states for the amount of solar
energy installed with one of the fastest growing solar job markets
in the nation.\""Rooftop solar means local jobs,"" Seifert told the PSC at a recent
meeting. ""It puts money directly into Georgia's economy, (into)
homeowners' and employees' pockets that go out and spread that
money. Rooftop solar provides more jobs per megawatt and more local
jobs than any other solar resource. These are good paying jobs as
well, with low barriers to entry, transferable job training and
opportunities for growth in and outside the solar industry.""\The jobs issue resonated with Echols.\""As we hit the net-metering cap without further PSC action, we do
risk confusing consumers and chilling the solar business across our
state,"" Echols said. ""I am hopeful that the solar advocates on our
Commission can craft a workable solution.""\The cap may also make it more difficult for Solarize to meet its
stated goal of recruiting more low-income families to install
solar.\""When we designed these solarized programs for these two cities, we
also embedded within them components to reach low- and
moderate-income and communities of color,"" President Don Moreland
of Solarize organizer Solar Crowdsource told the PSC. ""And and we
were only able to design a program like that because of monthly
netting.""\Echols is skeptical of the low-income Solarize program.\""These loans can be onerous and impact the sale of a house if the
person needs to move,"" he wrote in an email. "" Additionally, solar
requires a fairly new roof and so the homeowner could incur even
more debt. I suggest low-income homeowners invest in community
solar as a bill add-on.""\At the same recent PSC meeting, commissioners discussed increasing
the cap but seemed hesitant to do so immediately.\Georgia Power's Attorney Steve Hewitson spoke against it.\""The limitation was specifically put in place so that the company
and the commission could evaluate the impacts of the RNR monthly
netting program to the system and other customers,"" Hewitson told
the PSC. ""There's no reason to revisit that limitation now as the
2019 rate case already provided we can revisit that program and its
limitations in the next (long-term plan) and rate case cycle which
begins next year.""\Commissioner McDonald said in a phone interview Friday he also
prefers to wait for next year's iteration of Georgia Power's
long-term plan to make the changes to the cap.\""If you start changing policy in the middle of the stream, you'll
never come to the end,"" he said. ""Everybody wants something
changed.""\Echols sounded more flexible.\""Technically, the PSC could act now to raise the cap or modify it
in any way that we would see fit,"" Echols said in an email sent
Friday. ""I am personally evaluating if this is the best path
forward and prepared to work with my fellow commissioners in a way
that makes sense for all parties.""\Residents should tell the PSC how they feel, Echols said.\""I suggest that consumers reach out personally to each of our five
PSC commissioners with thoughtful, personal emails that are not a
template,"" said Echols. ""We need to hear from people who have solar
and who want solar, and what their experience has been.""\That should sit well with Solarize organizers like Jennette Gayer,
state director of Environment Georgia.\""We're thinking through how can we get people who are coming to us
interested in solar on their own roofs, interested also in the
policy landscape,"" she said. ""Because I think it's really important
that people understand and realize and help make sure that we have
a strong policy landscape for solar in Georgia. This is a really
clear and obvious example of how policy is a big deal if you're
considering solar.""\Solar buyer Lydia Moore knows she might not get into the net
metering program right away. A Solarize representative told her
there were only 500 spots left when she applied. She's moving ahead

"
182,"
At its imposing facade on West Perry Street, Helen Downing's Victorian Italianate mansion looks every bit the piece of post-Civil War history it is. You have to look three stories up to know this old beauty is making history anew.
\
One day last month, a crew from Hannah Solar finished installing 14 solar panels on its south-facing roof. At about 3.5 kilowatts, the system isn't huge - it'll supply about enough electricity to cover a third of an average household's usage. But Downing's solar installation here, as well as another on her Tybee Island residence, are part of a residential solar revolution in Georgia.
\
Downing and dozens of other homeowners around Chatham County participated in the Peach State's first Solarize program, a kind of Costco for solar panels that brings prices down through the power of a bulk buy. Solarize, supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, also helps local governments promote solar energy to homeowners and business owners by streamlining the selection of an installer.
\
Atlanta-based Hannah Solar won the bid for the program that was initially intended for Tybee only, but which grew to encompass all of Chatham County as residents of other municipalities asked to be included.
\
Downing's home was the 36th of 60 installations contracted through  Solarize. The new arrays, totaling 318 kilowatts, will triple the residential solar capacity in the county. And their impact is not expected to end there.
\
Tybee City Council member Paul Wolff, who was instrumental in bringing the program to the coast, has fielded calls from Sanibel Island, Fla. about replicating Solarize there.
\
Hannah's founder and CEO Pete Marte said he's heard from other communities including Roswell, Dunwoody, Athens and Atlanta that want to have their own Solarize program.
\
""It's just gonna spur many more Solarize programs, not just in Georgia but across the Southeast,"" Marte said. \
\
DOING WELL BY DOING GOOD
\
Downing, who with her late husband bought her downtown home 32 years ago through Historic Savannah's revolving fund, said she'd thought about solar often in the past and had even called a contractor but was hesitant to be a solar pioneer.
\
""There were not a lot of people doing it,"" she said. ""I was really excited when I learned Tybee was doing this thing.""
\
As with many of the Solarize participants, her motivation was only partially about her electric bill.
\
""I think the environment needs us to do this sort of thing, and electricity's gone up so much,"" she said. ""It can help the environment and save some money in the long run, even if I don't see it. It probably adds value to the house. And it's kinda fun. I'm a big gadget kind of person.""
\
The geekiness of it also appeals to retired dentist Steve Acuff, who installed a 3-kilowatt system on his garage in Ardsley Park. He was happy to show off the app that allows him to monitor his panels' production from his phone.
\
""It's now making about 12 kilowatt hours per day,"" he said, glancing at a chart.
\
Over the last decade, solar costs have been steadily decreasing. The Solarize Chatham program cut the price even more, with a final cost of about $2.70 a watt, though extras such as customization to keep partially shaded systems running efficiently added cost to some systems.
\
""The last time I checked five years ago my system would have cost $30,000,"" Acuff said. ""This time it cost $9,000. Then there's the tax credit so the final cost is $6,000.""
\
He figures he'll get a return of 8 or 9 percent on his investment.
\
Tybee resident John Rabun, who installed a 7.8 kilowatt system on his north end beach-front home, is proud of his clean energy and the panels that blend in so well ""you don't even know it's there.""
\
""The money, it wasn't insignificant, but it was secondary to the whole green idea,"" Rabun said. \
\
RESIDENTIAL CATCHING UP
\
Despite solar's potential in the state, it's been slow to gain momentum. States with much less sunshine, like New Jersey, zoomed past Georgia in installations as neither Georgia Power nor state government embraced solar-friendly policies.
\
Unlike Georgia, solar-forward states allow net metering, in which consumers are compensated for the full retail value of the electricity their solar panels put back on the grid. Downing was appalled to find out she'd get only about a fifth of the highest retail value for any overproduction from her panels and she'd have to pay Georgia Power $2.35 a month (the equivalent of her first 60 kilowatt hours of overproduction) for the privilege of selling them that electricity. The other option is to just give to the electric company whatever her household doesn't immediately use. That's not happening, Downing said.
\
""I don't care,"" she said. ""I'm not donating it to Georgia Power.""
\
But slowly, policies are changing in solar's favor in Georgia.
\
The Solar Power Free Market Financing Act, which went into effect July 1, allows residents to lease out their rooftop for solar and sell that solar electricity to someone other than their utility. Previously, residents had to own the solar on their rooftop and could only use it themselves or sell it to their utility.
\
Twenty-four other states, none in the Southeast, already allowed such leases and power purchase agreements. In 2014, two-thirds of all new residential solar installations were third-party owned, reports the Rocky Mountain Institute.
\
Georgia Power, whose executives once derided solar as unworkable in the Peach State, has added large scale commercial solar to its portfolio under pressure from regulators. Still, its focus on residential lags. But the utility now operates its own solar panel installation services through a separate (and unregulated) business unit called the Georgia Power Energy Services, partnering with Hannah Solar to do installations.
\
Solarize Chatham, which had an April deadline for signups, predated these latest boosts for residential solar in Georgia. It was needed, Marte said.
\
""Residential had become the red-headed stepchild,"" he said. ""Solarize from the Department of Energy was developed with that recognition in mind.""
\
Together these legislative and market changes suggest a bright future for residential solar here.
\
Some local installers are counting on that. Savannah-based Julian Smith of SolarSmith, has had to travel to Augusta and Macon to find business while Solarize is in the thick of its installations. But he's expecting a rebound, particularly with the 30 percent federal tax credit on residential installations set to expire at the end of 2016.
\
""By 2016, anybody who doesn't jump on the bandwagon completely misses out,"" he said.
\
Republican Congressman Buddy Carter, who was a solar advocate while in the state legislature, sounds disinclined to advocate an extension of that credit.
\
""It's time to let the market dictate the course in our pursuit of alternative energy sources and technology,"" he said in an email response. ""I led the charge in the General Assembly and will continue fighting in Congress to remove government roadblocks to an 'all of the above' energy policy.""
\
Smith has developed a ground-mounted system that can be assembled off site and trucked in for homeowners with a sunny yard but a shaded roof. It's cheaper than rooftop, he said, because the costs of working on a roof are eliminated.
\
Marte, who likes to point out the number of jobs created by solar installations - he hired 12 new employees including several Savannah Tech grads to work on Solarize - isn't too worried about competition.
\
Along with more Solarize homes to complete, two large commercial solar installations are beginning in the Savannah area soon, one at the port that Atlanta-based competitor Radiance Solar will install and another on a Savannah Distributing Company warehouse that his company is doing.
\
""There is more than enough to go around,"" Marte said. \ SOLARIZE TYBEE BY THE NUMBERS
\
* Total capacity installed for Solarize Tybee and Chatham County: 317.5 kilowatts
\
* Number of installations: 60
\
* Average size installation: 5.1 kilowatts (20 panels)
\
* Residents who expressed interest: about 600, with about half unable to move forward due to shade, orientation, and available roof space.
\
* Final cost: $2.70 per watt
\
* Donation: Hannah is donating a 15-kilowatt system to the Tybee Island Maritime Academy, a charter elementary school. The donation is part of the company's contract with the city of Tybee for reaching the 300-kilowatt tier of installations.

STATEWIDE SOLAR STATS
\
* Solar power per person has grown 533 percent in Georgia since 2012, the second highest growth rate since 2012 in the country.
\
* Georgia ranks number 20 in solar electricity capacity per capita (at 16 watts per person). Last year Georgia was ranked number 17 for solar electricity capacity per capita.
\
* The top 10 states with the most solar electricity installed per capita - Hawaii, Arizona, Nevada, California, New Jersey, New Mexico, Vermont, Massachusetts, North Carolina - account for only 26 percent of the U.S. population but 86 percent of the nation's total installed solar electricity capacity.
\
* Georgia has more than 1.2 million residential and commercial roofs that could host solar panels, but it is only utilizing a small fraction of them.
\
* The solar industry is adding jobs faster than the overall economy, employing 2,890 people in Georgia last year.

183,"
Solar energy systems are having their day in the sun at the builders show under way in downtown Atlanta.
\
The alternative power source, long deemed too expensive by many builders, is among the hottest technologies on display at the National Association of Home Builders Convention and International Builders Show. The show is at the Georgia World Congress Center through Monday.
\
Sure, builders still want to see homes wired for heavy-duty broadband applications like remote controlled security systems, home data networks and smart refrigerators. They also want to hear how the Internet can help them coordinate jobs with subcontractors and offer more options to home buyers.
\
But this year, with natural gas costs and California's power crisis weighing in, home builders are taking a serious look at solar. The alternative ""green"" power has grabbed consumers' --- and therefore builders' --- attention.
\
The cost of solar systems has dropped during the past decade, but more importantly, the price of traditional power has skyrocketed, said Joseph Wiehagen, project engineer for the National Association of Home Builders' research center. The center, located in Upper Marlboro, Md., tests new home technologies and designs.
\
The $5,000 to $25,000 a solar system adds to building a home is starting to look more attractive to consumers comparing upfront expenses with the long-term cost of utility bills, he said.
\
""What's happening in California, that changes everything,"" Wiehagen said.
\
Liza Bowles, president of the NAHB research center, agreed that solar and other alternative power sources, energy-saving appliances and energy-efficient homes are the industry buzz. But, she said, home buyers need pocketbook persuasion.
\
""Consumers think a lot about the environment, but they still drive the SUV. Will they pay extra for solar? They'll pay some extra. If costs were equal, they'd all want (solar). I think the key is bringing costs down,"" she said.
\
At the show, NAHB has a solar-powered model home on display. Wiehagen is on hand to explain the technology. Silicon solar panels or less-noticeable solar roof shingles absorb heat and energy from the sun. That power --- which can supplement and sometimes replace power bought from utilities --- can be used immediately or stored in batteries for later use.
\
In some states, homeowners whose solar systems produce more power than they can use are able to sell that power back to utility companies. A solar home's meter runs forward when it's taking power from a utility, backward when it's sending power.
\
Georgia power companies don't allow such ""net metering."" But a bill making it standard practice in the state --- sponsored by state Sen. Michael Polak (D-Atlanta) and supported by Georgians for Clean Energy --- is working its way through the General Assembly. Georgia Power said it hasn't yet formed a position on the proposed law.
\
A net-metering trial already is happening at Southface Energy Institute, a 23-year-old organization promoting energy- and resource- efficient home building and community planning.
\
Southface, which is participating in the show, operates from a ""home"" built in 1996 to be a model of sustainability and energy efficiency. In addition to construction that minimizes leaks and humidity while maximizing natural light, the Southface home on the northern edge of downtown Atlanta produces about 10 percent of its power using solar technology, said Marci Reed, Southface director of development.
\
On weekends, when the institute's 20 or so computers, (energy- efficient) copier and fax machine aren't on, its meter often runs in reverse --- especially during the summer.
\
Reed said if the 6,200-square-foot building was a true home rather than an office, it could run almost exclusively on the solar power it creates.

Vogtle as an example. The typical residential customer has paid
approximately $385 extra because of Vogtle's delays and cost
overruns, according to PSC staff analysis, for an expected total of
$833 paid by late 2022 per residential ratepayer before the new

Georgia.\In 2013 he pushed for Georgia Power to include 525 megawatts of
solar power in their energy production plans. At the time Georgia
Power didn't have ""one watt"" of solar, McDonald said.\""And now we are sixth in the nation,"" he said. ""And in renewable
energy developed with solar energy, there's no upward pressure on

solar action, too. Most of the solar in Georgia is in utility-scale
farms rather than on ratepayers' rooftops. While many states have
for years had net metering - where a solar panel owner is paid for

for what they use - Georgia Power only began monthly net metering
this year, and it still isn't fully rolled out.\""I also believe that we have to expand opportunities around
renewable energy in a more aggressive way that low and
moderate-income families can be able to participate,"" Blackman
said. ""Because right now, you have no plans to include more solar

186,"A grass-roots campaign to boost solar energy in DeKalb County through the power of bulk purchasing has drawn interest from more than 500 families and businesses.\The Solarize Decatur-DeKalb program, the third effort that the organizers have put together in Georgia since 2015, promises bigger discounts as more people and firms sign up for solar energy. At the upper end, they can save more than 25 percent on solar installations compared to when customers go it alone, according to the organizers, mostly nonprofit environmental and community groups.\But so far, only about 30 homeowners and one business have signed contracts. The sign-up deadline is Dec. 31.\Jane Turner, president and co-owner of A.S. Turner & Sons, a 113-year-old Decatur funeral home that is participating, wishes more businesses were signed up because it could mean bigger savings for her.\Small-scale solar projects have been slow to take off in Georgia.\Solar advocates blame a handful of causes. Trees shade many potential customers' roofs. Georgia's electricity rates are low compared to rates in many states. And Georgia utilities typically pay lower rates for so-called ""net-metering,"" in which customers are paid for surplus power their solar units feed back onto the grid.\Still, Solar ize Dec atur-DeKalb's backers say they're happy with the results so far, and expect to begin up to eight more campaigns next year in cities and counties around metro Atlanta and Georgia.\""We really want to open this up next year to as many communities as we can,"" said Don Moreland, of Solar CrowdSource.\The Kennesaw firm, which is running the online platform for the campaign, teamed with four environmental and community groups, including the Sierra Club and the City of Decatur's Environmental Sustainability Board, to push for wider adoption of solar power.\The carrot: help with evaluating whether solar power makes sense on customers' homes or businesses, and bulk-purchase agreements with two local contractors who agreed to lower their prices as more customers sign up for solar installations. The project contractors are also working with Norcross-based Suniva, one of the nation's largest solar panel manufacturers, to supply their solar panels.\""A lot of folks, they just don't know where to begin,"" said Moreland. ""There's been a couple of hundred of these (solarize programs) around the country, and we're trying to kick these off in Georgia.""\Third solar project This is the third community solar project in Georgia for the group. The first project was last year on Tybee Island, where the group signed up 60 homes and businesses for roof-top solar units with a total capacity of 360 kilowatts of power. Athens was the second project, with 78 customers for 430 kilowatts of power.\The typical house uses about 1,000 kilowatt-hours per month. One kilowatt-hour is the amount of energy a 1-kilowatt solar unit would produce in an hour in full sunshine if it was operating at top efficiency.\The Decatur/DeKalb campaign started in early September.\""Our goal is we would like to hit 134 (solar units),"" said Russell Seifert, founder of Creative Solar USA, the Kennesaw firm that is handling residential installations for the group. The number of solar-powered homes in DeKalb County totaled 66 before the project began, he said.\""I think we'll be pretty close,"" said Seifert. ""The folks in Decatur seem very open.""\Donna Brogan and Z.T. Daniels are the DeKalb program's first participants to get solar units installed, on their Druid Hills home's roof. They said they hope to save money over the long run and do their bit to help the environment.\""Besides benefiting us individually, it benefits the earth,"" said Brogan, a retired biostatistics professor at Emory University.\They hope their 6 kilowatt system, installed in November, will pay for itself in about eight years -- shorter than the typical 12-year break-even period for residential customers -- because they've already made substantial energy-saving investments, including a geothermal heating and cooling system and energy-efficient windows, that will leave them with surplus power.\""We're sort of frugal electricity users anyway,"" said Brogan.\""I hope to add a battery backup eventually,""said Daniels, a retired manager at\AT&T, that will allow them to store surplus solar power generated during the day for use at night, on cloudy days, or during power outages.\Shrinking impact Turner, the Dec atur\funeral home operator, said she's also motivated by a chance to cut her business's power bills and shrink her impact on the environment.\""I'm always interested in saving money and I am also interested in saving the earth,"" said Turner.\She and her sister, co-owner of A.S. Turner & Sons, signed up for a$50,000 solar installation that will produce about 23.8 kilowatts, enough to trim about 6 percent off their $5,500-permonth power bill.\They also expect to reap about $14,000 in savings from a 30 percent federal tax break on renewable energy projects.\They had hoped to do a project three times larger but discovered they will need to upgrade part of the building's roof first.\Even though the Decatur funeral home is the only commercial customer that has signed a contract so far, J.P. Sartori, Hannah Solar's vice president of corporate development, expects more big customers to sign up. They could include the DeKalb County government, Agnes Scott College and a number of churches in the county, he said. Atlanta-based Hannah Solar is the coalition's contractor for doing commercial solar installations.\""The pipeline looks good,"" said Sartori. ""It's always a much longer tail for commercial (projects).""\He said he's ""very confident"" the company will sign up at least 400 kilowatts of commercial projects before the campaign ends.\Credit: STAFF"

Here comes the sun.
\
The Smithsonian Institution Saturday unveiled a unique traveling exhibition of solar devices intended to show that virtually anything under the sun can be powered by its rays.
\
The exhibition, a showcase for solar design innovations, will begin a two-year national tour in Washington and will proceed to Atlanta, Houston, Los Angeles and other cities. Dates are yet to be set.
\
""The point of the exhibit is to demonstrate how easily we can generate plenty of power featuring the sun,"" said Lucy Fellowes, curator and project director of the Smithsonian-affiliated Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum, an organizer of the exhibit with the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service.
\
Although President Clinton has pointed to solar energy as one answer to the problem of global warming, critics say federal policy has been less than vigorous in promoting the alternative to fossil energy sources, such as gas and coal. Pollution from such fuels is contributing to what many scientists say is an accelerating ""greenhouse effect"" by pumping tons of heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
\
Clinton announced a ""Million Solar Roofs Initiative"" in 1997 and set a national goal of increasing the number of solar electric panels and heat collectors. To stimulate the trend, the president said the government would make a ""down payment"" by installing 20,000 solar systems on federal buildings by 2010.
\
""The United States programs are strongest in title, not in implementation,"" said Seth Dunn, a research associate at Worldwatch Institute, a natural resources think tank in Washington. ""The government has sort of taken baby steps. There have been serious cutbacks in funding, and most of the innovation is at the state level.""
\
Dunn pointed to some state policies that encourage use of solar energy, such as ""net metering,"" which allows solar homeowners to sell excess electricity back to power companies.
\
But less than 1 percent of the country's energy budget is provided by solar power, said Kert Davies, science policy director at Ozone Action, an environmental group. He said other countries are moving to solar energy much faster. Japan, for example, already has millions of rooftop solar units.
\
The Worldwatch ""State of the World"" report for 1999 noted that between 1990 and 1997, worldwide use of solar power to generate electricity grew by an annual rate of 16.8 percent.
\
The Smithsonian display --- it's titled ""Under the Sun: An Outdoor Exhibition of Light"" --- is sponsored and funded by the U.S. Department of Energy and BP Solar, the world's largest solar energy manufacturer.
\
Exploring the relationship of the sun and Earth, it illustrates the usefulness of photovoltaic cells, which convert sunlight to electricity. ""Under the Sun"" examines the various ways that solar energy can be used in everyday life.
\
Among the solar-powered items on display:
\
A garden chair with a photovoltaic-powered overhead light that stores energy and is designed for reading under the stars.
\
A solar-powered lawn mower that can cover 13,000 square feet in the course of a growing season. It's equipped with an edge sensor, a personal activation code, an impact detector, a theft alarm and a communications system to keep it on track --- all powered by the sun.
\
A ""portable energy system"" that uses direct or indirect sunlight to power and charge battery-operated devices. It can double the operating time of a laptop computer, for
\
example.
\
A solar cooker, which can help the estimated 1.5 billion people who live in areas of the world where fuel wood is scarce. In sunny areas, a family dependent on wood fuel can save about 30 percent of its annual wood consumption by using a solar cooker, the Smithsonian says.
\
A solar-powered fountain where the flow of its water is determined by the intensity of the sunlight.
\
A solar pavilion made of a thin film of photovoltaic glass that generates enough electricity to power its own night lighting and ventilation systems.
\
The Smithsonian says all of the items on display are consumer-friendly and sensitive to the environment. Fellowes said many of the items --- sun-powered lanterns, a clock and sundial, garden lights, solar cookers and portable energy systems, for instance --- already can be purchased at hardware stores, on the Internet or through catalogs.
\
In creating the exhibition, she said, the National Design Museum felt it was important to remain true to its mission of celebrating the direct impact of design on daily life. ""It made sense to us to look at energy, renewable energy from the sun,"" she said.
\
The National Design Museum, located in New York, provided an attractive setting for the exhibit, which opened last summer and was designed by architects Nicholas Goldsmith and Gregory Kiss.
\
""It became an exhibition on generating energy in our own back yard. . . . The design used all features of the garden --- our green space, trees, the museum's facade,"" Fellowes said. ""It was an outdoor environment powered by the sun.""
\
Fellowes said the sponsors were so enthusiastic about ""Under the Sun"" when it opened that they wanted it to go on tour. The Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service worked with them to develop a mobile version. For the national tour, Fellowes said, it was important to have a good geographic distribution and one that would also allow the exhibit to ""follow the sun."" The final itinerary has not yet been determined.
\
Fellowes said she was intrigued by the materials and strategies that were used to generate electricity in the exhibit when it opened.
\
""My reaction was one of sheer exhilaration,"" she said. ""It was beautiful night and day and it worked!""
\
Referring to the individual displays, she said, ""It's hard to pick favorites."" However, she said visitors should take care to note that the exhibition is entirely self-powered, which she said is its most appealing aspect.
\
""It is the essence of design --- how to make something work,"" she said.

190,"Throughout Georgia's history, the state's sunny climate has drawn settlers and self-starters, but never before has the sun itself driven a revolution like the one happening now: a solar power boom that's creating thousands of jobs and reducing Georgians' reliance on conventional energy.\In 2013, Georgia boasted the fastest-growing solar energy market in the U.S., adding 91 megawatts of capacity, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. The state has enough solar capacity to power 8,405 homes. From 2012 to 2013, solar industry jobs in Georgia more than tripled, rising from 800 to 2,600 --- the largest percentage increase of any state.\That growth is expected to continue, thanks to several factors: strong clean energy research programs at state institutions such as  Georgia Tech, funded in part by U.S. Department of Energy grants; public-private partnerships; falling costs for renewables and strong leadership from the Georgia Public Service Commission.\GPSC commissioner Lauren ""Bubba"" McDonald, after watching the rise of solar in Arizona, California, and elsewhere, persuaded Georgia Power to include solar energy in the utility's 2013 integrated resource plan. ""I told them, 'We can do this as partners and get it done, or as adversaries and everyone --- including ratepayers --- will lose,' "" McDonald says.\Today, Georgia's renewable energy industry shows yet again that what's good for the environment can also be very good for the economy. Georgia's clean energy sector attracted $477 million in private investment in 2013, the eighth-highest figure in the nation. Of that, $326 million went to the solar sector, a 1,025 percent increase over 2012. The state is now home to more than 140 solar companies.\Georgia Power is also working with the U.S. Army Energy Initiatives Task Force to build, own and operate solar power systems at three Army bases: Fort Stewart, Fort Benning and Fort Gordon. By 2016, each base will house 30 megawatts of installed solar capacity that together will produce 18 percent of the energy used on the bases and will move the Army 9 percent closer to its goal of deploying 1 gigawatt of renewable energy by 2025.\As solar power storage and transmission improve, Georgia will enjoy another economic opportunity: A study by Arizona State University ranked it third among states that would benefit the most from selling solar power to other states.\To maintain and build on this momentum, Georgia's growing solar industry needs the federal government to extend the investment tax credit, which allows residential and commercial customers to take a federal tax deduction of 30 percent of the cost of a solar system; that credit is set to expire at the end of this year. Industry leaders say the credit has helped fuel solar installation growth of more than 1,600 percent nationally since 2006. That growth, in turn, has helped to drive the cost of solar down 80 percent since 2009.\This federal tax policy is a complement to the state's energy policies, which include a 2013 public service commission directive calling for Georgia Power to add 525 megawatts of solar power by 2016; a buy-back program that allows customers to purchase electricity from the utility's solar portfolio; interconnection guidelines that enable residential customers who have installed clean energy systems to link to the main grid; and ""net metering,"" which allows residential customers to generate electricity from their systems to offset bills from the power company.\The evidence is clear: Georgia is establishing itself as a leader in clean, reliable, affordable, job-creating solar energy. Extending the federal investment tax credit will help ensure that even more Georgians benefit from harnessing the power of this plentiful resource.\CAPTION: A solar power boom is reducing Georgians' reliance on conventional energy.

191," Over the past two decades, U.S. companies have been slashing costs to survive in an increasingly competitive marketplace. By stripping away layers of management, employing more part-time workers and replacing laborers with new equipment, corporations have tried to increase efficiency.\ Those changes have paid off. Since the start of this decade, the stock market's value has tripled and corporate profits have roughly doubled.\ But now that businesses have mastered the art of belt-tightening to boost earnings, a new challenge is emerging: Do American businesses know how to manage in these good times?\ In recent years, companies have treated workers as if a recession were still raging. Since 1989, the economy has grown 18 percent, but wages and benefits have grown only 2.8 percent after adjusting for inflation, according to the Labor Department.\ The disparity between gains for investors and wages for workers is starting to rankle. The bitter strike by Teamsters at United Parcel Service is essentially a test of whether companies can continue to clamp down on wages, benefits and work hours while the economy is booming and the unemployment rate is 4.8 percent.\ At UPS, the 90-year-old shipping giant, management has long been known for running an efficient and profitable company. Before the 1990s, the work force shared generously in the company's wealth, with good wages, benefits and a pension plan.\ But starting in the late 1980s, the ""big, happy family"" way of doing business was put to a severe test. Fierce new competitors, such as Federal Express Corp. and RPS Inc., began muscling into the delivery business. As the demand for faster, cheaper service grew more intense, UPS responded with great skill. Managers ordered drivers to deliver more packages, at greater weights and in less time with the help of new tracking equipment. At the same time, they made a dramatic shift to hiring part-time workers. In the past four years, more than 80 percent of the union jobs created at UPS have gone to part-timers.\ While many of these part-time workers are being thwarted from moving into full-time positions, the company's owners have been enjoying record-breaking income. The disparity between profits for owners and austerity for part-timers has sparked an ugly strike.\ Managers understandably have no desire to abandon the labor practices that helped UPS flourish in the harsh environment of the early 1990s. But workers understandably want a greater share of the prosperity of the late 1990s.\ By sticking to the practices that worked so well six years ago, managers have brought the company to a standstill today, with workers shouting from picket lines and customers switching to other delivery services. UPS, so savvy in hard times, is getting jammed up in good times.\ Big Brown and other prosperous companies now have to decide: How much longer can the belt stay tight around workers while shareholders grow fat? If too much is given out in wage hikes, companies could end up in trouble when the next recession hits. But if they resist workers' demands for bigger shares of the profits, companies could find themselves being destabilized by strikes and other labor problems.\ Managing well in good times may turn out to be even tougher than surviving in hard times.\ Marilyn Geewax is a Constitution editorial writer.

192," FedEx copied UPS' retail strategy by announcing Tuesday that it would buy the Kinko's chain for $2.4 billion in cash.\ FedEx will take over all 1,200 Kinko's copy center stores and their 20,000 workers when the deal closes in the first quarter. Industry experts expect the Memphis-based company to re-create the stores in its own purple-and-orange image and offer new services to home-office workers, mobile sales forces and other road warriors.\ ""FedEx is looking at more than just shipping and copying,"" said Satish Jindel, a transportation analyst. ""They'll provide computer workstations, presentation services and digital electronic services, too. FedEx has a very strong brand, and it can be extremely useful in the retail environment.""\ The FedEx announcement comes six months after UPS transformed 3,500 former Mail Boxes Etc. outlets into UPS Stores in a bid to grow its retail business. Small shippers are vital to delivery firms because they pay premium prices. About 80 percent of all UPS and FedEx packages are sent by large shippers that command deep discounts.\ Dallas-based Kinko's is 75 percent owned by a New York investment firm, Clayton, Dubilier & Rice. Kinko's doesn't release detailed financial information, but FedEx said it expects the deal to boost earnings starting in 2005. FedEx currently sells its products at 134 retail counters inside Kinko's stores.\ The deal differs from some previous FedEx acquisitions in that the company is paying cash --- not stock. FedEx bought its ground delivery unit with stock in 1998, and drivers there are independent contractors.\ UPS Stores also are individually owned and operated franchises.\ ""We have an advantage because we're mom-and-pop shops,"" said Andi Govitz, co-owner of the UPS Store at 50 Barrett Parkway. ""We specialize in providing good customer service.""\ FedEx is paying about 12.5 times as much for Kinko's as UPS paid for its $191 million retail network --- but FedEx will own all of Kinko's assets. And even though Kinko's has fewer stores, each one is larger on average and brings in more revenue than UPS franchises.\ Sales at UPS Stores totaled about $1.6 billion last year, compared with $2 billion at Kinko's.\ Kinko's was founded in Santa Barbara, Calif., in 1970 by Paul Orfalea, a school supplies salesman who had a single copying machine in a tiny, 100-square-foot retail space. As Orfalea expanded the original store, then opened others, new Kinko's operators helped finance the company's growth and became partners. By the mid-1990s, there were more than 800 Kinko's stores.\ Clayton, Dubilier & Rice bought into Kinko's in 1996 and funded a technology drive aimed at linking the stores electronically and offering new services. In 2000, the chain moved its headquarters from Ventura, Calif., to Dallas, hired new management and sought to reinvent itself as a business services company.\ Orfalea and other former owners sued, claiming the investment firm blocked attempts to take Kinko's public. Clayton, Dubilier & Rice paid $116 million for Orfalea's stake and $228 million for about 28 percent of the company owned by disgruntled shareholders, according to published reports. J.P. Morgan owns 20 percent; managers and employees own the remaining 5 percent.\ Phil Bagley, a transportation analyst, says FedEx is pursuing an expensive, ""me too"" transaction that takes it away from its transportation expertise. ""UPS has gotten a huge head start on FedEx in this arena,"" he said. ""It sounds as if FedEx is significantly increasing its asset base with a business that is probably outside its core competency.""\ Analyst Jindel says comparing Kinko's to UPS Stores is like comparing McDonald's restaurants to Subway sandwich shops. McDonald's are larger and have bigger staffs, while Subway shops are relatively small, individually owned and have lower overhead.\ ""McDonald's has a bigger footprint, and each store brings in a lot more revenue,"" he said. ""Subway requires a smaller initial investment, and the number of stores can expand rapidly. The FedEx acquisition makes UPS' purchase look like a bargain.""\ Credit: STAFF"

Had Representatives Pelosi and Murtha been in the House while U.S. forces fighting in the European and Pacific theaters during World War II suffered horrendous casualties, I wonder if they would have attempted to micro-manage that war? If asked, the American people might have wanted to have the troops brought home had they been constantly bombarded with the real-time visual images and lopsidedly negative reports from the battlefront we receive today.
\
Would President Roosevelt have been wrong to continue to follow the advice of his generals and to continue the war to its conclusion in spite of popular opinion and his political opponents? Is it now acceptable to allow partisan politics to undermine the authority of the commander-in-chief because he is a Republican?
\
Has the extreme hatred for President Bush continuously published by the main stream media and the far-left blogs completely blinded otherwise patriotic Americans to what Pelosi, Murtha and their ilk are attempting? Today's enemy of freedom is the worldwide Islamofascist movement which incorporates both the fanatical willingness to die of the Japanes Kamikaze pilots and the dogged determination of Communism to take over the world.
\
This menace is far more dangerous and real than the threat posed by the U.S.S.R. and all too few Americans seem to be aware of it. Will it take another 9/11 to wake them up?

WE MUST DO MORE ON RENEWABLE ENERGY
\
It's time for the U.S. to utilize its wealth of renewable energy resources like wind, solar and geothermal power. H.R. 969 establishes a national renewable electricity standard (RES) that would require utilities to generate 20 percent of their electricity from clean, renewable resources by 2020.
\
Investment in clean, renewable energy resources is a highly-effective, proven means for reducing global warming pollution; more than 20 states, along with the District of Columbia, already require that a certain percentage of their electricity come from renewable sources.
\
A national RES would accelerate the deployment of wind, solar and other clean energy sources and boost the economy and improve energy security.
\
According to an analysis by the Union of Concerned Scientists, a 20 percent RPS would:
\
- Create 355,000 new jobs, nearly twice as many jobs as generating the same amount of electricity from fossil fuels;
\
- Save consumers $49 billion dollars on their natural gas and electric utility bills by increasing competition from renewable energy generators; and
\
- Reduce carbon dioxide emissions by more than 400 million metric tons the equivalent of taking 71 million cars off the road.
\
If a national renewable energy policy is a ""win, win"" for the environment as well as the economy, H.R. 969 can help set America on the path to a clean, sustainable, safe energy future.
\
Let's also make realistic use of our ability to make changes for other reasons that involve simple survival as well as healthy survival. The increased traditional means of powering industry, transportation, and home fuels, such as burning coal and petroleum derivatives, as Al Gore and respected scientists discussed, have definitely accelerated the natural, cyclical global warming process.
\
The research evidence for this acceleration is valid despite the respect many have for at least one popular author of fiction. Savannah and other coastal cities will eventually be under water if the polar ice cap continues to increase its current rate of disintegration through melting.

EASTER SEASON A TIME OF REFLECTION
\
We are near the Easter season, so I pause to remember.
\
The greatest man in history is Jesus, who had no servants, yet they called him master. He had no degree, yet they called him teacher. He had no medical training, yet they called him healer. He had no army, yet kings feared him. He won no military battles, yet he conquered the world. He committed no crimes, yet they crucified him. He was buried in a borrow Tomb, yet he still lives in the minds and hearts of Christians all over the world.
\
Christians all over the world feel honored to serve such a leader who loves us.

ALLEN'S COMMENTS ON WAR CASUALTIES INAPPROPRIATE
\
I was appalled by a comment in Henry Allen's editorial on the scandal at Walter Reed (The enlisted man's curse, March 11).
\
No one, officer or enlisted, condones the conditions that the wounded heroes had to endure there. I trust the commission headed by Sen. Dole and Sec. Shalala will get some answers.
\
However, Mr. Allen's snide comment that he has ""seen three officer victims mentioned from around the country"" was reprehensible.
\
Statistics by multiple demographics, including by rank, are readily available at www.icasualties.org.
\
Had Mr. Allen done the least bit of research, he would have discovered that more captains have died than sergeants first class, more majors than master sergeants, and more lieutenant colonels than first sergeants.
\
Do these numbers say anything about the sacrifice they made or the loss suffered by their families?
\
My father was an enlisted soldier wounded during World War II.
\
Growing up, I loved listening to his stories grumbling about how he had to put up with the officers.
\
But I never heard him question or diminish the sacrifice of a fellow soldier, regardless of rank.
\
Every service member's loss brings grief to their families, friends, and loved ones who know and love them by their name and their deeds, not by their rank.
