0,"Our immigration system is broken. Few would disagree.\The political debate over immigration reform over the past decade has centered on legalization (also called amnesty) versus border security, and both sides are dug in.\Liberals believe they cannot achieve their aim of the legalization of the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants living in the country without a comprehensive bill. For this reason, they oppose dealing with immigration reform with individual bills, as the Republican-led House majority intends to do.\Political considerations are, of course, at work here.\Republican elected officials are wary of their base being able to claim they support amnesty. At the same time, Republican Party officials, donors and operatives understand that Republicans must increase their share of the rapidly growing Hispanic vote beyond the less than one-third that Mitt Romney won in 2012.\Therein lies the challenge.\It's easy to forget that a bipartisan immigration reform bill, authored by Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., passed last year in the U.S. Senate. Most Senate Republicans opposed it, and the House has said it is a nonstarter, with weak enforcement provisions and border security that has too many holes in it.\There is another consideration.\If the House and Senate agreed on a legislative package that included legal immigration reform, dealing with those here illegally and new increases in border security, what confidence would Republicans have that the Obama administration would enforce the border security and enforcement parts of the law?\Republicans have good reason to ask this question.\If you take the Affordable Care Act, the Obama administration has unilaterally (and extra-constitutionally) changed existing law literally dozens of times. They have ignored mandates, delayed provisions, made changes, all through their own ""executive authority.""\But wait, doesn't Congress write and pass the law and the executive branch enforce it?\Yes, your seventh-grade government teacher was correct.\But, the Obama administration has taken them beyond what any constitutional scholar ever could have dreamed.\Here's an incomplete list of constitutional violations under President Barack Obama: Under Obamacare, they have delayed (removed?) the employer mandate, delayed out-of-pocket caps and delayed insurance requirements. They issued a scaled-back version of the DREAM Act through executive order. They have made recess appointments when the Senate was not in recess. They've used the IRS for politically motivated purposes. The president directed the U.S. Department of Justice to ignore the law and not enforce the Defense of Marriage Act. They went around Congress to enable the EPA to enforce cap and trade. The list could go on.\Why would Republicans pass a law on immigration reform when the Obama administration would be entrusted to enforce it? What confidence should they have that it would be enforced?\However, in a post-9/11 environment, we must know who is here, and we must control our borders. We must also have a skilled labor force, and that includes legal immigrants.\Republicans have a few paths to choose from going forward:\(1) Wait until 2017 and hope that a Republican president is in office.\(2) Pass piecemeal immigration reform legislation this year but prevent a conference committee (forcing Senate to pass House bill(s) or nothing at all).\(3) Wait until 2015, if the Republicans take the U.S. Senate majority, to negotiate with Obama on immigration reform from a stronger position (this still requires the Obama administration to enforce the law).\All three paths have potential risks.\Matt Mackowiak is an Austin- and Washington-based consultant and president of Potomac Strategy Group LLC.

1,"fwallis@baxterbulletin.com\A landfill management company that thrives in some of the nation's toughest markets wants an opportunity to fix the NABORS landfill and extend its life.\Rick McEwen, executive vice president of Heartland Environmental Services LLC, based in Snowmass, Colo., told The Baxter Bulletin on Wednesday that he believes Heartland and the Twin Lakes Area are ""a good fit"" for the work of reducing, recycling and storing solid waste.\""Our contractor qualification statement should be completed next week,"" McEwen said. ""I know we are going to have a good plan.""\Heartland has operated the Pitkin County, Colo., landfill, serving the tourist mecca Aspen, and the South Canyon landfill near Glenwood Springs, Colo., since 2009. Heartland came into the Glenwood Springs environment after a local government owner/operator wanted out.\Technology\Heartland, using patented technologies, has reduced the volume in both landfills, McEwen said. At at the same time, Heartland has catered to a public interested in purchasing a bio-mass or compost product that comes from the landfill via multiple composting formulas.\At the invitation of Mountain Home Mayor David Osmon, Heartland owner Larry Giroux first visited Ozark Mountain Regional Solid Waste Management District board in January 2010.\The waste management district board has pushed a call for contractor qualification statements for professional waste management firms interested in managing NABORS.\At the 2010 meeting, Giroux told the board Heartland has learned to capitalize somewhat on so-called federal carbon tax credits that come to the company because of its work to create bio-mass and fuels from solid waste.\Many other management firms forego the recycling challenge. Giroux told the board that Heartland's disposition toward stored waste is that it's an asset that awaits recycling as technology and demand for recycled products evolve.\Although separate business entities, McEwen told The Bulletin Heartland has access to cutting-edge technologies recently rolled out by Heartland Technology Partners LLC, including an on-site leachate treatment system that has been called a breakthrough technology in the waste management industry.\Costs\Girioux also has eyed waste management opportunities on the East Coast, where landfill storage comes at premium tipping fees of $80 to $100 per ton. A technology available from another Girioux LLC converts municipal waste into pellets to be used in coal-replacement applications.\The NABORS landfill tipping fee is $42 a ton.\Landfill tipping fees in Missouri and Oklahoma, where some solid waste now goes from the six-county waste management district, range from $22 to $25.\Believers\Matt Beavers, owner of Start 2 Start Recycling of Mountain Home, said Heartland sounds like a company he would like to work with or for.\""I'm a believer,"" Beavers said. ""Reduce. Reuse. Recycle.""\""We got into this after my wife (Jaren) and I discovered we could reduce our household waste by 70 percent by recycling,"" Beavers said. ""If they can do in the landfill anything like what we do at home, we want to be on board.""\""There's lots of concern about the landfill right here between the two lakes,"" Beavers, 32, said.\In the space of a year, Start 2 Start has built a customer base of 120 residential and business clients pretty much from word-of-mouth advertising.\Start 2 Start furnishes marked containers and there"" no need to separate recyclable items in separate bins.\ID_Code: D3-305100018"

The drive for direct wine shipments had been stalled for years before getting a big boost from former New England Patriots quarterback Drew Bledsoe. Now a winemaker in Washington state, Bledsoe complained to lawmakers he could not send his products to Massachusetts residents, including fans and former teammates like current Patriots quarterback Tom Brady.\ANIMALS\In California, a ballot initiative approved by voters in 2008 takes effect restricting the confinement of egg-laying hens, breeding sows and veal calves. The Humane Society of the United States says the law goes further than any in the country when coupled with a law signed by former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger that extends the space requirements for egg-laying hens to out-of-state suppliers.\In Utah, cities and towns can no longer ban specific dog breeds within their limits. At least 10 cities now have restrictions that ban ownership of breeds such as pit bulls.\CRIME\In Louisiana, law enforcement agencies had to provide a tally of the number of untested rape kits on their shelves by Thursday, part of a law that took effect in August.\In Tennessee, ex-felons who have turned their lives around can now receive a certificate of employability, which gives businesses who hire such individuals protection from negligent hiring lawsuits.\ELECTIONS\In Louisiana, 16- and 17-year-olds will be able to register to vote when obtaining a driver's license, though they still won't be able to vote until they turn 18.\In North Carolina, individuals filing as a candidate in a party primary must have had an affiliation with that party for at least 90 days before filing a candidacy notice.\ENVIRONMENT\In North Carolina, home sellers will have to disclose whether they know if underground oil and gas rights have been sold.\HEALTH\Tennessee joins more than 20 states adding insulin to medications that school staff may volunteer to be trained to administer. Proponents said it will help in an era of dwindling school nurses, while opponents say only someone with a medical background should give insulin in case something unexpected happens.\In Louisiana, smoking will be banned within 25 feet of public entrances to state office buildings, as a way to lessen exposure to secondhand smoke.\HUNTING\In North Carolina, the state Wildlife Resources Commission faces new restrictions on how high it can raise fees on hunting, fishing and trapping licenses. Starting with the new year, the fees can't be raised beyond a widely used measure of inflation averaged over the previous five years.\MOTOR VEHICLES\In California, drivers' licenses will be available for people in the country illegally.\In Nevada, students who are declared habitually truant could be delayed from obtaining a driver's license, or could have their license suspended.\In Florida, all children aged 4 and 5 will be required to sit in a child safety seat or booster seat instead of using just a car seat belt.\SOCIAL MEDIA\In New York in February, it becomes illegal to pose for a photo with a lion, tiger or other big cat. The measure, which specifically prohibits contact between members of the public and big cats at animal shows, passed after self-portraits with the animals started becoming more popular online, particularly with some young men on dating sites.\TAXES\In North Carolina, Republican lawmakers who approved an income tax cut also took away breaks to Hollywood and cab drivers. Expiring is a 25 percent tax credit for TV and film productions that in 2013 allowed producers to forego paying $61 million in state taxes. It's being replaced in 2015 by a grant program for video productions capped at $10 million.\In Virginia, drivers can expect to see a 5 cents-per-gallon increase in the cost of gas, while Maryland's gas tax is set to rise about 3.5 cents.\In Mississippi, totally disabled veterans and their surviving spouses who have not remarried would not have to pay property taxes on their primary residence.\WAGES\The minimum wage went up Thursday in several states, including Arkansas, Connecticut, Florida, Ohio, Maryland, Massachusetts and Rhode Island.
