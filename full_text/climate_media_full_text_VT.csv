CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- New Hampshire Gov. John Lynch said Thursday he wants the state to remain a member of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative aimed at reducing carbon emissions.
\
Lynch announced he is opposing House legislation that would repeal that participation.
\
In a letter to The House Science, Technology and Energy Committee, Lynch said repealing the law will cost electric ratepayers up to $6 million in higher costs while forfeiting $12 million a year in funding.
\
""Withdrawing from RGGI would be a blow to our economy and to our state's efforts to become more energy efficient and energy independent,"" Lynch wrote.
\
The committee held a hearing Thursday on a bill to repeal the program started three years ago.
\
New Hampshire is one of 10 Northeastern states participating in a cap-and-trade program for carbon dioxide. Under the program, generators must reduce pollution or bid at auction for allowances giving them the right to produce certain amounts of carbon dioxide.
\
Proceeds from the auction are used for energy efficiency programs. Critics complain electric users are funding efficiency programs that don't directly benefit them.
\
""Through this initiative, we have invested significantly to help increase the energy efficiency of homes, public buildings and businesses,"" said Lynch. ""In many cases, these funds help to leverage additional private resources to achieve even greater benefits.""
\
Last year, New Hampshire raided its fund to help pay for other state spending -- a move Lynch supported and defended by saying the overall goal of reducing energy demand was being met through a mix of state and federally funded programs.
\
The repeal bill's prime sponsor, Republican state Rep. Richard Barry of Merrimack, said his main concern was government's involvement. He also criticized its funding source.
\
""RGGI is a stealth tax that never shows up. It's hidden on your electric bill,"" he said.
\
State Rep. Andrew Manuse, a Derry Republican and bill co-sponsor, argued the law is hurting, not helping New Hampshire's economy.
\
""Even if carbon dioxide emissions are a problem for the environment, the regional greenhouse gas initiative has simply not impacted the overall reduction of emissions, yet it has had and will continue to have a significant negative impact on the economy,"" he said.
\
Any benefit from New Hampshire's emissions reductions is nullified by growing emissions in other countries, he said.
\
State Air Resources Director Robert Scott testified that the program was never intended to solve the climate change problem. When the program was established, the Legislature intended for it to be revisited to see if it was working, he said.
\
""It was a beginning,"" he said.
\
Environmental groups including the New Hampshire chapter of the Sierra Club and Environment New Hampshire are urging the bill's defeat as is House Democratic Leader Terie Norelli.

\
BRUSSELS (AP) -- Europe's main weapon in the battle against climate change is now fighting for its own survival.
\
In early January, investors in the continent's cap-and-trade system still had to pay some 14 euro ($18.30) for the right to emit one ton of carbon dioxide into the air. By last week, the price of one emission allowance had tumbled to a meager 6.41 euro -- making it much cheaper to pollute and slashing the financial incentives for companies to invest in low-carbon technologies.
\
Analysts warn that the prospect of another recession in the debt-ridden continent, and the accompanying decline in emissions, could push prices below 2 euro by the end of next month.
\
The troubles in the carbon market, a system being watched closely from California to China, is linked to the struggles of Europe' other ambitious project, the euro. And just as financial investors have looked to the European Central Bank to save the currency through massive intervention in the bond markets, analysts say the emissions market may need similar centralized help.
\
Last week, 19 companies, including oil giant Royal Dutch Shell PLC, Philips Electronics NV and supermarket chain Tesco PLC, sent a letter to the European Commission urging it to reduce the number of emission allowances in the system and figure out how to protect the market from future economic shocks. The commission and national governments jointly manage the cap-and-trade system.
\
Undermining development
\
""The lower price is really undermining the development of technologies that will be needed in the decades to come,"" said David Hone, Shell's climate change adviser.
\
Shell, which is mostly known for selling oil and gas, has been one of the pioneers of carbon capture and storage, projects in which CO2 emissions are stored underground so they don't get released into the atmosphere and contribute to global warming. But investing in new technologies like carbon capture and storage only becomes commercially viable at a carbon price of between 25 and 30 euro, Hone said.
\
""Over the last few months, we have seen some of these projects disappear,"" he added.
\
In October, the U.K.government shut down the carbon capture project in Longannet in eastern Scotland in which Shell was one of the partners.
\
While the prospect of another recession is the main reason for the recent drop in carbon prices, experts say that -- just like with the euro -- serious flaws in the system are exacerbating the problems and could lead to its failure if they can't be fixed.
\
The economic crisis has lowered emissions and thus hit the price of carbon allowances. But the drop has been so dramatic because there were too many allowances in the system to begin with.
\
To get industry and skeptical governments on board, the Commission set a very high cap for emissions when it launched the carbon market in 2005.
\
Since then, most allowances have been given out for free to the 11,000 power stations and factories covered by the system based on their historical emissions. Companies that emit less carbon dioxide than they are allowed can sell their spare permits to firms that exceed their limit. As of next year, airlines will also be included in the system.
\
But the big test for Europe's carbon market -- and whether it can provide the financial incentives for cutting emissions -- will come in 2013, when governments start selling a growing number of allowances at auctions.
\
It is before then that the Commission has to intervene, say the companies that wrote last week's letters.
\
There are signs that their calls are being heard.
\
On Tuesday, the environment committee of the European Parliament voted to withdraw some 1.4 billion allowances, about 15 percent of the total, from the carbon market between 2013 and 2020. At the same time, the committee said, the annual cap should be cut by 2.25 percent per year, rather than the 1.74 percent currently planned.
\
While the committee vote is the first step in a long process of changing the system and few industry watchers expect the figures to survive negotiations among EU states trying to protect their national industries, it caused carbon prices to jump more than 18 percent.
\
""It opens up a much deeper discussion about what does the intervention look like and when is it going to happen,"" says Sanjeev Kumar, an expert on carbon trading at environmental watchdog E3G in Brussels.
\
""Without intervention,"" warned Kumar, ""not only the ETS is over, but Europe's climate policy is over. It will put Europe back into the dark ages.""
\
Apart from failing to encourage the necessary cuts in emissions and technological innovation, the collapse in the carbon price could also worsen Europe's debt crisis.
\
Between 2013 and 2020, when companies have to pay for more and more of their allowances, the cap-and-tade system could raise as much as 190 billion euro for governments across the EU if prices recover.
\
""This is a pretty important revenue stream for most member states,"" says Rob Elsworth, of climate campaign group Sandbag in London. ""And they are watching revenues just disappear.""
\
Experts like Kumar and Elsworth are hopeful that states will garner the political will to save the carbon trading system, which has pioneered the market-based approach to saving the environment.
\
""If you take away this green-economy narrative,"" asked Elsworth, ""what's really left of Europe?""
"
2,"By Tim Johnson\Not too long ago it was being called ""the century's defining issue."" Now it's not even the issue of the year -- in an election year, no less.\Climate change has been trumped by the recession, of course, and there are other reasons why it has fallen out of the public spotlight. The Copenhagen conference, which some environmental zealots had billed as humanity's last best hope to limit greenhouse gas emissions before it's too late, essentially failed. A flap over allegedly fudged research in England fed the climate-change-denial movement and public doubts about whether the threat has been exaggerated. Legislation narrowly passed the U.S. House but stalled in the Senate and dropped off the table for the rest of the year.\To be sure, climate change is not entirely missing from election platforms, in that many candidates are touting their support for measures that promote energy efficiency, or energy conservation, or energy renewables -- all of which would help rein in the greenhouse gas emissions that scientists say are causing the problem. What the candidates are not talking so much about -- even in the aftermath of a summer reported to be one of the hottest on record -- is how, or whether, the government should put a lid on greenhouse gas emissions and attempt to bring them down systematically, and substantially, before the midpoint of the century.\That's partly because members of Congress who voted for the House bill, which included a market-driven cap-and-trade scheme to limit emissions, are under attack around the country. ""Cap and trade"" -- a moderate attempt to address the issue that drew the scorn of climate-change scientists, who said it didn't do enough, and conservative critics, who dubbed it ""cap and tax"" -- has become a flashpoint for the tea party insurgency.\After Christine O'Donnell upset Mike Castle in the Republican senatorial primary in Delaware, postmortems took note of how she capitalized on Castle's vote for cap and trade. As a longtime Republican representative, Castle had voted against both health care reform and the economic stimulus, holding to the party line, but his divergence on climate change apparently contributed to his undoing.\That groundswell of upheaval hasn't made its way to Vermont -- yet. Here, climate change is a settled question within the political business establishment.\Questioning the candidates\In Vermont, three statewide races are for offices that have oversight over climate-change issues: U.S. senator, U.S. representative, and governor. When the Free Press asked the six candidates for the two major parties in those contests for their attitudes toward climate change, one respondent -- U.S. Representative candidate Paul Beaudry, a Republican -- stood apart.\To the questions, ""Do you believe that human-induced climate change is a reality?"" and ""Do you believe that the government should act to reduce carbon emissions?"" Beaudry's answer was emphatic: ""No!""\""Climate change is from the sun, oceans and volcanoes for the most part,"" he said.\By contrast, Rep. Peter Welch, D-Vt., Beaudry's opponent, answered both questions affirmatively. He also reaffirmed his support for the House bill (The American Clean Energy and Security Act) and its goal to ""cut carbon emissions 80 percent by 2050 through a cap and trade system.""\Democratic candidates Patrick Leahy, the incumbent senator, and state Sen. Peter Shumlin, running for governor, both replied, in effect, that they believe climate change is real.\""The evidence is overwhelming,"" Shumlin said. ""Any other conclusion is simply irresponsible.""\Leahy said he supported President Obama's pledge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a pledge spelled out in the House bill, which Obama supported.\On the emission-limit question, Shumlin replied: ""We all have a responsibility to race instead of crawl in our effort to relieve our addiction to fossil fuels. In addition, Vermont's next governor needs to capture a piece of the job expansion that is going to take place.""\Republican candidates Lt. Gov. Brian Dubie, Shumlin's opponent, and Len Britton, running against Leahy, did not respond to the climate-change query.\Dubie told the League of Conservation Voters over the summer: ""I believe that scientific data clearly show that climate change is real, and as a result of human behavior, the world is getting warmer. Carbon emissions are playing a large role in the warming of our planet.""\Britton's campaign website does not mention climate change, per se, but calls for a reduction in reliance on fossil fuels and ""setting a date for the end of oil consumption.""\Where the issue is hot\The biggest and loudest fight over climate change this election season is in California, where a law limiting greenhouse gas emissions is under attack through a ballot initiative that's drawing heavy financial support from oil interests.\Emissions limits and the machinery to enforce them are portrayed, by conservative political candidates and their supporters, as another example of government overreach.\John McCain, who had supported cap-and-trade legislation to address climate change before his presidential campaign, spoke out against the Senate version this year, invoking the ""cap and tax"" tag.\""I think the tea party has pulled the Republican Party further away from supporting any kind of climate-change policy,"" said Christopher Klyza, a professor of political science and environmental studies at Middlebury College. ""It is a bit ironic that 20 years ago Republicans and conservatives were advocating the use of market incentives like cap and trade and taxation to make environmental regulation (for acid rain) more efficient and it was environmentalists who were hesitant. Now, market incentives are dismissed as taxes.""\Carbon taxes, another policy tool to subdue emissions advocated by some activists, get virtually no consideration in the current politico-economic climate. Ditto cap-and-dividend, a policy variant advocated by Bill McKibben, resident scholar at Middlebury College and leading climate-change activist.\""Climate should be ever nearer the center,"" he wrote in an e-mail. ""We've just come through the warmest year on record, watched what happened in Pakistan and Russia, and so on. But ... it's nowhere near the top of the political agenda.\""One reason is, at the national and international level our leaders have punted -- the failure of the Copenhagen process and the failure of Congress to push through any climate legislation have I fear taken away the chance for real legislative progress over the next two years,"" he said, adding that an alternative approach would be to step up efforts to address the issue through EPA regulation.\State of the state\At the state level in Vermont, climate change might not be the most compelling environmental issue. For one thing, the most substantial policies to address global warming are likely to be at the national level -- through congressional or EPA action -- or at the global level, through international treaties that commit the big emitters to action. Anything Vermont does to reduce emissions is likely to be overwhelmed, or minimized, by actions of the big players.\Nevertheless, Vermont has its own climate change plan, and the Governor's Climate Change Commission in 2007 set an ambitious goal that the state probably won't be able to meet: to reduce total emissions by 2012 to 25 percent below the level of 1990.\The question for agency chiefs and political leaders is how aggressively the state should act to pursue that goal. Taking the edge off, however, is a fresh updating of the state's emissions inventory, released last week, which shows total emissions' dropping 10.8 percent from 2005 through 2008. The decrease is attributable partly to efficiency improvements and to the recession. High fuel prices helped lead to a drop in vehicle miles traveled, lowering the profile of transportation, the biggest emitting sector.\No government entity is charged with pushing Vermont toward its overall emissions goal. Piecemeal efforts to cut emissions are under way in various departments and around the state -- most promisingly at the local level, said to Elizabeth Courtney, executive director of the Vermont Natural Resources Council. She calls climate change ""the 800-pound gorilla in the room.""\""The inaction on the issue of climate change here in Montpelier and in Washington, D.C., is breathtaking,"" she said in an e-mail. ""Thank goodness for the tireless work of the 100 or so volunteer town energy committees across the state, putting forth their best efforts to reduce their carbon footprints, in spite of federal and state inaction.""\McKibben said that in Vermont, as nationally, ""the political eye is focused on the economy,"" but he added: ""That doesn't mean there isn't an awful lot we can do in Montpelier --much of it focused on both energy and the economy. ... It's all about climate change in the end, since anything to do with energy is at the core of the problem."""

\
Imagine if the government made you spend 20 percent of your family's food budget on asparagus. It might be costlier than other vegetables, but Congress and the president say it's good for you. Asparagus producers are ecstatic -- no more competing with other vegetables for your business. And because there's a mandate, they don't even have to worry about lowering costs.
\
Other farmers respond by replacing their less-expensive crops with the costlier, mandated vegetable. In the end, consumers are stuck with less choice and higher prices.
\
Sounds absurd, right? Well, it's what would happen to our electricity bills if Congress passes a Renewable Electricity Standard.
\
An RES would force Americans to purchase a pre-determined percentage of their electricity from certain energy sources that Washington bureaucrats deem acceptable, like wind or solar, which featured prominently in last year's failed ""cap and trade"" legislation. Tuesday's election likely killed any hopes of Congress passing a cap-and-trade bill anytime soon, but an RES, which has garnered bipartisan support, is still in the cards.
\
Politicians are quick to say that an RES would enable us to have renewable energy without having a cap and trade. But like cap and trade, it's the equivalent of an energy tax -- and an economy killer.
\
Because these electricity sources are expensive, Washington has to force us to buy them. Mandated higher electricity prices ripple throughout the economy. Higher electric bills force families to consume less and dip into their savings. They force businesses to cut production and reduce labor.
\
A Heritage Foundation analysis found that a 15 percent RES by 2020 would destroy more than 1 million jobs as soon as 2017 and reduce gross domestic product by more than $1 trillion from 2012 to 2020.
\
But, say politicians, higher prices are justified. An RES is necessary for America's clean energy economy and securing energy independence.
\
Saying RES will enhance America's energy security is nothing more than an empty talking point. Since electricity comes almost entirely from secure domestic sources, and petroleum provides about 1 percent of our electricity needs, an RES would do almost nothing to decrease our use of foreign energy. It would simply displace cheap electricity with expensive electricity.
\
RES supporters argue that because wind and solar energy are emissions-free, increasing those sources will save the earth. The reality is requiring Americans to buy expensive, uncompetitive energy has little, if anything, to do with the environment. A recent study by the Independent Petroleum Association of Mountain States finds that temporarily reducing coal generation in place of wind generates more greenhouse gases because it causes coal plants to operate inefficiently.
\
RES is more a political instrument for Washington to subsidize powerful special-interest groups, than a policy to reduce emissions. Otherwise, it would include nuclear power, which provides almost 70 percent of the nation's emissions-free energy.
\
Not that including nuclear energy and carbon capture and storage technology in an RES bill would make it a good idea -- Washington has no business in dictating what energy sources Americans use. But excluding them demonstrates the hypocrisy at work here.
\
Too often these mandates are not recognized for what they are: a mechanism to transfer wealth from everyday Americans to industries that politicians believe are worthy. Congress concentrates benefits to the politically connected and disperses the costs to the rest of us.
\
Here is the truly perverse outcome of these policies. Mandating and subsidizing non-competitive technologies crowds out investment for newer, cleaner technologies that could not only help us preserve the environment but do it at an affordable price. The resources used to prop up uncompetitive wind and solar projects could be invested into new emissions-free electricity sources that might be cheaper than fossil fuels. But we'll never know, because we'll be stuck with what the government gave us.
\
Chalk RES up as another policy that will increase the cost of living and curtail liberty for Americans. An RES will eliminate competition, drive prices higher, and encourage government dependence. This isn't an acceptable substitute for cap and trade, and any bipartisanship the idea receives doesn't make it a good idea. If some politicians believe wind and solar are economically viable for their respective states, they should work with state legislators to pass something for their state and not allow the rest of America to endure the economic pain of a national RES.

In the summer of 1988, I worked in New Hampshire's White Mountains for the Appalachian Mountain Club. I lived at Greenleaf Hut on Mount Lafayette, carrying food and supplies, cooking meals for hikers, and spending my free time exploring the peaks and crags of the Franconia Ridge. It's the most spectacular place I've ever worked. On a clear day, you could see a fair chunk of Northern New England from the ridge above the hut. Even facing a sink full of dirty dishes, you could look out the window and see clear across the Northeast Kingdom to Jay Peak and Quebec.
\
During an extended stretch in August of that summer, however, an unusual event occurred: You couldn't see much of anything. It wasn't due to fog or rain or any of the crazy weather that the White Mountains are famous for. Rather, it was just the opposite: The weather more or less came to a halt. Each day dawned just like the one before, only hotter and thicker, with the sun barely visible overhead through a sticky, gray haze of pollution.
\
The air over the mountains, which had traversed the power plants and the industrial centers of the Midwest before stalling over New Hampshire, was picking up ever-more pollution and car exhaust with each passing day. The mountains were lost from sight, even at midday. I remember one particular day looking across Franconia Notch and not even being able to see the Old Man of the Mountain, still residing in Franconia Notch in 1988, on his cliff less than a mile away.
\
As it happens, the research arm of the Appalachian Mountain Club was starting a study that year trying to understand why the famous White Mountain views were disappearing. The staff mounted a camera on the roof of one of their buildings in Pinkham Notch, and each day the camera snapped a photo up toward Mount Washington. At the same time, sampling equipment higher up the mountain measured air quality. The researchers then correlated how far they could see with how much pollution was in the air.
\
Their findings were much clearer than the air they were studying. The typical view in the White Mountains over the first decade of the study, between 1988 and 1996, was about a third less than it should have been: 54 miles instead of the 80 to 90 miles that would have been observed on an otherwise clear day. Some days, like those infamous ones in August 1988, were dramatically worse.
\
Poor visibility isn't just a problem for hikers or tourists up in the mountains, of course- it's a marker of air pollution in general. Foul air is linked to everything from respiratory problems and asthma to slowed brain development in children, suppressed IQ, and ultimately, lowered life expectancy. New England, situated downwind from most of North America, had some of the worst air pollution in the United States. Acadia National Park, on the remote coast of Maine far from any major urban center, often earned the dubious distinction of having worse air pollution than Central Park in New York City.
\
As it happens, this is a tale with a happy ending. Over the past quarter century, we've made a nationwide commitment to cleaning up our air. We've phased out old power plants, shifted to cleaner fuels, built more efficient cars and installed filters and scrubbers on major industrial emitters. Some of this has come through government regulation, like improvements to the Clean Air Act, and some of it has come working with the private sector, like the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative that has established a cap-and-trade market for cleaning up the air.
\
Up in the White Mountains, the progress is evident. The Appalachian Mountain Club reports that we've gotten back about half of the lost view - you can see 18 miles farther on average today than you could back in the late 1980s. And with additional improvements coming down the proverbial pipe - the phasing out of the dirtiest coal plants in the coming years and the phasing in of tighter gas mileage requirements - the best is still to come.
\
I take great solace from this story, and not only because I still love to scramble to the top of White Mountain peaks and take in the view. Back in 1988, haze and smog seemed inevitable, like problems that were never going to be solved. The beginnings of the environmental movement in the 1960s and 1970s had only just begun to show results, and air pollution was still spawning all sorts of related ill effects, like the acidified rain that was degrading mountain ponds and lakes across the Northeast.
\
And yet, here we are. The air is clean and getting cleaner.
\
I take solace from this story for another reason, one that does not yet have a happy ending. 1988 became famous as the hottest year on record up to that point, and the term ""global warming"" burst onto the national stage. A problem that had previously been confined primarily to scientific conferences suddenly became front page news.
\
Looking back, 1988 is a year we'd gladly return to now. It's no longer on the list of the top 10 hottest years anymore. (It's number 18, according to NASA, with all of the top 10 years having occurred since then.) The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was still below the 350 ppm threshold back in 1988, a level that many scientists believe we needed to stay below. (It's now averaging 400 ppm.)
\
The arguments against taking action today against climate change are the same as those brought up in 1988 over air pollution: We can't afford it, jobs will be lost, we'll lose our competitive edge, you can't have jobs and a clean environment. These arguments ignore the benefits that come from a cleaner environment: new jobs in new fields, better health for everyone and competitive advantage in fields that weren't even invented then. The tools we need to address climate change are exactly those we've used so successfully against air pollution: a combination of government regulation, private innovation and cap-and-trade schemes that put the market to work on our behalf.
\
I was just up in the White Mountains recently. As it happened, you could see the Atlantic ocean from the top of Mount Washington that day, a stunning view across all of New Hampshire, with the red maple and mountain ash leaves catching fire in the foreground. What finer example of how far we've come in the past 25 years. And what better view of the ground we need to cover in solving a problem we've been ignoring for too long since then.

Thursday, June 12CONCORD, N.H. -- New Hampshire became the 10th state Wednesday to participate in a regional effort to cut greenhouse gas emissions.
\
Gov. John Lynch signed a law to implement the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative known as RGGI. New Hampshire will revisit the issue if Congress enacts a federal program. The law took effect immediately.
\
""With this legislation we are taking a major step forward in protecting our economy and our natural resources by reducing pollution and increasing energy efficiency,"" said Lynch. ""Pollution and climate change threaten our state's environment, our health and our economy.""
\
The law adds New Hampshire to the other New England states, New York, New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland in a market-based, ""cap and trade"" program to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from the region's power plants.
\
Lynch believes joining RGGI will allow New Hampshire to cut the emissions that contribute to global climate change, increase energy efficiency and ultimately help consumers save on energy costs.
\
""If global warming is left unchecked, our grandchildren could be living in a much warmer climate,"" he said.
\
Lynch said a warmer New Hampshire would affect the environment which, in turn, could hurt tourism - a major economic engine in the state.
\
""I believe strongly there should be national action and a national energy policy that addresses these issues,"" he said. ""But I also do not believe that New Hampshire can afford to wait for national action.""
\
Environment New Hampshire, The Nature Conservancy and the Conservation Law Foundation applauded the step toward reducing greenhouse gases.
\
""This program will serve as a catalyst for additional regional and national action,"" predicted Daryl Burtnett, state director of The Nature Conservancy.
\
The governors of the 10 states signed a memorandum of understanding agreeing to the initiative. It is a regional plan, but each state must adopt its own laws and regulations.
\
Under RGGI, a regional carbon dioxide emissions cap will be put in place for large fossil fuel-fired power plants beginning in 2009. Allowances will be issued equal to the total cap and apportioned to the participating states. Utilities would have to buy enough allowances within three years to cover their emissions. Since the number of allowances is limited by the regional cap, overall emissions are expected to be reduced.
\
The money utilities pay for the allowances would go into a state-regulated fund to improve energy efficiency. Money from the sale of allowances above a certain threshold would go back to electric ratepayers.
\
Critics said RGGI unfairly shifts costs onto ratepayers, especially businesses. Businesses wanted a lower threshold than either the House or Senate proposed, while environmental groups wanted a high threshold to build a bigger fund.
\
The House proposed an initial threshold of $12 per ton while the Senate set its 2009 mark at $6 per ton - which the House accepted and Lynch signed into law. Business groups had wanted the mark set at $2 per ton. The threshold rises over time in both versions to 2015. After 2015, all proceeds go into the fund.
\
New Hampshire's cap would be 8.6 million tons per year out of 188 million tons emitted by the 10 states. Affected power plants in New Hampshire would be: Schiller Station in Portsmouth, Newington Station and Newington Energy LLC, both in Newington, Merrimack Station in Bow, and Granite Ridge in Londonderry.
\
Other types of allowances also are part of the plan. For example, capturing methane gas at a landfill also reduces carbon emissions. Also under consideration is using forestry management to reduce carbon emissions through techniques as simple as planting trees.
\
State environmental officials envision a wide range of uses for the money that include cooling and heating efficiencies. For example, money could be used to help insulate homes or to buy wood stoves or more efficient furnaces.
\
Wal-Mart Inc.'s Concord store supplied energy-efficient compact fluorescent light bulbs that Granite State Conservation Voters distributed to people at the bill signing to highlight the importance of reducing demand for power.
\
New Hampshire's electric users would have paid higher rates regardless of New Hampshire participating in RGGI. That's because New Hampshire buys about half its power from a wholesale market whose rates will rise as other states' power producers buy RGGI allowances and pass on the costs to ratepayers.
\
If the state had not joined the initiative, electric users would have lost the benefit of a share of the allowances going into an energy efficiency fund whose aim is to lower both carbon emissions and energy consumption over time.
\
Critics argued nothing prevents lawmakers from raiding multimillion-dollar fund created by the bill to pay for other state spending - which would undo future savings on rates.

\
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Appealing for courageous action ""before it's too late,"" President Barack Obama launched a major second-term drive Tuesday to combat climate change and secure a safer planet, bypassing Congress as he sought to set a cornerstone of his legacy.
\
Abandoning his suit jacket under a sweltering sun at Georgetown University, Obama issued a dire warning about the environment: Temperatures are rising, sea level is climbing, the Arctic ice is melting and the world is doing far too little to stop it. Obama said the price for inaction includes lost lives and homes and hundreds of billions of dollars.
\
""As a president, as a father and as an American, I'm here to say we need to act,"" Obama said. ""I refuse to condemn your generation and future generations to a planet that's beyond fixing.""
\
At the core of Obama's plan are new controls on new and existing power plants that emit carbon dioxide -- heat-trapping gases blamed for global warming. The program also will boost renewable energy production on federal lands, increase efficiency standards and prepare communities to deal with higher temperatures. Obama called for the U.S. to be a global leader in the search for solutions.
\
But Obama's campaign will face extensive obstacles, including a complicated, lengthy process of implementation and the likelihood that the limits on power plants will be challenged in court. Likewise, the instantaneous political opposition that met his plan made clear the difficulty the president will face in seeking broad support.
\
""There will be legal challenges. No question about that,"" former EPA Administrator Christie Whitman said in an interview. ""It's a program that's largely executive. He doesn't need Congress. What that does, of course, is make them (Congress) madder.""
\
Obama also offered a rare insight into his deliberations on whether to approve the Keystone XL oil pipeline, deeming it in America's interests only if it doesn't worsen carbon pollution. Obama has faced intense political pressure from supporters and opponents of the 1,200-mile pipeline from Canada to Texas.
\
Declaring the scientific debate over climate change and its causes obsolete, Obama mocked those who deny that humans are contributing to the warming of the planet.
\
""We don't have time for a meeting of the flat-earth society,"" Obama said.
\
Obama's announcement followed years of inaction by Congress to combat climate change. A first-term effort by Obama to use a market-based approach called cap-and-trade to lower emissions failed, and in February a newly re-elected Obama issued lawmakers an ultimatum in his State of the Union: ""If Congress won't act soon to protect future generations, I will.""
\
Four months later, impatient environmental activists reveled in the news that Obama was finally taking matters into his own hands, announcing a series of steps that don't require congressional approval.
\
""This is the change we have been waiting for,"" said Michael Brune, who runs the Sierra Club, an environmental group. ""Today, President Obama has shown he is keeping his word to future generations.""
\
Republicans on both sides of the Capitol dubbed Obama's plan a continuation of his ""war on coal"" and ""war on jobs."" The National Association of Manufacturers claimed Obama's proposals would drive up costs. Republican Rep. Shelley Moore Capito of the coal-heavy state of West Virginia slammed what she called Obama's ""tyrannical efforts to bankrupt the coal industry.""
\
""The federal government should leave us the hell alone,"" said Texas Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson, whose agency handles Texas' environment and energy markets.
\
Even industry groups that have been friendly to Obama and supportive of his climate goals, such as the Edison Electric Institute, which represents power plants, signaled their apprehension by calling for ""achievable compliance limits and deadlines.""
\
Obama said the same arguments have been used in the past when the U.S. has taken other steps to protect the environment.
\
""That's what they said every time,"" Obama said. ""And every time, they've been wrong.""
\
Obama broke his relative silence on Keystone XL, explicitly linking the project to global warming for the first time in a clear overture to environmental activists who want the pipeline nixed. The pipeline would carry carbon-intensive oil from Canadian tar sands to the Texas Gulf Coast refineries and has sparked an intense partisan fight.
\
""Our national interest would be served only if this project does not significantly exacerbate the problem of carbon pollution,"" Obama said.
\
The White House indicated Obama was referring to overall, net emissions that take into account what would happen under alternative scenarios. A State Department report this year said other methods to transport the oil -- like shipping it on trains -- could yield even higher emissions.
\
""The standard the president set today should lead to speedy approval of the Keystone pipeline,"" said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio.
\
Announcing he will allow more renewable energy projects on public lands, Obama set a goal to power the equivalent of 6 million homes by 2020 from sources like wind and solar, effectively doubling the current capacity. The set of actions also includes a new set of fuel efficiency standards for heavy-duty trucks, more aggressive efficiency targets for buildings and appliances, and $8 billion in federal loan guarantees to spur innovation.
\
By far the most sweeping element -- and the one likely to cause the most consternation -- is new limits on carbon dioxide pollution from power plants.
\
The administration has already proposed rules for new coal-fired plants, but they have been delayed amid industry concerns about the cost. A presidential memorandum Obama issued Tuesday directs the EPA to revise and reissue the new plant rules by September, then finalize them ""in a timely fashion.""
\
The key prize for environmental groups comes in Obama's instruction that the EPA propose rules for the nation's existing plants by June 2014, then finalize them by June 2015 and implement them by June 2016 -- just as the presidential campaign to replace Obama will be in full swing.
\
Rather than issue a specific, uniform standard that plants must meet, the EPA will work with states, power sector leaders and other parties to develop plans that meet the needs of individual states and also achieve the objective of reducing emissions.

8,"
Thursday, March 20 CONCORD, N.H. -- New Hampshire's House is endorsing a 10-state regional effort to cut greenhouse gas emissions to preserve the state's climate and way of life.
\
The House voted 214-107 to send a bill to the Senate that implements the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative known as RGGI.
\
""This is a very small step. It is almost a token step. I would agree with that 100 percent. But we have to start somewhere,"" said Lee Democrat Naid Kaen, the bill's prime sponsor and chair of the Science, Technology and Energy Committee.
\
Gov. John Lynch believes the initiative will help New Hampshire's environment and economy.
\
""We are dedicating ourselves here in New Hampshire to reducing the pollution that causes global warming and climate change, and joining the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative is a major part of that effort. Cutting our greenhouse gas pollution is the right thing to do for the long-term health of our citizens, the health of our environment and our economy,"" Lynch said after the vote.
\
The bill adds New Hampshire to the other New England states, New York, New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland in a market-based, ""cap and trade"" program to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from the region's power plants.
\
The governors of the 10 states have signed a memorandum of understanding agreeing to the initiative. It is a regional plan, but each state must adopt its own laws and regulations. States in other regions are considering similar plans.
\
Under RGGI, a regional carbon dioxide emissions cap would be put in place for large fossil fuel-fired power plants beginning in 2009. Allowances would be issued equal to the total cap and apportioned to the participating states. Utilities would have to buy enough allowances within three years to cover their emissions. Since the number of allowances is limited by the regional cap, overall emissions are expected to be reduced.
\
New Hampshire's cap would be 8.6 million tons per year out of 188 million tons emitted by the 10 states. Affected power plants in New Hampshire would be: Schiller Station in Portsmouth, Newington Station in Newington, Merrimack Station in Bow, Granite Ridge in Londonderry and Newington Energy LLC in Newington.
\
Other types of allowances also are part of the plan. For example, capturing methane gas at a landfill also reduces carbon emissions. Also under consideration is using forestry management to reduce carbon emissions through techniques as simple as planting trees.
\
The money utilities pay for the allowances would go into a state-regulated fund to improve energy efficiency.
\
State environmental officials envision a wide range of uses for the money that include cooling and heating efficiencies. For example, money could be used to help insulate homes or to buy wood stoves or more efficient furnaces.
\
Environmental Services Commissioner Thomas Burack says New Hampshire's electric users will pay higher rates regardless of New Hampshire participating in RGGI. That's because New Hampshire buys about half its power from a wholesale market whose rates will rise as other states' power producers buy RGGI allowances and pass on the costs to ratepayers.
\
If the state does not join the initiative, electric users would lose the benefit of a share of the allowances going into an energy efficiency fund whose aim is to lower both carbon emissions and energy consumption over time.
\
The governor and Executive Council can suspend RGGI's requirements in emergencies.
\
Critics argued the allowances should only be available to the utilities that need them to comply with the law.
\
They also said it is unfair to saddle electric ratepayers with the costs of subsidizing energy efficiency projects that they might not directly benefit from.
\
""We don't need to jump off the RGGI bridge just because everyone else is,"" said Atkinson Republican James Garrity.
\
Critics also said nothing prevents lawmakers from raiding multimillion dollar fund created by the bill to pay for other state spending -- which would undo future savings on rates.
\
""What's to prevent a future Legislature from raiding it?"" said Belmont Republican John Thomas.
\
Critics also said the bill only addresses power plants using fossil fuels, ignoring carbon dioxide emissions from transportation, homes and businesses.
\
""It's going to negatively affect our rates more than we realize,"" added Thomas.

Hanover -- Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., staked out a position on climate change during a Thursday visit to Dartmouth College, saying she believed that humanity should work to reduce its contribution to the phenomenon.
\
Ayotte, who is up for re-election in 2016, was in the Upper Valley to reach out to conservationists with a roundtable discussion focused on her support for the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which helps protect public lands and waters -- including sections of the Appalachian Trail that pass through Hanover.
\
""I believe that it is a real issue, that obviously man-made activity is contributing to carbon dioxide emissions and that we should be of course working on solutions that I hope are common-sense solutions,"" Ayotte said of climate change in an interview after the event.
\
She called for ""energy efficiency and other measures to help reduce the impact that carbon has on our environment.""
\
A one-term incumbent, Ayotte faces a likely general election challenge from New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan, a Democrat, who also has said that climate change is real, exacerbated by humans and in need of solutions.
\
Ayotte's climate change position, which is more moderate than many in her party, might be part of a 2016 election effort to appeal to environmentally conscious independents, according to political observer Dean Spiliotes, a civic scholar at Southern New Hampshire University.
\
""There are people out there who are almost single-issue voters on climate change -- those folks are unlikely to vote for her in any event,"" as their ballots usually go to Democrats, he said.
\
Rather than win those votes, Ayotte may wish to ""pick off independents who are comfortable enough voting for a Republican ... but would like to see a set of positions that are more moderate,"" Spiliotes said.
\
A Hassan spokesman said on Thursday that the governor believes humans contribute to climate change, and touted her sponsorship as a state senator of New Hampshire's participation in the 2008 Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, or RGGI, which authorized a cap-and-trade program for carbon emissions among several northeast states .
\
""The science is clear that climate change is real and that human activity is contributing to it, and Governor Hassan has long fought to combat climate change and address its impacts,"" spokesman William Hinkle said in an email. ""A healthy environment and economic development go hand-in-hand, and climate change is threatening our economy, our environment, our people and our way of life.""
\
As governor, Hassan signed legislation to update the state's renewable energy portfolio and establish a long-term state energy strategy, Hinkle said.
\
On Wednesday, Ayotte said the RGGI, while a state-level program, is ""very worthwhile.""
\
Ayotte noted that she had co-sponsored the 2015 Energy Efficiency Improvement Act authored by Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H, and signed into law in April. Ayotte added an amendment of her own that imposed energy-efficiency standards in commercial buildings.
\
Beyond the efficiency measures, she offered few other specifics Wednesday on how the federal government could address climate change.
\
""I think we need to make sure that we use the best technology that we can on, for example, power plants and other measures,"" Ayotte said in the interview. ""That's why I've consistently supported measures that the best technology that exists is used on our energy sources to protect our environment. And obviously, more opportunities in development in renewables is always positive, in terms of energy efficiency as well.""
\
In other environment-related votes, Ayotte has supported oil and gas drilling in the Arctic, as well as the Keystone XL pipeline. She twice voted against legislation that would have made it easier for power plants to obtain exemptions to the Environmental Protection Agency's air quality standards.
\
On climate change, Ayotte stands in contrast to the Republican presidential primary field, where most candidates alternately contend that the Earth is not warming, that humans are not significant contributors, that the science is not conclusive or that immediate action is not necessary.
\
Presidential hopeful Jeb Bush, during a town hall meeting Tuesday in Lebanon, said humanity played a role in climate change, but said scientists haven't determined how much of it is attributable to people.
\
""Humans have some impact,"" he said in response to an audience question. ""I don't think anybody can honestly say the science is over as it relates to the longevity of the impact, when that impact plays out, and what the actual impact will be.""
\
Rather than focus directly on reducing emissions, the government should not ""pick winners and losers,"" he said, and advocated letting markets sort out the problem while humanity waits for a new technology to ""reinvent the wheel"" in regards to global warming.
\
Asked about the apparent distance between her views and Republican orthodoxy, Ayotte kept the focus on her own position.
\
""I'm my own person,"" she said, adding, ""It's about my views and representing New Hampshire, so that's my focus, as opposed to what other candidates believe about issues.""
\
Ayotte's stance is not unusual for a Granite State Republican in Congress, Spiliotes said, citing former U.S. Rep. Charles Bass, who he said had ""always positioned himself to the left of the party on conservation issues.""
\
After the Dartmouth event, Ayotte joined a group hike on a trail segment that runs to the south of the town's lower water reservoir and features newly conserved land.

Tuesday, June 26 BRUDENELL, Prince Edward Island (AP) -- A coalition of environmental groups says Eastern Canadian provinces are lagging behind the New England states in controlling greenhouse gas emissions.
\
Canadian and U.S. environmentalists were in Prince Edward Island on Monday to pressure Eastern Canadian premiers and New England governors to take concrete action to stop climate change.
\
The premiers and governors from northeastern North America are holding their annual retreat at a golf resort on Prince Edward Island. The environment and energy top their agenda.
\
It has been six years since the state and provincial leaders agreed to ambitious targets for greenhouse gas emissions.
\
Time is running out for their first target -- the region is supposed to be at 1990 emission levels by 2010.
\
The states and provinces are supposed to be 10 per cent below those 1990 levels by 2020.
\
So far, emission levels in the region remain on the rise.
\
""The political opportunity is huge right now to take the kind of bold action we need if we are to achieve these targets and play our role in stopping global warming,"" said David Coon of the New Brunswick Conservation Council, one of the environmental groups attending the two-day premiers and governors meeting.
\
Coon and the other environmentalists said New England is setting the pace for change with its regional cap-and-trade program to reduce carbon emissions from power plants.
\
Under the cap-and-trade system, the players set a percentage-based emissions cap that they must meet together. If one of the players produces emissions below the cap, it may sell its ""excess"" emissions to another player that produces more than the cap allows.
\
Coon said that is the kind of system needed in Eastern Canada.
\
""What has been missing here is a commitment to regulation of industrial emissions,"" he said.
\
""This is key. If the provinces are going to achieve their targets they absolutely have to regulate emissions from industry.""
\
Provinces Like New Brunswick and Nova Scotia have announced targets, but appear reluctant to take on big industry.
\
New Brunswick has said it will leave regulations to the federal government.
\
Michael Stoddard of the U.S. based Environment Northeast group, said progress is being made in other areas.
\
The five Canadian provinces represented at the meeting are Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland and Labrador and Quebec. The six New England states are Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Democrats are pushing for a 20 percent cut in greenhouse gases by 2020 -- deeper than what the House has passed and what President Barack Obama wants -- according to a long-awaited bill that will test how serious the U.S. is about slowing global warming.
\
The Democratic bill is to be released today by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee with a vote by the panel likely in late October.
\
House Democrats could win passage of only a 17 percent emission cut by 2020 and Obama originally had sought only a 14 percent cut. However, aides who worked on the Senate version said it includes measures that will make the Senate's target easier to achieve and cheaper for consumers.
\
The bill obtained by The Associated Press remains subject to change. But the overall carbon reduction requirements are expected to stand.
\
The bill includes an economy-wide cap and trade system that would require power plants, industrial facilities and refineries to cut carbon dioxide and other climate-changing pollution. While there would be an overall emission cap, polluters would be able to purchase emission allowances to limit reductions. The bill, however, does not lay out how emission allowances would be distributed, a contentious issue left for resolving later.
\
The bill will become the starting point for difficult Senate negotiations in coming months as Democratic leaders seek to work out compromises to garner the 60 votes that will be needed for passage.
\
The 800-page bill calls for a ceiling on greenhouse gas emissions beginning in three years, to be tightened annually so that emissions would be 20 percent lower in 2020 than they were in 2005. Emissions would have to be 83 percent lower by 2050. While the long-term cuts are the same as required by the House in June, the Senate bill has bigger early targets, something many in industry oppose.
\
Democratic aides said information released since the House acted the 20 percent reduction by the end of the next decade will be easier to meet. U.S. emissions of carbon dioxide, the heat-trapping gas targeted in the bill, already are 6 percent lower than what they were in 2005, a reduction attributed largely to the economic recession, according to the Energy Department.
\
The bill includes provisions that its sponsors argue would help avoid severe energy price spikes as the economy shifts more and more away from cheaper fossil fuels, especially coal for electricity production. It would hold emission allowances in reserve so they can be made available if energy prices soar, said the Democratic aides.

Tuesday, May 13 PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- John McCain broke with the Bush administration and Republican Party orthodoxy Monday as he not only declared global warming real, but reached out to Democrats and independents with a free-market solution that includes capping carbon-fuel emissions.
\
The GOP presidential contender also prodded China and India -- two major emitters of the greenhouse gases blamed for the planet's warming -- to join the effort, although he muted planned talk of tariffs against them in favor of ""effective diplomacy"" to encourage their compliance.
\
An aide later said the Arizona senator didn't want to be interpreted as being ""at odds with his commitment to open trade.""
\
McCain was less restrained in his approach to President Bush, who broke a 2000 campaign pledge to regulate carbon-dioxide emissions and who also backed off signing the Kyoto global warming protocols shortly after taking office.
\
""I will not shirk the mantle of leadership that the United States bears. I will not permit eight long years to pass without serious action on serious challenges. I will not accept the same dead-end of failed diplomacy that claimed Kyoto. The United States will lead and will lead with a different approach -- an approach that speaks to the interests and obligation of every nation,"" McCain declared.
\
The language highlighted the political stakes for McCain, the Republicans' presumed presidential nominee.
\
His visit to Oregon came days after the leading Democratic contenders, Sens. Barack Obama of Illinois and Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, campaigned in the state.
\
Oregon is viewed by some as a general-election battleground, and its Columbia Gorge and Mount Hood National Wilderness are playgrounds for many outdoorsmen and environmentalists.
\
Among those attending McCain's speech was Oregon Gov. Ted Kulongoski, a Democrat. McCain heaped praise on him -- despite mangling the pronunciation of his name -- and said, ""As president of the United States, I will sit down with Governor Ted Kulongoski and all other governors of this country, whether they be Democrat or Republican, and work for the betterment of this nation.""
\
Global warming also stands with abortion rights and an array of social causes as important issues to the evangelicals and Christian conservatives whom McCain hopes will bolster his political base this fall.
\
Democrats derided McCain's record on the issue, noting contributions to his campaign from energy lobbyists, his recent proposal to temporarily suspend the federal gasoline tax as a means of making driving cheaper and some votes against alternate energy sources.
\
""It is truly breathtaking for John McCain to talk about combating climate change while voting against virtually every recent effort to actually invest in clean energy,"" Obama said in a statement.
\
Clinton said, ""While Senator McCain's proposals may be improvement on President Bush's, that's not saying much.""
\
McCain has long expressed a belief in global warming, arguing that even if he is wrong, acting as if the planet's temperature were increasing would only benefit the environment if scientists subsequently proved he was mistaken.
\
The main solution he outlined Monday is to implement a cap-and-trade program on carbon-fuel emissions, like a similar program in the Clean Air Act that was used to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions that triggered acid rain.
\
Industries would be given emission targets, and those coming in under their limit could sell their surplus polluting capacity to companies unable to meet their target.
\
McCain wants the country to return to 2005 emission levels by 2012; 1990 levels by 2020; and to a level 60 percent below that by 2050.
\
Internationally, McCain promised to challenge China and India, economic rivals who are fueling their challenge to U.S. market supremacy with heavily polluting fuels such as coal, gas and oil.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- A leading House Republican climate skeptic on Monday called for his party to preserve a global warming committee created by Democrats so Republicans can use it to rein in the Obama administration on the issue.
\
Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., said that the economic threat posed by Environmental Protection Agency regulations deserves special attention in the next Congress.
\
The EPA is set to regulate greenhouse gases next year for the first time, after the Supreme Court ruled in 2007 that it could treat heat-trapping gases such as carbon dioxide as pollutants. Many Republicans, who take control of the House in January, argue that the regulations would hurt the economy and kill jobs.
\
""No panel has developed more experience on these topics than the Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming,"" Sensenbrenner said in a statement. ""These regulations are moving quickly, but the oversight and subpoena power wielded by the select committee would put a tall hurdle in the path and would further expose the economic destruction these policies would bring.""
\
Sensenbrenner, the committee's top Republican, is in line to become chairman if his party keeps the panel. Brendan Buck, a spokesman for the Republican Majority Transition Committee, said that the decision will be made by GOP leadership -- subject to approval by the full party conference.
\
Michael Steel, a spokesman for Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, who is expected to become House speaker, said he has not heard any discussion about the panel. But some Republicans have already advocated putting the global warming committee on ice.
\
""The American people do not need Congress to spend millions of dollars to write reports and fly around the world,"" wrote Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., in a recent Washington Times op-ed. ""We must terminate this wasteful committee.""
\
Upton is a candidate to become next chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.
\
Democrats established the committee in 2007, after taking control of the House. At the time, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., called global warming possibly ""the greatest challenge of our time, setting at risk our economy, environment and national security."" With the committee, she said, ""the House is giving these issues the high visibility they deserve."" But from the very start, Republican committee members scoffed at claims about global warming as ""hot air"" and ""extremism.""
\
The committee has been chaired by Rep. Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat who was co-sponsor of legislation that would have limited pollution linked to global warming and redirected the nation toward greater use of clean energy. The bill narrowly passed the House last year. But it withered way in the Senate this year, despite a call for a carbon tax on fossil fuels or a cap-and-trade system for curbing greenhouse gas emissions by the National Academy of Sciences, which labeled global warming an urgent threat.
\
Markey spokesman Eben Burnham-Snyder declined to offer an opinion on Sensenbrenner's call.
\
""While we agree with Congressman Sensenbrenner that the select committee is ambitious and highly experienced in energy and climate issues, renewing the committee is a matter for his party's incoming speaker,"" he said.
\
The EPA did not immediately return messages seeking comment.

\
ATLANTA (AP) -- Rick Perry said Friday anyone with doubts about how he would govern as president should simply look at Texas.
\
In his first domestic policy speech as a candidate for the White House, Perry touted his record on taxes, health care and the environment during a decade at the helm of the Lone Star state. But he used the brief outline of his tenure to bludgeon his political rivals.
\
Perry drew a stark contrast between his record and that of Mitt Romney, his main GOP opponent, and raised the specter of the health care law Romney ushered through as governor.
\
""I am confident""
\
""As Republican voters decide who is best suited to lead this country in a new direction by stopping the spending spree and scrapping Obamacare, I am confident they will choose a nominee who has governed on conservative principles, not one whose health care policies paved the way for Obamacare,"" Perry said.
\
""I knew when I got into this race I would have my hands full fighting President Obama's big government agenda. I just didn't think it would be in the Republican primary,"" Perry continued.
\
The 13-minute speech to the Georgia Public Policy Foundation, an Atlanta-based conservative think tank, was delivered in a laconic, low-key style. He received polite applause from the crowd, which included a number of prominent Georgia Romney supporters.
\
Perry offered no policy proposals, instead pointing to Texas as a roadmap for a Perry presidency.
\
""I have a lengthy record, and sometimes it has ruffled feathers,"" Perry said. ""But sometimes you have to shake up the system. I am not running from my record.""
\
Perry has been battling back after a shaky debate performance, after which he admitted that he used ""inappropriate"" language when he called Republican rivals ""heartless."" Perry was defending a Texas law that allows illegal immigrants to pay in-state tuition at state universities if they meet certain criteria.
\
Perry went on the offensive Friday and launched a fresh line of attack on Romney's environmental record.
\
""In Texas, we've cleaned the air while creating jobs and adding millions in population. Another state -- Massachusetts -- was among the first states to implement its own cap-and-trade program which included limits on carbon emissions for power plants,"" Perry said in his speech.
\
Texas, home to the nation's oil and gas industry, has taken significant steps to clean its air in recent years, offering tax breaks and other incentives to companies that install expensive pollution controlling technology. But Texas still leads the nation in greenhouse gas emissions.
\
Perry has fought EPA rules and regulations, insisting the agency is overreaching and meddles in state affairs.
\
The state has challenged in court several new EPA regulations aimed at forcing heavy industry to take pollution-controlling measures.
\
Perry also accused Romney of relying on environmental advisers who went on to work in the Obama administration. Environmental Protection Agency official Gina McCarthy, who works on clean air regulations, helped Massachusetts develop a climate plan when Romney served as governor. McCarthy was appointed by Democratic Gov. Michael Dukakis and worked in state government for decades before moving to the EPA.
\
The Romney campaign accused Perry of misrepresenting the former Massachusetts governor's position. ""Rick Perry once again has run into problems with the truth,"" spokeswoman Andrea Saul said.
\
Romney never signed a cap-and-trade plan for Massachusetts, though he did encourage state efforts to protect the environment. Massachusetts participated in discussions about a Northeastern regional cap-and-trade system while Romney was governor, but Romney decided not to join it.
\
Lester Tate, past president of the Georgia Bar Association, called Perry's claims about the benefits of tort reform questionable and said his statistics about new doctors in Texas have been proven false.
\
""He's doubling down on a lie,"" Tate said. ""It's good Republican politics to go after lawyers.""
\
The number of new doctors actually practicing in the state is around 12,800, according to the Texas Medical Board. And critics say the state's 20 percent population growth over that span has swelled the ranks of doctors more than the state's strict medical malpractice caps.
\
Perry's speech comes as the presidential candidates face an important fundraising deadline Friday in the latest quarter of the campaign cycle.
\
Perry was set to headline a fundraiser in Atlanta before heading to New Hampshire for a town hall style meeting with voters.

16,"
Friday, May 16 CONCORD, N.H. -- New Hampshire's Senate is backing a 10-state regional effort to cut greenhouse gas emissions.
\
The Senate voted 16-8 Thursday to implement the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative known as RGGI, but to revisit the initiative if Congress enacts a federal program. The House next considers changes made to the proposal, especially on how much money would go into a fund to promote energy efficiency.
\
Gov. John Lynch believes the initiative will help New Hampshire's environment and economy.
\
The bill adds New Hampshire to the other New England states, New York, New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland in a market-based, ""cap and trade"" program to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from the region's power plants.
\
The governors of the 10 states have signed a memorandum of understanding agreeing to the initiative. It is a regional plan, but each state must adopt its own laws and regulations. States in other regions are considering similar plans.
\
Under RGGI, a regional carbon dioxide emissions cap would be put in place for large fossil fuel-fired power plants beginning in 2009. Allowances would be issued equal to the total cap and apportioned to the participating states. Utilities would have to buy enough allowances within three years to cover their emissions. Since the number of allowances is limited by the regional cap, overall emissions are expected to be reduced.
\
New Hampshire's cap would be 8.6 million tons per year out of 188 million tons emitted by the 10 states. Affected power plants in New Hampshire would be: Schiller Station in Portsmouth, Newington Station and Newington Energy LLC, both in Newington, Merrimack Station in Bow, and Granite Ridge in Londonderry.
\
Other types of allowances also are part of the plan. For example, capturing methane gas at a landfill also reduces carbon emissions. Also under consideration is using forestry management to reduce carbon emissions through techniques as simple as planting trees.
\
The money utilities pay for the allowances would go into a state-regulated fund to improve energy efficiency. Money from the sale of allowances above a certain threshold would go back to electric ratepayers.
\
Critics said RGGI unfairly shifts costs onto ratepayers, especially businesses. Businesses wanted a lower threshold than either the House or Senate propose, while environmental groups wanted a high threshold to build a bigger fund.
\
""This is a tax on dirty air,"" said Senate Republican Leader Ted Gatsas said. ""At some point, businesses are going to start to leave.""
\
But Webster Democrat Harold Janeway said rates will rise even more if nothing is done to promote energy efficiency.
\
""If we don't invest in energy efficiency, the price will be higher,"" he said. ""When you don't do something you ought to, you pay a procrastination penalty.""
\
The House proposed an initial threshold of $12 per ton while the Senate set its 2009 mark at $6 per ton. The threshold rises over time in both versions to 2015. After 2015, all proceeds go into the fund.
\
The Senate defeated an attempt to set the threshold at $2 -- a rate business groups advocated -- and an attempt to set the starting rate at $4 with $1 annual increases until 2018. The Senate also rejected a move to use the fund to pay for $250 million in borrowing to upgrade electric transmission lines in the North Country so more renewable power could be developed in the region.

For The Washington Post
\
There is no shortage of threats to our economy. America's unemployment rate recently hit its highest mark in more than 25 years and is expected to continue climbing. Worries are widespread that even when the economy finally rebounds, the recovery won't bring jobs. Our nation's debt is unsustainable, and the federal government's reach into the private sector is unprecedented.
\
Unfortunately, many in the national media would rather focus on the personality-driven political gossip of the day than on the gravity of these challenges. So, at risk of disappointing the chattering class, let me make clear what is foremost on my mind and where my focus will be:
\
I am deeply concerned about President Obama's cap-and-trade energy plan, and I believe it is an enormous threat to our economy. It would undermine our recovery over the short term and would inflict permanent damage.
\
American prosperity has always been driven by the steady supply of abundant, affordable energy. Particularly in Alaska, we understand the inherent link between energy and prosperity, energy and opportunity, and energy and security. Consequently, many of us in this huge, energy-rich state recognize that the president's cap-and-trade energy tax would adversely affect every aspect of the U.S. economy.
\
There is no denying that as the world becomes more industrialized, we need to reform our energy policy and become less dependent on foreign energy sources. But the answer doesn't lie in making energy scarcer and more expensive! Those who understand the issue know we can meet our energy needs and environmental challenges without destroying America's economy.
\
Job losses are so certain under this new cap-and-tax plan that it includes a provision accommodating newly unemployed workers from the resulting dried-up energy sector, to the tune of $4.2 billion over eight years. So much for creating jobs.
\
In addition to immediately increasing unemployment in the energy sector, even more American jobs will be threatened by the rising cost of doing business under the cap-and-tax plan. For example, the cost of farming will certainly increase, driving down farm incomes while driving up grocery prices. The costs of manufacturing, warehousing and transportation will also increase.
\
The ironic beauty in this plan? Soon, even the most ardent liberal will understand supply-side economics.
\
The Americans hit hardest will be those already struggling to make ends meet. As the president eloquently puts it, their electricity bills will ""necessarily skyrocket."" So much for not raising taxes on anyone making less than $250,000 a year.
\
Even Warren Buffett, an ardent Obama supporter, admitted that under the cap-and-tax scheme, ""poor people are going to pay a lot more for electricity.""
\
We must move in a new direction. We are ripe for economic growth and energy independence if we responsibly tap the resources that God created right underfoot on American soil. Just as important, we have more desire and ability to protect the environment than any foreign nation from which we purchase energy today.
\
In Alaska, we are progressing on the largest private-sector energy project in history. Our 3,000-mile natural gas pipeline will transport hundreds of trillions of cubic feet of our clean natural gas to hungry markets across America. We can safely drill for U.S. oil offshore and in a tiny, 2,000-acre corner of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge if ever given the go-ahead by Washington bureaucrats.
\
Of course, Alaska is not the sole source of American energy. Many states have abundant coal, whose technology is continuously making it into a cleaner energy source. Westerners literally sit on mountains of oil and gas, and every state can consider the possibility of nuclear energy.
\
We have an important choice to make. Do we want to control our energy supply and its environmental impact? Or, do we want to outsource it to China, Russia and Saudi Arabia? Make no mistake: President Obama's plan will result in the latter.
\
For so many reasons, we can't afford to kill responsible domestic energy production or clobber every American consumer with higher prices.
\
Can America produce more of its own energy through strategic investments that protect the environment, revive our economy and secure our nation?
\
Yes, we can. Just not with Barack Obama's energy cap-and-tax plan.
\
Sarah Palin, a Republican, is governor of Alaska.

18,"Scientists have spoken on global warming, but the window of opportunity for action is closing fast, and it will take a mass political movement -- something like the civil rights movement -- to avert catastrophe.\So said author and environmental activist Bill McKibben in a talk at Champlain College on Monday afternoon. The difference with the civil rights movement, he said, was that leaders of that knew they would eventually win. By contrast, there's no assurance that the movement to avert disastrous climate change will prevail.\Only a few years remain to make a difference, he said. He pointed to some positive signs: The national awareness of the problem is rising, and the ""Step it Up"" campaign, which generated more than 1,000 demonstrations across the country last year, set a useful precedent.\The necessary changes are huge, but they have to be made rapidly, he said.\""We have to stop building coal-fired power plants. We have to phase out coal over the next 20 years, not develop oil from shale and tar sands,"" he said. That's just for starters.\When asked for one thing an individual could do, he replied: ""Politically organize.""\McKibben's remarks were Champlain College's keynote to ""Focus the Nation,"" a week of activities on campuses across the country designed to take on the challenge of climate change.\The University of Vermont kicked off its program with a panel discussion of carbon trading -- an enterprise that some in the environmental movement see as an answer to the question of how to rein in greenhouse gas emissions.\Introducing the panel, forestry specialist William Keeton of UVM's Rubenstein School of Environment and Natural Resources cautioned the audience of about 60 that carbon trading ""is not a silver bullet"" in addressing climate change. That proved to be the understatement of the morning, as some panelists disputed that existing carbon-trading patterns have any climate-change-reducing effects at all.\The discussion covered carbon trading primarily in two forms: a regulated ""cap-and-trade"" system, a version of which has been implemented in industrialized Europe; and a voluntary, largely unregulated market, growing rapidly in the United States, in which carbon-dioxide emitters can buy offset credits in the form of investments in projects that absorb carbon dioxide (such as a new forest in Brazil) or that displace fossil fuels as an energy source (such as wind turbines in South Dakota).\The larger, global issue is how -- and how fast -- to reduce the human-produced emissions of greenhouse gases (principally carbon dioxide, a byproduct of burning fossil fuels such as oil and coal) that most scientists agree have a heat-trapping, or global warming effect when they continue building up in the atmosphere. One commonly cited goal is to reduce emissions 80 percent by 2050. The sense of urgency grows, and Keeton quoted NASA scientist Jim Hansen as putting the tipping point less than 10 years away.\The remedies won't come cheap, said Keeton's Rubinstein colleague, Cecilia Danks. Substantially cutting emissions will impose a substantial cost, she said, but that cost in the United States is unlikely to come via a carbon tax, which is widely seen as politically unfeasible.\An easier political sell would be a cap-and-trade system, which several panelists agreed is likely to be set up in the United States before long. Under such a system, major emitters -- power plants, for example, are assigned emission ceilings, or caps. If they want to exceed the caps, they have to buy credits to compensate. The caps, which would diminish gradually over years, would be determined in keeping with a national goal of emissions reductions.\Two panelists from the United Kingdom took sharp issue with both forms of carbon trading.\The problem with the cap-and-trade system in Europe, said Larry Lohmann of The Corner House, an environmental advocacy group, is that it hasn't worked. Major polluters have used their political clout to get their caps raised, he said, and they've been able to exceed their limits by buying offset credits of dubious environmental value. An example of the latter might be a hydroelectric project in India that inundates traditional, low-emitting farming communities and is then counted as an offset for pollution in an industrialized country.\An offset is just what it sounds like, Jutta Kill of the United Kingdom's SinkWatch reminded the audience: It's compensatory, but it does nothing to reduce overall emissions. More likely, she said, it can be used as an excuse for someone to produce even more emissions.\Much more effective, she said, would be to stop subsidizing fossil-fuel industries and shift that money to renewable and decentralized energy projects.\Another panelist, Secretary of Natural Resources George Crombie, suggested that the efficacy of a carbon-trading system ""is only as good as its design.""\One of the few upbeat thoughts came from UVM economist Josh Farley, toward the end. He pointed out that the country could cut its energy use and its emissions by a third and still leave people with the same living standard that Americans enjoyed in 1969, when the poverty rate was even lower than today.\Contact Tim Johnson at 660-1808 or tjohnson@bfp.burlingtonfreepress.com\BOX: Warming week events\The main events\A Web cast Wednesday night intended as a springboard to teach-ins to be held Thursday and Friday at campuses across the country.\The live, interactive Web cast, ""The 2 Percent Solution,"" takes place starting at 7:45 p.m. The sites of the Web cast include: Champlain College, Hauke Family Center; Johnson State College, Bentley 207; University of Vermont, Davis Center's Livak Ballroom.\Champlain College\TODAY: Voter registration drive and sustainability expo, 4-6:30 p.m. in Fireside Lounge of IDX Student Life Center.\Film ""Escape from Suburbia"" shown at 8:30 p.m., Alumni Auditorium.\THURSDAY: College goes car-free.

Saturday, February 9 WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal appeals court said Friday the Bush administration ignored the law when it imposed less stringent requirements on power plants to reduce mercury pollution, which scientists fear could cause neurological problems in 60,000 newborns a year.
\
A three-judge panel unanimously struck down a mercury-control plan imposed by the Environmental Protection Agency three years ago. It established an emissions trading process in which some plants could avoid installing the best mercury control technology available by buying pollution credits.
\
Environmentalist and health experts argued that such a cap-and-trading mechanism would create ""hot spots"" of mercury contamination near some power plants. Seventeen states as well as environmental and health groups joined in a suit to block the regulation, saying it did not adequately protect public health.
\
Power plants are the biggest source of releases of mercury, which finds its way into the food supply, particularly fish. Mercury can damage developing brains of fetuses and very young children.
\
The court decision was the latest in a string of judicial rebukes of the Bush administration's environmental policies. The Supreme Court last year took the administration to task for not regulating greenhouse gases. Courts have also rejected administration attempts to overhaul federal forest policies and streamline fuel economy standards for small trucks.
\
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said that the EPA violated the federal Clean Air Act when it scrapped a mercury-control policy established in December 2000 under the Clinton administration. Utilities were required to install the best available technology to capture mercury from power-plant smokestacks.
\
That policy was anticipated to capture more than 90 percent of mercury releases. The cap-and-trade approach imposed by the EPA in March 2005 envisioned capturing 70 percent of emissions by 2018.
\
The court held that the EPA failed to show that its new approach would not harm the environment or that emissions at all plants not ""exceed a level which is adequate to protect public health with an ample margin of safety.""
\
""This three-judge panel has done the world a favor and helped save lives,"" said Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, whose state participated in the lawsuit.
\
EPA spokesman Jonathan Shradar said the agency was reviewing the decision, but he indicated it was not giving up on the cap-and-trade approach to reducing mercury.
\
""This rule is still our policy until we evaluate how to move forward,"" said Shradar. He emphasized that the court did not rule directly on the merits of the cap-and-trade approach but that ""they ruled against the process.""
\
But it was clear the agency now would have to re-examine its approach to capturing mercury from power plants. ""Because of the court's action the U.S. now has no national regulation to cut mercury emissions from existing power plants,"" he said.
\
Environmentalists, hailing the decision as a victory for public health, predicted it will require the EPA to issue the more stringent emissions requirements that were proposed eight years ago.
\
""This means the EPA is going to have to go back and do a real job of regulating all the toxics coming out of these plants,"" said Earthjustice attorney James S. Pew, who argued the case on behalf of several environmental organizations. He said EPA ""is now under a simple, legal obligation to get those overdue rules out.""
\
Industry organizations had strongly supported the cap-and-trade mercury plan, arguing that the requirements for the best available technology at all plants would be too costly, may not even be achievable, and delay mercury reduction.
\
Dan Riedinger, a spokesman for the Edison Electric Institute, an association of power companies, called the court decision ""a major setback ... to establish clear mercury regulations for coal-burning power plants.""
\
""Now EPA has to go back to the drawing board, pushing mercury regulations far off into the future,"" said Riedinger .
\
Mercury is a powerful neurotoxin. About 8 percent of U.S. women of childbearing age have enough mercury in their blood to cause concern for a future pregnancy. The National Academy of Sciences estimates that 60,000 newborns a year could be at risk of learning disabilities because of mercury their mothers absorbed during pregnancy.
\
""The mercury emitted by our nation's coal-fired power plants pose serious health risks for all Americans,"" said Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association. The association was among a number of public health groups, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, that filed papers in support of the states' lawsuit.
\
Joining New Jersey in the lawsuit were: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Wisconsin.

New Hampshire's two Republican senators are facing pressure on Capitol Hill to help save a tri-partisan bill on climate change that could be killed today by a GOP filibuster.
\
U.S. Sens. John Sununu and Judd Gregg earlier this week both put out statements saying they supported debate on the so-called Warner-Lieberman-Boxer legislation, but stopped short of saying they would vote for the final bill.
\
The major piece of global-warming legislation in Congress this year, the bill would cut emissions of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels and other greenhouse gases by about 70 percent over the next four decades. The bill targets power plants, refineries, factories and transportation.
\
President Bush earlier this week said the measure would ""impose roughly $6 trillion in new costs on the American economy,"" but supporters say the shift away from fossil fuels can be made without significant economic damage. Not addressing global warming, they argue, would lead to greater economic harm later this century.
\
Jim Rubens, a former Republican state senator from Etna who now serves as a consultant for the Union of Concerned Scientists, which supports the bill, said Gregg and Sununu are the key ""swing votes"" in an effort to get 60 votes to invoke cloture today and end a Republican filibuster.
\
Early predictions are that Democrats won't muster the votes to advance the bill, which is co-sponsored by Republican Sen. John Warner of Virginia and Independent Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut. Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., the chairwoman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, also has her name attached to the legislation.
\
""We would hope they would follow through with their promise to allow debate by supporting cloture,"" Rubens said of Gregg and Sununu. ""They haven't committed to the bill, but they have said this is a big issue worthy of debate.""
\
The offices of Gregg and Sununu did not reply yesterday to requests about how the senators stood on the filibuster.
\
But Rubens said that while the bill might understandably be opposed by coal-state senators, New Hampshire and the country as a whole stands to gain by its passage.
\
""If we don't do anything, if we continue with business as unusual, the cost of inaction is most conservatively estimated as 5 percent of gross domestic product by the end of the century,"" due to such effects as rising sea levels, loss of sugar maples, heat waves that damage crops and warming that threatens the ski industry in New England, Rubens said.
\
The Granite State, on the other hand, with its forests that could provide biomass and ridges that offer the potential for wind energy, stands to benefit from the bill, Rubens said. ""Simply by tilting the U.S. economy away from fossil-fuel dependency and toward energy we can produce here in the U.S.A., that advantages New Hampshire,"" Rubens said.
\
Sununu is in the midst of one of the country's most closely watched re-election battles, and his Democratic opponent, former Gov. Jeanne Shaheen, generally backs the initiative.
\
""She supports many of the aims of the Warner-Lieberman bill,"" Shaheen spokeswoman Kate Bedingfield said in a statement. ""She supports the goal of cutting carbon emissions by 80 percent by 2050, and in the U.S. Senate will push for a comprehensive plan to achieve that goal that includes economy-wide emissions reductions, aggressive research and development for new energy technologies, work with international partners to achieve global emissions reductions, and incentives for energy efficiency and clean alternative energy sources.""
\
No one is sure how much the reductions in greenhouse emissions would cost the U.S. economy. Computer model-based studies have provided a wide range, from a modest rollback in annual economic growth to an annual economic loss of as much as $4.6 trillion by 2030. The range is based on different assumptions as to the success of shifting away from fossil fuels toward alternatives and increased energy efficiency and conservation.
\
The Senate bill assumes getting $6.7 trillion over the next four decades from the sale and trading of carbon emissions allowances in order to meet the imposed emissions caps. Under the bill, the money would be used to help industries comply with the carbon reductions and to help consumers pay for higher energy costs.
\
Both of Vermont's senators, Democrat Patrick Leahy and Independent Bernie Sanders, support passage. ""The legislation is not a perfect solution, but its goals are positive and its solutions are constructive,"" Leahy said in a statement yesterday.
\
Sanders said the bill is an important start, but needs to be improved with amendments.
\
""There is huge potential. We must go forward for the sake of our kids and our grandchildren,"" he said on the Senate floor.
\
Rubens, noting that both presidential candidates, Republican John McCain and Democrat Barack Obama, have voiced support for cap-and-trade programs to fight global warming, said the measure will surely be back before Congress next year if it is killed today.
\
""We're not going to be debating global warming. We're not going to be debating cap-and-trade systems. We're going to be debating how to make it work,"" Rubens said. ""Our two senators ought to be part of this debate.""

"
21,"The Bush administration's proposal to rely on long-term market forces to clean up mercury pollution sends a cynical message that industry rules, and public health and environment be damned.\This week, the Environmental Protection Agency announced it was leaning toward a cap and trade strategy that would delay mercury cleanup and allow Midwestern power plants to buy their way out of reducing emissions.\This approach, endorsed by industry, would reverse a strict emission-reduction plan introduced by the Clinton administration that had significant benefits for downwind states such as Vermont. That plan aimed to reduce mercury and other toxins from 1,100 coal-burning power plants to 5.5 tons a year from 48 tons by 2008 by using the best available technology.\The Bush administration, based on the findings of a study by the Department of Energy and the utility industry, says the technology doesn't exist to meet the demanding schedule.\It was possible under Clinton, but it is impossible under Bush.\To the average person living in the Northeast, where mercury deposits from the Midwestern power plants are a serious health and environmental threat, there is a credibility problem with the Bush administration. It has been steadily trying to gut clean-air rules, and this is the latest angle.\In December, the Bush administration decided that mercury emissions should be removed from the most stringent regulations of the Clean Air Act that govern such toxins as lead and asbestos. Those regulations require maximum pollution controls.\This downgrading of mercury's toxicity set the stage for the more relaxed cap and trade proposal that would fix a nationwide cap by phasing in lower ceilings on each plant's pollution. Plants that reduced their pollution to a certain ceiling could sell credits to plants that don't. The Midwestern power plants generate 40 percent of the nation's mercury emissions.\Mercury is a neurotoxin that can cause brain damage in children, fetal birth defects and other illnesses.\Vermont has been doing its part to reduce the pollution that blows in from the Midwest. Sens. Patrick Leahy and James Jeffords have legislation before Congress to curb mercury and power plant emissions.\Vermont and 13 other states won a lawsuit in December against the Bush administration that tried to ease ""new source review"" standards that require utilities and other smokestack plants to install modern anti-pollution equipment whenever they upgrade.\Vermont must continue to fight for clean air.\Send comments to EPA Administrator Michael Leavitt at this address: Environmental Protection Agency, Ariel Rios Building, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave. N.W., Washington, D.C. 20460."

Will states take the easy way?
\
The Environmental Protection Agency will soon demand that states cut their greenhouse-gas emissions. You would think that state leaders, particularly Republicans warning of an EPA regulatory apocalypse, would be frantically reaching for the least onerous strategies to comply. But so far many have shown more interest in lambasting the EPA than in accepting the sorts of policies that would make new carbon regulations easiest on people.
\
The way states comply with the EPA matters. The agency figures that if states banded together into regional greenhouse-gas-cutting pacts, the total cost of the Obama administration's clean-power rule would drop by 17 percent. Even absent a push from the EPA, states should adopt regional, market-based carbon policy because it's the cheapest way to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, a goal all states should share. With the EPA's impending carbon mandate, it's an even easier policy choice. But with a few exceptions, it's one that states still aren't making.
\
California is one of the exceptions. Gov. Jerry Brown, Democrat, touted his state's carbon dioxide program at a Friday meeting with Washington Post writers and editors, drawing particular attention to its cap-and-trade program. Cap-and-trade has endured a lot of right-wing abuse over the past several years, but a well-designed program is, in fact, a market-based approach and among the most efficient ways to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Indeed, several Western states moved to cooperate with California to create a multi-state cap-and-trade agreement. But California was the only state that followed through.
\
One would expect Western governors to beat down Brown's door, revive the regional cap-and-trade plan and ask the EPA to give them credit for the resulting carbon dioxide cuts. But, astonishingly, Brown said that not a single governor has asked him about this.
\
Around the same time California created its carbon market, a group of Northeastern states established their own cap-and-trade scheme, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont are members. Eastern states can join RGGI and take that to the EPA. Some Republicans have acknowledged the idea's merit. Virginia's Ronald Villanueva tried to persuade his fellow GOP legislators to join RGGI this year. They didn't take his advice.
\
The positive view is that state leaders still have time before the EPA's rules phase in, and more will accept the smart approach as the EPA clarifies its requirements and as deadlines approach.
\
The negative view is that, whether out of ideology or poor judgment, state officials will continue their negligent approach to carbon dioxide emissions. States such as Texas have made a virtue of defying the EPA in the past. But states will have to comply, the easy way or the hard way. Which to choose should already be a matter of bipartisan consensus in every statehouse.

\
Steven Chu, the Nobel Prize-winning physicist who is President Obama's energy secretary, recently gave a speech in which two key words never passed his lips. He talked about energy efficiency, electricity transmission lines and renewable energy sources. He waxed eloquent about technology and the need to fund energy research. But afterward, Chevron vice chairman Peter Robertson noted disconsolately that ""it would be nice to hear a bit about oil and gas.""
\
Oil and natural gas, however, are not what's lighting up the Obama energy agenda. The new president is setting out to change the very nature of American energy, from the way we use it to the way we generate it. It's a goal that drives his policy on automakers, whom he wants to push to manufacture more fuel-efficient cars. And it's why he inserted a ""down payment"" of mammoth proportions into the stimulus bill, roughly $70 billion or more in grants, loans and loan guarantees for Chu to hand out for high-tech research and commercial projects for renewable energy such as biofuels and wind, solar and geothermal power. That's nearly three times as much as the baseline Energy Department budget and more than the annual budgets of the Labor and Interior departments combined.
\
Obama has decided to do it all. Need help weatherizing your home? He'll pay for that. Smart meters? He'll help pay for them, too. Industry wants to determine whether you can economically capture and store carbon emissions at coal plants? Obama has set aside a few billion federal dollars for that as well.
\
This isn't the first time a president has set an ambitious energy policy agenda. Almost every chief executive since Nixon has vowed to promote oil independence. Jimmy Carter went furthest in the late 1970s, declaring the ""moral equivalent of war"" on energy use. Then Ronald Reagan became president, eliminated tax breaks for solar power and removed the solar panels Carter had installed on the White House roof. The war was declared over before it had really begun.
\
Now the battle has resumed, but this time it's not only about U.S. independence from oil imports; it's also about slowing climate change that most scientists say threatens to inflict catastrophic damage on the environment and the economy over the next four decades. Thus the administration's coming attractions feature an energy bill with nationwide renewable energy standards for electric utilities and a far-reaching cap-and-trade program that would limit greenhouse gas emissions, raise the price of everything from gasoline to plastics to electricity and generate more than $100 billion a year in revenue.
\
""The clean energy revolution is here now,"" declares Greg Wetstone, senior director for government and public affairs at the American Wind Energy Association.
\
To carry out this revolution, Obama has appointed a climatologist's dream team of scientists, regulators and political operatives to energy and environment positions. Chu gave up his research to devote himself to seeking technologies that could slow climate change. Environmental Protection Agency head Lisa Jackson is determined to set greenhouse gas regulations. Lisa Heinzerling, principal author of the brief in a key lawsuit against the Bush EPA, is now working as the agency's senior climate policy counsel. And Carol Browner, who served for eight years as head of Bill Clinton's EPA, is back as White House energy and climate czar.
\
It's not hard to see an energy program emerging that Obama -- part activist, part centrist -- might embrace. It offers something for everyone, not just solar, wind and biofuel industries. Bush and Congress bequeathed Obama enough loan guarantees to spur the construction of at least three new nuclear plants. With the offshore-drilling moratorium gone, Obama could open up some promising prospects. New high-voltage transmission lines for renewable energy sources could be to energy what Dwight Eisenhower's interstate highway system was to transportation. And if energy efficiency (combined with a recession-induced slump in electricity consumption) proves effective, new coal plants could be postponed indefinitely while Obama pours money into carbon-capture technology to clean up their emissions.
\
But change environmentalists can believe in won't come about just because of change in the Oval Office. In Congress, Rep. Henry Waxman, the new chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, has an ambitious timetable for a climate bill. Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Chairman Barbara Boxer, who wrested the lead on climate policy away from rival committees, isn't far behind.
\
More important, two seminal documents changed the balance of power on climate policy before Obama won a single primary. One was the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's fourth and most frightening report, issued in November 2007, offering new evidence that climate change is real and that human behavior is making it worse.
\
The second was the Supreme Court ruling on April 2, 2007, that carbon dioxide, a common greenhouse gas produced by burning fossil fuels, qualifies as a pollutant under the Clean Air Act. That gave the EPA the authority and responsibility to regulate carbon dioxide without waiting for Congress to issue guidelines. Just recently, in fact, the Obama EPA declared that global warming endangers public health, bringing it a step closer to regulation.
\
The Supreme Court's decision gives the administration tremendous leverage in negotiations over a cap-and-trade bill, offering Obama a sturdy backup if he fails to extract concessions from industry, utilities and recalcitrant members of Congress. ""People will have to recognize that there is a sword of Damocles out there mandated by the Supreme Court,"" says Rep. Jay Inslee, a Washington Democrat who's a leading proponent of cap-and-trade legislation.
\
At the boisterous celebrity-studded ""Green Ball"" on the eve of Obama's inauguration, expectations about his energy and climate agenda were already rife. As the tuxedo-clad Carl Pope, executive director of the Sierra Club, said, ""The president has set the bar extraordinarily high.""
\
But is it high enough? America's energy industry is immense, and so is the job of changing its profile. The conventional energy industry is not only politically powerful, it is enormous and hard to replace. The United States has about 500 coal plants that supply half the country's electricity, thousands of miles of low-voltage electricity lines, more than 100 million dumb meters and 240 million cars that run on diesel or gasoline with mediocre efficiency. As large as the energy portion of the stimulus package may be, it amounts to what the world's top three oil companies spend every year. The U.S. energy business overall represents $1.6 trillion a year.
\
Obama's goal of doubling renewable energy would give solar, wind and geothermal power only a 2 percent share of the nation's energy production. Even deep cuts in energy use would leave the country, and the planet, far short of what it would take to slow climate change sharply. The Energy Department's own Energy Information Administration predicts that even rapid growth in renewable energy sources and high oil prices will leave fossil fuels still providing 79 percent of the nation's energy needs by 2030.
\
While Obama sells his energy and climate plans as part of a push for U.S. oil independence, he has ruled out any increase in the gasoline tax, the most effective way of cutting oil use: More than half the oil used in the United States goes into the fuel tanks of cars and trucks. A gasoline tax would also be likely to boost consumer appetites for the more fuel-efficient cars Obama wants car companies to make. Blurring the rhetoric about renewable energy and oil independence obscures the fact that without mass-market electric cars -- still a remote prospect -- wind and solar may cut coal use and carbon emissions, but they won't save a drop of oil.
\
Yet the stars have never aligned in favor of a change in U.S. energy and climate policy the way they're aligned in Washington today.
\
Thirty-two years ago, Jimmy Carter called on people to ""put up with inconveniences and to make sacrifices"" to slash oil consumption and safeguard American power. With Obama comes a new vocabulary, promising ""green jobs"" and ""a revolution in energy efficiency"" that will ""save consumers money"" and ""spur innovation.""
\
Time will tell. It took more than a century to construct the electricity and oil industries we have today. It will take more than a presidential term to remake them.

\
We humans are faced with a staggering array of problems, not least the specter of global warming with its concomitant tragedies, both social and environmental.
\
Fossil-fuel emissions into the atmosphere of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases continue to escalate in the United States, China, and elsewhere above the safe (sustainable) level into the so-called atmospheric sink that we began to exceed in the 1960s.
\
As a result, glaciers are melting, the sea level is rising, floods, droughts and other adverse weather events are increasing and global biodiversity is suffering, as is so sadly demonstrated by the associated species extinctions. The outlook for both humans and nature remains bleak with the continued failure of governments to reach workable agreements.
\
And nowhere is the failure more conspicuous than in the general avoidance of the subject of population growth. Population is a double-barreled environmental problem, for not only is population increasing, so are the emissions per capita.
\
In 1970, when worldwide greenhouse gas emissions had just begun to transgress the sustainable sink capacity of the atmosphere, world population stood at about 3.7 billion; today it has risen to about 6.9 billion, an increase of 86 percent.
\
During that same period, worldwide emissions from fossil fuels rose from about 14 billion tons during 1970 to an estimated 29 billion tons during 2010, an increase of 107 percent.
\
From the above figures it can be seen that in 1970, emissions were about 3.8 tons per capita; today, despite the ever-growing awareness of looming climate-related disasters, such emissions have actually risen to about 4.2 tons per capita.
\
The still modest but growing fraction of energy produced by low to nearly emission-neutral means (solar, hydro, nuclear, wind, etc.) seems merely to be slowing down the rapidly growing dependence on fossil fuels in response to ever increasing energy demand.
\
Even in Vermont, one of the most efficiency-conscious and otherwise greenest of jurisdictions in the United States, emissions continue to rise in step with its population.
\
But inexplicably and inexcusably, recommendations by the United States, the United Nations and its affiliated agencies, and independent research and policy organizations essentially never include -- and certainly never stress -- population size as a contribution to global warming.
\
No rapid solution to the population problem is in sight. While those who can should speak up, we must continue, at the same time, to promote emission control measures ever more vigorously so as to return to the atmospheric sink capacity.
\
However, it is difficult for any government to impose major changes without the approval of the most vocal and powerful elements of its citizenry.
\
For this reason, nothing is more important than persistent education and publicity. And in the matter of global warming, no idea to be promulgated is more critical than the notion of a global commons. As with the high seas, the atmosphere must come to be regarded as a global commons, that is to say, as a common heritage of responsible humankind.
\
A principle of fairness follows from the idea of a global commons. Thus the time has come to apportion an overall safely sustainable level of emissions into the atmosphere to all the countries of the world in an equitable fashion.
\
Such apportioning cannot be based on amounts currently being discharged by various industrialized or rapidly industrializing countries. Neither can it be based on population, for this would reward over-populated countries (those populated beyond their human carrying capacity) and even encourage further growth.
\
Among the more environmentally friendly approaches to achieving the needed reductions in energy production are partial abstinence and frugality, greater use of energy-efficient devices, carbon capture and sequestration, emission-neutral means of generation, rain-forest protection, a levy on emissions (a ""carbon tax"") and the lease or purchase of emission rights by over-emitters from under-emitters (""cap-and-trade"" arrangements).
\
If appropriate international agreements could be forged (clearly no easy feat), cap-and-trade schemes would be in principle an excellent approach as long as (a) the worldwide level of emissions being sought is a safe and sustainable one, (b) a country's contribution to a safe level is equitably determined, and (c) inefficiency and corruption in its administration, monitoring and international verification are eliminated (or, to be realistic, kept to an acceptable limit).
\
An environmentally and socially equitable approach to cap and trade would be to base the discharge allocations on the country's area, that fraction of the atmosphere that its own land mass supports.
\
In such a scheme, many rich countries would currently be discharging more than their fair allotment, most of the poor countries probably less so.
\
The under-discharging countries would then be able to lease (not sell) some portion of their discharge rights until such time that they are able, with the help of this income, to develop their own necessary discharging infrastructure.
\
The leasing countries, for their part, would have time to institute changes to stay within their fair allotment, which might well include retrenchment of individual energy consumption or, barring that, even reduced population numbers, difficult as that might be.
\
In the end, we must all recognize that we have an obligation to share this earth -- the global biosphere -- with the other living things, an obligation that requires a reduction, by one means or another, in our population-driven demands on its natural resources and sink capacities.
\
To bring about this recognition is the task of civic education in the broad sense, a sustained effort to create public opinion powerful enough to give governments the incentive and ability to act.

Saturday, February 9 WASHINGTON -- A federal appeals court said Friday the Bush administration ignored the law when it imposed less stringent requirements on power plants to reduce mercury pollution, which scientists fear could cause neurological problems in 60,000 newborns a year.
\
A three-judge panel unanimously struck down a mercury-control plan imposed by the Environmental Protection Agency three years ago. It established an emissions trading process in which some plants could avoid installing the best mercury control technology available by buying pollution credits.
\
Environmentalist and health experts argued that such a cap-and-trading mechanism would create ""hot spots"" of mercury contamination near some power plants. Seventeen states, including Vermont, as well as environmental and health groups joined in a suit to block the regulation, saying it did not adequately protect public health.
\
""This ruling is a big win for healthier air and water for everyone, and especially for a whole generation of the most vulnerable Americans, our children,"" said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont. ""Mercury is so toxic that even small amounts cause birth defects, IQ loss and mental retardation. The American people should not have to wait another decade for a real solution.""
\
Leahy has long been the Senate's leader on mercury pollution control policy.
\
Power plants are the biggest source of releases of mercury, which finds its way into the food supply, particularly fish. Mercury can damage developing brains of fetuses and very young children.
\
""When the question is allowing old power plants to keep on polluting, there is only one right answer, and the Bush Administration got it wrong,"" Leahy said. ""Their mercury rule was of, by and for the powerful special interests who want to continue polluting.""
\
""This ruling turns the page on one of the darkest decisions in EPA's history.""
\
The court decision was the latest in a string of judicial rebukes of the Bush administration's environmental policies. The Supreme Court last year took the administration to task for not regulating greenhouse gases. Courts have also rejected administration attempts to overhaul federal forest policies and streamline fuel economy standards for small trucks.
\
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said that the EPA violated the federal Clean Air Act when it scrapped a mercury-control policy established in December 2000 under the Clinton administration. Utilities were required to install the best available technology to capture mercury from power-plant smokestacks.
\
That policy was anticipated to capture more than 90 percent of mercury releases. The cap-and-trade approach imposed by the EPA in March 2005 envisioned capturing 70 percent of emissions by 2018.
\
The court held that the EPA failed to show that its new approach would not harm the environment or that emissions at all plants not ""exceed a level which is adequate to protect public health with an ample margin of safety.""
\
""This three-judge panel has done the world a favor and helped save lives,"" said Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, whose state participated in the lawsuit.
\
EPA spokesman Jonathan Shradar said the agency was reviewing the decision, but he indicated it was not giving up on the cap-and-trade approach to reducing mercury.
\
""This rule is still our policy until we evaluate how to move forward,"" said Shradar. He emphasized that the court did not rule directly on the merits of the cap-and-trade approach but that ""they ruled against the process.""
\
But it was clear the agency now would have to re-examine its approach to capturing mercury from power plants. ""Because of the court's action the U.S. now has no national regulation to cut mercury emissions from existing power plants,"" he said.
\
Environmentalists, hailing the decision as a victory for public health, predicted it will require the EPA to issue the more stringent emissions requirements that were proposed eight years ago.
\
""This means the EPA is going to have to go back and do a real job of regulating all the toxics coming out of these plants,"" said Earthjustice attorney James S. Pew, who argued the case on behalf of several environmental organizations. He said EPA ""is now under a simple, legal obligation to get those overdue rules out.""
\
Industry organizations had strongly supported the cap-and-trade mercury plan, arguing that the requirements for the best available technology at all plants would be too costly, may not even be achievable, and delay mercury reduction.
\
Dan Riedinger, a spokesman for the Edison Electric Institute, an association of power companies, called the court decision ""a major setback ... to establish clear mercury regulations for coal-burning power plants.""
\
""Now EPA has to go back to the drawing board, pushing mercury regulations far off into the future,"" said Riedinger .
\
Mercury is a powerful neurotoxin. About 8 percent of U.S. women of childbearing age have enough mercury in their blood to cause concern for a future pregnancy. The National Academy of Sciences estimates that 60,000 newborns a year could be at risk of learning disabilities because of mercury their mothers absorbed during pregnancy.
\
""The mercury emitted by our nation's coal-fired power plants pose serious health risks for all Americans,"" said Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association. The association was among a number of public health groups, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, that filed papers in support of the states' lawsuit.
\
Joining Vermont in the lawsuit were: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Wisconsin.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senators trying to craft bipartisan climate legislation offered a revised proposal Thursday that would add incentives for building nuclear power plants and open the way for expanded oil and gas drilling off the nation's coastlines in hopes of attracting wider support.
\
The new framework for a Senate climate bill would ease back requirements for early reductions of greenhouse gases. It calls for cuts in the range of 17 percent by 2020, instead of 20 percent, similar to reductions already approved by the House and what Obama will call for at an international climate conference in Copenhagen.
\
""We would like to underscore the fact that the framework we are releasing today is a starting point for our negotiations going forward,"" said Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass.
\
The framework provided only a broad view of what a compromise bill would include with details to emerge early next year. But it reflects a widespread view that the climate bill that advanced out of committee in early November would need to be significantly revised for any hope of getting bipartisan support from at least 60 senators.
\
White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said in a statement that the framework released ""is a positive development toward reaching a strong, unified and bipartisan agreement in the U.S. Senate.""
\
Gibbs said the passage of comprehensive energy legislation was essential to the president's other efforts to build a new energy foundation.
\
The blueprint's release also was timed to give American delegates at the Copenhagen climate talks, now under way, additional ammunition in their argument that the U.S. is taking climate change seriously and that Congress is making progress -- although at a glacial pace -- on reducing heat-trapping greenhouse pollution.
\
Kerry has for weeks been working with Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., on broadening the Senate bill in hopes of gaining more Republican support. No Republican senator has endorsed the legislation Democrats pushed out of the Environment and Public Works Committee, although Graham supports the need to address climate change and mandatory reductions in greenhouse gases.
\
The revised proposal will ""a send a strong message to the world gathering at Copenhagen. That message is the United States is committed to addressing this challenge,"" said Kerry at a news conference, joined by the two other senators.
\
But the three acknowledged they are nowhere near getting the votes needed to overcome a certain GOP filibuster threat on any climate legislation. ""We don't have 60 votes,"" said Lieberman.
\
Graham said the commitment to expand nuclear energy and open new opportunities for new oil and gas drilling both on shore and on the Outer Continental Shelf is hoped to attract additional support from Republican senators.
\
The senators said the bill would include tax credits and a substantial increase in government loan guarantees for building nuclear reactors as well as some streamlining of the reactor permitting process. Currently loan guarantees for new reactors -- which can cost $9 billion or more each -- are limited to a total of $18.5 billion, and even those have yet to be awarded by the Energy Department.
\
The legislation also would open the way for offshore oil and gas drilling with the proceeds shared between the federal government and nearby states. Where to drill and how much revenue will be shared with states will depend on negotiations on the bill, said Graham.
\
The outline embraces the so-called cap and trade approach in the existing Senate climate bill in which the government would limit greenhouse gas emissions from power plants and other industrial facilities, but allow the trading of emission allowances to ease the cost of compliance. Opponents widely have likened cap and trade to an energy tax, saying it will boost energy prices for consumers, prompting Senate sponsors of the bill to avoid the phrase whenever possible.
\
""Remember there was once the artist previously known as Prince,"" Lieberman quipped. ""This is the market based system for punishing polluters perviously known as cap and trade.""

28,"One-third of the nation's lakes and nearly one-quarter of its rivers are contaminated with enough mercury and other pollutants that they could cause health problems in fish-eating pregnant women and children.\If that news from the Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday isn't enough to ruin your day by the lake, then consider what the EPA and the Bush administration have been proposing for the future.\Under Bush's scheme to allow polluting Midwest power plants to buy and sell mercury emission rights, and thereby reduce their fi- nancial hardship, Vermont and other downwind states would continue to be a receptacle for mercury.\In Vermont, where 12 fish consumption advisories were issued last year, mercury, a potent neurotoxin that can irreversibly affect brain development, has become a real concern for women of child-bearing age and children. Even consuming small amounts of this persistent toxin from contaminated fish can hinder fetal development and damage the brains of young children.\While the technology exists to reduce pollution from coal-fired power plants and save lives as Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., argues Bush has been working to weaken clean air laws and save the power industry a fortune on anti-pollution equipment.\Jeffords, a senior member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, has proposed legislation that would cut mercury emissions from power plants by 90 percent by 2008 while Bush's plan would reduce emissions by 29 percent by 2010 and 70 percent by 2018. Jeffords' work was backed up by a Massachusetts research group, Abt Associates, which reported in the spring that the Vermont senator's plan would save more lives and money than the Bush proposal.\Under Bush's cap-and-trade strategy, which the EPA has been touting and Vermont and 10 other states have been fighting, plants could purchase pollution rights rather than cut emissions. While the strategy of setting a cap on total emissions and trading among utilities has been effective with some pollutants, critics say it wouldn't work with mercury because it would result in highly polluted hot spots.\Jeffords' proposal, which echoes the drastic mercury reductions proposed by the former Clinton administration, should be taken seriously because mercury pollution won't go away on its own. Like lead, dioxin and other toxins poisoning the environment, mercury is harmful to human and animal health in small amounts. It also builds up in tissue and the environment over time.\The primary sources of mercury pollution are coal-burning power plants hundreds of miles away in the Midwest. However, while government regulation in the 1990s reduced emissions from medical and municipal waste incineration, there continue to be New England-based sources. These, Vermonters can control.\Car-crushing, for instance, releases mercury into the environment through the shattered light switches. Fluorescent lights and thermometers are also problem sources and should be disposed of properly through communities' solid waste districts. Dental offices deal with high concentrations of mercury from tooth amalgam and Vermont's Department of Environmental Conservation has been working on a pilot project to remove the waste so it doesn't end up in the environment.\Vermont takes the problem of mercury seriously.

\
Vermont is poised to take the world stage on Sept. 25 when the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) holds the first-in-the-nation, mandatory carbon cap-and-trade program for power plants.
\
This collaborative, pioneering effort by Vermont and nine Northeastern and Middle Atlantic states aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, generate thousands of new green jobs and help move America into a new, clean energy future.
\
I was the first governor to sign onto the agreement and my administration has been deeply involved in developing RGGI to help address the issue of global warming. Vermont's work also helped to create a framework on which a future federal-state partnership could be modeled.
\
The auction on Sept. 25 will be watched by policy makers and opinion-leaders around the world, including those involved with the Western Climate Initiative (a similar effort by several Western states and Canadian provinces), the Midwest Climate Initiative and the European Emissions Trading Scheme.
\
The need to address climate change is real and the opportunity to leverage new technology and energy efficiency to reduce greenhouse gas emissions -- and grow our economy -- has never been greater.
\
The RGGI program will generate new capital to invest in green jobs and inspire innovation for long-term economic growth in Vermont and other RGGI states.
\
In the absence of federal action, states are continuing to move ahead to address this environmental challenge. However, I believe -- as do the other RGGI governors -- that a strong federal program is also needed to address climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
\
Six out of seven of the cap-and-trade proposals introduced in the 110th Congress called for auctioning of allowances, including an amendment that contained provisions for RGGI to transition into a national program.
\
RGGI's goals are realistic and achievable and will have tangible benefits for Vermont and our partner states. It will reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the power plant sector by 10 percent by 2018. (Although Vermont has the most climate-friendly energy portfolio in the country, RGGI power sector CO2 emissions account for more than 28 percent of CO2 emissions in the 10-state RGGI region.)
\
It's a first step -- and RGGI is ready to expand its sources under the cap-and-trade program if there continues to be no action at the federal level.
\
The quarterly CO2 auctions will raise funds for expanding energy efficiency, renewable energy and clean energy technology. By boosting clean tech innovation, Vermont will make a direct investment into our state economy and increase good-paying, green jobs -- all the while reducing carbon emissions.
\
Vermont will auction more than 200,000 of the available 1.2 million CO2 allowances to qualified bidders, raising funds that Vermont can invest in energy efficiency, renewable energy technologies and other programs to help Vermonters combat steep energy costs.
\
At a minimum, Vermont stands to raise more than $400,000 in this month's auction -- but the tally will likely be much higher. As of Sept. 4, prompt prices for Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative carbon futures on the Chicago Climate Futures Exchange were about $4.48 a ton.
\
That translates into a minimum of $2 million for Vermont in each of the next several years for continued expansion of the green economy, beginning with weatherization services, green building practices and installation of renewable energy systems.
\
In other words, we will create jobs and help Vermonters save money on their energy costs.
\
I am proud that Vermont was the first RGGI state. In Vermont, where our economic livelihood is so closely tied to the environment, we must safeguard our quality of life for future economic and environmental prosperity.
\
That's why Vermont is the greenest state in the nation and why Vermont leads the way on so many environmental fronts. The inaugural RGGI auction is no different.

Saturday, September 29 WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Bush's call on Friday for a new fund to reduce global warming fell flat with Europeans and environmentalists who say U.N.-mandated cuts in greenhouse gases are what's needed.
\
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson is to lead discussions with other nations on starting the ""international clean technology fund"" with contributions worldwide to help to help pay for clean-energy projects in developing countries.
\
'Still far apart'
\
""This here was a great step for the Americans and a small step for mankind,"" German Environment Minister Sigmar Gabriel said after Bush's speech at the State Department before representatives of the nations that are the world's biggest emitters of greenhouse gases. ""In substance, we are still far apart.""
\
In his speech, Bush acknowledged that climate change is real and that human activity is a factor.
\
""By setting this goal, we acknowledge there is a problem, and by setting this goal, we commit ourselves to doing something about it,"" Bush said. ""We share a common responsibility: to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while keeping our economies growing.""
\
The president's speech capped two days of talks at a White House-sponsored climate conference that brought together the U.S. and developing nations such as China, India and Brazil that are not required to make cuts under the Kyoto Protocol, the U.N. treaty for reducing greenhouse gases that expires in 2012.
\
The conference also included representatives of other major industrial nations such as Russia, Japan, Britain, France and Germany that have signed onto the Kyoto treaty that Bush rejected, because he said it would harm the U.S. economy and did not require cuts of countries like China and India. Other participants came from Australia, Canada, Indonesia, Italy, Mexico, South Africa and South Korea. Iran, another of the biggest emitters, notably was excluded.
\
Bush said his purpose was to begin setting a new worldwide goal for cutting carbon dioxide emissions after 2012 and to help developing nations pay for the changes that would be needed. The president said the reduction goal should be finalized by next summer, along with ways to measure progress toward it.
\
He said each nation should establish for itself what methods it will use to rein in the pollution problem without stunting economic growth.
\
But he refuses to sign onto mandatory emission-reduction obligations, preferring to encourage the development of new technologies and other voluntary measures, and won't participate in any talks toward a global agreement that do not include energy guzzlers from the developing world. Bush made clear, however, that he saw his talks as complementary to the U.N. negotiations over what will succeed the Kyoto treaty after 2012. U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon held a summit Monday to grease the wheels for an agreement.
\
Bush has seemed more sensitive lately to perceptions in other parts of the world that the U.S. government either does not take the phenomenon of global warming seriously -- or seriously enough.
\
It may be too little, too late.
\
John Ashton, a special representative on climate change for the British foreign secretary, said: ""One of the striking features of this meeting is how isolated this administration has become. There is absolutely no suppport that I can see in the international comunity that we can drive this effort on the basis of voluntary efforts.""
\
The ball is now in Congress' court, said Fred Krupp, president of Environmental Defense, who was one of the few outsiders to address the panel of government ministers at the meeting.
\
""Congress needs to lead. The president is not giving us the leadership we need. Ultimately what we need are mandatory caps,"" Krupp said. ""No air pollution problem in the world has ever been solved without having legal limits.""
\
Democrats Barbara Boxer of California and Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, who both chair committees in the Senate, said they would provide that leadership and work toward legislation with mandatory carbon controls and a cap-and-trade system.
\
Boxer called Bush's speech an improvement on what he has said about climate change in the past ""but unless it is followed up with mandatory cuts in global warming pollution, it will amount to little more than empty words.""
\
At the same time, the fact that the United States was taking a role in the process, and a leading one, was heartening to some.
\
Until recently, said Emil Salim, an economist and member of the Indonesian president's council of advisers, Bush offered ""no dialogue on the Kyoto Protocol whatsoever. This time, the members of the Kyoto Protocol are invited to discuss. So from that point of view, there is some improvement,"" he said in an interview. ""But on the other hand, I think it has more to do with the domestic politics, because you have election.""

Monday, June 8 Dozens of indicators tell whether or not our environment is healthy.
\
For many people the signs are very personal and local, such as being able to walk in the woods and enjoy the songbirds (which are actually declining in numbers).
\
For others the indicators are more scientific and global -- climate change and rising levels of greenhouse gas emissions.
\
In the last couple of years, three widely different studies have reported that at both the local and global levels -- and everything in between -- the Vermont environment is not being protected and, in fact, continues to gradually deteriorate.
\
In ""Understanding Vermont,"" published in 2007 by the Vermont Community Foundation, 10 of 11 environmental indicators were pointing in the wrong direction.
\
In ""Disappearing Vermont,"" published by Vermonters for a Sustainable Population in March 2008, 23 of 31 indicators were negative.
\
In ""Vermont in Transition,"" published in December 2008 by the Council on the Future of Vermont, 12 of 21 indicators were deteriorating.
\
Arguably the most significant indicator is the amount of land developed, because it also affects other indicators -- the loss of farm and forest land, additional greenhouse gas emissions due to heating and the number of vehicle miles traveled, habitat destruction, and storm water runoff.
\
Just between the years 1982 and 2003, the years for which data are available, more than 100,000 acres of land were developed in Vermont.
\
As noted environmental writer Gus Speth, the outgoing head of the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, says in his most recent book, ""The Bridge at the End of the World: Capitalism, the Environment, and Crossing from Crisis to Sustainability,"" that ""all in all, today's environmentalism has not been succeeding. We have been winning battles, including some critical ones, but losing the war.""
\
Time magazine called Speth the ""ultimate insider"" because he has served on several environmental boards.
\
There are several reasons the environmental movement has been losing the war. The most important is that environmentalists have been focusing on the symptoms of our environmental problems instead of the causes.
\
As just one example, to solve the problem of land development, environmentalists focus on establishing and strengthening laws and regulations restricting development, which is only a partial solution. However, the underlying cause of land development is our cultural insistence on an ever-growing economy which includes increasing population growth and consumption of natural resources.
\
With the U.S. population growing by more than three million people per year, any improvements in treating the symptoms -- such as tougher regulations, cap and trade, improved conservation and efficiency and alternative energy development -- are going to be cancelled out by the sheer increase in the numbers of people. President Obama's 30 percent increase in fuel efficiency standards of automobiles will be wiped out when the U.S. population grows by 30 percent in the coming decades.
\
The environmental community is very fragmented. Most environmental organizations focus only on a few aspects of environmental protection. Some issues, such as landscape beauty, are not being addressed much at all. And these various groups don't seem to be collaborating in any meaningful way to address the root causes of our environmental problems.
\
If environmental organizations could work together and develop a common platform of positions, policies and programs to make real changes, we would have more hope of solving our environmental crisis.
\
Before citizens join or support an environmental organization they might want to ask, ""Is this organization just dealing with the symptoms or is it also addressing the underlying causes? And what specific long-term policies does it have that will actually lead to a healthy environment?""
\
As Speth also says, ""It is time for the environmental community -- indeed, everyone -- to step outside the system and develop a deeper critique of what is going on.""
\
George Plumb is the executive director of Vermonters for a Sustainable Population and chairman of the New England Coalition for a Sustainable Population. He is a longtime environmental activist and a co-founder of the Vermont Earth Institute, the Vermont Bicycle and Pedestrian Coalition and the Vermont Trails and Greenways Council.

Hanover -- Long before the Ford Foundation awarded him $300,000 last month to jump-start his Climate Justice Research Project at Dartmouth College, environmental-studies professor Michael Dorsey couldn't imagine a better place to teach -- and continue to learn.
\
""Dartmouth has been leading the conversation, particularly in the polar North, on climate change,"" Dorsey said during a telephone interview last week. ""The conversation is being advanced at the (John Sloan) Dickey Center (for International Understanding). Dartmouth has been working with Inuit peoples in the polar North and Inuit political leaders in Greenland. That relationship has been focused on broader issues.
\
""Dartmouth is sort of an ideal place to open up a global conversation on how people on the margins are affected by what's happening to the environment.""
\
Dorsey, now 37, began talking with students, fellow educators and policymakers at home and abroad on those issues in the early 1990s, while pursuing his bachelor's degree at the University of Michigan. Progressing through his education -- master's degrees in forest science from Yale and in anthropology from Johns Hopkins, doctorate in natural resources and environmental policy from Michigan -- he traveled the world as a lecturer and a scholarly advisor to non-government organizations and government task forces.
\
He landed at Dartmouth in 2001, serving first as a Thurgood Marshall Fellow in Geography and Environmental Studies, then as a lecturer for 2 1/2 years. After earning his doctorate in 2005, he became an assistant professor.
\
With the Ford Foundation grant, he and a team of undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows will study ways for governments and other organizations worldwide to build what Dorsey describes as ""bridges between the scientists, the policymakers and the people in low-income communities.""
\
The Valley News caught up with Dorsey by phone last week, during a break in the climate-change conference he is attending at the University of Southern California. An edited transcript of that conversation follows:
\
Valley News: How did the grant come about, and how long did it take to develop to this point?
\
Michael Dorsey: The Ford money was a byproduct of the Ford Foundation's commitment to dealing with climate change. In the fall of '07, they brought together a critical mass of project officers across a variety of sectors -- human rights, community development, economists and a couple of others to have a convention about climate change. ... I gave a 20-minute presentation, and there was another 20 minutes or so for Q&A. So this really came out of that conversation, and work that the foundation has been doing. ... It was there that I suggested that one of the areas we wanted to pay attention to is emerging carbon markets, and how much things like cap-and-trade agreements actually help or work. When this got under way, we were under a very different administration, with a very different outlook on climate change.
\
VN: And I take it that the climate, if you'll pardon an alternate use of the phrase, surrounding the issue of climate change has changed with the Obama administration?
\
MD: President Obama is clearly someone who is committed to addressing climate change -- addressing it aggressively. His appointments -- putting Carol Browner as climate czar in the White House, Dr. (Steven) Chu in the Department of Energy, Lisa Jackson at the EPA -- these are clear indications that the president takes this very seriously.
\
VN: Seriously enough that you can see future money flowing from the feds for your project at Dartmouth?
\
MD: One cannot predict how the feds will help you with a research project. Our work is oriented toward providing policy options and solutions. But as we ramp up, we will (apply for federal grants), absolutely.
\
VN: Do you worry at all, even with a relatively sympathetic administration and Congress, that the big focus on righting the economy will lead to delays in support for taking on climate change and its implications for poor and marginalized populations?
\
MD: I think there is a risk ... maybe not a risk, there's a concern that some have expressed that an aggressive stance toward climate change could adversely or perversely affect the economy. The reality is that less carbon can produce more jobs. Efforts to reduce C02 (emissions) are integral to restructuring economies. Committed action to get carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere in the long run, even in the medium and short run, can be economically helpful.
\
VN: Which President Obama maintained during the campaign and after taking office.
\
MD: His advisers bring a lot of experience on this issue to the table.
\
VN: How is your team for the project shaping up?
\
MD: We're looking at candidates now. We'll ramp up fully in the summer. By the middle of the summer, we'll have a couple of post (doctoral fellows) moving it forward. We'll be on the ground for the next round of climate negotiations in Copenhagen (in December).
\
VN: In addition to the postdoctoral people, you're bringing graduate students and undergraduates into the project as well. Sounds like you've got plenty of people to choose from.
\
MD: There's a lot of interest. Dartmouth students have been actively engaged in domestic climate change policy for some time. They've actively been bringing in speakers to campus, and going to meetings and conferences. We had several who went to the Power Shift Conference. I'll be turning to them not just for their labor, but for insights and opinions. They're quite informed.
\
VN: So would you say interest in the subject is growing among students generally, as opposed to their fighting for top jobs on Wall Street?
\
MD: Dartmouth students have a larger and a deep interest in protecting the environment, and also exhibit interest and engagement in climate-change policy.
\
VN: As well as with the impact of climate change on marginalized populations?
\
MD: Dartmouth students are acutely aware of the ways climate change has consequences on the lives and livelihoods of everyone. Climate change doesn't simply involve environmental problems, but social and economic consequences. And there's an active commitment among them to think about issues of justice and issues of equity, and how to design and shape policies going forward.
\
VN: And you've found the Upper Valley in general a hospitable place in terms of awareness, as well as to live and work?
\
MD: Hanover and the Upper Valley are amazing places to live, and also to do research that is global in nature. The rootedness of the people who go back generations, but also the interest of people at the college and the surrounding communities, is pretty inspiring.
\
VN: I see where, when you're not traveling or teaching, you find time to take advantage of our natural resources around here, including mountain climbing.
\
MD: It's great. I've done some ice climbing in Pinhkam Notch, under the careful and watchful eye of (Dartmouth Outdoor Programs director) Brian Kunz. I've also been out on the Appalachian Trail in so many stretches. That is one of the benefits of being at Dartmouth and in the Upper Valley. You've got dedicated and committed people, interested in enjoying, as well as protecting, the environment.
\
VN: Is that about the only breather you get in your schedule, what with the teaching and the travel to conferences and being on the speed dials of people in government and the media?
\
MD: My breather is going to the classroom and working with engaged students. That's what gives me the energy.

\
What problems can the United States solve with renewable energy?
\
Four years ago, both presidential candidates acknowledged the threat of climate change and endorsed vigorous policies to move away from fossil fuels. The nation seemed on the verge of committing to greenhouse-gas reductions and developing alternative-energy technologies. Since then, most Republican leaders have become skeptical about global warming and now oppose any major policy response.
\
Democrats, including President Obama, have stopped talking about the subject. Their energy proposals now target lower costs, energy security and job creation from domestic production. That doesn't mean they no longer worry about climate change; they just decided it would be politically unfeasible to adopt greenhouse-gas policies directly. Instead, they are betting they can push the climate agenda indirectly, by focusing on renewable energy as the solution to other problems.
\
It's a bad bet and likely to backfire. The United States needs to invest in renewable energy, but not because that would be a good way to address energy security, affordability or unemployment.
\
While it's tempting to roll all our energy challenges into one, the problems and the solutions are numerous and distinct. If your goal is just to maintain moderate energy costs or achieve greater energy security, your friendly neighborhood fossil-fuel producers have the answers.
\
Domestic coal is cheap and plentiful, and likely to remain so for centuries. Natural gas is more abundant by the month. With new drilling technologies, there probably is enough moderately priced domestic gas to last for decades.
\
Similar new techniques are even improving U.S. oil production. More than half of the oil we use is now produced domestically and that share is likely to rise over the next decade. Technologies for converting coal and natural gas to a gasoline equivalent are also advancing.
\
Sure, the cost of low-carbon energy technologies -- wind, solar, biofuels and others -- is coming down. But improvements in technologies for extracting fossil fuels are making it harder for renewables to reach cost parity. Scientific breakthroughs are hard to predict: Still, the most likely scenario is that domestically produced fossil fuels will be the lowest-cost way to meet most of our energy needs and achieve greater energy security for years to come.
\
The employment argument also falls short. During a recession, it makes sense for the government to promote job creation with subsidies and federal expenditures, some of which may be targeted at specific industries. In the longer run, however, economists are almost unanimous that the economy creates more and better jobs when companies operate in the most cost-effective way. If we don't count the cost of environmental damage, that's likely to mean carbon-based energy for generations.
\
Some politicians argue that the government should invest in alternative energy because it's the next economic frontier. The evidence doesn't suggest such initiatives build a sustainable industry. In Spain, renewables took off during the last decade, but the industry crumbled in 2009 when subsidies were halted during the country's fiscal crunch. Germany made a big push in solar photovoltaic technology with subsidies more than five times the cost of conventional power generation, and manufacturing of PV systems exploded. Then China got into solar-panel production and German firms' share of domestic PV sales fell to 27 percent in 2010, from 77 percent in 2008.
\
The only compelling argument for policies to boost renewables and reduce fossil fuels is the environment. The vast majority of climate scientists believe that carbon-dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels are the primary cause of climate change. Most believe there is a real risk that the changes could cause major ecosystem disruptions, including more frequent droughts, floods, hurricanes and wildfires, as well as rising sea levels, more conflicts over resources and accelerated species extinction.
\
Economists of all political persuasions agree that the free market, by itself, won't address unregulated emissions that damage the environment. Government policy is necessary and the most efficient policy is pricing those emissions. By doing so, we give incentives to develop all possible solutions: solar, wind, biofuels, nuclear power, improved energy efficiency and even capturing emissions from power plants and sequestering them underground.
\
We need to encourage all these technologies because we don't yet know which will be cheapest or most scalable. Those incentives, however, should be even-handed, not the patchwork of mandates, subsidies and tax breaks for favored technologies that we have today. Pricing greenhouse gases helps all low-carbon alternatives without putting a thumb on the scale.
\
If conservatives continue to reject carbon pricing -- even though cap and trade was the brainchild of mainstream Republicans -- then subsidizing green power is probably the best option. It is a more costly way to rein in greenhouse gases, as I explain in recent research. But if similar subsidies for all low-carbon technologies maintain a level playing field, such an exchange is still likely to be a major step in fighting climate change.
\
Those market incentives need to be augmented by support for the scientific research that will discover the next generation of low-carbon technologies. The federal government supports basic research in medicine, telecommunications and electronics, and needs to nurture energy technologies in the same way. As a share of gross domestic product, energy gets far less support than these other areas.
\
What once was bipartisan agreement on the need to reduce greenhouse gases has been recast as a political food fight. Advocates of renewable energy feel cornered by the gridlock in Congress and waning interest in climate change. But arguing that renewable energy is the best way to address economic or security concerns isn't the way to prevail. It just focuses the debate on issues where fossil fuels are almost sure to win.

Thursday, December 6 It has been 10 years since the signing of the Kyoto Protocols, a decade in which the effects of global warming on the planet have become dramatically and frighteningly apparent. It was largely a decade wasted, as the refusal of the United States, the world's largest polluter, to sign on, gutted the pact. This week, representatives of 190 of the world's nations gather in Bali, Indonesia to propose an extension of the Protocols, which expire in 2012. Again, it is the United States that threatens to stand in the way of progress.
\
What debate there was about global warming science 10 years ago ended with the report last month of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which laid out the tangible results of human-caused global warming in damning detail, and explained what is likely to come if nothing is done to arrest greenhouse emissions with similar clarity. The report should provide a sense of urgency to the Bali meeting that wasn't there in past world gatherings on the environment, but politics can have a numbing effect on the most well-intentioned of efforts.
\
The Bush administration has been sulkily moving toward an acknowledgment of the reality of human-caused global warming, helped by the Supreme Court's prodding of an Environmental Protection Agency that doesn't think air pollution is any of its business. Yet Paula Dobriansky, the U.S. under secretary of state for democracy and global affairs, says any global framework for attacking greenhouse emissions must contain some ""flexibility."" Unfortunately, there is nothing flexible about the inexorable march of global warming -- the melting of ice caps, rising of sea levels, the increase in powerful storms and instances of long droughts. It will take tough regulations, rigidly adhered to, to combat that march.
\
One accomplishment of the Kyoto Protocols was the introduction of the cap and trade system, in which polluting companies can finance emission-cutting programs elsewhere to save themselves costly environmental protections at home. It is far from an ideal system but it does give companies, and countries, an incentive to address pollution, and it is the basis of a bill going before the Senate tomorrow that would cut greenhouse emissions by an estimated 15 percent over the next 12 years by assigning emission allowances that companies could trade on the open market. The cap and trade system should be continued and expanded in Bali.
\
Ideally, the world's leading polluters will reach a mandatory agreement to reduce greenhouse emissions, setting an example for smaller nations. In the 10 years since the Protocols, China and India have emerged as major polluters, contributing dramatically to global warming. They, however, will do nothing unless the United States, still the globe's leading polluter, sets the pace. In that sense, Washington holds the world's future in its hands.

Friday, September 26 NEW YORK -- Greenhouse gases went on sale Thursday as 10 Northeastern and mid-Atlantic states held the nation's first auction of pollution credits aimed at curbing global warming.
\
""It is time really to turn the tide on global warming,"" said New York Gov. David Paterson, who opened the auction by ringing the ceremonial bell at the New York Mercantile Exchange. ""And we hope that we've done this today.""
\
The program puts a price on carbon dioxide pollution, giving power plants a financial incentive to cut emissions.
\
Auction proceeds will go toward energy conservation and renewable energy programs in each of the 10 participating states: New York, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Rhode Island and Vermont.
\
The program aims to hold carbon dioxide emissions steady through 2014 and then gradually reduce them; it is widely viewed as a model for future programs nationally and around the globe.
\
""It's historic,"" said Lance Pierce, climate program director of the Union of Concerned Scientists. ""The carbon markets have arrived in the United States. And carbon markets, if designed correctly, hold the promise for development of cleaner energy ... and reductions in global warming pollution that benefit consumers, businesses and the environment as well.""
\
The Northeast regional effort caps the total amount of carbon that power plants in the 10 states can pump out of their smokestacks at the current level -- 188 million tons. Electric power generators must pay for allowances covering the amount of carbon they emit and RGGI will provide a market-based auction and trading system where the generators can buy, sell and trade the emissions allowances.
\
The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, or RGGI, covers more than 200 fossil fuel power plants, requiring that the owners of those plants pay for the carbon dioxide they emit into the air.
\
The initiative will gradually reduce carbon emissions by reducing the cap in a series of steps, until it is 10 percent below the current level a decade from now. The companies that don't reduce emissions can buy allowances from companies that have, thereby creating a financial incentive to reduce pollution because the more environmentally friendly plants won't have to buy as many credits and because they can sell any they don't need.
\
Dale Bryk, senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said, ""This new energy plan is straightforward, highly cost-effective and creates a clean energy pathway for the rest of the country to follow. It is the shape of things to come.""
\
Carbon dioxide trading already exists in Europe. Some carbon dioxide allowances also are being traded in the United States on a voluntary basis through the Chicago Climate Exchange. But RGGI is the nation's first mandatory capping effort for carbon dioxide.
\
The initiative took five years to bear fruit. Then-New York Gov. George Pataki brought together nine other governors five years ago to develop a regional strategy to limit carbon dioxide emissions from power plants.
\
Other regional greenhouse gas coalitions, such as the Western Climate Initiative and the Midwestern Greenhouse Gas Accord, are in earlier stages of development.
\
New Jersey Gov. Jon Corzine, who joined Paterson at a news conference at the mercantile exchange, noted that both John McCain and Barack Obama support cap-and-trade programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Corzine said ""there is building momentum"" to enact federal cap-and-trade legislation.

Climate change is no longer a future threat but a current reality, as the extreme weather throughout the U.S. in recent years suggests.
\
Beyond what common sense tell us there are the reports of scientists, the most recent of which was released last week and went into sobering detail about the impact of human-caused climate change today and in the future, if nothing is done. Much can still be done -- but will any of it?
\
""A lot has changed since the U.S.government released their last report in 2008,"" said Cornell University professor David Wolfe, lead author of the report's section on the Northeast, in The Boston Globe. He added that ""Many climate impacts that were once projected for the future are happening now."" Congress in 1990 mandated that federal climate reports be made every four years but the refusal of Republican administrations to do so has resulted in only three being done in that time period. The damage done to the environment during a quarter-century of inaction is incalculable and inexcusable.
\
The report found that temperatures in the Northeastern states have risen by 2 degrees Fahrenheit over the last century, a significant rise that pales in comparison to a rise of as much as 10 degrees over the next 70 years if nothing is done to release the flow of heat-trapping gases produced by the burning of fossil fuels into the atmosphere. That means that the dramatic increase in violent storms, heavy rain and flooding seen in recent years would increase exponentially in the decades ahead.
\
Much of what is caused by climate change is counter-intuitive, which riles up skeptics who wonder how there can be both heavier rain and increased drought conditions. As the report makes clear, brutally hot summers will cause more and quicker evaporation, so floods can and will be followed by droughts. Warmer winters will mean that the ticks, mosquitoes and other insects that carry Lyme disease, West Nile Virus and other serious ailments will not be killed off and will continue their spread across New England. Climate change is already increasing the potency of plant allergens such as ragweed and that will escalate, said the report.
\
Berkshire County has long been cherished by residents and visitors for its warm but not overwhelming summers, crisp autumns and snowy winters. Increasingly, we have seen humid, buggy summers, duller fall foliage and warm, soggy winters, and climate change will continue to take a toll on the beautiful Berkshires.
\
Unless, of course, there is change in political circles in the attitude toward climate change. Predictably, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has no scientific credentials, denounced the report (which was put together by more than 300 specialists and vetted by the National Academy of Sciences) as ""alarmist."" The report is alarming, as is the continued insistence of congressional Flat Earthers that not only science but the mega-storms, fires and droughts that afflict their own states are of no significance. They are, of course, doing the bidding of the fossil fuel industry, which cares deeply about profit margins and not a whit about the damage it is doing to the planet.
\
Massachusetts can be proud that it is out front in encouraging the expanded use of green energy and of ambitious conservation measures. This is the first state to require all environmental reviews to consider the impact of climate change. The report encourages other regions of the country to follow the Northeast's environmental example, such as the adoption of cap and trade programs to reward industries that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but cap and trade is a non-starter with Washington Republicans.
\
The effort to slow if not reverse global warming will require a concerted effort by states, the United States and the nations of the world, in particular fast-growing Asian nations. The evidence of human-caused climate change is irrefutable to all but ideological ostriches. We can act, as a world, or we can continue, as has been the case for decades, to ruin the planet we live on and live with the consequences.

37,"As a business focused on producing household products with human health and the environment in mind, we are always seeking ways to use resources efficiently. We have found that this is a recipe for a successful business and we hope policymakers will embrace this ethos too. State policymakers in New England and the Mid-Atlantic currently have an exciting opportunity to continue to raise the bar in the region and invest in a clean and efficient energy grid.\The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) is a successful regional carbon cap-and-trade program in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic that has been helping states cut energy usage for the past eight years. Governors from RGGI states will soon make an important decision regarding the fate of the RGGI program moving forward. These states have an opportunity to demonstrate their leadership in tackling climate change and fostering clean energy investment.\The states can either choose to maintain the status quo -- or they can choose to rise to the challenge and increase the program's ambition. We hope RGGI states will choose to do what is right by both the planet and the economy by adopting a more ambitious RGGI program.\For over 8 years, this group of nine northeastern states has demonstrated that clean energy and economic growth go hand-in-hand. In fact, RGGI states have cut their carbon pollution levels by 40 percent while their economies have grown at rates outpacing the rest of the country.\RGGI's track record of success demonstrates that emissions reductions are good for the economy. These states are not alone. Leading companies across the country are cutting emissions, investing in energy efficiency and buying renewable energy because it makes business sense. At Seventh Generation, we have set a goal to power all of our operations with non-fossil fuel sources and make all of our products and packaging 100 percent biodegradable or recyclable by 2020. We are on track to meet our goals and we have used an internal carbon fee to fund our investments carbon-reduction initiatives.\As part of our mission, we're also committed to reversing the negative health effects of climate change. The RGGI program has helped avoid an estimated 8,200 asthma attacks, 39,000 lost work days, and more than 300 premature deaths by reducing dangerous air pollution -- providing an estimated $5.7 million in health benefits from 2009 to 2015.\RGGI is a market-based policy that incentivizes innovation in emissions reductions and investment in clean energy -- helping boot our region's economy. Electricity prices across the region have fallen by 3 percent, while the rest of the country has seen prices climb. Furthermore, RGGI state economies have grown by an impressive 25 percent and have boosted employment by 28,500 job-years, generating an incredible $2.7 billion in economic growth.\What's more, the proceeds generated by the RGGI auctions provide important funding for states, which many have chosen to reinvest in local clean energy programs that lead to even greater economic kick-backs and bill savings.\As a company based in Vermont, we're proud to have a governor that recognizes the economic imperative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In his recent executive order on climate change, Gov. Scott announced that Vermont remains committed to doing its part to address climate change (""Vermont will join climate alliance,"" June 12), despite policy rollbacks from Washington. Other RGGI states, too -- Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, New York and Rhode Island -- have joined the bipartisan U.S. Climate Alliance to signal their commitment to upholding the objectives of the Paris Climate Agreement.\The upcoming decision to increase RGGI's ambition will be the first major test for states in the U.S. Climate Alliance. After such a resounding success with California's cap-and-trade program, all eyes on RGGI states to step up to the plate and continue their ambition.\Lawmakers should seize upon this opportunity to go further and invest in a low-carbon future. The faster we transition to clean energy, the more jobs we will create and the more money we save in the long run. Future generations will be better off thanks to our thoughtful decisions.\Seventh Generation is committed to doing our part, and we encourage RGGI states do so as well. The health and wellbeing of our economy and of the next seven generations rely on it.\John Replogle is president and CEO of Seventh Generation, a Burlington-based American cleaning and personal care products company."
38,"Here's the bewildering thing about climate change: It's invisible. So, too, are the gaseous emissions believed to bring it about. Their supposed effects are complex, expensive, and for the most part, years away -- unseen. Emissions are easy to ignore.\It's the same with policies that try to limit climate change -- exceedingly complex, expensive, easy to ignore.\If nobody makes a serious effort to limit a state's total emissions of carbon dioxide, the most plentiful greenhouse gas, who will notice? Nobody gets sick from carbon dioxide in the great outdoors. Nor can anyone be sure if the year-to-year variations in temperature, or the severity of storms, has anything to do with the buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. If carbon dioxide and other ""greenhouse gases"" really do affect the climate in the Northeast, another generation or two might go by before people really start to see the effects -- such as the dwindling of the maples, the dulling of the foliage.\Nevertheless, most states in New England have started making serious, comprehensive attempts to do something about climate change. They have invested in analyzing where their emissions are coming from, and in what amounts -- a complicated and time-consuming technical undertaking, but necessary if a state is to determine, rigorously, how and where to reduce emissions.\Some states have hired consultants to help them develop climate-change policies. Some states began, two to three years ago, to convene meetings of ""stakeholders"" -- municipalities, private businesses, environmentalists and so on -- to formulate policy options and seek consensus. Three of the New England states have developed and published comprehensive climate-change action plans with specific measures and quantitative strategies for reducing or limiting total greenhouse gas emissions. Four states have each pledged to reduce total emissions to 1990 levels by 2010, in keeping with a regional goal set in 2001.\Not Vermont.\Vermont does not have a plan for reducing statewide greenhouse gas emissions. Vermont has not committed to reducing its emissions to 1990 levels by 2010. Vermont does not have an updated accounting of its greenhouse gas emissions. (The most recent year for which official data are available is 1990.)\To be sure, Vermont has taken some actions. Like most other New England states, Vermont has moved to improve the fuel efficiency of its state fleet and to upgrade the energy efficiency of state buildings and other operations of state government. Like most other New England states, it has adopted California's stricter tailpipe-emission standards for newer cars, and has signaled its intent to sign on to a new California standard that aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in new cars. Vermont has added bus lines in the northwestern part of the state, and like other states, has encouraged forms of ride sharing and alternative transit.\None of these measures has made a significant dent in Vermont's greenhouse gas emissions. State government accounts for less than 3 percent of Vermont's total emissions. Public transit and ride-sharing programs are used by a tiny fraction of the state's commuters. The new California emission standard would not go into effect until the 2009 model year.\Vermont's total emissions in 2001 were 23 percent higher than in 1990, according to an analysis released earlier this year by the New England Climate Coalition, which includes state Public Interest Research Groups and other environmental-advocacy organizations. Indeed, when it comes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, Vermont might face a tougher challenge than any of its New England counterparts.\That's because Vermont is the only state in the region whose emissions come primarily from cars. Officials working on climate-change policy in other states acknowledge that emissions from cars might be the toughest to contain -- tougher than those from industry, commerce or electric utilities.\Vermont's total Vehicle Miles Traveled increased 35 percent from 1990 to 2003, according to the state's statistics. As late as August, as gas prices rose, people in Vermont were driving about as much as before: Gas tax receipts for that month were down 1 percent from August the previous year; diesel tax receipts were up.\Halfway through the decade that was supposed to put a regional curb on climate-changing emissions, Vermont's primary challenge -- transportation -- is one that the state has barely begun to confront.\The regional initiative\Four years ago, not long after the United States refused to sign an international treaty to cut emissions, New England governors and Eastern Canadian premiers decided to take matters into their own hands.\In August 2001, they adopted a ""Climate Change Action Plan"" that established regional goals and set forth a framework for achieving them.\The short-term goal was to reduce the region's emissions to 1990 levels by 2010. Each state or province was to develop its own plan for making reductions.\Four states -- Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts and Rhode Island -- have drawn up climate action plans that commit to that goal at the state level. Officials in some of those states say they have a shot at attaining the goal, or at least coming close.\Vermont and New Hampshire have agreed only to work toward the regional goal.\When a bill in the Vermont House (H.49) was introduced this past session to establish that same 2010 emissions goal for the state, Jeffrey Wennberg, commissioner of environmental conservation, and Tom Torti, secretary of the Agency of Natural Resources, both took issue with the bill during hearings before the House Natural Resources and Energy Committee, asking the panel to defer action until next year. (The bill remains in committee.) Wennberg said that the goal would be ""exceedingly difficult to achieve,"" a ""far more difficult task"" in Vermont than in the other states or provinces.\Why more difficult in Vermont? In part because such a large share of Vermont's emissions come from transportation. All the other states have large fossil-fuel burning power plants, and most have bigger industrial and commercial sectors. Most of the electricity Vermont consumes is produced by non-emitting power generators, nuclear and hydro. So, Vermont's greenhouse gas emissions from the electrical sector are negligible, ""the envy of the nation,"" according to Wennberg.\As John Sayles, director of policy research and planning in the Agency of Natural Resources, put it recently, in discussing the challenge of reducing emissions: ""There's low-hanging fruit in other states"" -- for example, you can put a scrubber on a power plant to cut down on some emissions. Vermont has no ""low-hanging fruit,"" he said -- you can't put a scrubber on several hundred thousand cars.\The bill, which according to its principal sponsor, Rep. Steven Maier, D-Middlebury, was inspired by the regional plan, called among other things for Vermont to develop its own climate-action plan and its own inventory of greenhouse gas emissions.\Torti told the committee that the Agency of Natural Resources could not afford to do all the work the bill called for.\""We don't have the resources to do all the environmental work we're supposed to do now,"" Torti said. Wennberg said the bill provided no resources for a task that would likely require additional employees and hundreds of thousands of dollars.\Yet this is a financial commitment that other states have chosen to make. Detailed, comprehensive climate-action plans in Connecticut, Maine and Rhode Island have been hammered out over the past three years. Rhode Island's cost about $200,000; Maine's, about $250,000; Connecticut's, about $500,000. How did Connecticut come up with that kind of money, on top of all its other environmental regulatory responsibilities?\""It's a matter of deciding what your priorities are,"" said Chris James, director or air planning in the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection.\Vermont's priority has been to promote efficiencies in state government, following executive orders in 2002 and 2003 by Govs. Dean and Douglas, and this year, a detailed report drawn up by the Climate Neutral Working Group, a committee of state-agency representatives.\The regional plan calls state-government initiatives ""leading by example,"" and most of New England's state governments have sought to do so -- adding hybrid cars to state fleets, making state buildings more energy-efficient. (Vermont's state government accounted for about 2.2 percent of the state's total carbon dioxide emissions in 1990, according to the Agency of Natural Resources.)\Vermont also participates in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a cooperative effort of nine Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states to discuss the design of a regional ""cap-and-trade program"" covering carbon dioxide emissions. The program would apply just to electric power and not to Vermont's biggest greenhouse-gas bugaboo, transportation.\As for a statewide climate-action plan, Vermont will have one, and it will be funded, Wennberg said last week. He declined to specify a timetable for developing the plan. ""It's going to be announced in the near future,"" he said. Coming to grips with transportation\Vermont's total greenhouse gas emissions -- and the population that produces them -- are smaller than those of any other New England state.\Wennberg told the House committee that Vermont's emissions per capita were lower than for any other state in the region. (That's in part because each of the other states, unlike Vermont, has fossil-fuel burning power plants that account for about a quarter of total emissions.) Even if Vermont cut its emissions to zero, this reduction would have a negligible effect on the global greenhouse gas problem.\Does all of this mean that Vermont can ignore its rising greenhouse gas emissions?\If Vermont's emissions continue to go up, then for the regional goal to be reached, other states or provinces will have to compensate by cutting their emissions even more than they otherwise would. Moreover, the nature of the emissions problems vary from state to state, but each state is committed to working on its unique situation.\Only in Vermont does transportation account for more than half the carbon dioxide problem.\Compounding Vermont's transportation challenge are recent trends in the U.S. auto industry. Over the last 20 years, according to a study of cars and light trucks by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the thrust of technological innovation has been to increase vehicles' weight, power and acceleration. Average fuel economy hasn't improved significantly since about 1990. In other words, people have been buying bigger and more powerful vehicles, without regard for better gas mileage.\Why does this matter? ""Fuel economy is directly related to emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide,"" states the EPA. The more miles per gallon your car gets, the less carbon dioxide it gives out for each mile you drive.\Other states in New England are working on transportation measures that have yet to receive serious consideration in Vermont, among them:\Incentive to buy hybrids: Gas-electric hybrids are more fuel-efficient, and thus lower emitters. Connecticut dropped the sales tax on hybrids last year. A bill to do that was introduced in Vermont House in the spring, but it didn't get a hearing in the Transportation Committee.\In any case, hybrids are a small part of any solution. Of the 423,724 ""pleasure cars"" registered with the Vermont Department of Motor Vehicles, 1,150 are hybrids -- less than half of 1 percent. The state fleet, for its part, has 13 Toyota Priuses and 25 Honda Civic hybrids.\A ""feebate"" program: Connecticut, Maine and Rhode Island have included this idea in their climate-change action plans. In Connecticut, the legislature asked a task force to come up with a proposal for the next session. The program would apply to purchases of new vehicles: Gas guzzlers would be assessed a fee; fuel-efficient cars would get a rebate. The program could be designed to be ""revenue neutral"" -- that is, so that total fees would pay for total rebates.\A bill to establish a feebate program was introduced in the Vermont House during the last session. It didn't get a hearing in the Transportation Committee. Chairman Rep. Richard Westman, R-Cambridge, said, however, that there have been discussions about revising registration fees to promote ownership of fuel-efficient vehicles.\Slowing growth in Vehicle Miles Traveled: This is an explicit goal in Maine's and Connecticut's climate-change plans; in Rhode Island, it's a ""priority study option."" In Maine's plan, which ranks 55 policy options in order of carbon dioxide savings, slowing VMT growth is No. 17. One way to do that is to foster ""smart growth"" development, clustered housing or in-fill development. Connecticut's plan calls for ""smart growth"" initiatives coupled with transit improvements, and urges consideration of ""pay-as-you-drive"" insurance.\Reducing VMT growth is not a formal policy goal of Vermont's Agency of Transportation, beyond the state's promotion of public transit, ride-sharing, bike/pedestrian programs. Apart from such programs, ""Vermont has explicitly stayed away from reducing VMT as a policy goal,"" said Ian Grossman, spokesman for the agency. One reason is that ""This type of 'social engineering' is not something the agency sees as part of our mission.""\Transportation planning: Greenhouse gas emissions are not taken into account in the planning of Vermont's transportation projects. ""Because there is no adequate scientific knowledge to understand the effect of a single highway project on climate change, we do not consider potential increases in greenhouse gas emissions (or the effects on climate change) when planning specific transportation projects,"" Grossman said.\By contrast, Massachusetts' ""Climate Protection Plan"" states: ""Considering greenhouse gas emissions when making transportation planning and funding decisions will be a powerful tool in state efforts to reduce transportation's harmful impacts on the environment. There are many opportunities to curb growing GHG emissions through the transportation planning process, but traditionally these have not been considered."" The unavoidable truth\Sooner or later, all efforts to cut down on transportation emissions run up against an unavoidable fact: Any car that burns gasoline, no matter how efficient, emits carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is an inevitable byproduct of combustion.\So, if drivers want to churn out less carbon dioxide, they'll have to use less gasoline. They can do that by driving more efficient cars or by driving less. Either way means conserving energy.\That's why the most obvious policy measure to reduce emissions from transportation -- and from every other energy sector -- is one that promotes conservation. It's a measure that has been adopted in New Zealand and in some parts of Europe. In the United States, it's deemed so politically unpalatable that most states grappling with climate change aren't even considering it.\It's called a carbon tax: a tax on energy sources that spew carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Earlier this year, an endorsement of a national carbon tax emerged from an unlikely source -- the CEO of an electric utility.\Paul Andersen, of Duke Energy, gave a speech in Charlotte, N.C., that called for such a tax. He told his listeners that Americans have to confront the fact that they can't have it both ways -- a better environment and cheap energy.\""We need to face up to the inconsistency of our demands,"" Andersen said. ""It's time to recognize that if we want a better environment, we're going to have to pay more for energy.""\Contact Tim Johnson at 660-1808 or tjohnson@bfp.burlingtonfreepress.com"

The state fleet, for its part, has 13 Toyota Priuses and 25 Honda Civic hybrids.\A ""feebate"" program: Connecticut, Maine and Rhode Island have included this idea in their climate-change action plans. In Connecticut, the legislature asked a task force to come up with a proposal for the next session. The program would apply to purchases of new vehicles: Gas guzzlers would be assessed a fee; fuel-efficient cars would get a rebate. The program could be designed to be ""revenue neutral"" -- that is, so that total fees would pay for total rebates.\A bill to establish a feebate program was introduced in the Vermont House during the last session. It didn't get a hearing in the Transportation Committee. Chairman Rep. Richard Westman, R-Cambridge, said, however, that there have been discussions about revising registration fees to promote ownership of fuel-efficient vehicles.\Slowing growth in Vehicle Miles Traveled: This is an explicit goal in Maine's and Connecticut's climate-change plans; in Rhode Island, it's a ""priority study option."" In Maine's plan, which ranks 55 policy options in order of carbon dioxide savings, slowing VMT growth is No. 17. One way to do that is to foster ""smart growth"" development, clustered housing or in-fill development. Connecticut's plan calls for ""smart growth"" initiatives coupled with transit improvements, and urges consideration of ""pay-as-you-drive"" insurance.\Reducing VMT growth is not a formal policy goal of Vermont's Agency of Transportation, beyond the state's promotion of public transit, ride-sharing, bike/pedestrian programs. Apart from such programs, ""Vermont has explicitly stayed away from reducing VMT as a policy goal,"" said Ian Grossman, spokesman for the agency. One reason is that ""This type of 'social engineering' is not something the agency sees as part of our mission.""\Transportation planning: Greenhouse gas emissions are not taken into account in the planning of Vermont's transportation projects. ""Because there is no adequate scientific knowledge to understand the effect of a single highway project on climate change, we do not consider potential increases in greenhouse gas emissions (or the effects on climate change) when planning specific transportation projects,"" Grossman said.\By contrast, Massachusetts' ""Climate Protection Plan"" states: ""Considering greenhouse gas emissions when making transportation planning and funding decisions will be a powerful tool in state efforts to reduce transportation's harmful impacts on the environment. There are many opportunities to curb growing GHG emissions through the transportation planning process, but traditionally these have not been considered."" The unavoidable truth\Sooner or later, all efforts to cut down on transportation emissions run up against an unavoidable fact: Any car that burns gasoline, no matter how efficient, emits carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is an inevitable byproduct of combustion.\So, if drivers want to churn out less carbon dioxide, they'll have to use less gasoline. They can do that by driving more efficient cars or by driving less. Either way means conserving energy.\That's why the most obvious policy measure to reduce emissions from transportation -- and from every other energy sector -- is one that promotes conservation. It's a measure that has been adopted in New Zealand and in some parts of Europe. In the United States, it's deemed so politically unpalatable that most states grappling with climate change aren't even considering it.\It's called a carbon tax: a tax on energy sources that spew carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Earlier this year, an endorsement of a national carbon tax emerged from an unlikely source -- the CEO of an electric utility.\Paul Andersen, of Duke Energy, gave a speech in Charlotte, N.C., that called for such a tax. He told his listeners that Americans have to confront the fact that they can't have it both ways -- a better environment and cheap energy.\""We need to face up to the inconsistency of our demands,"" Andersen said. ""It's time to recognize that if we want a better environment, we're going to have to pay more for energy.""\Contact Tim Johnson at 660-1808 or tjohnson@bfp.burlingtonfreepress.com"
40,"Here's the bewildering thing about climate change: It's invisible. So, too, are the gaseous emissions believed to bring it about. Their supposed effects are complex, expensive, and for the most par, years away -- unseen. Emissions are easy to ignore.\It's the same with policies that try to limit climate change -- exceedinglycomplex, expensive, easy to ignore.\If nobody makes a serious effort to limit a state's total emissions of carbon dioxide, the most plentiful greenhouse gass, who will notice? Nobody gets sick from carbon dioxide in the great outdoors. Nor can anyone be sure if they year-to-year variations in temperature, or the severity of storms, has anything to do with the buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. If carbon dioxide and other ""greenhouse gases"" really do affect the climate in the Northeast, another generation or two might go by before people really sart to see the effects -- such as the dwindling of the maples, the dulling of the foliage.\Nevertheless, most states in New Enland have started making serious, comperhensive attempts to do something about climate change. They ave invested in analyzing where their emissions are coming from, and in what amounts -- a complicated and time-consuming technical undertaking, but necessary if a state is to determine, rigorously, how and where to reduce emissions.\Some states have hired consultants to help them develop climate change policies. Some states began, two to three yearsgo, to convene meetings of ""stakeholders"" -- municipalities, private businesses, environmentalists and so on -- to formulate policy options and seek consensus. Three of the New England states have developed and published comprehensive climate-change action plans with specific measures and quantitative strategies for reducing or limiting total greenhous gas emissions. Four states have each pledged to reduce total emissions to 1990 levels by 2010, in keeping with a regional goal set in 2001.\Not Vermont.\Vermont does not have a plan for reducing statewide greenhouse gas emissions. Vermont has not committed to reducing its emissions to 1990 levels by 2010. Vermont does not have an updated accounting of its greenhous gas emissions. (The most recent year for which official data are available is 1990.)\To be sure, Vermont has taken some actions. Like most other New England states, Vermont has moved to improve the fuel efficiency of its state fleet and to upgrade the energy efficiency of state buildings and other operations of state government. Like most other New England states, it has adopted California's stricter tailpipe-emission standards for newer cars, and has signaled its intent to sign on to a new California standard that aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in new cars. Vermont has added bus lines in the northwestern part of the state, and like other states, has encouraged forms of ride sharing and alternative transit.\None of these measures has made a significant dent in Vermont's greenhouse gas emissions. State government accounts for less than 3 percent of Vermont's total emissions. Public transit and ride-sharing programs are used by a tiny fraction of the state's commuters. The new California emission standard would not go into effect until the 2009 model year.\Vermont's total emissions in 2001 were 23 percent higher than in 1990, according to an analysis released earlier this year by the New England Climate Coalition, which includes state Public Interest Research Groups and other environmental-advocacy organizations. Indeed, when it comes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, Vermont might face a tougher challenge than any of its New England counterparts.\That's because Vermont is the only state in the region whose emissions come primarily from cars. Officials working on climate-change policy in other states acknowledge that emissions from cars might be the toughest to contain -- tougher than those from industry, commerce or electric utilities.\Vermont's total Vehicle Miles Traveled increased 35 percent from 1990 to 2003, according to the state's statistics. As late as August, as gas prices rose, people in Vermont were driving about as much as before: Gas tax receipts for that month were down 1 percent from August the previous year; diesel tax receipts were up.\Halfway through the decade that was supposed to put a regional curb on climate-changing emissions, Vermont's primary challenge -- transportation -- is one that the state has barely begun to confront.\The regional initiative\Four years ago, not long after the United States refused to sign an international treaty to cut emissions, New England governors and Eastern Canadian premiers decided to take matters into their own hands.\In August 2001, they adopted a ""Climate Change Action Plan"" that established regional goals and set forth a framework for achieving them.\The short-term goal was to reduce the region's emissions to 1990 levels by 2010. Each state or province was to develop its own plan for making reductions.\Four states -- Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts and Rhode Island -- have drawn up climate action plans that commit to that goal at the state level. Officials in some of those states say they have a shot at attaining the goal, or at least coming close.\Vermont and New Hampshire have agreed only to work toward the regional goal.\When a bill in the Vermont House (H.49) was introduced this past session to establish that same 2010 emissions goal for the state, Jeffrey Wennberg, commissioner of environmental conservation, and Tom Torti, secretary of the Agency of Natural Resources, both took issue with the bill during hearings before the House Natural Resources and Energy Committee, asking the panel to defer action until next year. (The bill remains in committee.) Wennberg said that the goal would be ""exceedingly difficult to achieve,"" a ""far more difficult task"" in Vermont than in the other states or provinces.\Why more difficult in Vermont? In part because such a large share of Vermont's emissions come from transportation. All the other states have large fossil-fuel burning power plants, and most have bigger industrial and commercial sectors. Most of the electricity Vermont consumes is produced by non-emitting power generators, nuclear and hydro. So, Vermont's greenhouse gas emissions from the electrical sector are negligible, ""the envy of the nation,"" according to Wennberg.\As John Sayles, director of policy research and planning in the Agency of Natural Resources, put it recently, in discussing the challenge of reducing emissions: ""There's low-hanging fruit in other states"" -- for example, you can put a scrubber on a power plant to cut down on some emissions. Vermont has no ""low-hanging fruit,"" he said -- you can't put a scrubber on several hundred thousand cars.\The bill, which according to its principal sponsor, Rep. Steven Maier, D-Middlebury, was inspired by the regional plan, called among other things for Vermont to develop its own climate-action plan and its own inventory of greenhouse gas emissions.\Torti told the committee that the Agency of Natural Resources could not afford to do all the work the bill called for.\""We don't have the resources to do all the environmental work we're supposed to do now,"" Torti said. Wennberg said the bill provided no resources for a task that would likely require additional employees and hundreds of thousands of dollars.\Yet this is a financial commitment that other states have chosen to make. Detailed, comprehensive climate-action plans in Connecticut, Maine and Rhode Island have been hammered out over the past three years. Rhode Island's cost about $200,000; Maine's, about $250,000; Connecticut's, about $500,000. How did Connecticut come up with that kind of money, on top of all its other environmental regulatory responsibilities?\""It's a matter of deciding what your priorities are,"" said Chris James, director or air planning in the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection.\Vermont's priority has been to promote efficiencies in state government, following executive orders in 2002 and 2003 by Govs. Dean and Douglas, and this year, a detailed report drawn up by the Climate Neutral Working Group, a committee of state-agency representatives.\The regional plan calls state-government initiatives ""leading by example,"" and most of New England's state governments have sought to do so -- adding hybrid cars to state fleets, making state buildings more energy-efficient. (Vermont's state government accounted for about 2.2 percent of the state's total carbon dioxide emissions in 1990, according to the Agency of Natural Resources.)\Vermont also participates in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a cooperative effort of nine Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states to discuss the design of a regional ""cap-and-trade program"" covering carbon dioxide emissions. The program would apply just to electric power and not to Vermont's biggest greenhouse-gas bugaboo, transportation.\As for a statewide climate-action plan, Vermont will have one, and it will be funded, Wennberg said last week. He declined to specify a timetable for developing the plan. ""It's going to be announced in the near future,"" he said.\Coming to grips with transportation\Vermont's total greenhouse gas emissions -- and the population that produces them -- are smaller than those of any other New England state.\Wennberg told the House committee that Vermont's emissions per capita were lower than for any other state in the region. (That's in part because each of the other states, unlike Vermont, has fossil-fuel burning power plants that account for about a quarter of total emissions.) Even if Vermont cut its emissions to zero, this reduction would have a negligible effect on the global greenhouse gas problem.\Does all of this mean that Vermont can ignore its rising greenhouse gas emissions?\If Vermont's emissions continue to go up, then for the regional goal to be reached, other states or provinces will have to compensate by cutting their emissions even more than they otherwise would. Moreover, the nature of the emissions problems vary from state to state, but each state is committed to working on its unique situation.\Only in Vermont does transportation account for more than half the carbon dioxide problem.\Compounding Vermont's transportation challenge are recent trends in the U.S. auto industry. Over the last 20 years, according to a study of cars and light trucks by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the thrust of technological innovation has been to increase vehicles' weight, power and acceleration. Average fuel economy hasn't improved significantly since about 1990. In other words, people have been buying bigger and more powerful vehicles, without regard for better gas mileage.\Why does this matter? ""Fuel economy is directly related to emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide,"" states the EPA. The more miles per gallon your car gets, the less carbon dioxide it gives out for each mile you drive.\Other states in New England are working on transportation measures that have yet to receive serious consideration in Vermont, among them:\Incentive to buy hybrids: Gas-electric hybrids are more fuel-efficient, and thus lower emitters. Connecticut dropped the sales tax on hybrids last year. A bill to do that was introduced in Vermont House in the spring, but it didn't get a hearing in the Transportation Committee.\In any case, hybrids are a small part of any solution. Of the 423,724 ""pleasure cars"" registered with the Vermont Department of Motor Vehicles, 1,150 are hybrids -- less than half of 1 percent.

These increases have enhanced the heat-trapping capacity of Earth's atmosphere.""\Combustion of fossil fuels and other human activities are the primary reason for the increased concentration of carbon dioxide, scientists believe.

The Obama administration's proposed crackdown on carbon emissions cited Vermont's environmental policies as an example of how coal states can achieve necessary greenhouse gas reductions.
\
The Environmental Protection Agency on Monday released details of a proposed regulation requiring states to come up with a plan to collectively cut the nation's carbon emissions by 30 percent of 2005 levels by 2030.
\
Vermont does not generate electricity from coal and is the only state not required to come up with a plan (the District of Columbia is also exempt). The ruling targets coal-powered electric plants that are the nation's leading source of carbon emissions, but it is intended to give states flexibility to find ways to cut carbon emissions.
\
The ruling cites Vermont's energy efficiency program as an example of how states can reduce carbon emissions. The state's regulated efficiency utility, Efficiency Vermont, offers rebates and incentives for energy-efficient appliances, among other efforts.
\
""Vermont is leading the way,"" said Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., a member of the Senate environment and energy committees. ""I congratulate Efficiency Vermont for being cited as a national model and for other efforts underway in Vermont to address global warming.""
\
The utility in 2013 cut Vermont's electricity sales by about 1.6 percent, which represents about $12 million in retail value, according to an Efficiency Vermont report.
\
Rep. Peter Welch, D-Vt., said he was pleased that Vermont's efficiency program was mentioned as a way to cut carbon emissions.
\
""Vermont has led the nation on energy efficiency and is reaping the benefits of lower electric bills, good jobs and a cleaner environment,"" Welch said in a statement.
\
Gov. Peter Shumlin said Vermont has already ""faced several emergency-level storms that are proof of a changing climate."" In the Northeast, climate change is causing ""increases in heavy precipitation and resulting damages to property and infrastructure, heat waves that threaten public health, and stresses placed on our unique ecosystems,"" he said in a statement.
\
Among a menu of possible options cited by the EPA to cut emissions is a Northeast carbon cap-and-trade program, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). Vermont has earned more than $12 million by selling so-called carbon allowances since joining the program in 2009. The state uses 98 percent of this money for thermal efficiency incentives.
\
Shumlin said the EPA ruling ""points the nation in the same direction Vermont and our neighbors have already pursued"" through the RGGI program.
\
Democratic candidates in Pennsylvania's gubernatorial race have announced their plan to join RGGI as part of their environmental platform. The EPA's ruling will make it more likely that Pennsylvania, which generate the most power from coal in the Northeast, will join the program.
\
Deputy Secretary of Natural Resources Justin Johnson represents Vermont on the RGGI board. He said other states joining the program will only make it stronger.
\
""There will be more allowances. There would be more people looking to use them. It would make it a stronger market,"" Johnson said.
\
The program works by setting a ""cap"" on carbon emissions for the region. States ""trade"" credits at a value placed on each ton of carbon the region emits. As the region brings down its cap, the price to purchase these credits goes up.
\
The nine states partcipate in RGGI are: Vermont, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York and Rhode Island.
\
Johnson said if a new state were to join the program, the board would have to adjust the region's emission cap and reset how fast it plans to bring the cap down.
\
Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., applauded the EPA's ruling as an important ""step"" to combat climate changes caused by heat-trapping carbon emissions. He said the long overdue limits on carbon pollution will be good for future generations.
\
""This historic step is not based on theory but on sound science and long experience with the effects of this major, unchecked source of pollution in communities across the nation,"" Leahy said in a statement. ""This is tangible progress in turning the corner toward a healthier and more sustainable clean energy economy.""

BENNINGTON -- A leaner form of a home retrofitting program introduced in Congress by Rep. Peter Welch is now a cornerstone of a strategy aimed at putting Americans back to work that was outlined Tuesday by President Barack Obama.
\
Energy proposal
\
The president said Tuesday he is seeking a program to provide Americans with rebates for completing home improvement projects that make homes more energy efficient.
\
Such a program will create jobs while improving the environment, Obama said in an economic speech delivered at the Brookings Institution.
\
""I'm calling on Congress to consider a new program to provide incentives for consumers who retrofit their homes to become more energy-efficient, which we know creates jobs, saves money for families and reduces the pollution that threatens our environment,"" Obama said.
\
The retrofitting plan is one part of a three-pronged approach the president announced to lift the nation out of a prolonged recession and curb monthly job losses that at one point was the ""equivalent to the population of the state of Vermont,"" according to Obama.
\
A more involved retrofitting plan is already part of a bill approved by the U.S. House this past summer. Welch, D-Vt., introduced the Retrofit for Energy and Environmental Performance (REEP) program in March. It was passed by the House in July as part of the American Clean Energy and Security Act, a sweeping climate change bill that includes a ""cap and trade"" plan. The REEP provision was added to a Senate version of the bill, but it has since stalled in the Senate.
\
Welch's REEP plan, based on an existing program in Vermont, seeks to increase building efficiency by 20 percent nationwide. The program would provide cash incentives to homeowners and businesses to retrofit existing buildings.
\
""Vermont's played a big role in this because basically I'm just advocating for the efficiency program we've had in place since 2000,"" Welch said in a telephone interview Tuesday.
\
He urged implementation of REEP through the fall, penning a memo to the White House in October, and gathering a group of 44 House members who signed onto the idea. In recent months, Welch has been working with White House officials, including Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel, to develop a more targeted program based on REEP that will encourage job-growth in the short-term.
\
""Like the rest of us around here, I knew there was going to be a jobs bill, so I was lobbying for it,"" Welch said.
\
Availble to homeowners
\
That plan, which would be available only to homeowners, includes a ""prescriptive"" segment that would offer a rebate for about 10 common upgrades a homeowner can do to improve efficiency. A second ""performance"" segment would provide additional rebates based on energy savings benchmarks that are met.
\
Welch said the idea has a ""broad coalition of support"" because of its benefits, including boosting local jobs, energy savings for homeowners and reducing the country's carbon footprint.
\
Details about how Obama would fund such a program were not included in his speech. Senior administration officials said in conference call with reporters Tuesday that some elements of the job growth plan would likely utilize bank bailout money from the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, that has been repaid to the Treasury.
\
The administration officials argued that more money from the TARP program is being returned to the Treasury than previously expected. That money can be used to create jobs and lower the deficit, an important task the president is ""very cognizant of,"" they said.
\
Welch said the plan he is working on with the White House would create 600,000 to 850,000 jobs and cost $20 billion over two years. It would help Americans save about $3.3 billion in energy costs, he said.
\
However, Welch said he would prefer the plan be funded with money from the already approved stimulus plan.
\
""My preference is to use unallocated stimulus money. That's my preference, but obviously I'll work with my colleagues and the White house to get something done,"" he said.
\
Welch said he will continue to work on crafting language for the retrofit program, along with other members of an environmental caucus in the House. The legislation has ""a long way to go,"" but inclusion in the president's plan is ""extremely helpful,"" he said.
\
""I don't care whether it's my language or someone else's as long as we get it done,"" he said.

43,"Here's the recipe for delivering an unwelcome dose of airborne mercury to northern Vermont:\Let a mass of air stagnate for hours or days over a coal-fired power plant in Ohio or Pennsylvania. Then let the wind quicken, zipping that air across New York state to the Green Mountains.\When that happens, air samplers at the Proctor Maple Research Center in Underhill show a spike in airborne mercury, according to new data collected by Eric Miller of the Ecosystems Research Group in Norwich.\What's so surprising about that?\The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says it shouldn't happen.\Coal-fired plants emit 48 tons of mercury a year, about 40 percent of the man-made airborne mercury generated in the United States. Nevertheless, the computer models the EPA relied on in writing new emissions-control rules predicted that no mercury from Midwestern power plants would end up deposited in Vermont.\""They show a zero for the effect of power plants on mercury deposition in Vermont,"" Miller said last week. ""Their model world doesn't jibe with the real world we are measuring.""\Miller's findings matter because Vermont and other states are pressing the Bush administration for tougher mercury controls on power plants. That's because mercury in its toxic form, methylmercury, accumulates in the environment -- particularly in the tissue of fish such as walleye, lake trout and smallmouth bass, favorites of anglers and diners.\Too much exposure to methylmercury can cause neurological damage; fetuses and small children particularly are at risk. The Vermont Health Department warns pregnant women and small children to avoid eating any walleye and large lake trout and to severely limit meals of several other kinds of fish.\Shifting the risk\Miller presented his findings at a recent conference of the Lake Champlain Research Consortium, a group of scientists who study issues important in the Champlain Basin.\Total mercury emissions in theUnited States have dropped 45 percent since 1990, he told the conference, but almost none of that decrease came from power plants.\""What is driving mercury deposition in our region is these utility boilers,"" he said, flashing slides that showed the path of air currents on days when airborne mercury spiked in Underhill.\The worst day of his sampling, he said, was Aug. 31, 2005, when the air over Vermont had sat over coal-fired plants in Pennsylvania on the previous days.\Vermont and other northeastern states want the EPA to require steep cuts in mercury emissions from specific power plants. Instead, the EPA proposed a system that set emissions caps, then allowed plants emitting less than the cap to sell the remainder to plants that exceed the standard -- a system known as ""cap-and-trade.""\For example, a power plant in the far West could reduce its mercury pollution and sell some of its right-to-pollute to a power plant closer to Vermont that can't meet the cap.\""The New England states don't want to allow trading because all you do is shift the risk from one person to another,"" said Dick Valentinetti, director of the state's Air Quality Division.\Finding the source\EPA justified its approach, in part, by arguing that most of the mercury deposited in the United States comes not from power plants but from other sources outside the country. Miller's is one of several studies that challenge the EPA's theory.\""If we want to address trying to lower the amount of mercury getting into our environment, we have to have an accurate understanding of the sources responsible,"" Miller said.\""The EPA has one vision of the sources, which is not power plants but global background sources, places like China, as being the biggest source of mercury for our region. Our analysis is that the largest source is the power plants,"" he said.\Valentinetti said studies like Miller's are important.\""Absolutely this will be useful. This is showing where some of the models being used aren't adequate to demonstrate the extent of the problem,"" he said.\Contact Candace Page at 660-1865 or cpage@bfp.burlingtonfreepress .com"

The utility in 2013 cut Vermont's electricity sales by about 1.6 percent, which represents about $12 million in retail value, according to an Efficiency Vermont report.
\
Rep. Peter Welch, D-Vt., said he was pleased that Vermont's efficiency program was mentioned as a way to cut carbon emissions.
\
""Vermont has led the nation on energy efficiency and is reaping the benefits of lower electric bills, good jobs and a cleaner environment,"" Welch said in a statement.
\
Gov. Peter Shumlin said Vermont has already ""faced several emergency-level storms that are proof of a changing climate."" In the Northeast, climate change is causing ""increases in heavy precipitation and resulting damages to property and infrastructure, heat waves that threaten public health, and stresses placed on our unique ecosystems,"" he said in a statement.
\
Among a menu of possible options cited by the EPA to cut emissions is a Northeast carbon cap-and-trade program, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). Vermont has earned more than $12 million by selling so-called carbon allowances since joining the program in 2009. The state uses 98 percent of this money for thermal efficiency incentives.
\
Shumlin said the EPA ruling ""points the nation in the same direction Vermont and our neighbors have already pursued"" through the RGGI program.
\
Democratic candidates in Pennsylvania's gubernatorial race have announced their plan to join RGGI as part of their environmental platform. The EPA's ruling will make it more likely that Pennsylvania, which generate the most power from coal in the Northeast, will join the program.
\
Deputy Secretary of Natural Resources Justin Johnson represents Vermont on the RGGI board. He said other states joining the program will only make it stronger.
\
""There will be more allowances. There would be more people looking to use them. It would make it a stronger market,"" Johnson said.
\
The program works by setting a ""cap"" on carbon emissions for the region. States ""trade"" credits at a value placed on each ton of carbon the region emits. As the region brings down its cap, the price to purchase these credits goes up.
\
The nine states partcipate in RGGI are: Vermont, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York and Rhode Island.
\
Johnson said if a new state were to join the program, the board would have to adjust the region's emission cap and reset how fast it plans to bring the cap down.
\
Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., applauded the EPA's ruling as an important ""step"" to combat climate changes caused by heat-trapping carbon emissions. He said the long overdue limits on carbon pollution will be good for future generations.
\
""This historic step is not based on theory but on sound science and long experience with the effects of this major, unchecked source of pollution in communities across the nation,"" Leahy said in a statement. ""This is tangible progress in turning the corner toward a healthier and more sustainable clean energy economy.""

"
45,"WASHINGTON -- Bernie Sanders is facing his first big legislative dilemma since becoming Vermont's junior senator in January.\Sanders, an independent, introduced legislation this year that environmentalists hailed as the strongest and best legislation to reduce global warming. But his bill, which would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent by 2050, is not the one the Senate is poised to take up.\A less ambitious compromise bill by Sens. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., and John Warner, R-Va., is slated for a vote by the global warming subcommittee of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee as early as Thursday. The bill would reduce global warming emissions 50 percent to 60 percent by 2050, falling short of the 80 percent reduction that scientists say must be reached to prevent catastrophic climate change by the middle of this century.\Sanders must decide whether to help pass the bill or fight it, knowing that it might be the only major global warming legislation that has a real chance to pass the full Senate this session.\Sanders' bill, which has 18 co-sponsors, including all the Democratic senators running for president, is considered unpalatable to most Republicans and some conservative Democrats, who fear it would increase energy costs and hurt the economy.\The Vermonter, who wields clout as a member of the global warming subcommittee, said he has major concerns about the Lieberman-Warner legislation and will work with the senators to try to strengthen the bill enough that he can support it.\""I've got half my staff working on this right now,"" Sanders said in an interview from Capitol Hill. ""Our goal is to get a bill that can significantly reduce global warming in the quickest time possible.""\Sanders said he is less likely to compromise on this legislation than on other bills because so much is at stake. His vote could be key because only three of the subcommittee's seven members -- Lieberman, Warner and Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont. -- have announced their intention to vote for the bill.\""A lot of the politics around here comes down to something like this: I want to spend $100 million on a program, you want to spend $50 million, and we compromise at $75 million,"" Sanders said. ""That's the way business is done, and there's nothing wrong with it.\""But global warming doesn't come down to what you want versus what I want,"" Sanders said. ""It comes down to physics and chemistry. Scientists are telling us that global warming is already causing us significant problems and, if we don't take bold action, the planet could suffer catastrophic problems impacting billions of people. So if we end up with a compromise that doesn't solve the problem, then what's the sense?""\Sanders won't say what changes it will take to persuade him to support the Lieberman-Warner bill.\""If I tell you that, I won't have any leverage in the negotiations,"" he said.\The senator did outline some of his major problems with the bill. They include:\Timelines. Sanders wants the bill to make deeper, faster cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, slashing them by at least 15 percent by 2020 and 80 percent by 2050. Current estimates say the bill would cut emissions 10 percent to 15 percent by 2020 and up to 63 percent by 2050.\Cap and trade plan. The bill sets an overall limit or cap on emissions and then allows companies to come up with ways to meet the goals. Companies could use ""offsets"" to claim a reduction of up to 15 percent in their global warming emissions. That means a power plant could get credit for investing in a cleaner plant somewhere else, including another country. Sanders worries that these foreign offsets could be difficult to verify.\Coal subsidies. Sanders believes that subsidies to help the coal industry -- a major contributor to global warming -- develop cleaner technology could be better used to promote energy efficiency programs that reduce the use of fossil fuels.\Environmental groups say they are depending on Sanders to push hard for a stronger bill.\""Sanders has a critical role to play,"" said Emily Figdor of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. ""We're counting on him to make sure this bill is going to be strong enough to protect future generations.""\Sanders knows the Lieberman-Warner bill faces an uphill battle, even in its current form. With the exception of Warner, Republicans on the environment committee appear poised to vote against the bill because they believe it will increase energy costs and drive cheap, coal-fired power plants out of business.\""It appears that no analysis of the massive impacts that this bill will impose on the U.S. economy has been conducted,"" said Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., the panel's top Republican and a leading skeptic of global warming. ""I fear the bill is all pain and no gain.""\Although Republicans are in the minority in the Senate, they have enough votes to filibuster a global warming bill to death if it reaches the Senate floor. President Bush also has opposed mandatory reductions in global warming emissions, preferring a voluntary approach that scientists say has failed.\""We've got some very formidable political hurdles in front of us,"" Sanders said. ""Having said that, we are beginning to take some important steps forward. We can't give up.""\Contact Erin Kelly at ekelly@gns.gannett .com."

Saturday, May 9 WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration, which promised a sharp break from the Bush White House on global warming, declared Friday it would stick with a Bush-era policy against expanding protection for climate-threatened polar bears and ruled out a broad new attack on greenhouse gases.
\
To the dismay of environmentalists, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar refused to rescind a Bush administration rule that says actions that threaten the polar bear's survival cannot be considered when safeguarding the iconic mammal if they occur outside the bear's Arctic home.
\
The rule was aimed at heading off the possibility that the bear's survival could be cited by opponents of power plants and other facilities that produce carbon dioxide, a leading pollutant blamed for global warming.
\
The Endangered Species Act requires that a threatened or endangered species must have its habitat protected. Environmentalists say that in the case of the polar bear, the biggest threat comes from pollution -- mainly carbon dioxide from faraway power plants, factories and cars -- that is warming the Earth and melting Arctic sea ice.
\
Salazar agreed that global warming was ""the single greatest threat"" to the bear's survival, but disagreed that the federal law protecting animals, plants and fish should be used to address climate change.
\
""The Endangered Species Act is not the appropriate tool for us to deal with what is a global issue, and that is the issue of global warming,"" said Salazar, echoing much the same view of his Republican predecessor, Dirk Kempthorne, who had declared the polar bear officially threatened and in need of protection under the federal species law.
\
Kempthorne at the same time issued the ""special rule"" that limited the scope of the bear's protection to actions within its Arctic home.
\
The iconic polar bear -- some 25,000 of the mammals can be found across the Arctic region from Alaska to Greenland -- has become a symbol of the potential ravages of climate change. Scientists say while the bear population has more than doubled since the 1960s, as many as 15,000 could be lost in the coming decades because of the loss of Arctic sea ice, a key element of its habitat.
\
Environmentalists and some members of Congress had strongly urged Salazar to rescind the Bush regulation, arguing the bear is not being given the full protection required under the species law.
\
Others, including most of the business community, argue that making the bear a reason for curtailing greenhouse gases thousands of miles from its home would cause economic chaos.
\
Reaction to Salazar's decision Friday was sharply divided.
\
Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin hailed the decision as a ""clear victory for Alaska"" because it removes the link between bear protection and climate change and should help North Slope oil and gas development. Both of Alaska's senators and its only House member also praised the decision and rejected claims the bear won't be protected.
\
Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma, a global warming skeptic and the ranking Republican on the Senate Environment Committee, applauded Salazar ""for making the right call and applying a commonsense approach to the Endangered Species Act"" and climate.
\
But environmentalists and some of their leading advocates in Congress were disappointed.
\
""The polar bear is threatened, and we need to act,"" said Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., who chairs the environment panel, adding that she disagreed with Salazar's decision not to revoke the Bush regulation.
\
Andrew Wetzler, director of wildlife conservation at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the Endangered Species Act should be part of the government's arsenal in fighting climate change ""and it shouldn't be unilaterally disarming itself for no reason.""
\
""For Salazar to adopt Bush's polar bear extinction plan is confirming the worst fears of his tenure as secretary of interior,"" said Noah Greenwald, of the Center for Biological Diversity, which along with the NRDC and Greenpeace has a lawsuit pending challenging the bear rule.
\
Salazar noted that he has overturned a string of Bush-era regulations, including last week restoring a requirement that agencies consult with the government's most knowledgeable biologists when taking actions that could harm species. ""We must do all we can to protect the polar bear,"" he said, but that using the species protection law ""is not the right way to go.""
\
The way to deal with climate change is a broad cap on greenhouse gases, he said.
\
Congress is considering cap-and-trade legislation forcing a reduction on greenhouse gases, and, separately, the Environmental Protection Agency has begun working on a climate regulation under the Clean Air Act. Last month, the EPA declared carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels and other greenhouse gases a danger to public health.
\
The last word is still to be heard on linking species protection and climate change.
\
Earlier this week, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service began a review of whether the American pika, a tiny rabbit relative living in high altitudes of 10 Western states, is threatened by climate change because the mountain areas are becoming warmer.
\
The American pika is no polar bear, but the arguments may be the same.

47,"
Wednesday, April 29 WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama has not yet achieved the big campaign promises he'll be judged on years from now, on health care, war, the economy and so much more. It's early, it's a colossal load and Rome wasn't built in 100 days.
\
He has delivered, though, on the work ethic he outlined back when his Republican presidential rival challenged him to suspend campaign events and confront the financial crisis. ""You know,"" he said then, ""presidents are going to have to deal with more than one thing at a time.""
\
So he has.
\
Obama has moved ahead on the towering problem of health coverage, succeeding on the first baby steps, and has taken on still big-ticket items that other leaders might have mothballed in perilous times like these.
\
On foreign policy, energy and the environment, Obama the president is trying to do what Obama the candidate promised. No bait and switch here.
\
But he'll be judged on results, not effort.
\
He's broken some promises:
\
--Obama's pledge to change the way Washington works is turning out to be a mix of gimmick, genuine reform and sidelined ambition.
\
--He promised repeatedly not to raise taxes on anyone but the rich, then did, approving a tobacco tax increase that disproportionately hits the poor.
\
His broad directions, though, are rooted in the rhetoric of his change-is-coming campaign.
\
He's winding down the Iraq war, though a little more slowly than promised. He's reached out to adversaries as he said he would, in a stark departure from President George W. Bush's uncompromising world view.
\
A look at Obama's progress on a sampling of his promises:
\
--------
\
THE DEFICIT
\
The promise: ""Every dollar I've proposed, I've proposed an additional cut that it matches."" -- Presidential debate, Oct. 15, 2008.
\
The performance: Obama's contention that his programs would not deepen the deficit was treated with great skepticism in the campaign, even before the financial crisis was in full fury. The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated his policy proposals would add a net $428 billion to the deficit over four years, even accounting for his spending reduction goals. Now, the deficit is nearly quadrupling to $1.75 trillion, and few independent analysts believe he can meet his goal of halving the deficit in five years.
\
------
\
DIPLOMACY
\
The promise: To pursue direct diplomacy with Iran and other hostile governments. Asked in a Democratic debate in 2007 whether he would meet the leaders of Iran, Syria, Venezuela, Cuba and North Korea without conditions during his first year in office, he said: ""I would."" Later in the campaign, Obama hedged on that after being called naive by rival Hillary Rodham Clinton, now his secretary of state. But he stuck to his basic position that the U.S. should engage with unfriendly countries.
\
The performance: Obama has offered dialogue to Tehran, made a video appealing to the Iranian people and included Iran in multinational discussions on Afghanistan, while sticking to his insistence that the Iranians not be permitted to develop nuclear weapons.
\
And Obama -- without conditions -- crossed a room at the Summit of the Americas to shake the hand of Hugo Chavez, the fiercely anti-American leader of Venezuela, and chat briefly.
\
The promise: ""There are no better ambassadors for freedom than Cuban-Americans. That's why I will immediately allow unlimited family travel and remittances to the island."" -- May 23, 2008, speech, Miami.
\
The performance: This month, Obama delivered on the promise by announcing he will allow Cuban-Americans to visit families in Cuba and send money to them. He also opened possibilities for telecommunications cooperation between the two countries while honoring his pledge to keep the trade embargo largely intact until Havana allows more freedom.
\
------
\
EDUCATION
\
The promise: ""Obama will fund No Child Left Behind and improve its assessments and accountability systems."" -- Obama's ""Blueprint for Change"" platform.
\
The performance: The economic stimulus bill signed Feb. 17 includes $25 billion for education improvements, including No Child Left Behind.
\
The promise: ""When I'm president, we'll fight to make sure we're once again first in the world when it comes to high school graduation rates."" -- Dayton, Ohio, Sept. 9, 2008.
\
The performance: This will be a work in progress for a long time. Obama's 2010 budget proposes new spending aimed at keeping at-risk kids in school.
\
------
\
ENERGY-ENVIRONMENT
\
The promise: ""I will set a hard cap on all carbon emissions at a level that scientists say is necessary to curb global warming -- an 80 percent reduction by 2050. To ensure this isn't just talk, I will also commit to interim targets toward this goal in 2020, 2030 and 2040. These reductions will start immediately."" -- Oct. 8, 2007, Manchester, N.H.
\
The performance: The president's proposed budget would put the U.S. on his promised path. His administration's declaration that carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse gases ""endanger public health and welfare"" was a stage-setting pronouncement for the long and contentious debate ahead. Prospects are uncertain, as the argument for emission controls tangles with concerns about higher energy costs to consumers arising from Obama's proposed cap-and-trade system.
\
------
\
ETHICS-OPEN GOVERNMENT
\
The promise: ""When you walk into my administration, you will not be able to work on regulations or contracts directly related to your former employer for two years. And when you leave, you will not be able to lobby the administration throughout the remainder of my term in office."" -- Manchester, N.H., June 22, 2007.
\
In November 2007 he said of lobbyists: ""When I am president, they won't find a job in my White House.""
\
The performance: Obama imposed strict rules barring registered lobbyists from working for him for two years after their registrations expire. But once in office he devised a waiver that would allow exceptions for ""uniquely qualified individuals,"" including Raytheon lobbyist William Lynn, Obama's No. 2 Pentagon official.
\
The promise: ""As president, Obama will not sign any nonemergency bill without giving the American public an opportunity to review and comment on the White House Web site for five days."" -- Campaign Web site.
\
The performance: Poor, starting with his first bill, a nonemergency measure giving workers more time to take their pay discrimination cases to court. No more than two days passed before it became law. Only one bill in the first 11 was posted online for five days after it cleared Congress and before Obama signed it, the Cato Institute found.
\
Similar pledges to give the public more insight into decision-making have yet to bear fruit, such as one to disclose all communications between the White House and outside groups concerning regulatory policymaking. Obama is also preserving Bush-era secrecy surrounding dozens of FBI databases containing personal information about Americans and foreigners.
\
On the other hand, Obama strengthened access to government records under the Freedom of Information Act.
\
------
\
HEALTH CARE
\
The promise: ""Obama will expand eligibility for the Medicaid and SCHIP (State Children's Health Insurance) programs and ensure that these programs continue to serve as a critical safety net."" -- Blueprint for Change.
\
The performance: Obama signed an extension of that children's program and provided $87 billion to help states pay for Medicaid in the stimulus package in February.
\
The promise: ""The Obama plan will create a National Health Insurance Exchange to help individuals who wish to purchase a private insurance plan."" -- Blueprint for Change.
\
The performance: No action so far, just meetings.
\
The promise: Obama ""will invest $10 billion a year over the next five years to move the U.S. health care system to broad adoption of standards-based electronic health information systems, including electronic health records."" -- Campaign Web site.
\
The performance: The Feb. 17 stimulus law included $19 billion to modernize health information technology, most of it spread over five years.
\
------
\
HOME OWNERSHIP
\
The promise: ""Obama will create a Foreclosure Prevention Fund to help people facing foreclosure stay in their homes and renegotiate with their lenders or sell their homes."" -- Obama campaign.
\
The performance: Obama delivered on this promise, at a much higher price tag than the $10 billion he proposed before the crisis deepened this year. The cost is $75 billion.
\
------
\
STEM CELL RESEARCH
\
The promise: End a ban on federal financing of research using embryonic stem cell lines created after Aug. 9, 2001. -- Response to a science questionnaire.
\
The performance: Obama eased the restrictions. The proposed guidelines that followed, however, disappointed some scientists by limiting the stem cells available for federally financed research to those from fertility clinic embryos that otherwise would be thrown away. The rules exclude using stem cells from embryos created just for experimentation.
\
------
\
TAXES
\
The promise: ""I will cut taxes -- cut taxes -- for 95 percent of all working families."" -- Denver, Aug. 28, 2008.
\
The performance: The compromise stimulus bill that became law included a tax credit of $800 for couples making up to $150,000, with a phase-out starting at $200,000. The amount was trimmed from the president's original proposal of $1,000 per couple.
\
The promise: ""And I can make a firm pledge: Under my plan, no family making less than $250,000 will see their taxes increase -- not your income taxes, not your payroll taxes, not your capital gains taxes, not any of your taxes."" -- Dover, N.H., Sept. 12, 2008.
\
The performance: The federal excise tax rose by the largest amount ever on April 1 after Obama signed the increase into law. The tax hit tobacco users, who are disproportionately low income.
\
------
\
TERRORISM
\
The promise: ""Barack Obama will end the use of torture without exception."" -- Obama campaign.
\
The performance: Obama signed an order outlawing torture, cruelty and degrading treatment of prisoners; released memos detailing brutal interrogation methods used during the Bush administration and has left open the possibility of prosecuting officials who provided the legal framework for using those tactics.
\
The promise: Close the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detention center. -- Obama campaign.
\
The performance: Obama signed an executive order to close the prison in a year.
\
------
\
WAR
\
The promise: ""I will remove one or two brigades a month, and get all of our combat troops out of Iraq within 16 months."" -- October 2007 and again in the summer and fall 2008 campaign.
\
The performance: Obama is moving to remove combat troops by Aug. 31, 2010, 19 months after he took office.
\
His timetable for withdrawal shifted during the campaign. At one point, in January 2008, he was promising to remove combat troops by the end of this year, 11 months after taking office.
\
The promise: ""As president, I would pursue a new strategy, and begin by providing at least two additional combat brigades (about 7,000 troops) to support our effort in Afghanistan."" -- July 14, 2008.
\
The performance: Obama has ordered 21,000 troops into Afghanistan in an escalation that will bring the U.S. total over 60,000, the most to date.

"
48,"Bill McKibben's first book, ""The End of Nature"" (1989), was in the vanguard of climate-change warnings for a popular audience. Much of McKibben's later writing has focused on related themes.\He has profiled low-emissions lifestyles in Brazil and India. He has challenged the conventional goal of relentless economic growth. He has championed the cause of local food and detailed his experiences as a Vermont localvore.\A scholar in residence at Middlebury College, McKibben is also an activist: Two years ago he founded Step It Up, which staged 1,400 global-warming demonstrations in a single day in April in an effort to press Congress to act on limiting emissions.\As a follow-up he has founded another organization with a wider scope -- the world -- and a more sharply focused message that's compressed into what he calls ""the most important number in the world"" -- 350. By his reckoning, that's the safe upper limit of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, in parts per million.\The current concentration is about 390 and rising, and unless the level is brought down during this century, he believes, excessive temperatures will put the Earth past the tipping point, with melting ice caps, rising sea levels, and devastating new drought and rainfall patterns.\Like Step It Up, McKibben's 350.org expects to nurture and publicize hundreds of anti-global-warming demonstrations on a single day, Oct. 24, all with the aim of imprinting ""350"" on the world's consciousness. The aim is to raise the pressure on the world's leading nations to set meaningful limits on emissions in talks scheduled for December in Copenhagen. Even McKibben admits that's a tall order.\We talked to him recently at his home in Ripton -- which has more than a dozen large solar panels on the roof -- about recent climate-change developments and the 350 campaign: Tim Johnson: What's the latest science telling us about climate change?\Bill McKibben: Basically, all the latest science can be summed up by saying, global warming is way ahead of schedule. We're seeing huge changes with only fairly small increases in temperature -- a little over one degree Fahrenheit, and that's been enough to get the Arctic melting, every glacier in the world melting, changing hydrological cycles in profound ways, so we're seeing much heavier bursts of rainfall than have ever been recorded. The science has gotten very clear about what we need to do. This number that we've been working with, 350, is new. Two years ago, no one knew it was important, but now, probably, it's the most important number in the world. It represents the most carbon we can safely have in the atmosphere.\TJ: Some have said 450.\BM: That was the old hope. But if we're at 390 now, and the Arctic is steadily melting. What does that tell you? Would that it were otherwise. I'd much rather be running 450.org.\TJ: So if we're over the limit, why shouldn't people just throw up their hands?\BM: The Earth will scrub carbon out of the atmosphere. We're filling a bathtub, but the bathtub does have a drain. The problem is now, we're just filling it faster than it can possibly drain. If we stop putting more carbon in ... forests and oceans suck some carbon out of the atmosphere each year and they will continue to. The deep problem is that if we don't stop putting more in soon, then as the temperature rises and those sinks, forests and oceans, become steadily less efficient at removing carbon from the atmosphere. Forests begin to die, and so on. So, we've go to do it soon. That's the problem. It's a real time test. It's not like other social or environmental problems that we're used to dealing with. If we don't get it right soon, we won't get it right.\TJ: So, what about a carbon tax in this country?\BM: I think the important thing is to get a serious cap on carbon that reflects the science. Once that happens, the price of carbon will go up. You saw what happened last summer when the price of gasoline went up. All of a sudden, people discovered that they didn't really need semi-military vehicles to go grocery shopping in, and that was good. ...You can call it a tax, you can call it cap and trade, you can call it cap and dividend. There are a lot of different schemes. The important thing is the cap. I think the best system by far is one that's called cap and dividend, where you basically put a cap on carbon, charge Exxon a lot of money for the right to produce fossil fuels, and then take the money and distribute it as a check to everyone in the country every six months or so. You could raise the price enough to change people's behavior without bankrupting them. Congress hasn't gone down that route. They have a different set of imperatives that involve mostly rewarding large coal-fired utilities that are big campaign contributors.\TJ: Is cap and dividend in place anywhere?\BM: It's actually in place in a few places. British Columbia has scheme like it, working well. It's kind of based on the Alaskan model for what you do with oil revenues. But in any event, the key part is getting the cap, and getting it fast, and it has to be not just national, but global.\TJ: So how do you raise the price without harming poor people in developing countries?\BM: Around the world the key is to provide real assistance in terms of resources and technology to allow countries like China and India to leapfrog the fossil-fuel era and go straight to wind and sun and whatever else. We need the kind of carbon-equivalent of the Marshall Plan, with that same mixture of practicality and idealism. This is the most important problem that we've every faced as a planet. We can't solve it without bringing developing countries on board. We can't tell developing countries, sorry, we've filled up the atmosphere, you think of some other way to prosperity.\TJ: China keeps building new coal-fired power plants.\BM: Well, China's a great enigma, in many ways. I've spent a lot of time there in the last few years. The first thing to realize is what it says about us. So, yeah, the Chinese are adding a coal-fired power plant a week or whatever. The average Chinese person uses one-quarter as much energy as the average American. Another thing to keep in mind is, a large percentage of those coal-fired power plants that go on line are designed to provide electricity to build all the stuff that we've outsourced to China to build for us.\TJ: In ""The End of Nature"" you noted that affluence is an obstacle to reducing emissions, that would be very difficult to change lifestyles. That was 20 years ago. Any reason to think it's less of a problem now?\BM: It's not any less of a problem, and the fact that we've done very little to deal with the climate so far is sort of proof I'm afraid of how difficult in certain ways it is. Two things have changed. One, the climate risk has become so much more obvious. Things are happening so much faster, and on such a larger scale than we thought 20 years ago. And two, to a certain degree, technology has progressed to the point where it's at least possible to sort of imagine some kind of set of solutions. Twenty years ago, we were still talking about solar power with our fingers crossed, .and now it's powering my house\TJ: How much does ""success"" depend on persuading people to change their lifestyles, and how much on persuading political leaders to change policy?\BM: I think at this point the percentage has shifted steeply in the direction of trying to get government action. I've spent the last two or three years trying to build political movements large enough to have some effect on that equation, because it's become very clear as the science has gotten much darker that we're no longer in a position of being able to solve this one light bulb at a time, if we ever were. When we do this thing on Oct. 24, it will be probably the biggest, most widespread geographic day of political action ever on the planet.\TJ: Tell me some of the things that will happen on the 24th.\BM: There will be thousands and thousands of events all designed just to take these three numbers, 3, 5, 0, and drive them into the public imagination. So, there will be big cities around the world will have tens of thousands of people and some of them, in Sydney, Johannesburg, will have people making giant 3s with their bodies. London and Delhi, huge 5s, and Washington .... giant 0s. Like planetary scrabble. We hope CNN will put them together on the evening news. In the Maldives, one of my favorite places on earth, the president, who's a wonderful guy -- of a country that may disappear in the next 50 years -- he's got all his cabinet taking scuba lessons. They're going to have an underwater cabinet meeting on Oct. 24, down on their dying reef, send a resolution to Copenhagen. There'll be, all over the world, farmers cutting 350s into their mowing them into their fields, concerts, bike rides with 350 bike riders, you name it.\TJ: What will you be doing on that day?\BM: I'll be in New York City, where we'll be uploading pictures in real time to our Web site, and flashing them on a giant screen at the U.N. and in Times Square on those video boards. Our goal is to draw attention to what people are doing all over the world, because that's the real fun of it for me. We couldn't have done it even a few years ago. Most of the world doesn't have the Internet, but everybody has a cell phone, and so we figured out how to do this kind of work across cell phones, and it's been very exciting.\TJ: Do you hope to change the minds of people in power?\BM: Yeah, we've already got 92 countries or something that have signed on to this 350 target. They're the smallest, poorest countries in the world. They're not going to sway the negotiations in Copenhagen, but the fact that they're now aggressive for something that will allow the world to survive, that will allow their countries to survive. That's a very powerful part of this. I think more what will happen is, that we'll change the frame of reference for this debate. We're not going to get a great agreement out of Copenhagen, I don't think, but clearly we're changing the game some already, and we'll keep trying. Most of the big, credible thinkers about climate, beginning with Al Gore, and then more recently. the other person to win a Nobel prize, Rajendra Pachauri (chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), have backed this 350 number, which was difficult for them to do. It's radical in a sense. It upsets the apple cart of international negotiations ...\TJ: Because it's lower ... ?\BM: It's lower than people want to go.\TJ: But the emissions have gone up every year.\BM: Until last year. The recession seems to have actually cut carbon emissions in this country, and probably around the world, which illustrates the problem. In a world as fixated as ours is on constant growth, it's very hard to have that constant growth without some growth in the amount of fossil fuel you're using.\TJ: One of the words you used in that first book was humility. It seemed to be a pretty important quality necessary to lower emissions.\BM: Absolutely.\TJ: Perhaps you've got to have people leading the way, pointing toward lives of greater humility.\BM: Look, I don't know if you have to have people leading the way. You have to set up the structure, a set of conditions. Here's how all these things fit together. There's a hopeful scenario that goes like this: We reach some kind of global agreement to start taking seriously the biggest problem we face. We cap carbon and put a real price on it. So that does a couple of things. One, directly, you begin to use less fossil fuels, emissions go down, and you start to get things a little more under control. But the other thing it does is change the conditions under which the world economy operates. So, for instance, we ship food 5,000 miles at a crack, because we have cheap fossil fuel to let us do it. The day we don't have cheap fossil fuel any more is the day that, for Vermonters, Vermont food becomes not just delicious, but obvious, because it's no longer competing with something that's being subsidized by the endless destruction of the environment.\TJ: What would you like to see from the Obama administration?\BM: I'd like to see a little more effort at actually communicating and educating. These guys know how to campaign. That's what we need. This is the biggest problem we've ever faced, and it's not some future problem. It's breaking on us right now. This is the one that will define his and everybody else's legacy.\TJ: What does Vermont need to do most in terms of reducing emissions that it's not doing?\BM: Right now, our electricity is low carb, but it's probably not going to be that way much longer, and as far as I can tell, Montpelier is not exactly planning for that contingency. I think the things that Vermont can do, one would be rapid, real deep powerful encouragement of renewable development. Rapid promotion of local food. It's amazing how much we've gotten done both with renewable energy and local food in this state with almost no help from Montpelier. Our Achilles heel is going to be transportation. I don't see any substitute for trying to, hard as it is, bring trains back in a serious way. There was a period of time in a much poorer Vermont, where one could take a train anywhere in the state, and take it regularly and easily. There's got to be a way to make that happen now.\TJ: Local food -- you mean infrastructure?\BM: Absolutely . We need more slaughterhouses, canneries, all the things that used to be all over the place. I spent a year eating nothing but food from the Champlain Valley. You can do it, but it was harder than it should have been, and there were some things that were essentially impossible.. There's nobody in the state of Vermont processing oats any more.\TJ: Could Vermont feed itself?\BM: I think the answer to that question is incredibly positive. I think inside of a growing season we could be feeding ourselves. Our agricultural policy has been so slanted toward dairies, and increasingly toward big dairies, and now were in the same kind of export agricultural business that the rest of the country's in, and it's bankrupting farmers and it's pretty obvious that continuing down that road doesn't help. So, why aren't we investing those resources in helping people transition to growing things we want to eat?\TJ: What about energy?\BM: In energy, we're not even near the forefront of states. There are places with much tougher renewable standards going forward. We're really pretty far behind environmentally now. Vermont's notion that it's a really green state rests on things that were done 15 and 20 years ago, and they're no longer particularly innovative or unusual. Some of the Sunbelt states, places like Mississippi., have strong renewable portfolio standards. Texas is installing wind at a really fast rate. So, our idea that we're a particularly environmental place is more in the past than in the present. We could be deeply in the future. We still have the real possibility to emerge again as a leader in a lot of this stuff.\On the Net\-- For information on the 350 campaign and a list of ""Day of Action"" events scheduled for Oct. 24, go to: www.350.org\-- The full text of the paper by NASA scientist James Hansen and nine co-authors, ""Target atmospheric CO2: Where should humanity aim?"" -- http://bit.ly/HansenPaper\-- A detailed discussion of how emissions might be constrained in Third World countries without unduly hampering their economic development: ""The Right to Development in a Climate-Constrained World: The Greenhouse Development Rights Framework,"" a November 2008 report of the Stockholm Environment Institute"" -- http://bit.ly/GDRsFrame\-- ""The IPCC 4th Assessment Report,"" the latest report by the Nobel-prize winning U.N.

49,"Override lax rules\In preparation for a showdown over mercury pollution, Senators Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., and Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, are calling on all senators to stop the Bush administration's rollback of clean air rules.\The two senators issued a letter Wednesday that urges support for a seldom-used resolution to override the administration's weakening of mercury emission standards.\Vermont and other downwind states need a strong voice against the administration's industry-backed plan that would allow power plants to retain their antiquated pollution controls and avoid costly updates.\The rules set out by the Environmental Protection Agency are out of step with scientific studies about mercury's toxicity. The agency's scientists reported finding 630,000 newborns in the United States in a 1999-2000 study had mercury levels above what is considered safe.\Mercury is a neurotoxin that can damage the developing nervous systems of children and fetuses. It has also contaminated lakes and streams across the nation, prompting fish consumption advisories.\The ""resolution of disapproval"" invokes the Congressional Review Act and when it is brought to the Senate next month, it will be only the third time that it has been used to try to override an administration rule, according to a statement from Leahy's office.\The administration's lax mercury emission rules are cause for turning to this tool.\Coal-fired power plants would be exempt from Clean Air Act requirements that up-to-date technology be used to reduce toxic emissions. Under the cap and trade system, the nation's oldest, dirtiest plants could continue polluting with no emission reductions until at least 2018. Plants would benefit from buying and selling pollution credits, and risk creating toxic hot spots in downwind locations.\The health and safety of the American people and protection of the environment must come before the profits of the industry. Senators should join Leahy and Snowe to show their disapproval of a regressive environmental policy."

BENNINGTON -- Vermont Congressman Peter Welch says dozens of Vermont businesses could see a boon from energy legislation the U.S. House is expected to take up on Thursday.
\
The second-term Democrat said the Home Star Energy Retrofit Act will create up to 170,000 jobs across the country in construction, retail and manufacturing.
\
The legislation creates a national energy efficiency retrofit program to provide incentives to homeowners to reduce energy consumption. The bill would offer in-store rebates and incentives for whole-home retrofits, according to Welch, and could improve about three million homes and save $10 billion over a decade.
\
Welch said Monday that the incentive program would boost hardware and other home performance stores throughout Vermont when the in-store rebates take effect. Among the local stores he said could benefit are:
\
* H. Greenberg & Son, Inc. - Bennington
\
* Weatherization Works - Dorset
\
* Friends of the Sun - Manchester Center
\
* R.K. Miles Inc. - Manchester Center
\
* Hand Energy Services - Manchester Center
\
""Home Star will create good jobs for Bennington County's energy contractors, builders and hardware store employees alike. At the same time, it will help homeowners from North Pownal to Manchester Center save money on their utility bills, while moving our country toward energy independence,"" Welch said.
\
The national program is similar to a statewide program in Vermont run by Efficiency Vermont, the first electrical efficiency utility of its kind. Welch, an early supporter of a retrofit incentive program, has lobbied the White House and fellow House members on the issue.
\
A more involved retrofitting plan is already part of a bill approved by the U.S. House last summer. Welch introduced the Retrofit for Energy and Environmental Performance program in March 2009 that passed the House last July as part of the American Clean Energy and Security Act, a sweeping climate change bill that includes a ""cap and trade"" plan. Action has stalled in the Senate, however.
\
President Barack Obama included the incentive program in a plan designed to put Americans back to work while improving the environment.

\
In an effort to keep Vermonters more informed on climate change, the state recently launched a new website, with assistance from the Agency of Natural Resources, which compiles and shares various pieces of information on initiatives being taken around the state to limit greenhouse gas emissions.
\
An ANR official told the Reformer this week that the ""portal"" aimed to inform and collect information people in the state wanted to see. After all, when most of the state's tourism dollars are tied in to the state of the environment -- from sugaring to foliage to skiing -- most Vermonters have a vested interest in seasons changing.
\
That's why it's more than a little disappointing to hear the president announce than the proposal to limit global warming through Congress placing a cap on greenhouse gas emissions has been abandoned.
\
""Cap-and-trade was just one way of skinning the cat; it was not the only way,"" Obama said during a Wednesday news conference. ""I'm going to be looking for other means to address this problem.""
\
According to a report by the Associated Press, legislation which places a limit on heat-trapping greenhouse gases and then allowing companies to buy and sell pollution permits under that ceiling narrowly passed the House last year, but it later stalled in the Senate.
\
Republicans referred to the bill as ""cap-and-tax"" because it would raise energy prices, and then used it as a main talking point during the midterm elections (30 of the bill's supporters were among some 50 House Democrats turned out of office Tuesday).
\
""It's doubtful that you could get the votes to pass that through the House this year or next year or the year after,"" Obama said.
\
In Washington, it appears, new battles will now wage over the Environmental Protection Agency's ability to regulate greenhouse gases.
\
In the meantime, it's at least a little comforting to see various groups around the state continue to carry out projects aimed at limiting emissions.
\
""We wanted to provide information on climate change and give people ideas on what they can do to make a difference,"" Brian Woods, the coordinator of the ANR Climate Change team, told the Reformer. ""It'll be a way to see which direction we are heading. If we show people effective strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we hope others will try new things to see what they can do.""
\
It is hoped the website will become an historic record of Vermont's work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, as well as a catch basin for reports and groups' information.
\
""Climate change is an issue that the world and the nation and the region need to deal with,"" Woods said.
\
We agree. Hopefully other states will follow step with Vermont ... that way, waiting for Washington to actually do something won't be the difference on actually having a future.

Tuesday, June 19 AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) -- Gov. John Baldacci signed legislation Monday that includes Maine in the nation's first regional effort to control greenhouse gas emissions through a cap-and-trade system.
\
Maine joins other states that have already joined the 10-state Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which is intended to reduce pollution from northeastern power plants by 10 percent over a decade through 2018.
\
The law signed by Baldacci requires Maine's six largest power plants to pay for the right to release carbon dioxide, the heat-trapping gas most blamed for global warming.
\
Baldacci said industries that will be affected by the law worked collaboratively with environmentalists and state regulatory officials to write the complex legislation. Baldacci said the regional effort will trigger green energy development, which will be benefit the economy.
\
""Reducing global warming pollution protects our natural treasures for future generations, and it protects our children's future while placing Maine at the forefront of new economic opportunities,"" Baldacci said.
\
""It is critical for Maine to act on greenhouse gas emissions because so much of the state's economy depends on our spectacular natural resources, our forests, fisheries, farms. Even the seasons on which the recreation and tourism economy depend throughout the year are threatened by global warming,"" he governor added.
\
Baldacci said Monday's action is Maine's latest step in addressing greenhouse gases. Maine has reduced greenhouse gas emissions 8 percent since 2002 and is the first state government in the nation to buy 100 percent renewable power for state buildings, he said.
\
The RGGI bill establishes a new energy conservation board and directs up to $25 million in new energy conservation investments, said Michael Stoddard, deputy director of Environment Northeast, a nonprofit advocacy group that supports RGGI.
\
Other RGGI states include Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont.

53,"Vermonters are right to question whom and what the Environmental Protection Agency is protecting with a plan to relax rules on mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants.\The proposal being considered by the federal agency in no way protects Vermont's public health, lakes, rivers and air.\It does, however, guard the interests of industry with huge loopholes that weaken pollution standards for the Midwestern power plants that spew toxic mercury into the air.\This week, Vermont Attorney General William Sorrell joined officials from 10 other states to oppose the EPA's regressive proposal. We must all stand with them in this fight.\Mercury is a neurotoxin that can cause brain damage in children, birth defects and other illnesses. Downwind states like Vermont are seriously affected by mercury deposits from these power plants, which generate 40 percent of the nation's mercury emissions.\Vermont, like all New England states, has a health advisory on a number of fish species sought by anglers. The warnings are targeted at women who are pregnant, planning to get pregnant, or nursing, but the state warns that mercury in fish poses a health risk to all Vermonters.\Since coming into office in 2001, the Bush administration has waged an aggressive campaign to weaken clean air laws to save the power industry billions of dollars on anti-pollution equipment.\The administration decided in December that mercury emissions should be removed from the most stringent regulations of the Clean Air Act that require maximum pollution controls for other toxins such as lead and asbestos.\Under the plan, which has been endorsed by industry, power plants would reduce mercury emissions by 69 percent by 2018, and they could buy their way out of cutting emissions through a cap and trade strategy. This approach would cancel tougher guidelines introduced by the Clinton administration to reduce emissions by 90 percent by 2008.\At the same time the EPA has been touting the less stringent regulations on mercury, it has been releasing disturbing health findings. The agency recently estimated that 630,000 of the 4 million babies born each year might be exposed to dangerous levels of mercury in the womb.\The federal Food and Drug Administration has also issued warnings that high levels of mercury in some fish, including albacore tuna, can be hazardous to the health of children, and pregnant and nursing women.\Vermont's congressional delegation and state officials have not been standing still on this serious issue. Vermont and 13 other states won a lawsuit against the Bush administration in December for trying to ease standards that require utilities and other smokestack plants to install modern anti-pollution equipment whenever they upgrade.\A research group, Abt Associates, recently compared an air quality improvement plan by Sen. James Jeffords, I-Vt., with measures by the Bush administration and a Democratic senator from Delaware and found Jeffords' plan offered significantly more benefits in terms of dollars and human health while costing the industry more money.\This is our air and our water. We cannot let the bottom line of power plants in the Midwest control the environment and public health in Vermont.\Contact EPA Administrator Michael Leavitt at this address: Environmental Protection Agency, Ariel Rios Building, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., N.W. Washington, D.C. 20460. Check the EPA's Web site, www. epa.gov."
54,"As hard as President Bush has pushed to loosen pollution controls on the power industry, Vermont's congressional delegation has fought to tighten them.\Senators Patrick Leahy and Jim Jeffords are in the forefront of a tug of war with the Bush administration over a mercury pollution rollback plan that puts the industry's bottom line ahead of public health. Leahy and Jeffords are at the right end of the rope.\Vermont and other downwind northeastern states are the unfortunate recipients of mercury-laced exhaust from coal-fired power plants in the Midwest. Mercury is a dangerous neurotoxin that can damage the developing nervous systems of children and fetuses. Almost all states, including Vermont, have consumption warnings for fish contaminated with mercury.\Under Bush, the Environmental Protection Agency has moved to a cap and trade system that allows industry to buy and sell pollution credits. Utilities that don't meet the pollution cap could continue polluting by buying credits from other plants that do.\Leahy, with Jeffords as a co-sponsor, led an effort last week to repeal the EPA's regulations that were issued in March to allow market trading in mercury pollution. Leahy turned to the seldom-used Congressional Review Act to force a Senate debate and try to veto the agency's rules. Congress has 60 days to study and potentially reject the regulations. The president can veto, but Congress can counter by overriding the veto.\Leahy, Jeffords and 28 other senators have joined environmentalists to denounce the market trading system as an inadequate and regressive way to deal with mercury pollution. The nation's Clean Air Act and its amendments set up a tough but achievable process to clean up toxic mercury, with each plant being responsible for controlling its emissions of mercury and other toxins.\As Leahy and Jeffords have stressed, under the Bush administration plan, the nation's oldest, dirtiest power plants will be able to continue polluting at least 12 years longer than the Clean Air Act permits. Under that law, mercury controls were to have been in place on all coal-fired power plants by 2008.\Meanwhile, by the EPA's own estimate, the number of newborns at risk of dangerous levels of mercury has increased dramatically to 630,000 of the 4 million babies born in the United States each year.\In the case of polluting power plants, the Bush administration's disregard for human health and the environment has been shameful. Vermont's delegation is providing the leadership this critical issue requires."

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Joe Lieberman riled Democrats last year by criticizing then-presidential candidate Barack Obama. Now the Connecticut independent is helping the president push for a bill to combat global warming.
\
Lieberman's fingerprints have been on every major climate change bill ever considered by the U.S. Senate, and despite his differences with his former party, he is a regular at the weekly meetings of a dozen Democratic senators working to get a bill in shape by the end of September.
\
It's the first time in his 20-year Senate career that he is not a member of the key panel drafting the legislation. He lost his seat on the environment committee when he supported GOP presidential candidate John McCain, a move many view as a punishment for campaigning against the Democrats.
\
""My goal is exactly the same as it's been, but my role is different,"" said Lieberman in an interview with The Associated Press in his Washington office. ""My goal is to help pass a law that will enable the United States to reduce the threat of global warming, and incidentally, make America energy independent, because the two now go together.""
\
Perhaps no one knows more than Lieberman how tough it will be. None of the five global warming bills he has introduced or signed onto since 1998 has been successful.
\
The template for the Senate this year passed the House in late June by the slimmest of margins. Although Lieberman acknowledges that it would reduce global warming, wean the country off foreign oil and boost the economy with clean-energy jobs, he doesn't support it. Neither do many Republicans, or all Democrats.
\
So, as Democratic Sens. Barbara Boxer of California and John Kerry of Massachusetts lead the effort, Lieberman is busy on the sidelines drumming up support for measures -- such as boosting the commitment to nuclear energy -- that he says are necessary to improve the bill's chances.
\
""I assume as I start my work on this that 60 Democrats will not vote for this bill, and therefore we got to get a core group of Republicans,"" said Lieberman, who has counted McCain and then-Sen. Barack Obama as co-sponsors on previous bills. ""And I think we can.""
\
Lieberman still thinks that cap-and-trade is the best way to control global warming emissions. He also says it would raise the money needed to make ""revolutionary investments"" in cleaner forms of energy, and to ""ameliorate some of the pain associated with an enormous societal change"" in how Americans power their homes, vehicles and businesses.
\
This year, however, Lieberman says the odds for passage ""are better than even"" -- thanks to a president who is behind the bill, the House passing global warming legislation for the first time and a looming December deadline for international talks on a new treaty to reduce heat-trapping gases.

Wednesday, March 5 WASHINGTON (AP) -- The head of the Environmental Protection Agency said Tuesday he didn't know of behind-the-scenes efforts by EPA officials to blunt state attempts to reduce mercury emissions from power plants.
\
Those efforts occurred even as the Bush administration argued in court that states are free to enact tougher mercury controls from power plants, The Associated Press reported last month, based on internal EPA documents.
\
Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., questioned EPA Administrator Stephen L. Johnson about the report at a hearing of the Senate Appropriations environment subcommittee.
\
""Has anyone with EPA ever pressured any state against instituting any more restrictive mercury regulation?"" asked Leahy, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee.
\
""I don't recall having any firsthand knowledge of that,"" said Johnson. ""I don't know if they have, no I don't,"" he added.
\
Leahy cautioned Johnson that such pressure on states was inappropriate, and if it did occur, ""then the EPA gave misleading information to the courts, which is an extremely serious matter.""
\
A federal appeals court last month struck down the Bush administration's industry-friendly approach for mercury reduction that allowed plants with excessive smokestack emissions to buy pollution rights from other plants that foul the air less.
\
Internal EPA documents obtained by the advocacy group Environmental Defense show attempts over the past two years to bar state efforts to make their plants drastically cut mercury pollution instead of trading for credits that would let them continue it.
\
Many states did not want their power plants to be able to buy their way out of having to reduce mercury pollution.
\
The push to rein in uncooperative states continued until the eve of the Feb. 8 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit that struck down the EPA's program. A day before that ruling, the White House Office of Management and Budget approved a draft regulation to impose a ""federal implementation plan"" for mercury reduction in states whose mercury control measures did not meet EPA approval.
\
It would have required power plants to comply with the national cap-and-trade provisions, even it that meant ignoring state restrictions.
\
Yet even as the EPA tangled with the states behind the scenes, government lawyers representing the agency were in U.S. District Court in Washington saying states could require more than the federal program. A state restriction on emission allowances ""is not a basis for disapproval"" of its program by the EPA, the court was told.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- President Barack Obama said Friday that opponents of his energy bill are disputing the evidence of global warming in a cynical ploy to undermine efforts to curb pollution and steer the nation to greener energy sources.
\
Obama said some opponents ""make cynical claims that contradict the overwhelming scientific evidence when it comes to climate change -- claims whose only purpose is to defeat or delay the change that we know is necessary.""
\
He also appeared to be taking on chief critics like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and National Association of Manufacturers, though not by name.
\
""There are those who will suggest that moving toward clean energy will destroy our economy, when it's the system we currently have that endangers our prosperity and prevents us from creating millions of new jobs,"" Obama told his audience at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
\
Using familiar refrains from his campaign and his administration as Congress mulls its next move on the climate bill, the speech was designed as a nudge for lawmakers to act on a top priority of the president's.
\
Next week, the Senate environment committee will take up its version of a global warming bill. The legislation would cut greenhouse gases by about 80 percent by 2050 -- as the president called for in his campaign -- and require more domestic energy to come from renewable sources such as wind, solar and hydropower. The House passed a similar bill in June.
\
The two business groups to which Obama alluded oppose reducing emissions by allowing companies to buy and sell permits to pollute, a system known as cap and trade.
\
With work still to be done on health care and deep divisions in Congress over the best approach to climate change, the chances the Senate will pass a climate bill by the end of the year are slim. That means U.S. negotiators are likely to not have firm targets set before 192 nations gather in Copenhagen, Denmark, to hammer out a new treaty to slow global warming.
\
""This should not be a partisan issue,"" Obama said, urging bipartisan answers on a day largely devoted to raising campaign money for fellow Democrats. ""The closer we get, the harder the opposition will fight.""

"
58,"While the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's recently proposed emissions standards for new power plants were controversial, the debate over how to limit the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of the largest source in the country -- existing fossil-fueled power plants -- is of much greater consequence.\Carbon dioxide constituted 84 percent of GHG emissions in 2011. The electric power industry accounted for 33 percent of these GHG emissions, with coal plants leading the way as the worst source of this pollution.\While there has been industry backlash over the recently proposed standards of performance for new power plants, the ""Holy Grail"" to reducing carbon emissions rests with existing coal-fired power plants. The EPA's 2013 power plant rule was just the first step in President Obama's plan to act on ""Power Sector Carbon Pollution Standards,"" and ultimately culminates in EPA-proposed standards for existing power plants in June 2014.\While the scientific imperative and legal authority to act are clear, much less is known about the EPA's plan for existing power plants. Section 111(d) is a seldom-used statutory backstop through which the EPA is empowered to issue standards of performance that the states then implement through EPA-approved plans. Traditionally, the EPA has based its standards of performance on the best system of emissions reductions, but for existing fossil-fueled generation, the unit-specific alternatives are extremely limited when it comes to reducing CO2 emissions. Some believe that the EPA will base its standard on generation efficiency improvements, but this could pose challenges for a large number of units. While industry is often in favor of flexible compliance mechanisms, there is some industry fear that flexibility in compliance could lead to the EPA adopting a more stringent standard.\Although the EPA's proposed standards for new power plants embrace the flexible compliance approach by allowing new sources to phase in the use of clean energy technologies, the plan for existing power plants is uncertain. The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) has proposed to cut existing power plant emissions from 2005 levels by 26 percent in 2020 and by 34 percent by 2025. The NRDC plan would have the EPA set state-specific emissions rates based on the individual percentage of coal- versus gas-fueled generation. The states would then have broad flexibility in meeting the standards through a range of technologies, as well as the ability to invest in new renewables or energy efficiency to earn and trade credits toward compliance. The NRDC proposal would facilitate alternative compliance approaches, such as the cap-and-trade regimes already in place in the Northeast and California, as long as those approaches achieve equal or lower emissions.\Various industry groups have criticized the NRDC plan. For example, the National Climate Coalition, which includes electric generation companies and other industrial giants, has embraced an approach that sets separate performance standards for coal- and gas-fired power plants, but allows the utilities to calculate average emissions across their facilities. The states would have the ability to use market-based mechanisms in achieving overall compliance. Whether the EPA chooses one of those two approaches or something completely different, the Obama administration has set the EPA on a path to finally reduce carbon emissions from existing coal plants. The country can only hope that some combination of market and regulatory forces will end the decades-long reign of king coal as the dominant source of carbon pollution.\Kevin Jones is deputy director and senior fellow for energy technology and policy at Vermont Law School's Institute for Energy and the Environment; Mychal Ozaeta is a JD/MELP '15 candidate."

Wednesday, May 21CONCORD, N.H. - New Hampshire is poised to become the 10th state to participate in a regional effort to cut greenhouse gas emissions.
\
The House voted Wednesday to send Gov. John Lynch legislation to implement the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative known as RGGI, but to revisit the initiative if Congress enacts a federal program. The House next considers changes made to the proposal, especially on how much money would go into a fund to promote energy efficiency.
\
Lynch believes the initiative will help New Hampshire's environment and economy.
\
The bill adds New Hampshire to the other New England states, New York, New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland in a market-based, ""cap and trade"" program to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from the region's power plants.
\
The governors of the 10 states have signed a memorandum of understanding agreeing to the initiative. It is a regional plan, but each state must adopt its own laws and regulations. States in other regions are considering similar plans.
\
Under RGGI, a regional carbon dioxide emissions cap would be put in place for large fossil fuel-fired power plants beginning in 2009. Allowances would be issued equal to the total cap and apportioned to the participating states. Utilities would have to buy enough allowances within three years to cover their emissions. Since the number of allowances is limited by the regional cap, overall emissions are expected to be reduced.
\
The money utilities pay for the allowances would go into a state-regulated fund to improve energy efficiency. Money from the sale of allowances above a certain threshold would go back to electric ratepayers.
\
Critics said RGGI unfairly shifts costs onto ratepayers, especially businesses. Businesses wanted a lower threshold than either the House or Senate propose, while environmental groups wanted a high threshold to build a bigger fund.
\
The House proposed an initial threshold of $12 per ton while the Senate set its 2009 mark at $6 per ton. The House voted to accept the Senate's threshold. Business groups had wanted the mark set at $2 per ton. The threshold rises over time in both versions to 2015. After 2015, all proceeds go into the fund.
\
New Hampshire's cap would be 8.6 million tons per year out of 188 million tons emitted by the 10 states. Affected power plants in New Hampshire would be: Schiller Station in Portsmouth, Newington Station and Newington Energy LLC, both in Newington, Merrimack Station in Bow, and Granite Ridge in Londonderry.
\
Other types of allowances also are part of the plan. For example, capturing methane gas at a landfill also reduces carbon emissions. Also under consideration is using forestry management to reduce carbon emissions through techniques as simple as planting trees.
\
State environmental officials envision a wide range of uses for the money that include cooling and heating efficiencies. For example, money could be used to help insulate homes or to buy wood stoves or more efficient furnaces.
\
New Hampshire's electric users will pay higher rates regardless of New Hampshire participating in RGGI. That's because New Hampshire buys about half its power from a wholesale market whose rates will rise as other states' power producers buy RGGI allowances and pass on the costs to ratepayers.
\
If the state does not join the initiative, electric users would lose the benefit of a share of the allowances going into an energy efficiency fund whose aim is to lower both carbon emissions and energy consumption over time.Critics argue nothing prevents lawmakers from raiding multimillion dollar fund created by the bill to pay for other state spending - which would undo future savings on rates.

Saturday, May 30 President Obama's ""green jobs czar,"" Van Jones, told a group of Vermont business leaders last week that the Green Mountain State is in a unique position to show the rest of the nation how to create a strategy to both lift the nation out of recession and help fight the growing threat of climate change.
\
Jones, who was the keynote speaker at the Vermont Business and Industry EXPO in South Burlington, said the rest of America needs Vermont to maintain its ""pace-car"" reputation for merging entrepreneurial, environmental and social-justice strategies into a forward-looking green economy.
\
""Pound-for-pound, this state is leading the country,"" Jones said.
\
Jones' official title is special adviser of Green Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation for the White House Council on Environmental Quality. He has been busy over the past few years pushing a simple idea: labor, social justice activists, environmentalists, students and faith-based organizations should come together to promote a political, economic and social agenda that boosts the interests of green capital and green technology in a way that spreads the benefits as widely as possible. If they can do this, our nation and our world will be much better off.
\
""For decades, we somehow let our political system give us a false choice: to be concerned about the economic health of our children -- or the physical health of our grandchildren,"" Jones said. ""This administration has changed the terms of that debate.""
\
Vermont has been an early adopter of that idea. Well before President Obama took office, the state joined a regional group doing carbon cap-and-trade. Vermont is part of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a market-based emissions trading system where electric power generators in 10 Northeast states purchase allowances for their CO2 emissions through auctions. The states then invest the proceeds in consumer benefits: energy efficiency, renewable energy and other clean energy technologies.
\
Obama has proposed something similar on a national scale, with the goal of gradually decreasing total allowable carbon emissions and providing an incentive to reduce the use of fossil fuels. ""The clean forms of energy should be the profitable ones,"" Jones said.
\
Efficiency Vermont, a program that Jones got a quick look at during his Vermont visit, is another model for the nation -- an electric utility whose job it is to encourage residential and business customers to use less energy.
\
And the many profitable alternative-energy businesses --such as Hinesburg's NRG Systems and Williston's Earth Turbines -- that have sprung up in Vermont are another sign that green jobs are where the growth is. Both low- and high-tech industries around the country will ultimately benefit when, instead of importing components from Europe or Asia for wind turbines and solar arrays, we are building them in America.
\
This what Jones calls ""The Green Collar Economy,"" which is also the title of his best-selling book on the subject. It is possible to do right by the environment and make the economy grow. But we need to shift our massive government subsidies for coal, petroleum and nuclear power and put some of that money toward wind, solar, hydro and biomass energy.
\
Through a mix of government spending and regulation, we can speed the development of green technology both here and around the world. To do this requires taking on some of the most powerful lobbies and corporations in the country. It would take nothing short of a revolution in how Washington works. If the Obama administration has the political will, Vermont already has the blueprint in place for how to take the first steps toward a greener future.

\
Just like in ""The Wizard of Oz,"" the curtain was torn back and leading proponents of anthropogenic (people-caused) global warming have been caught lying. Called Climategate, the scandal exposes the global warming shysters who are conning the public into a massive restructuring of the global economy, while attempting to silence any dissent.
\
But don't expect to see this in our mainstream media, because they are the spinsters who promote this manipulation of data and propaganda.
\
It all began when an anonymous person hacked into the computers at the University of East Anglia's Climate Research Unit in England, releasing 61 megabytes of confidential files, including 1,079 e-mails and 72 documents onto the Internet. These files are a wealth of information.
\
The most damning indictment of proponents of global warming hysteria is a long series of communications discussing how best to squeeze dissenting scientists out of the peer review process. The e-mails even included fantasies of violence against those who question anthropogenic global warming. These e-mails show disturbing patterns of ""conspiracy, collusion in exaggerating warming data, possibly illegal destruction of embarrassing information, organized resistance to disclosure, manipulation of data, private admissions of flaws in their public claims and much more,"" says Australian Sun's Andrew Bolt.
\
Man-made global warming hysteria has long been fueled by people using junk science, fear and hyperbole to support an agenda that they personally profit from. As they attempt to lead the world into a green revolution, these propagandists are hiding the truth that the average global temperature has fallen since 1998.
\
The leading profiteering propagandist is Al Gore. After losing the presidential election in 2000, Al Gore became the leader of the hysteria movement. However, this ""Eco-Prophet"" has hidden a few inconvenient truths of his own. He just happens to be involved with a venture capital firm that has invested approximately a billion dollars in green companies that stand to make a bundle if Cap-and-Trade becomes law.
\
Reports state that Gore's net worth now stands at $100 million, when it was $2 million when he left politics. He's laughing all the way to the bank.
\
Al Gore has a history of playing loose with the facts. Recently on TV, while discussing geothermal energy, Al Gore made the outrageous claim that ""the interior of the earth is extremely hot, several million degrees."" However, the actual temperature here on earth is between 5,000 and 9,000 degrees. This is a gaffe that if Sarah Palin had made, the media would ridicule as her stupid.
\
Speaking of hypocrisy, Al Gore is a living embodiment of it. As he lectures the world on energy use, and lobbies Congress to regulate productive American companies out of business, Gore consumes more than 20 times more energy than the average American, according to the Tennessee Center for Policy Research. This doesn't count the energy consumption of his jet.
\
Gore's ""Inconvenient Truth"" is full of instances where he plays loose with the facts. A 2007 British court ruled that Gore's film has nine significant refutable errors. These are examples of Gore's scare tactics to induce the public to take radical action (to his financial benefit).
\
Not only is Gore prone to hyperbole, hypocrisy and blatant distortions, he is also a bully. Professor Richard Lindzen of MIT wrote about scientists being ""in the crosshairs"" of Gore, who ""tried to bully"" them into changing ""their views and supporting his climate alarmism."" Lindzen also refers to a failed Gore effort to ""enlist Ted Koppel (then a TV host) in a witch hunt to discredit anti-alarmist scientists.""
\
These propagandists use various tactics. A favorite is to make people feel guilty if they don't jump on the ""green"" bandwagon, and those who do are praised for helping the environment.
\
With the Copenhagen meetings just around the corner, expect to see ""green"" propaganda exponentially increasing. Open your eyes to these manipulators of data and people, who while acting like do-gooders, see great (green as in money) gain.

Thursday, March 22 WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore made an emotional return to Congress Wednesday to plead with lawmakers to fight global warming with moral courage while revealing nothing about whether he'll join the 2008 presidential race.
\
The former vice president is a Democratic favorite for the presidential nomination even though he says he's not running. Fresh off a triumphant Hollywood appearance in which his climate-change documentary, ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" won two Oscars, Gore drew overflow crowds as he testified before House and Senate panels about a ""true planetary emergency.""
\
He said the issue should not be partisan or political, but Gore faced skeptical Republicans who questioned his personal commitment to reducing energy usage and the science behind his film.
\
""You're not just off a little, you're totally wrong,"" said Texas Rep. Joe Barton, the leading Republican on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, as he challenged Gore's conclusion that carbon dioxide emissions cause rising global temperatures. Barton and Gore's exchange grew testy at one point -- Barton demanding that Gore get to the point and Gore responding that he would like time to answer without being interrupted.
\
""Global warming science is uneven and evolving,"" Barton said.
\
Gore insisted that the link is beyond dispute and is the source of broad agreement in the scientific community.
\
""The planet has a fever,"" Gore said. ""If your baby has a fever, you go to the doctor. If the doctor says you need to intervene here, you don't say, 'Well, I read a science fiction novel that told me it's not a problem.' If the crib's on fire, you don't speculate that the baby is flame retardant. You take action.""
\
Gore's congressional testimony marked the first time he had been to Capitol Hill since January 2001, when he was the defeated Democratic presidential nominee still presiding over the Senate in his role as vice president. It comes 20 years after Gore, then a congressman from Tennessee, held the first hearings in Congress on global warming.
\
It also brought him face-to-face with Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, who could have her front-runner status threatened if Gore decided to challenge her for the party nomination. But there was no political fireworks between them at the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee hearing.
\
Clinton said she found some of Gore's ideas ""extremely intriguing"" and asked for more details on proposals such as a carbon-based tax, a cap-and-trade system and a carbon neutral mortgage association.
\
In a day of testimony, Gore first appeared before a joint hearing by two House committees, with his wife, Tipper, sitting behind him and a stack of boxes beside him containing hundreds of thousands of messages asking Congress to act on global warming. Later, he testified before the Senate panel where partisan bickering grew even louder.
\
Republican Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma, who has labeled global warming a hoax, complained that the Democratic leadership gave Gore extra time and advantages not afforded typical witnesses. Inhofe then grilled Gore about his personal energy use at his Tennessee mansion and showed the final frame of Gore's film that read, ""Are you ready to change the way you live?""
\
When Gore tried to respond at length, Inhofe cut him off.
\
Democratic Chairwoman Barbara Boxer kept trying to bring order to the hearing. She told Inhofe he can't control things anymore now that Republicans have lost their majority. ""Elections have consequences, so I make the rules,"" she said, holding up her gavel to cheers from the audience.
\
Gore sighed heavily and proposed that he and Inhofe have breakfast and privately discuss it away from the cameras.

\
Since nuclear power is indispensible to United States' efforts to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and ensure energy security, the nation must maintain a disciplined and sustained policy of reactor construction that proceeds from the firm ground of the national interest.
\
Such a major commitment to nuclear power could halt the continuing buildup of carbon in the atmosphere and reduce the need for imported oil.
\
The nation must first recognize that the climate and energy legislation that the House has approved and will be taken up by the Senate is critically important for America's economic and environmental well-being. Besides providing government loan guarantees for the construction of nuclear plants using new advances in technology, the legislation would promote the use of renewable energy sources (nuclear power can be considered renewable) and energy-efficiency improvements.
\
A cap-and-trade system for controlling carbon emissions would raise the cost of burning fossil fuels and provide a catalyst for the development of clean energy technologies, including carbon capture-and-storage for coal plants.
\
The legislation is not perfect. But it's a good middle ground in that it supports a diverse mix of carbon-free energy sources that are being developed in the United States. Creation of a clean energy bank would provide the loan guarantees and other forms of financing support to ensure that capital flows to nuclear power and its partners, solar and wind. Supply would be more secure, and Americans would gain more from energy production we control.
\
Further, the legislation would help move the entire carbon mitigation process forward. In short, there is nothing to lose and everything to gain.
\
The Senate energy bill includes a clean energy bank provision similar to that passed by the House. Additionally, it has a ""sense-of-the-Senate"" provision that designates nuclear power as essential in a low-carbon energy future. ""Nuclear energy is a strategic technology and should be recognized for providing clean and secure domestic energy and reducing greenhouse emissions,"" the provision states.
\
Importantly, both the House and Senate bills create a role for nuclear power in a renewable electricity standard. The standard would require utilities to generate 15 percent of their electricity from renewable resources by 2021. It exempts new nuclear plants from base-line calculations, acknowledging the role nuclear power plays in reducing carbon emissions.
\
Though the nuclear waste issue is still politically unresolved, the Senate bill calls for storing spent fuel in a limited number of centralized facilities. The fact is, spent fuel can be stored for several hundred years in concrete-and-steel casks, if that becomes necessary.
\
Reprocessing the spent fuel to make new nuclear fuel, as is currently done in France and Great Britain and was once done in the United States, would make a lot more sense than discarding it. Besides extending uranium resources well into the future such recycling would make it possible to convert plutonium into useful energy while reducing the amount of nuclear waste for permanent burial. The Senate bill directs the Department of Energy to expedite the development of a ""proliferation-resistant"" recycling technology.
\
Nuclear power matters, both in the generation of electricity and the ability to control carbon emissions. Yet many in Vermont are (and have always been) uncomfortable with nuclear power.
\
In its extreme form, it has led to attempts to shut down Vermont Yankee, which provides more than half of the state's electricity and without which electricity to power our homes, farms and factories would cost significantly more and would not be as environmentally friendly.
\
The enormity of the climate-change problem is obvious. To be sure, the development of solar, wind and other renewable sources is important. But nuclear power is central to the solution. It is reliable, safe, renewable and affordable. America's pursuit of nuclear power after World War II led to a more prosperous economy and a cleaner environment. This can happen again.

Monday, March 3 Terrified by the supposed horrors of global warming, Vermont's Green legions are geared up to make 2008 the year of the state's Extreme Green Makeover.
\
That momentous event was to have been set in motion last year, but it suddenly expired with Gov. Jim Douglas' veto of Sen. Peter Shumlin's bill to lay a $25 million tax bill on the state's leading generator of clean electricity to fund a new state entity to go about persuading Vermonters to stop wasting money on heating fuels.
\
In July, the Democratic-controlled House sustained the veto by 13 votes. That caused the ambitious Senator from VPIRG to declare that he would be back in the 2008 session with an even stronger bill. Now it's 2008, and he's back as promised.
\
Earlier this month the House Natural Resources and Energy Committee, ably chaired by the greenish but realistic Rep. Robert Dostis, brought out its version of an earlier Senate-passed energy conservation bill (S.209). The bill recites the Senate's global disaster mantra that ""global climate change is threatening our environment and perhaps ultimately our existence."" It then sets forth 47 sections of policy changes, including the creation of a non-monopoly energy efficiency program to meet the goals of the vetoed bill.
\
The bill expands the carbon cap and trade system under the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. This is a multistate program where electric ratepayers of the other states will send money to Vermont to reward us for having such a green electrical energy system.
\
The bill also sets in motion the process for increasing the gross receipts tax on heating fuels, and creating a state public power authority. But all in all, the House version was restrained enough to pass that body on a 136-2 vote.
\
Now the Senate will act, most likely by grafting a large number of amendments onto the House bill. The Shumlin amendments are contained in his 49-page S.350. Modestly titled the ""energy independence and economic prosperity"" act, the bill incorporates the entire radical agenda put forth by VPIRG.
\
The central feature of the Shumlin-VPIRG wish list is the creation of what can only be described as an energy super-government, the ""climate collaborative,"" to ""coordinate statewide activities on climate change and all related energy activities.""
\
This unprecedented public corporate body would be controlled by nine ""stakeholders"" jointly chosen by governor and Legislature. It would consist of one public official, two higher education representatives, two ""business"" representatives (presumably from the Vermont Businesses for Social Responsibility lobby), one from ""conservation interests"" (presumably VPIRG), one from low-income interests, one from ""sustainable rural development"" (presumably Rural Vermont), and one from Efficiency Vermont. Notably not included: taxpayers.
\
This super government would supervise a bewildering array of task forces and working groups to produce a host of reports advocating new regulations, controls, mandates, plans, rules, standards, taxes and subsidies. The bill envisions or imposes strict ""smart growth"" land use control strategies, greenhouse gas emission inventories, aggressive implementation of Act 200's planning mandates, new Act 250 rules to impose ""carbon neutrality"" on developments, mandates for the protection of ""dead and dying wildlife trees,"" doubling (heavily subsidized) passenger rail traffic by 2028, getting all single-occupancy vehicles off the highways, steeply increased vehicle sales and use taxes and registration fees on low-mpg vehicles, energy efficiency standards that must be met before homeowners could sell their houses, and biofueled bus tours to visit biofuel producing farms.
\
The collaborative would develop a ""public education and engagement framework to encourage behavior change,"" through ""social marketing strategies with broad ethical goals."" An example: ""in-depth, science-based in-school programs on energy efficiency and climate change at all levels.""
\
This proposal emerged from a lobby group (VPIRG) that strenuously insists that all scientific questions about climate change have been settled, no dissent can be deemed credible, the planet is racing toward Al Gore's heat death and only desperate wide-ranging big-government ""solutions"" will be considered!
\
And how will all this be paid for? In addition to the various taxes levied, the collaborative would create a working group to come up with ways for funding greenhouse gas reduction efforts. The collaborative itself, a veritable Manhattan Project of Green Social Engineering, would apparently be funded through the inexhaustible General Fund.
\
The far more reasonable House-passed bill contains numerous useful provisions, such as expansion of net metering, passthrough of federal tax incentives, and relaxation of some government-created barriers to energy enterprises. It also has some questionable inclusions, but it has strong bipartisan support, including that of Gov. Douglas.
\
If Sen. Shumlin and his VPIRG allies try to load up the House-passed bill with selections from their sweeping Senate bill -- especially the unaccountable global warming super government -- it may well stimulate a backlash among a lot of average Vermonters. It certainly should.

65,"The EPA's November proposal to reduce our nation's use of biofuel is a commendable step towards lowering our climate impact. As a student of environmental studies, I am constantly hit with the issues threatening our planet, realizing that my generation will bear the brunt of actions we engage in now.\Biofuel production is an emerging cause of deforestation around the globe. This clean fuel is an enticing alternative for those seeking to reduce their carbon emissions, and renewable energy is what we need to replace our dependence on fossil fuels. However, simply generating and utilizing renewable energy sources does not always mean that we are reducing our carbon footprint. In an effort to reduce dependence on foreign oil, we have developed a new dependence on land clearing for foreign corn and sugar.\Deforestation has already cost us millions of kilometers of rainforest, and has reduced the planet's capacity to sequester carbon from the atmosphere and regulate the global climate.\As important as it is to transition to cleaner fuel, the costs we are imposing on the environment through deforestation are not proving worthy. The Amazon rain forest contributes to the stability of our climate and includes hundreds of endangered species as well as an estimated 10 percent of the world's most biodiverse ecosystems, unlikely to recover with business as usual.\Right now, we are outsourcing our need for cleared land, mainly to Brazil, for growing soybean and sugarcane to meet our biodiesel requirements. This is a result of our intent to reduce fossil fuel use.\In reducing the rate of deforestation, energy alternatives should be fit to a sustainable scale. We have unnecessarily sacrificed ecosystem services in effort to switch to cleaner energy. A simple tax on land clearing is inefficient. A higher price will not hinder industry from engaging in profit-promising activity, since oil companies will continue to drill and adjust the price we pay at the tank.\Looking at potential solutions, a cap-and-trade program will establish a global carbon market for CO2 emissions. This approach will set an allowance of carbon emissions for new business. Carbon credits will be sold by developing nations and bought by developed nations that wish to continue resource use at set levels. Assessing the potential carbon emissions associated with a new energy source will allow us to estimate the true environmental impact.\This design gives ownership rights of a clean atmosphere to the public, and forces polluters to pay for the ability to contaminate the air.\Our global system has ecological limits, which if surpassed, may be impossible to restore. As our global economy strives for infinite growth, we must address the means to attain this goal. We cannot afford to take backward steps in terms of replacing fossil fuel dependence. A cost-benefit analysis and more thorough Environmental Impact Assessments must be done to ensure that the energy decisions we make today will reduce our footprint in the future. Measuring the potentials of carbon emissions and sequestering losses through carbon caps will help to illustrate the harm or benefit that will come out of energy production.\Kimberly Voellmann of Burlington majored in environmental studies at the University of Vermont.\kimberly voellmann"

Friday, February 1 PORTLAND, Ore. -- Global warming issues took over lecture halls in colleges across the country Thursday, with more than 1,500 universities participating in what was billed as the nation's largest-ever ""teach-in.""
\
Organizers said the goal of the event, dubbed ""Focus the Nation,"" was to move past preaching to the green choir, to reach a captive audience of students in many fields who might not otherwise tune in to climate change issues.
\
Faculty members from a wide spectrum of disciplines -- from chemistry to costume design -- agreed to incorporate climate change issues into their lectures on Thursday. Community colleges and some high schools also took part.
\
""It's about infusing sustainability into the curriculum of higher education, so students can graduate prepared to deal with the world they have been handed,"" said Lindsey Clark, 23, who organized events at the University of Utah.
\
The day's activities were the brainchild of Eban Goodstein, an economics professor at Lewis & Clark College in Portland who authored a widely used collegiate textbook on economics and the environment. Major funding came from Nike, Clif Bar and Stonyfield Farms, among other companies and foundations.
\
Goodstein, who has spent years training people to speak on climate change, said he issued a call to arms to fellow professors across the country a few years ago, as his certainty grew that time was running out to address global warming.
\
Some participating professors said the climate change issue already had been woven into their syllabus, in areas as disparate as philosophy and urban planning.
\
""For my students, three years ago, it felt like I was shoving this down people's throats. Now it feels mainstream,"" said Jane Nichols, who teaches interior design at Western Carolina University. ""Students don't want their future clients to know more than they do.""
\
Nichols said global warming is relevant to interior design because a designer's choice of materials has environmental implications. Bamboo floors and furnishings, for example, are more environmentally sustainable than old-growth wood, she said.
\
Other schools held panel discussions with political luminaries, including Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, who participated via video satellite at the University of Nevada's campuses in Las Vegas and Reno.
\
A few schools took the concept beyond the classroom. At Lewis & Clark, student actors portrayed presidential candidates for a mock debate on climate change issues, with the Hillary Rodham Clinton character stressing the need for ""green collar"" workers and the John McCain figure echoing the candidate's calls for a cap-and-trade system to regulate carbon emissions.
\
Glendale Community College in Arizona and the University of Kentucky have been serving ""low carbon"" meals all week. Organizers at New York's Fordham University put up a mock wind farm to show people that ""solutions are close at hand,"" said philosophy professor Jude Jones.
\
Western Carolina University hosted a recycled fashion show. And at the University of California at San Diego, a student dressed as a polar bear sat in a mock electric chair to illustrate how climate change could erase the species' habitat.
\
Goodstein said the event comes at a crossroads for those involved in the climate change movement: There's less debate over whether global warming is happening, but many people have the sense that it's too late to change course.
\
""If you go back to 1960, most Americans felt that segregation was wrong, but they were fatalistic about it,"" Goodstein said. ""But now, 40 years later, Barack Obama is a serious contender for the presidency. And 40 years from now, when our young people have finished the job of rewiring the planet, they will look back and say that 2008 was the year Americans woke up.""

\
Even for people who don't believe in it, climate change just got real. It's about time.
\
The Obama administration's proposed new rule for existing power plants -- reducing heat-trapping carbon emissions by up to 30 percent by 2030 -- is ambitious enough to get anyone's attention. No, this one measure will not halt or reverse human-induced warming of the atmosphere. But the rule is necessary in the context of seeking international consensus on solutions -- and also significant in its own right.
\
Before Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Gina McCarthy could announce the new rule Monday, critics were already bellowing about higher energy rates and lost jobs. They pretended not to see that President Obama -- as with health care reform -- is taking what ought to be seen as a Republican-friendly approach.
\
The rule, which will not become final until next year, gives states great flexibility in how they reach the target. They are not forced to immediately begin shutting down the aging coal-fired power plants that constitute one of the biggest sources of carbon pollution. Rather, each state can take the path that best fits its circumstances -- ramping up the generation of energy from renewable sources such as wind and solar, for example, or entering regional cap-and-trade agreements.
\
Ultimately, however, hundreds of those aging, dirty, coal-fired plants will have to close. If the planet could speak, it would say good riddance.
\
Many of those who do not believe in climate change also reject the idea that carbon dioxide can be called a pollutant, since it is a natural and necessary component of the air we breathe. But direct measurement shows that the concentration of carbon dioxide in atmosphere has increased by an astounding 40 percent since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, when humankind began burning fossil fuels in earnest. As with any poison -- or pollutant -- it's the dose that counts.
\
This thickening pall of human-generated carbon dioxide -- which traps heat, according to universally accepted principles of physics and chemistry -- has coincided with a long-term rise in average temperatures that agrees with climate scientists' predictions. The big unanswered question isn't scientific, it's political: Will we continue to turn up the thermostat?
\
The question that some skeptics like to pose -- ""Why should the United States take such a big step on its own?"" -- is meaningless, when you think about it.
\
China is the world's largest emitter of carbon dioxide. Emissions are rising sharply in India and other rapidly industrializing countries. Nothing the United States does unilaterally, or even in concert with Europe and Japan, can solve the problem. What we really need is a global solution.
\
All this is true, but one less ton of carbon makes an incremental difference, however slight. Obama's major energy initiatives -- higher fuel economy standards for vehicles, plus the new power plant emissions rule -- will mean billions of tons less of carbon dioxide in the air. It is true that we cannot save the planet on our own. But it is also true that if warming-induced disaster is inevitable, it will arrive sooner if we fail to act.
\
Meanwhile, Chinese and Indian universities are full of scientists who are warning their own governments about the negative impacts of carbon emissions. China has already signaled its intention to move away from coal, and while this is easier said than done, Chinese officials have an added incentive: The noxious smog that shrouds major cities, most of it from coal-fired power plants, has stoked real anger among the country's burgeoning urban middle class. In other industrializing countries as well, as people get richer they will demand a cleaner environment.
\
Obama hopes that action by the United States, the richest country in the world, will make it possible for the other big carbon emitters to act. Some of the domestic critics who scoff at this notion also complain that Obama, in their view, does not sufficiently assert U.S. leadership around the globe. What do these people think leadership means, if not actually leading?
\
The bonus is that closing coal-fired power plants will encourage the development of cleaner energy sources. The power generation industry was already moving toward cheap, plentiful natural gas, which releases much less carbon. Gas should be seen as a bridge toward clean, renewable energy sources -- an industry that will be huge in the 21st century.
\
It's our choice. We can try our best to ensure that the next industrial revolution -- the one that ends dependence on fossil fuels -- happens here. Or we can watch it happen in China.

Wednesday, October 8 WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the presidential election less than a month away and the economy reeling, House Democratic leaders on Tuesday unveiled a proposal to reduce the gases blamed for global warming from power plants, transportation and factories by 80 percent come 2050.
\
The draft legislation, which will be refined in coming months for introduction next year, would begin slowly, capping emissions of heat-trapping gases released by transportation and power plants first, then moving to other sectors of the economy. The money earned from auctioning off some of the permits would be redirected to energy efficiency and clean technologies. In later years, all permits would be sold with the proceeds going back to the taxpayer, unless Congress reauthorizes the bill.
\
""Politically, scientifically, legally, and morally, the question has been settled: regulation of greenhouse gases in the United States is coming,"" wrote House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman John Dingell, D-Mich., and energy and air quality subcommittee Chairman Rick Boucher, D-Va. in a letter explaining the 461-page draft, which has been in the works for two years and was the subject of more than two dozen hearings.
\
The only questions are when, and how.
\
With the economy in turmoil, prospects have dimmed for federal legislation that would create a massive new market for carbon dioxide and in the short-term likely increase energy costs. The draft also makes clear that the federal government should take the lead on regulating greenhouse gases, rebuffing states such as California that want to set their own fuel economy standards and pre-empting regional markets for carbon dioxide, such as the one in the Northeast.
\
The bill tries to address the economic concerns by excluding small businesses and increasing the number of permits when prices spike.
\
But Texas Rep. Joe Barton, the committee's senior Republican, said Tuesday the bill would still lead the country off ""the economic cliff.""
\
The proposal falls in between plans put forward by both presidential candidates, but makes deeper cuts than a similar bill that failed in the Senate earlier this year. All the proposals rely on a cap-and-trade mechanism -- which allows industries to either reduce their pollution or to purchase credits from companies exceeding pollution targets -- to meet mandates.
\
Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama's plan calls for an 83 percent reduction in greenhouse gases from 2005 levels by 2050, while Republican John McCain's proposal would achieve a 66 percent cut over the same time period. A Senate bill that failed 48-36 in June would have slashed heat-trapping emissions from a variety of sources by 71 percent by mid-century.
\
Environmentalists on Tuesday said the bill was a step in the right direction, but criticized the pace of the cuts and some of the details. Reductions wouldn't begin until 2012, allowing time for the necessary technology to be developed.
\
The proposal floats an option that would bar the Environmental Protection Agency and states from setting fuel economy standards for vehicles different from those put forth by the Transportation Department. In April 2007, the Supreme Court ruled that the EPA could regulate carbon dioxide under the Clean Air Act. The Bush administration has since said the law is the wrong tool for the job.
\
""These options are straight from the playbook of the Big Three,"" said Frank O'Donnell, president of the advocacy group Clean Air Watch, referring to Dingell's connections with Detroit's automakers.
\
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce said such measures are needed to prevent overlapping jurisdiction. That, along with the extended timetable, makes this draft ""the first time that anyone on Capitol Hill has opened the door to realistic discussion of issue"" said Bill Kovacs, the chamber's vice president of Environment, Technology and Regulatory Affairs.

Friday, September 26 NEW YORK (AP) -- Greenhouse gases went on sale Thursday as 10 Northeastern states held the nation's first auction of pollution credits aimed at curbing global warming.
\
""It is time really to turn the tide on global warming,"" said New York Gov. David Paterson, who opened the auction by ringing the ceremonial bell at the New York Mercantile Exchange. ""And we hope that we've done this today.""
\
The program puts a price on carbon dioxide pollution, giving power plants a financial incentive to cut emissions.
\
Auction proceeds will go toward energy conservation and renewable energy programs in each of the 10 participating states: New York, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Rhode Island and Vermont.
\
The program aims to hold carbon dioxide emissions steady through 2014 and then gradually reduce them; it is widely viewed as a model for future programs nationally and around the globe.
\
""It's historic,"" said Lance Pierce, climate program director of the Union of Concerned Scientists. ""The carbon markets have arrived in the United States. And carbon markets, if designed correctly, hold the promise for development of cleaner energy ... and reductions in global warming pollution that benefit consumers, businesses and the environment, as well.""
\
The Northeast effort, called the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, limits the total amount of carbon that power plants in the 10 states can pump out of their smokestacks at the current level -- 188 million tons.
\
Electric power generators must pay for allowances covering the amount of carbon they emit, and the initiative will provide a market-based auction and trading system in which the generators can buy, sell and trade the emissions allowances.
\
The initiative covers more than 200 fossil fuel power plants, requiring that the owners of those plants pay for the carbon dioxide they emit.
\
It will gradually reduce carbon emissions by reducing the emissions limit in a series of steps, until it is 10 percent below the current level a decade from now. The companies that don't reduce emissions can buy allowances from companies that have, thereby creating a financial incentive to reduce pollution because the more environmentally friendly plants won't have to buy as many credits and because they can sell any they don't need.
\
Dale Bryk, senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said, ""This new energy plan is straightforward, highly cost-effective and creates a clean energy pathway for the rest of the country to follow. It is the shape of things to come.""
\
Carbon dioxide trading already exists in Europe. Some carbon dioxide allowances also are being traded in the United States on a voluntary basis through the Chicago Climate Exchange. But the Northeast effort is the nation's first mandatory effort to limit carbon dioxide.
\
The initiative took five years to bear fruit. George Pataki, New York's governor at that time, brought together nine other governors five years ago to develop a regional strategy to limit carbon dioxide emissions from power plants.
\
Other regional greenhouse gas coalitions, such as the Western Climate Initiative and the Midwestern Greenhouse Gas Accord, are in earlier stages of development.
\
New Jersey Gov. Jon Corzine, who joined Paterson at a news conference at the Mercantile Exchange, noted that both John McCain and Barack Obama support cap-and-trade programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Corzine said ""there is building momentum"" to enact federal legislation.
\
In response to critics who have argued that the limit is too high, Corzine said, ""I think we need to make sure that the mechanics of the auction process and the system work."" He said the limit would be lowered at subsequent auctions.
\
Thursday's auction was run by World Energy, an operator of online green exchanges. Results will be released Monday, pending review by an independent monitor.

Monday December 3, 2012
\
In just over a month the 2013 legislature will convene, and a large question will as usual be ""where will we get the money to pay for all this?""
\
Administration Secretary Jeb Spaulding has tasked the agency secretaries to submit General Fund budget requests that maintain ""current services,"" and add on any new initiatives separately. Unlike, say, rebuilding the Champlain Bridge, General Fund expenditures just keep rolling on year after year, growing with more people, depreciated dollars, new political demands and governors thinking up new things to spend tax dollars on. Those agency requests are likely to produce a FY2014 ""budget gap"" of $50-70 million
\
Five years ago Senate President Peter Shumlin, already marching toward the governorship, repeatedly declared ""We are spending too much, and have used up our tax capacity There is no more money in the bank ... We are tapped out.""
\
Since that time Shumlin has nonetheless discovered all sorts of General Fund tax capacity, and proposed or enacted all sorts of new taxes. Here's a partial list: Higher taxes on hospitals, nursing homes, and visiting nurse services; tobacco; electric bills (Efficiency Vermont); health insurance claims; and the $21 million pilfered from the CVPS ratepayers to finance his favorite renewable energy subsidy programs, notably the Clean Energy Development Fund..
\
This list does not include the $27.5 million ""penalty tax"" on the Education Fund, because local voters failed to heed the governor's urging to restrain their school budgets. Nor does it include the two cent increase in both school property taxes, to raise the education money to compensate for the penalty tax.
\
Also urged by Senate President Shumlin, but rejected, were a new ""thermal efficiency"" heating fuel tax, a ""gas guzzler"" tax on SUVs and pickups, a tax on milk distributors, a novel ""unanticipated profits"" tax on Vermont Yankee, and a state cap-and-trade energy tax program.
\
So the tight fisted Senate leader of 2007 has since found lots more tax capacity, and numerous new ways to spend it, if he can get the bills passed by his hitherto largely compliant legislature.
\
There is plenty of pressure to accelerate General Fund spending. The entire Vermont labor movement and their many allies, chanting ""Put People First,"" are vocally demanding that state government spend lots more to meet ""every person's need for health, housing, dignified work, education, food, social security and healthy environment.""
\
This is clearly impossible, but Shumlin himself has committed to single payer Green Mountain Care in 2017. This will require $3 billion from somewhere, and his hoped-for new Federal funds will surely fall far short of that amount. He also knows well that Vermont's two state-managed retirement funds show an alarming $3 billion gap between promised benefits and expected revenues.
\
Reducing state spending, aside from completed Tropical Storm Irene repairs, is not an acceptable option for a liberal majority. So where can Governor ""No More Tax Capacity"" go to find the money to fuel all the state's obligations and his ambitions?
\
Raising income taxes ""on the rich"" is not a good bet. The Tax Foundation reported last month that Vermont in 2010 had the 13th highest state and local tax burden, a finding that the Shumlin administration concedes is pretty close to the truth. Taxing the incomes of people who make a lot of money is an obvious stimulus for them to make and spend it somewhere else. Also, Shumlin himself has boasted of reducing income tax rates in 1999 and 2009 (in both cases disproportionately benefiting high income taxpayers, although he never mentions that).
\
The short list of potential new taxes comes down to some form of carbon tax on fossil fuel energy (proposed by Shumlin in 2008), extending the sales and use tax to services (offered earlier this year by Speaker Shap Smith, who is now backing off), and a General Fund ""penalty tax"" of up to $276 million on the Education Fund, that translates into higher school property taxes. Green Mountain Care, if and when it happens, will almost certainly require stiff new payroll taxes, so that source can't be tapped now to meet other demands.
\
Of course the Shumlin administration, staring the facts in the face, could relieve a lot of people by telling them and the union red shirts that 2013 will be the year of ""Putting Solvency First."" That thought brings to mind that popular Buddy Holly song of 1958, ""That'll Be the Day .""

\
With snow gently falling as the holiday season winds down, I find myself reflecting on the New Year and what we might hope for. World peace of course, and solving the poverty conundrum would be great. But what about energy and the environment? Here are some thoughts.
\
We will finally put a value on carbon In mid-2012 the conservative American Enterprise Institute made headlines by sponsoring strategic meetings about the merits of a carbon tax. While not fully embracing the idea, AEI seems to be open to carbon taxes - generating ire among its conservative brethren. Also in 2012, former Republican Congressman Bob Inglis of South Carolina, launched an organization promoting carbon taxes, the Energy and Enterprise Initiative.
\
I have long favored some form of tax on carbon or non-renewable energy, rather than the more complex cap-and-trade approach that is being tried in a few places, most notably California. As Al Gore said in his 1992 book, ""Earth in the Balance,"" we should tax things we want to discourage, like resource consumption and waste generation, and not tax things we want to encourage, like earnings and savings. With elevated concern about climate change generated by Superstorm Sandy, perhaps 2013 will be the year to finally consider sensible ideas like carbon taxes.
\
More of us will recognize the connection between resilience and sustainability Following Superstorm Sandy some editorials appeared suggesting that New York City suffered more than it needed to because the focus had been on sustainability or green rather than resilience. I couldn't disagree more. I believe that the two are inextricably linked - or at least should be linked. Each benefits the other.
\
The Resilient Design Institute, the non-profit organization I created in mid-2012, will be working to strengthen this link between sustainability and resilience throughout 2013. I'm excited about that, as I believe that resilience can be the route to far greater buy-in to green building practices (along with sensible urban planning, ecosystem protection, and support for local food production). By the end of 2013 I'm hoping that resilience will be widely understood and increasingly embraced. Options will become available for low-interest, long-term loans to finance efficiency improvements The PACE (property-assessed clean energy) program, when rolled out in a few cities between 2008 and 2010, was touted as a key solution to allow more homeowners to affordably finance energy conservation retrofits and renewable energy installations. Loan payments in PACE programs were able to be paid back as part of a homeowner's property tax bill, and if the house was sold the loan would transfer with the house.
\
Unfortunately, concern about who's first in line for payment in the event of a default led to opposition to PACE financing by the loan agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Normally, property taxes are superior to debt obligations, and there was concern by lenders that PACE could enable home improvement loans owed to municipalities to be repaid before mortgage obligations to lending institutions.
\
As this issue is being worked out, residential PACE financing is not available in most places, though there are some exceptions. I'm hopeful that 2013 will see PACE financing - or something like it - become commonplace nationwide.
\
More utility companies will embrace solar power
\
Critics point out that photovoltaics (PVs) can't replace our conventional power generation options. Indeed, it can't do so alone, but it can be an increasingly important part of a longterm plan to move us toward a carbon-neutral society. Utility companies should look to Green Mountain Power, Vermont's largest utility company, for progressive policies to expand the implementation of solar.
\
Small-scale, distributed PV systems will play a key role in achieving Vermont's Comprehensive Energy Plan, which calls for a shift to 90-percent reliance on renewable energy sources by the year 2050. Utility companies will play a key role in getting us there.
\
Leaving the car at home will become cool
\
Of all the challenges we face in transitioning to a low-energy, low-carbon future, none will be harder than reducing our addiction to the gasoline-powered automobile. One solution to this dependence will be electric and plug-in-hybrid electric vehicles with distributed PV systems charging those car batteries. But we can also make tremendous strides by more actively embracing non-automobile transportation options.
\
Public transit needs to be a key part of this. Light rail is an option where population density justifies the huge investment. A far-less-costly system, bus rapid transit, was developed in Curitiba, Brazil in the early 1970s and allows low-cost buses to function more like light rail, with passengers quickly boarding from platforms at the floor level of the bus having pre-paid their fares.
\
Several cities in the U.S. are putting bus rapid transit systems into place.
\
In rural areas like much of Vermont, public transit can consist of smaller buses that travel the major routes on a regular schedule. Making these rural bus systems more viable may depend on increased frequency and employers helping to subsidize the cost.
\
Making our communities more accessible to pedestrians and bicyclists is also part of the answer. We need to implement traffic-calming measures and build bicycle paths and safer bike lanes on our streets. As improvements continue in 2013, for example, the new West River Trail that extends from the Marina Restaurant in Brattleboro to Rice Farm Road in Dummerston, will increasingly make sense for commuting. Maybe 2013 can put us on the path to a future that moves beyond the standard automobile.

Thursday, April 17WASHINGTON -- President Bush called for a halt Wednesday in the growth of greenhouse gases by 2025, acknowledging the need to head off serious climate change.
\
The plan came under fire immediately from environmentalists and congressional Democrats who favor mandatory emission cuts, a position also held by all three presidential contenders.
\
Bush in a Rose Garden address for the first time set a specific target date for U.S. climate pollution reductions and said he was ready to commit to a binding international agreement on long-term reductions as long as other countries such as China do the same.
\
""There is a wrong way and a right way to approach reducing greenhouse gas emissions,"" Bush said, making clear that he opposes a Senate measure that would impose mandatory limits on greenhouse gases beginning in five years, followed by annual reductions.
\
""Bad legislation would impose tremendous costs on our economy and American families without accomplishing the important climate change goals we share,"" the president said.
\
He said he envisions a ""comprehensive blend of market incentives and regulations"" that would encourage clean and efficient energy technologies. And he singled out the electric utility industry, saying power plants need to stabilize carbon dioxide pollution within 15 years and reduce them after that.
\
While characterized by the White House as a fresh strategy to attack climate change, the president gave no new proposals for achieving these pollution reductions.
\
He cited, instead, measures already enacted such as a 40 percent increase in auto fuel economy, a requirement for a huge increase in use of ethanol and other biofuels, and some efficiency standards, as well as a push for developing clean energy technologies.
\
Environmentalists said the Energy Department's own forecasts have shown that even with those advances _ encompassed in energy legislation approved last year _ U.S. carbon dioxide emissions are expected to increase by about 10 percent by 2025.
\
""If this is President Bush's idea of 20/20 vision he needs to get his eyes checked,"" said Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., calling the new White House climate initiative ""late, insufficient and insincere.""
\
Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., said Bush's remarks showed that ""he has no intention of cooperating"" to get climate legislation passed this year. ""He's basically saying take two aspirins and call President Obama, Clinton or McCain next January,"" Markey told reporters.
\
All three presidential contenders are supporters of mandatory limits _ a so-called cap-and-trade system _ to reduce climate changing pollution, mainly carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels. Sen. John McCain, the presumptive GOP nominee, has been a co-sponsor of mandatory emissions cap legislation. Democratic candidates Sens. Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton both have said they would make binding emissions reduction requirements a top priority.
\
Some conservative House Republicans have expressed privately to the White House concern about Bush's call for a timetable for emission reductions, while other congressional Republicans said they welcomed the president becoming more engaged in the issue.
\
""The president has articulated a progressive vision for a comprehensive solution to climate change,"" said Sen. George Voinovich, R-Ohio, who has voiced concern about the economic cost of the Senate climate bill.
\
Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., who like the president has been critical of mandatory caps on greenhouse emissions, said, ""It is clear ... that we both share important principles that must be part of any policy addressing climate change, including support of technology.""
\
Still, Senate Democrats and environmentalists said the president's plan would allow continued growth of greenhouse gases for nearly two decades, during which the government estimates heat-trapping emissions from U.S. electric power plants alone are expected to grow by 16 percent.
\
Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., chairwoman of the Senate Energy and Environment Committee, called Bush's new climate strategy ""worse than doing nothing"" and would ""have America stand by while greenhouse gases reach dangerous levels.""
\
A climate bill expected to be taken up by the Senate in June would call for a 19 percent reduction in greenhouse gases by 2025 and about a 70 percent reduction by mid-century from power plants, transportation and industrial sources.
\
Bush called such a requirement ""unrealistic"" and economically damaging, but indicated that he would like to see some congressional action on climate this year to avert what aides have characterized as a ""train wreck"" of regulations under existing laws such as the Clean Air Act and Endangered Species Act.
\
These laws ""were never meant to regulate global climate change,"" said Bush, and would ""make the federal government act like a local planning and zoning board.""
\
A year ago, the Supreme Court declared that carbon dioxide is a pollutant under the Clean Air Act and directed the Environmental Protection Agency to determine whether CO2 is endangering public health or welfare. If so, the court said, the EPA must regulate CO2 emissions.
\
At the same time, the Interior Department has been told by another court to decide whether the polar bear should be brought under the protection of the Endangered Species Act because of disappearing sea ice _ a phenomenon blamed by scientists on global warming.
"

Friday April 8, 2011
\
BRATTLEBORO -- U.S. Rep. Peter Welch, D-Vt., is slamming legislation approved by the Republican majority that strips the Environmental Protection Agency from regulating greenhouse gases during a floor vote on Thursday.
\
Welch, Vermont's sole representative in the U.S. House, said the measure would prohibit the EPA from considering greenhouse gases as air pollutants, thus exempting them from regulation under the Clean Air Act.
\
Officially known as the Energy Tax Prevention Act of 2011 (H.R. No. 910), the legislation calls to amend the Clean Air Act to prohibit the EPA from ""promulgating any regulation concerning, taking action relating to or taking into consideration the emission of a greenhouse gas to address climate change, and for other purposes.""
\
It passed nearly along party lines by a 255 to 172 vote.
\
Lawmakers advocating for the bill report its passing would negate a 2007 Supreme Court decision finding the EPA has authority over greenhouse gas regulation. Critics say the act undermines the agency from enforcing current greenhouse gas reporting requirements and motor vehicle emission standards.
\
Welch said the measure overturns scientific findings about the risk posed by greenhouse gases to humans and the environment.
\
""The authors of this bill have come to the conclusion that global warming is a hoax. Give them credit, getting there was not an easy task and flies in the face of the unanimous conclusion of American scientists,"" Welch said. ""Supporters of this legislation are following the long-established tradition we humans have, the ability to disregard the obvious and proven when that conflicts with our ideology.""
\
Amendments proposed by Welch to repeal tax breaks for oil companies and protect the EPA efficiency program (known as Energy Star) were rejected by the majority.
\
U.S. Rep. Frederick Upton, R-Mich., sponsored the legislation as a means to ""remove the biggest regulatory threat to the American economy."" He said the bill is designed to stop the EPA from using the Clean Air Act as a unilateral tool to impose greenhouse gas regulations to address climate change.
\
Without congressional intervention, Upton said the EPA may continue to put together a house of cards to regulate emissions of carbon dioxide.
\
""EPA regulations will hit our manufacturing sector hard, with direct limits on factory emissions and indirect costs from the higher price to power their facilities,"" he said Wednesday on the House floor. ""It will hit small businesses hard, because when the electricity to power your power and the gasoline to fuel your vehicles is more expensive, you profit less and hire fewer new employees.""
\
The bill has support from multiple fossil fuel and manufacturing groups, including the National Mining Association and the National Association of Manufacturers.
\
""While our nation's unemployment has edged down slightly, Americans still desperately need jobs. The bipartisan vote in the House of Representatives today demonstrates that our nation's lawmakers understand this and are willing to stand against EPA regulations that would prevent job creation and economic growth,"" said Jay Timmons, president of the manufacturers association, in a statement.
\
""The Energy Tax Prevention Act will help create the climate necessary for future investment, innovation and expansion. This legislation also takes steps to provide some clarity in the regulatory process, which will help drive manufacturers' ability to create jobs and increase our global competitiveness,"" he added.
\
But Welch said lawmakers cannot pretend scientific facts do not exist for the benefit of creating jobs at coal-producing plants at the expense of Americans' health.
\
""You have to be truthful about what you're doing and what the consequences are. My view is the real job creation will come by taking on the challenge of making America energy independent,"" he said.
\
President Barack Obama has already vowed to veto any such legislation that makes it to his desk.
\
A statement of administration policy from the Executive Office of the president notes passage of H.R. 910 would halt the EPA ""common-sense"" steps to protect Americans from harmful air pollution.
\
EPA reports indicate the Clean Air Act prevented 160,000 premature death, 130,000 heart attacks and more than 100,000 hospital visits in 2010 alone.
\
In an opinion piece from the Washington Examiner, Illinois Republican Adam Kinzinger said the EPA is attempting to enforce a backdoor cap and trade system after Capitol Hill Democrats failed to push through legislation nearly two years ago. He wrote the prevention act is a bipartisan (three energy committee Democrats supported the measure) and effective approach to curtail the EPA's overreaching regulations.
\
""There is a whole host of other economically devastating rules in the pipeline at the EPA, which is why my colleagues and I on the Energy and Commerce Committee are focused squarely on reining in these runaway regulators,"" he wrote.
\
The bill does not restrict or change the Clean Air Act's current regulation of air pollution, however it does alter its definition to not include greenhouse gas. The language in the bill refers to greenhouse gases as the following: water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, sulfur hexafluoride, hydrofluorocarbons and perfluorocarbons.

Concord -- House Republicans yesterday rolled out what they said was a pro-jobs agenda for 2012, hoping to keep the focus on the economy and government spending even as they face growing criticism for bills opponents contend are outside the mainstream in New Hampshire.
\
House Republican Leader D.J. Bettencourt, a Salem Republican, said the agenda from the GOP caucus, which dominates the chamber, ""focuses on the concerns we've heard from job creators.""
\
Saying budget cuts last year helped New Hampshire get ""out of its fiscal crisis,"" Bettencourt said lawmakers can now ""focus squarely this year on getting Granite Staters back to work and address other closely related issues to job creation, such as government reform and achieving educational excellence.""
\
The agenda includes close to 30 pieces of legislation, including bills to ease business taxes, curtail worker safety programs, and repeal the state's regional greenhouse gas initiative cap-and-trade program for controlling carbon dioxide emissions. That last piece of legislation fell under the GOP rubric of ""strengthening"" New Hampshire's Clean Air Act and protecting the state's environment.
\
Other priorities in the agenda include measures to:
\
* Abolish the chancellor's office at University System of New Hampshire and give more power to the board of trustees;
\
* Create a legislative oversight committee that would have some power over the state's environmental agency;
\
* And make it more difficult for college students to vote in New Hampshire elections if they grew up elsewhere.
\
House Speaker William O'Brien told reporters it was a ""bottoms up agenda"" that came from lawmakers and will ""fulfill the promises that we made to the voters of New Hampshire.""
\
""This agenda is a great agenda. It moves us further down the road on the journey to affordable government,"" said O'Brien.
\
But Democratic lawmakers said Republicans are threatening to harm such issues as environmental protection, workers rights and public safety.
\
""There seems to be a strong current in this Legislature that wants to deregulate and dismantle government,"" said state Rep. Ray Gagnon, a Claremont Democrat. Gagnon, a former mayor, noted that the House spent 30 minutes debating whether to no longer require permits for outdoor burn piles and said voters are becoming wary of the GOP agenda.
\
""Regular people in the street ask me 'what are they doing down there?' "" Gagnon said.
\
Dick Bouley, a veteran lobbyist and former legislative aide to Gov. Hugh Gallen more than 30 years ago, said he was concerned by efforts to abolish professional licensing established in bipartisan fashion over time, though some of the measures have failed in the House.
\
""I just think that has all been done over the years by Republican governors, Republican legislators, as well as Democrats, and I just think we're wasting a lot of time on that,"" Bouley said.
\
Some Republicans made clear they want the focus to be strictly on jobs and improving educational opportunities.
\
State Rep. Rick Ladd, a Haverhill Republican and former school administrator who sits on the House Education Committee, expressed frustration hat his panel had had to spend valuable time yesterday morning on a bill that would establish an elective bible literacy course for high school students.
\
""I think people are saying this isn't an issue of importance right now,"" Ladd said. ""People are asking me what are they doing down there in Concord? How is what they are doing on any of these bills going to affect my ability to get a job?""
\
Bettencourt and O'Brien did appear to put some distance between themselves and one bill likely to be especially controversial this year, Republican efforts to repeal the state's gay marriage law.
\
It wasn't mentioned on the agenda sheet, and Bettencourt, when asked about same-sex marriage, said, ""That debate on gay marriage will come, and it will go, and which ever way it goes, we're staying focused on job creation and the economy.""
\
He later said ""getting our budget under control and getting Granite Staters back to work have to be our number one focus.""
\
Gov. John Lynch, a Democrat, has pledged to veto any repeal effort of same-sex marriage.
\
State Rep. Bernie Benn, a Hanover Democrat who sits on the House Finance Committee, said he opposes a GOP effort to move $26 million of surplus funds into the state's rainy day fund, saying services that have been cut need more funding.
\
""There's nothing wrong with savings, but when you have needs that are overwhelming, there are probably other uses,"" Benn said. ""There's no question that it's the national Republican agenda that has come to New Hampshire, shrinking government, and there is a role for government.""
\
But state Rep. Paul Ingbretson, a Haverhill Republican, rejected Democratic complaints that GOP interest in social issues threatened to detract from economic concerns, saying Democrats voted for the gay marriage law when the economy was already a priority.
\
""There's always room for both,"" Ingbretson said. ""You always have a pile of interesting bills, both sides do.""

Following two of the most destructive years for climate catastrophes, President Obama is now calling for a ""wide-ranging"" conversation with scientists. Let's talk.
\
As climate scientists who've together spent decades studying how and why our climate is changing, we welcome that opportunity. ""Frankenstorm"" Sandy brought a message for you and all of us: climate change impacts are here now, right now.
\
Climate change clearly contributed to Hurricane Sandy, one of the most destructive superstorms in U.S. history. On the stretch of the Atlantic Coast where we call home, sea level is rising four times faster than the global average. Global warming is heating the Atlantic Ocean and increasing atmospheric water vapor loading, both of which contributed to Sandy's power and deluge.
\
Were Sandy just a single disaster, the story might end there. Unfortunately it is not. The insurance giant Munich Re reports annual weather-related loss events have quintupled in the United States, costing Americans more than a trillion dollars.
\
This year we have suffered through a string of record-breaking extreme weather events, all worsened by climate change. These included ""Summer in March,"" the hottest month in U.S. history (July 2012), the worst drought since the 1950s and a wildfire season that is rivaling the worst ever, a record set only six year ago. In 2011, the United States broke its record for the most billion-dollar weather disasters in a year: 14 totaling $47 billion. And this year's number of disasters puts it on track to be No. 2.
\
The last few years are part of a longer trend of climatic disruption that is impacting communities and the world here and now. Already, observations indicate that the ranges of more than a thousand species are shifting poleward and up mountainsides to escape the increasing heat; CO2-driven ocean acidification is starting to dissolve coral reefs; the number of regions experiencing drought have doubled since the 1970s; over the last 10 years, wildfires in the American West burned twice as much land area each year as they did just 40 years ago; twice as many new high temperature records have been set in the past decade compared to new record lows; and both the minimum area and minimum volume of Arctic sea ice each summer are well below their values of 30 years ago with new records set in 2012.
\
The danger of such large changes, accompanied by an increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather, loss of biodiversity, imperiled food systems, a 2-to-4-foot sea level rise, and myriad national security risks, will present enormous challenges to our nation's infrastructure and landscapes and to the well-being of people and communities around the globe.
\
An increasingly disruptive climate and a bankrupt nation could be the legacy we leave our children. According to projections presented to the U.S. Congress by Tufts University economist Frank Ackerman, inaction will cost our nation more than 1 percent of GDP by 2025 - more than $200 billion a year. And costs will skyrocket from there to an estimated $1.8 trillion a year by 2100.
\
The next four years - the second term of President Obama's administration - will be critical. Faith Birol, chief economist for the usually conservative International Energy Agency, has repeatedly said that real progress toward a low-carbon economy needs to start very soon to avoid warming of 6 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century. Patience and credence can no longer be given to those denying climate change. The delays that these so-called ""skeptics"" and vested fossil-fuel interests are causing in the face of convincing detection and attribution only increase the staggering costs of adaptation and relocation.
\
Having seen the devastating impacts of Sandy, at least a few leaders in Washington seem poised to acknowledge what scientific analyses have clearly shown: human activities are causing climate disruption. Whether encouraged and forced by regulations, product standards, a cap-and-trade policy, or a carbon tax (possibly with a proportional dividend to every American), we need a national policy to initiate the transition to a low-carbon economy.
\
Investing in energy efficiency and switching from use of coal, petroleum, and natural gas to primary reliance on renewable wind and solar energy is a change that we CAN make. Switching away from petroleum would also build independence from OPEC and fossil fuel cartels. According to Bloomberg Finance, the best wind farms in the world already produce power as economically as coal, gas and nuclear generators, and solar energy is proving a good investment in many states. Iowa now generates nearly 20 percent of its electricity from wind energy and Colorado and Oregon more than 10 percent.
\
Clean energy is the fastest-growing industry in the U.S. today, growing at a rate of 8.3 percent, creating vital American jobs despite the depressed economy and the fact that over the past century fossil fuels have received subsidies 75 times the size of those for renewables since the mid-1990s. We saw inspiring political leadership when Sandy struck. Now we need equally bold and visionary action that taps into the best in ingenuity and technology that our country has to offer. Encouraging both economic development and environmental well-being requires creation of a modern, clean energy system that protects both our nation and our environment. The scientific community is eager to engage in the conversation the President seeks, but we all must recognize that the conversation must turn quickly from talk to action.
\
This story can have an ending we can live with. It is up to us.

\
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Disgruntled voters, a sluggish economy and vanishing enthusiasm for President Barack Obama have put 75 seats or more in the House -- the vast majority held by Democrats -- at risk of changing hands and putting Republicans in charge.
\
The Democrats could become a victim of their own successes during the past two elections, when candidates were swept into power by antipathy for President George W. Bush and ardor for Obama.Now, eight weeks from Election Day, the Democrats are bracing for the virtual certainty of lost House seats and scrambling to hold back a wave that could hand the GOP the 40 it needs to command a majority
\
Obama, grasping for a way to turn the tide, on Wednesday plans to propose $30 billion in new investment tax breaks for businesses to go along with tens of billions in spending he called for on Labor Day to invigorate the slow recovery. But even if Congress acts on the requests -- a long shot in a highly charged political season -- there's little time left for Democrats to salvage their election chances.
\
With Obama's popularity slumping and the party demoralized, dozens of first- and second-term Democrats as well as longer-serving congressmen who haven't faced serious challenges in years are toiling to hold onto their jobs in places that tend to prefer Republicans. And polls show independent voters leaning toward the GOP.
\
When asked which party they want to control Congress, voters are split or leaning toward Republicans, national surveys say. Perhaps even more ominously for Democrats, voters are overwhelmingly sour about national issues, especially the economy.
\
More than 60 percent said the nation was in a state of decline and on the wrong track in the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, in which voters likely to turn out in November gave Republicans a gaping 9-point edge when asked which party they wanted to control Congress.
\
Much can change between now and Election Day, and a GOP House takeover is far from sure. The political parties, individualcampaigns and outside groups that spend heavily to influence electionshave scarcely begun to distribute the hundreds of millions of dollars they plan to pour into key congressional districts across the country for advertising and on-the-ground organizing that can turn out crucial voters.
\
And most voters have yet to focus on the contests.
\
Still, Republicans are confidently predicting Democrats' defeat.
\
""Republicans have the intensity,"" said Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., head recruiter for House GOP candidates. ""The map is growing by the day.""
\
Democrats acknowledge the strong headwinds but counter that, with a solid fundraising advantage over Republicans and years worth of preparation for what they always knew would be a brutal election, they can fight off the GOP onslaught.
\
""We've got some very, very tough political territory on an off year with a weak economy, so it's a major challenge in a difficult political environment. That said, we will retain a majority in the House,"" said Democratic Rep. Chris Van Hollen, the party's House campaign chief.
\
The current breakdown is 255 Democrats, 178 Republicans and two vacancies that appear likely to be won by the GOP.
\
Democratic incumbents are at risk from California to New York and particularly in the unemployment-stricken Rust Belt, where six in Pennsylvania and five in Ohio face stiff challenges. Hotly contested races are unfolding in every region, including three each in Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Indiana, and two in Alabama, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Wisconsin and Virginia.
\
Among the most vulnerable Democratic incumbents are freshmen Reps. Betsy Markey of Colorado, Steve Driehaus of Ohio and Tom Perriello of Virginia. They had little time to settle into elected office before casting votes for key elements of Obama's agenda that are proving controversial, including the health care law and the so-called cap-and-trade measure to curb carbon emissions. Markey and Perriello, like some four dozen other Democrats, are fighting to hold onto districts that voted for Republican presidential nominee John McCain in 2008.
\
At the same time, a handful of influential, senior Democrats -- including Missouri's Ike Skelton, the chair of the Armed Services Committee, and South Carolinian John Spratt, the Budget chairman -- are facing formidable re-election battles in a year when voter dislike of elected officials, excessive government spending and the political establishment is on the rise.
\
Reps. Allen Boyd of Florida and Earl Pomeroy of North Dakota -- both in the House more than a decade -- and Paul Kanjorski of Pennsylvania and Chet Edwards of Texas -- veterans of 20 years or more -- also face tough fights.
\
And Democrats are facing tight races to hang on to most of the 20 seats where the incumbent retired, left or is pursuing another office -- typically the most difficult for a party to defend. Those include two each in Arkansas and Tennessee, and long-shots in Louisiana, Kansas and upstate New York, where Rep. Eric Massa resigned in March amid an investigation into whether he sexually harassed male staffers.
\
Most of the 23 open Republican seats are not regarded as seriously in play, although Democrats have good chances of claiming two being vacated by GOP lawmakers running for the Senate, including one in Delaware now held by Mike Castle and one in the Chicago suburbs held by Mark Kirk.
\
Only a few Republican incumbents are at serious risk in otherwise Democratic districts, including Joseph Cao in New Orleans and Charles Djou in Hawaii. Democrats also believe they have shots at ousting Republican Reps. Dave Reichert in Washington and Lee Terry in Nebraska.
\
As bad as things are for Democrats, they do lead in the money race. However, with their list of endangered incumbents expanding, they face painful choices about which races to abandon in the interest of spending where they realistically can win. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi put out an urgent fundraising appeal Tuesday beseeching supporters to help raise $500,000 by Friday for an ""Emergency Rapid Response"" fund to pay for TV ads defending Democratic candidates.
\
Otherwise, Pelosi wrote, ""we may not have all the resources we need for every race until November.""
\
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the party's House campaign arm, had $36 million in cash at the end of July compared to the National Republican Congressional Committee's $22 million. But the gap has been closing steadily as Election Day nears, and a handful of GOP-backed outside groups have plans to pour tens of millions into House races in the coming weeks. Unions are also planning to funnel large sums into the contests on behalf of Democrats.
\
Democrats have booked $49 million worth of TV advertising time in 60 congressional districts, the vast majority to protect vulnerable Democratic incumbents, while Republicans have reserved $22 million for advertising in 41 districts, all but one now held by Democrats.
\
""The opportunity is there,"" to wrest the House, said Guy Harrison, executive director of the National Republican Congressional Committee. ""We just have to execute.""

Washington
\
When President Obama urged lawmakers during his State of the Union speech to work with him on ""restoring the public trust,"" he was hardly going out on a limb. The Congress he was addressing is one of the least popular in decades. Barely a quarter of Americans approve of the job it's doing, according to the latest Gallup/USA Today poll, while 58 percent said it was below average or one of the worst ever, according to an NBC/Wall Street Journal survey last month.
\
It's not hard to find reasons why Americans are down on Capitol Hill, and why President Obama's approval rating has dropped below 50 percent in many polls. A year into the 111th Congress, unemployment remains at 10 percent, and many Americans are struggling to get by -- even as they've watched Congress bail out banks and coddle the same bankers now salivating over massive new bonuses. At the same time, the public has had a front-row seat to the always messy legislative process on health care and other issues, and this past year that process has been messier, more rancorous and more partisan than at any point in modern memory.
\
There seems to be little to endear citizens to their legislature or to the president trying to influence it. It's too bad, because even with the wrench thrown in by Republican Scott Brown's election in Massachusetts, this Democratic Congress is on a path to become one of the most productive since the Great Society 89th Congress in 1965-66, and Obama already has the most legislative success of any modern president -- and that includes Ronald Reagan and Lyndon Johnson. The deep dysfunction of our politics may have produced public disdain, but it has also delivered record accomplishment.
\
The productivity began with the stimulus package, which was far more than an injection of $787 billion in government spending to jump-start the ailing economy. More than one-third of it -- $288 billion -- came in the form of tax cuts, making it one of the largest tax cuts in history, with sizable credits for energy conservation and renewable-energy production as well as home-buying and college tuition. The stimulus also promised $19 billion for the critical policy arena of health-information technology, and more than $1 billion to advance research on the effectiveness of health-care treatments.
\
Education Secretary Arne Duncan has leveraged some of the stimulus money to encourage wide-ranging reform in school districts across the country. There were also massive investments in green technologies, clean water and a smart grid for electricity, while the $70 billion or more in energy and environmental programs was perhaps the most ambitious advancement in these areas in modern times.
\
As a bonus, more than $7 billion was allotted to expand broadband and wireless Internet access, a step toward the goal of universal access.
\
Any Congress that passed all these items separately would be considered enormously productive. Instead, this Congress did it in one bill. Lawmakers then added to their record by expanding children's health insurance and providing stiff oversight of the TARP funds allocated by the previous Congress.
\
Other accomplishments included a law to allow the FDA to regulate tobacco, the largest land conservation law in nearly two decades, a credit-card holders' bill of rights and defense procurement reform.
\
The House, of course, did much more, including approving a historic cap-and-trade bill and sweeping financial regulatory changes. And both chambers passed their versions of a health-care overhaul. Financial regulation is working its way through the Senate, and even in this political environment it is on track for enactment in the first half of this year. It is likely that the package of job-creation programs the president showcased recently, most of which got through the House last year, will be signed into law early on as well.
\
Most of this has been accomplished without any support from Republicans in either the House or the Senate -- an especially striking fact, since many of the initiatives of the New Deal and the Great Society, including Social Security and Medicare, attracted significant backing from the minority Republicans.
\
---
\
How did it happen? Democrats, perhaps recalling the disasters of 1994, when they failed to unite behind Bill Clinton's agenda in the face of uniform GOP opposition, came together. Obama's smoother beginning and stronger bonds with congressional leaders also helped.
\
But even with robust majorities, Democratic leaders deserve great credit for these achievements. Democratic ideologies stretch from the left-wing views of Bernie Sanders of Vermont in the Senate and Maxine Waters of California in the House to the conservative approach of Ben Nelson of Nebraska in the Senate and Bobby Bright of Alabama in the House, with every variation in between. Finding 219 votes for climate-change legislation in the House was nothing short of astonishing; getting all 60 Senate Democrats to support any version of major health-care reform, an equal feat. The White House strategy -- applying pressure quietly while letting congressional leaders find ways to build coalitions -- was critical.
\
Certainly, the quality of this legislative output is a matter of debate. In fact, some voters, including many independents, are down on Congress precisely because they don't like the accomplishments, which to them smack of too much government intervention and excessive deficits. But I suspect the broader public regards this Congress as committing sins of omission more than commission. Before the State of the Union, the stimulus was never really sold in terms of its substantive measures; it just looked like money thrown at a problem in the usual pork-barrel way. And many Americans, hunkering down in bad times, may not accept the notion of ""countercyclical"" economic policies, in which the government spends more just when citizens are cutting back.
\
Most of the specific new policies -- such as energy conservation and protection for public lands -- enjoy solid and broad public support. But many voters discount them simply because they were passed or proposed by unpopular lawmakers. In Massachusetts, people who enthusiastically support their state's health-care system were hostile to the very similar plan passed by Congress. Why? Because it was a product of Congress.
\
Well before Sen.-elect Brown's Bay State upset, it was clear that a sterling legislative record in the first half of the 111th Congress did not guarantee continuing action in 2010 or beyond. And now, Democrats' success at keeping 59 senators in line means little if they cannot find someone on the other side willing to become vote No. 60. With Republicans ebullient over the Massachusetts election, the likelihood is that they will feel vindicated in their ""just say no"" strategy, Obama's leadership lectures notwithstanding.
\
If the mid-term elections in November turn out to be more like 1994, when Democrats got hammered, than 1982, when Republicans suffered a less costly blow, the GOP will probably be emboldened to double down on its opposition to everything, trying to bring the Obama presidency to its knees on the way to 2012. That would mean real gridlock in the face of a serious crisis. Given the precarious coalitions in our otherwise dysfunctional politics, we could go quickly from one of the most productive Congresses in our lifetimes to the most obstructionist.
\
And voters would probably like that even less.

A newcomer's view of Vermont Yankee
\
Editor of the Reformer:
\
As a new addition to the town of Brattleboro, I have grown to love the people, stores and atmosphere here. Brattleboro and the surrounding towns seem to be an excellent representation of Vermont. The welcoming nature and kindness of my neighbors was a wonderful surprise.
\
My job as an engineer with Entergy Vermont Yankee has given me the opportunity to become a Vermonter. As a prior U.S. Navy nuclear machinist mate for more than eight years, I was pleased to see how much Vermont Yankee stressed safety and compliance to procedure.
\
The level of commitment to meticulous operation of the plant and the ownership taken by Vermont Yankee's employees is unparalleled and easily matches the diligence that I was used to in the military.
\
Vermont Yankee is an asset to Vermont. The people of Vermont will not find a better combination when it comes to work ethic and safety coupled with efficient energy production providing great rates.
\
I urge everyone to get informed and get the questions they have answered before forming opinions. Being a newcomer to Vermont and to Vermont Yankee, my opinions have come from seeing the day to day operations and interacting with other employees. I have not been disappointed and can confidently state that relicensing Vermont Yankee will be beneficial to the environment and the people of Vermont.

Robotic inspections at VY is a example of innovation
\
Editor of the Reformer:
\
Is it possible to increase U.S. energy production and still reduce greenhouse-gas emissions? More than possible, it is essential. How better to achieve that than to improve the performance of existing nuclear power plants, which are carbon-free, and build more plants?
\
Environmentalists swear this can't be done, and some politicians and pundits are skeptical; they don't believe the nuclear industry has the technology nor the expertise and discipline to make it happen. In fact, the growth of nuclear power is realistic. Notwithstanding criticism from opponents, nuclear power's comeback does not require construction of a national repository for nuclear waste, but it does require storing used fuel in concrete-and steel casks at regional sites, where the casks can be monitored for the next 300 years.
\
It is surprising how little notice has been taken of nuclear industry innovation right here in New England. Now, with the use of robotics, inspectors at the Vermont Yankee plant are able to get a close-up view of the steam dryer, which has been of some concern because of non-threatening age cracks. The robots enable them to inspect hundreds of welds at a safe distance from outside the reactor building. One of the robots travels on a rail-and-trolley system with a telescoping mast and camera. Another uses a small submarine for under-water inspections. These remotely-operated robots were designed, built and tested by Areva, a nuclear company, working with Entergy Nuclear Vermont Yankee, which won an award for this development.
\
Before robots came along to do much of the work, inspectors stood on either side of the reactor pool and conducted the inspections manually, using cameras mounted on long poles. Now, with robotic inspections, the quality of the inspections is much better. The result has been improved safety margins while doing the inspections with fewer people in less time.
\
Innovations like this are helping the nuclear industry become the most reliable source of carbon-free energy. Developing ways to improve the performance of nuclear plants is a high priority as companies like Entergy apply to renew operating licenses at existing plants and prepare to build additional reactors in order to meet projected growth in demand for electricity.
\
As it is, U.S. nuclear plants, on average, are operating more than 90 percent of the time, and that includes Vermont Yankee, which is one of the best performing power plants in the country.
\
Electricity will become more and more important in our economy In addition to the normal growth in demand, switching to carbon-free energy sources means that we will need to generate that electricity in ways that do not contribute to climate change. Technological advances such as robotic inspections are helping to make this happen.

Entergy is committed to keeping its promises
\
Editor of the Reformer:
\
You may have missed it in the news, but something very important happened on Aug. 13.Entergy, the owners of my employer, the Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant, agreed to commit an additional $51 million towards decommissioning.
\
If money talks - and we all know it does - this announcement speaks volumes about the company's commitment. Let's not forget that concern about the decommissioning fund was heightened by traumatic events on Wall Street. As the market has rebounded, so has the fund's worth.
\
I think it's time for the Legislature to drop its effort to pass a decommissioning bill that only makes it harder to relicense the plant, and let the federal and state regulators do what they are fully empowered to do: make sure that when the plant's days of producing low-carbon, affordable power are over, it will be fully decommissioned.

RGGI is effective in fighting global warming
\
Editor of the Reformer:
\
The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) has clarified what the Vermont Energy Partnership has been saying for years: the Vermont Yankee nuclear power station, the largest in-state electric power facility, is a ""good guy"" in the fight against global warming.
\
RGGI, a 10-state effort to reduce global warming by ""cap and trade,"" considers both Hydro Quebec and Vermont Yankee as zero CO2 emitters. Common sense says relicensing Vermont Yankee would be Vermont's greatest gift to the reduction of global warming. Closing Vermont Yankee would force us to purchase high-carbon fossil fuel electricity from the New England power market. There's simply not enough low-carbon, baseload power available to replace Vermont Yankee's 270 megawatts.
\
I am baffled that some ""green"" advocates would in effect lead us backwards. Vermonters are proud of our environmental achievements. Keeping Hydro-Quebec and Vermont Yankee electricity would preserve our strong environmental record.
\
Vermont receives $2-$3 million annually in RGGI greenhouse gas credits. An August 2009 Partnership study (www.vtep.org) determined that replacing Vermont Yankee with natural gas power - the most-used fuel of the New England power grid - would cost ratepayers about $3 million annually in RGGI ""carbon taxes.""
\
We can continue to receive millions from RGGI and pay nothing in carbon taxes through continued partnerships with Vermont Yankee and Hydro Quebec.

Global warming is a total fraud and it's how liberals are going to hand off the United States to a global government that will control every aspect of our lives. No, we don't really believe that, but we are paraphrasing Dana Rohrbacher (R-Calif.), a senior member of the House Science Committee, who said that during a Newport Mesa Tea Party meeting last week.
\
""It's step by step by step, more and bigger control over our lives by higher levels of government. And global warming is that strategy in spades,"" said Rohrbacher. ""Our freedom to make our choices on transportation and everything else? No, that's gotta be done by a government official who, by the way, probably comes from Nigeria because he's a UN government official, not a U.S.government official.""
\
As Lee Fang, writing for The Nation noted, such hyperbole is not new to Rohrbacher.
\
""In the past, he's suggested that global warming has been caused by everything from dinosaur flatulence to rainforests -- pretty much everything except the fossil fuel industries that provide Rohrbacher with campaign donations,"" wrote Fang. ""Rohrbacher is one of many lawmakers who, despite living in a state reeling from climate disasters, denies the basic science of anthropogenic global warming.""
\
At his town hall meeting, Rohrbacher went on to point the finger of blame at government-funded scientists who have received ""so much money"" for research that ""they have used it to intimidate people who disagree with their attempt to frighten all of us into changing our lives and giving up our freedoms to make choices.""
\
Those scientists include members of the American Meteorological Society, which last week released its annual ""State of the Climate"" report.
\
""Many of the events that made 2012 such an interesting year are part of the long-term trends we see in a changing and varying climate -- carbon levels are climbing, sea levels are rising, Arctic sea ice is melting, and our planet as a whole is becoming a warmer place,"" said Kathryn Sullivan, the acting administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
\
We bet Rohrbacher doesn't put any faith in that report or a study conducted by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley and Princeton University, which found even minor departures from normal temperatures or rainfall can increase the risk of conflict by 50 percent.
\
But if Rohrbacher doesn't trust those bastions of liberal elitism, he might ask the Pentagon what it thinks. Daniel Chiu, the deputy assistant secretary of the Department of Defense, recently revealed DoD is adjusting some of its planning based on climate change's potential impact on food, water and migration patterns.
\
""Although the effects of climate change alone do not cause conflict, they act as accelerants of instability, which influences our operating environment roles and mission.""
\
Climate change deniers span the spectrum from Rohrbacher to small-state think tanks, such as the Caesar Rodney Institute, which recently criticized the science behind Delaware's Climate Change Vulnerability and Risk Assessment
\
In 2009, CRI sponsored an online petition opposing cap and trade and other programs to cut carbon emissions ""based on unproven fears of man-made global warming.""
\
Delaware's Deputy State Environmental Chief David Small is not buying CRI's rhetoric.
\
""The science on this matter is settled and it is our responsibility to get on with the business of preparing Delaware for the future,"" he said. ""We have felt the impacts of rising sea levels and need to be considering how our state, citizens, natural resources and infrastructure could be affected by extreme weather events over the long term.""
\
CRI, as are many other critics of legitimate climate-change science, is a member of the State Policy Network, which Rebecca Wilce, writing for PR Watch, characterized as a right-wing think tank sponsored by billionaires and corporations to push the American Legislative Exchange Council's agenda in legislatures around the country.
\
According to SourceWatch, ALEC drafts legislation meant to ""undermine environmental regulations and deny climate change, support school privatization, undercut health care reform, defund unions and limit their political influence, restrain legislatures' abilities to raise revenue through taxes, mandate strict election laws that disenfranchise voters, increase incarceration to benefit the private prison industry, among many other issues.""
\
Right-wing luminaries who fund ALEC include the inimitable Koch Brothers, Peter Coors, the John Olin Foundation, Richard Scaife, and the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation. Corporate donors include ExxonMobil, Altria (formerly Phillip Morris), AT&T, Bayer, Coca-Cola, GlaxoSmithKline, Kraft Food, State Farm and Wal-Mart, a veritable rogue's gallery bent on maintaining the status quo to protect their bottom line.
\
But the corporations, money-bag elitists and legislators who insist on staying the course to human extinction may have met their match in the World Bank, which is shifting its focus on to climate change.
\
Rachel Kyte, the bank's vice president of sustainable development, told the National Journal that to achieve its mission to end poverty, it must find a way to slow or reverse the rate of climate change. If nothing is done to avert the coming catastrophe, said Kyte, ""It's going to be extraordinarily difficult for the poor, who are the least resilient, to be part of the growth and opportunity story over the next few decades if climate change is unabated.""
\
The World Bank is promoting strategies to help developing countries invest in their own resilience and in low-carbon developments, said Kyte. She also told the National Journal that climate change is having an impact on the developed world.
\
""The succession of storm events, droughts, the cycle of fires have enormous economic dislocation,"" she said. ""Beyond just the extreme weather events, in which insurance costs can be calculated, there are costs in not planning to accommodate the increased intensity and frequency of some of these events. One superstorm is one thing, but if you now expect the superstorm to hit on a more intensive or more regular basis, not planning for that is an economic folly.""
\
While there might be some short-term pain, said Kyte, the long-term benefits are immeasurable, and that includes increased economic stability, better jobs and well-being of our families.
\
""If you're concerned about your children's health, your own health, your grandchildren's health, if you're concerned about the job your child's going to get, if you're concerned about where your grandchildren are going to live -- this is front of mind,"" said Kyte.
\
Which side of history will you find yourself on, Rep. Rohrbacher? We're betting you and your ilk will be remembered 100 years from now with dumbfounded awe, and not in a good sort of way. But approbation for Rohrbacher and his merry gang of climate-change denials will only happen if we've taken the steps necessary to confront the slow-ticking time bomb that will define the fate of the human race. If we don't, there might not be many people around to hold them up for contempt.

Washington
\
Dozens of college students murdered in their classrooms; a member of Congress shot at point-blank range; innocents gunned down in a movie theater. Then, in the aftermath of a mass gun crime, the same ritual: national shock and anger, traumatized communities asking how this could happen, followed by ... nothing. At least, no progress on gun safety.
\
In a speech to the Urban League following the Colorado shooting, President Obama called for a conversation on youth violence and more steps to keep guns away from criminals and the mentally ill. But everyone, including Obama, has been pretty frank about it: No major new gun laws will result.
\
However, in Washington, nothing is ever as immovable as it seems.
\
The key is to understand how intractable problems are ultimately dislodged -- not by a single, seismic event, but by a slow shift in politics.
\
Consider three categories of intractable issues and the forces that have gotten them unstuck.
\
One reason for paralysis is that politicians fear the consequences of taking on powerful, well-financed organizations such as, when it comes to guns, the National Rifle Association. The gun lobby dramatically outspends gun-control advocates and has a long record of successfully opposing politicians who cross it.
\
Still, even a heavyweight institution can be sidelined when a problem becomes too large. The AARP has long been regarded as an invincible opponent of Social Security reform. But in the early 1980s, Social Security was nearing collapse. In 1981, the Social Security trustees issued a report warning that the system would be ""unable to make benefit payments on time beginning in the latter half of 1982"" and that it would run out of money by the middle of 1983. A bipartisan group of lawmakers began to explore the idea of making changes to Social Security, but the AARP stood firm.
\
A commission led by Alan Greenspan recommended fixes to Social Security in January 1983, and the AARP fought the proposals vigorously. The group argued that rather than change benefits or payroll taxes, Congress should raise other taxes and give that revenue to Social Security. It ran ads and urged its thousands of volunteer leaders to swamp Congress with letters, calls and visits. But the scale and immediacy of the problem moved President Ronald Reagan and congressional Democrats to take on the matter squarely, cut a deal on reforms and put in place a long-term fix.
\
Sometimes a consensus of experts raises an alarm, but Washington tunes them out. In the case of guns, the experts are police chiefs and mayors in cities plagued with gun crime, who almost uniformly support tougher gun laws, to little avail in Congress.
\
But expert voices can start to ring louder on Capitol Hill when the data move into the public's consciousness. In the 1960s, a small band of scientists began to notice the impact of acid rain -- pollutants emitted by power plants, most in the Midwest, were being carried by winds to the Northeast, where they were damaging waterways and forests.
\
This problem was hard for the non-expert to spot. Only scientists understood that there were rising levels of hydrogen ions in the rain. They saw the trends and understood the significance, even if the public did not -- like a minor cough that seems innocuous but to a doctor's ear could be an early sign of lung disease.
\
The scientists' warnings were ignored in the policy debate. No one did anything for more than a decade. But their concerns eventually began to move from academic journals and niche magazines into the mainstream. The public finally took notice of reports showing that many lakes in New England were so acidic, they no longer could support fish and other wildlife. And they connected the dots between lakes in New Hampshire and power plants in Ohio.
\
This steady accumulation of the scientific consensus ultimately became too big for politicians to ignore. Congress and the president responded, and in 1990, they enacted amendments to the Clean Air Act instituting a cap-and-trade system to control acid rain pollutants. The system has worked, and acid rain has been dramatically reduced.
\
Perhaps the most obvious reason for stasis in Washington is when public opinion runs counter to a policy change. Few elected officials will risk the wrath of voters on hot-button issues.
\
In the gun debate, large majorities of voters favor particular changes to laws, such as banning assault weapons or high-capacity ammunition magazines. But polls also show that they're skeptical that such changes would affect the right people or reduce gun crime. A Washington Post poll last year found that 57 percent of Americans thought that tougher enforcement of existing laws was a better way to reduce gun crime versus 29 percent who favored passing new laws. And focus groups have long found that many voters are turned off by elected officials who call for new gun laws. So politicians are generally right to think that gun control makes bad politics.
\
Yet voters reserve the right to change their minds. When he ran for president in 1992, Bill Clinton vowed that he would lift the ban on gay men and women serving openly in the military, and upon taking office, he tried to do it. But he met opposition in the Pentagon and in Congress, fueled by polls showing that the public opposed the change. Clinton was forced into a face-saving compromise -- ""don't ask, don't tell"" -- that kept the ban in place.
\
Over time, though, the politics of gay rights began to shift. By 2010, when Obama persuaded Congress to scrap ""don't ask, don't tell"" and lift the ban, a majority of voters said they supported its repeal. And even members of Congress who opposed the move mounted only a halfhearted campaign when the measure came up for a vote.
\
What this recent history shows is that Washington is rarely shocked into action. Galvanizing events can change the tone briefly: Congress adopted bipartisan seating at the State of the Union address after the shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., for instance. But even really big surprises rarely lead to major political change. We no longer see many Sputnik moments.
\
Rather, change is slow and cumulative. It takes time for a problem to boil over, for expert consensus to pierce the fog of denial, for public opinion to shift decisively.
\
We see this process today on the same issues: Social Security, the environment and gay rights. The AARP still opposes significant changes to Social Security, but as the potential for catastrophic fiscal failure becomes more real, prospects for reform are improving. The scientific consensus is solid on global warming, and as the weather grows more destructive, demands for action will likely become too loud to ignore. And even though the public has voted in 31 states to ban same-sex marriage, the national mood is changing, raising the odds that the Defense of Marriage Act eventually will be swept away.
\
So, too, on guns. It may be that nothing revolutionary or evolutionary will soon alter the gun debate. There are nearly 300 million guns in private hands in this country, and the Supreme Court has affirmed that the Second Amendment confers the right to own guns on most law-abiding adults. And the power of the NRA is real.
\
But when we ran a group called Americans for Gun Safety, we found reason for hope. We worked with Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., following the Columbine tragedy, because he was tired of doing nothing to prevent gun deaths. Together, we wrote legislation that would close a loophole in the law allowing people to obtain guns without background checks at gun shows. It reached the Senate floor in 2004 and passed as an amendment to another bill, but it was scuttled by NRA supporters.
\
McCain took a lot of grief for his stance. After he appeared in our television ads in Colorado promoting changes to close that state's gun show loophole, the NRA featured him on the cover of its magazine drawn as the devil.
\
Sadly, when McCain ran for president again in 2008, he reverted to the NRA's point of view. He knew it would be virtually impossible for him to win the GOP nomination if he was opposed by the most powerful interest group in conservative politics.
\
McCain's heresy on guns was short-lived. But rather than see it as a depressing truth about the power of the NRA, we see it as proof that virtually nothing is impossible in American politics.
\
Even mountains will eventually be moved, but that takes the work of years, not a moment of shock or pain.

81,"
Concord -- State Sen. Bob Odell, R-Lempster, was meeting Tuesday with youth-services advocates looking for his support in reversing House cuts to programs for troubled children and day care for the working poor, and the room was thick with budget lingo.
\
Odell was steeped in the acronyms -- CHINS, or children in need of services, and TANF, or Temporary Assistance to Needy Families -- but he cut to the core when the talk turned to shelters for adolescents who might otherwise be declared juvenile delinquents and sent to youth detention centers.
\
""The shelters are important to me. I drive by one every day,"" Odell said, referring to a shelter for boys in Bradford, N.H.
\
The discussion, one of a multitude on the New Hampshire budget that Odell is having these days, showed two other essential truths about the Claremont-area Republican.
\
As the chairman of the Senate Ways and Means Committee and vice chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Odell is a major player in budget negotiations in Concord.
\
And, as a moderate Republican who has long been allied with Democratic Gov. John Lynch, the 67-year-old Odell is a pragmatist who offers a counterweight to the more-ideologically driven budget writers in the House.
\
The big question -- which may become clearer later this week -- is whether Odell can find enough revenue to help the Senate restore some of the substantial cuts included in the House budget.
\
Former Democratic state Rep. John DeJoie, who was in the meeting with Odell as a lobbyist for the Children's Alliance of New Hampshire, said Odell was respected on both sides of the aisle.
\
""He is someone who is very driven by facts, but he also understands that behind the facts, behind the numbers, there are real human lives that are impacted, and the state is impacted by decisions that they are making now,"" said DeJoie, who sat on the House Finance Committee and is also a Concord firefighter.
\
""He's not dogmatic. He's a Republican, and very proud to be a Republican, but he's also someone who understands he has to make decisions for his constituents,"" DeJoie added.
\
Two years ago, when Democrats controlled the Legislature, Odell proved to be the critical swing vote to pass a budget that otherwise would have failed on a 12-12 tie. And when Lynch was a freshman governor in his first months in office in 2005, Odell supported his education funding plan designed to target more aid to needier communities.
\
In a Statehouse interview last week, Lynch said Odell, now in his fifth term in the state Senate, puts party labels aside.
\
""Bob Odell has always been candid with me. He's very nonpartisan. He looks at problems for what they are, and he's very much into trying to solve problems and do what's best for the people of New Hampshire,"" Lynch said. ""Bob is very much like that -- I try to be like that -- and I think that has made us allies.""
\
At the same time, Odell is also close to Senate President Peter Bragdon, a Milford Republican, a point reinforced by the fact that Odell's office is in Bragdon's leadership suite.
\
A Collaborative Approach
\
Odell's schedule on Tuesday was illustrative of the many forces -- and factions -- he is trying to juggle.
\
After the hour-and-15 minute drive in a Subaru that Odell makes most days from Lempster, he met with environmental activists concerned about cuts to the state's rivers and lakes program; testified before the House Finance Committee about his bill supporting innovative tax credits for community redevelopment projects; heard from Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center lobbyists looking to restore $55 million in uncompensated care payments to hospitals; and briefly fielded a call from a supporter of medical marijuana.
\
That was followed by the session with the youth-services advocates, a GOP leadership meeting in Bragdon's office, and then lunch -- Odell ate fruit cup and bisque at the Statehouse cafeteria -- with state Liquor Commission Chairman Joe Mollica.
\
Odell and Mollica, a Sunapee resident, discussed how New Hampshire can combat a repeal of a sales tax on liquor in Massachusetts that is threatening to cut into sales near the Bay State border.
\
Then, at 1 p.m., Odell chaired an hour-long Senate Ways and Means Committee hearing to get an update on fiscal year 2011 revenue, met for half an hour with a reporter, then headed to a Senate Republican caucus to discuss strategy for upcoming bills.
\
Odell said he tries to find a collaborative approach.
\
""My philosophy in government is we are stewards of the people's tax money, and government is here to serve people who can't serve themselves, need an assist, and maybe it's temporary, and maybe it's long-term,"" Odell said. ""And government should be run very efficiently, and we should be a low-tax environment, and I believe that we ought to be able to come together. I don't put down markers and say, never will I go over there or there.""
\
His approach, especially in enlisting Lynch, has proven to be especially important for constituent service in his 21-town 8th state Senate district, which includes property-poor towns like Newport and Claremont, rural towns in Sullivan and Cheshire counties, and the wealthy lake towns of Sunapee, New London and Newbury.
\
Claremont City Manager Guy Santagate said Odell had been repeatedly helpful to the city, working to restore state funding for the district court in Opera House Square, encouraging Lynch to bring Granite State College to Pleasant Street in Claremont, and backing redevelopment of the old mills along the Sugar River.
\
""He's a predictable guy. There are no wild swings there. He's been a voice of reason,"" Santagate said. ""He's got a very strong finance background, and it shows in the budget process that he is one of the most powerful people in Concord.""
\
Odell also enjoys a solid working relationship, and friendship, with Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Morse, a Salem Republican who also sits on Ways and Means, and who in the past has favored expanding gambling in New Hampshire, which Odell adamantly opposes. While it's Odell's committee that determines the amount of money available for the budget, the Finance panel makes the actual spending decisions that are brought to the full Senate.
\
""He's a legislator that puts a lot of work into everything he does,"" Morse said of Odell. ""He just doesn't stop, and you can guarantee if he does something, it's been looked at to the nth degree, and I respect him greatly for that.""
\
Asked about Odell's stance as a moderate, Morse said: ""Does he vote different at times? I respect what he does. ... He's told me dozens of times that he represents a different community, and I respect that.""
\
Revenue Questions
\
The most pressing question on Odell's plate is where revenues will end up in fiscal year 2011, which ends June 30, and which in turn forms the base for building a budget for fiscal years 2012 and 2013.
\
Lynch this winter proposed a two-year budget of just under $10.7 billion that cut more than $200 million from current spending, but House Republicans said he was far too optimistic about the state's revenue situation.
\
In late March, they approved a budget that cut $519 million more from the governor's proposal with sweeping reductions across state government. Interest groups, social service agencies, state employee unions and local officials are all looking to the state Senate to restore some of the cuts.
\
But almost two weeks ago, April revenues were almost $30 million below projections, leading to a total potential shortfall of $47 million, though the Lynch administration has said it will end the year with a balanced budget.
\
Odell last week signaled there is little basis for rosy projections, at least in the short-term, citing high gas prices and sluggish home sales that are hurting economic growth.
\
""From my perspective, I'm much more optimistic about fiscal year 2013 than I am for fiscal year 2012,"" Odell said after the Senate Ways and Means hearing. ""We will make what I would call conservative but responsible projections.""
\
Those forecasts will have a wide impact across New Hampshire.
\
DHMC's Vice President of Government Relations Frank McDougall, for instance, was meeting with Odell, along with fellow DHMC lobbyist Gina Balkus, in a bid to restore $55 million in uncompensated care funding to hospitals, which would help bring in federal matching funds and provide about $37 million to DHMC, the largest provider in New Hampshire.
\
Odell asked McDougall to draft a prospective amendment, and said he would discuss it with Morse.
\
McDougall, a former secretary of commerce in Vermont who served in both a Republican and a Democratic administration, said there is no question that Odell is ""a very significant player in Concord.
\
""He's bright, he understands the process, he's a good listener. He asks really good questions, and makes you feel like you are going to be part of the solution with him, and is respected on both sides of the aisle, which in these days is a rare commodity,"" McDougall said.
\
Odell also knows how to pick his battles.
\
As chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Odell was a central vote last week to reform -- rather than repeal outright -- New Hampshire's participation in a regional greenhouse gas emission cap-and-trade program, which most of his GOP colleagues wanted to scrap.
\
But he also had to cede ground on other environmental programs.
\
The environmental activists he met with on Tuesday wanted to get him to try to restore two staff positions that the House had cut from the state's rivers and lakes programs. When one of them said the program was under ""duress,"" Odell said it didn't compare to the needy families who might suffer from cuts in health and human services, according to Charlestown resident Sharon Francis, who was part of the meeting.
\
Francis, the former executive director of the Connecticut River Joint Commissions whose environmental credentials stretch back to her service in Lyndon Johnson's White House, said it was clear Odell felt he ""can't afford to waste effort on something that is going to lose"" with his colleagues, a realpolitik she respects.
\
""It was very clear that the Senate Finance Committee is operating in just an extremely tight situation, and he made it clear that obviously he cares about the program, he knows about it, and in a different world would be all for it, but given the kinds of cuts he has to make, it's not possible,"" Francis said.
\
From Politics to Policy
\
Odell's voting record also shows how he straddles the partisan divide.
\
He voted in March for a proposed constitutional amendment on school funding to more easily target aid, but made clear that he believes the state still has a responsibility to provide an adequate education for all students, a critical issue for a district that includes Claremont.
\
""This one clearly states that the state has a responsibility, and that's really key, because we can't walk away from our responsibility,"" he said at the time. ""There are those who don't believe the state has a responsibility -- I'm not one of those people.""
\
He joined Democrats in opposing a GOP bill that would require voters to produce a photo ID at the polls or otherwise submit to what Odell likened to a ""mug shot,"" saying the bill was antithetical to New Hampshire's small-town character and would have a ""chilling effect"" on some voters.
\
Odell also has declined to support a Republican bill aimed at directing the New Hampshire attorney general to join a federal lawsuit against President Obama's health care law, saying it runs counter to the separation of powers.
\
But he has voted for a major reform of the state retirement system and, this year, also voted for a right-to-work bill, which unions opposed and Lynch vetoed last week. Odell himself had opposed it in the past.
\
""This year was different. I felt I could have gone either way, but in the end I was getting direct communication, one-on-one, from major private employers in the area. They rarely ask me to do anything for them -- I think they expect me to be a good senator, do my job, stay in touch -- but they felt strongly about this. ... These are well-known businesses, these people have never been involved before, and I felt compelled to listen to them,"" Odell said.
\
The vote has disappointed some members of the labor community, including former state Rep. Larry Converse, who is also the chairman of Claremont Democrats.
\
""I really can't say he's done anything positive to make me vote for him,"" said Converse, who said Odell is a moderate when he needs to be. ""He doesn't do probably 50 percent of what the Democrats want him to do, but then he has to get re-elected, too.""
\
Other Democrats are more forgiving.
\
State Rep. Susan Almy, a Lebanon Democrat who chaired the House Ways and Means Committee when her party was in power, said Odell cares both about services and employers.
\
""I think he's got his feet very well grounded in the state reality, and his local reality,"" Almy said.
\
Odell's ability to serve as a bridge between parties is also valued by some Republicans.
\
""Isn't that what we want? We want people who can work with people from both sides of the aisle, or within different factions of their party, because we are in a difficult situation here, and we've got to find solutions that are real,"" said state Rep. Charlene Lovett, a first-term Republican who also sits on the Claremont School Board.
\
D.C. and Back
\
Odell's status as a quiet force in the Legislature follows a long and profitable career, albeit behind the scenes, as a major fundraiser for Republicans across the country.
\
Odell grew up in Milford, N.H. -- his father pumped gas and did other blue-collar jobs at a car dealership -- and he had applied to the University of New Hampshire, but didn't get in. Instead, he graduated from American University in Washington, D.C., in 1966.
\
Though he didn't work for the Nixon campaign, Odell wound up working for the Republican National Committee, where he was finance director from 1969 to 1974, working under three RNC chairmen, including George H.W. Bush and Bob Dole.
\
""That's when we really moved the party -- we did a lot of major donors -- but we really moved into the direct mail business, and the telephone marketing. That was just the right time, direct mail was hot, we were hot, and every year we would be breaking records,"" Odell said.
\
Odell even appeared in a CBS report by Dan Rather from early 1972 about the Nixon and Republican fundraising machinery, a story that also features a young Karl Rove, then lining up college Republicans.
\
Ever the technocrat, even at 28, Odell tells Rather that the use of computerized mailing lists and direct mail targeting grass-roots Republican supporters marked a new era.
\
""My feeling is that this is the way of the future in political finance. This is the way that the political parties in the future are going to be funded,"" Odell says in the clip, now viewable on YouTube. ""I think that the tax reform bill in 1971 will be an important incentive to encourage the individuals to participate in this manner.""
\
When Rather asks why this is better, Odell earnestly replies, ""It places less reliance on a few individuals, and greater reliance and responsibility, as a democracy should, on a broad spectrum of the American public.""
\
When Bush left the RNC for a diplomatic post in China in 1974, Odell took up an offer to create a private firm raising money for Republicans.
\
Now known as Odell, Simms & Lynch -- no relation to the New Hampshire governor -- and based in suburban Virginia, the firm has provided a comfortable living for Odell, who is listed as founder and chairman of the company and still receives income from its operations.
\
The company provided fundraising support for numerous GOP campaigns, including Bush's presidential campaign in 1988. The company today still processes receipts for the RNC and the National Republican Senatorial Committee and National Republican Congressional Committee, but has also branched out to include fundraising for nonprofits such as the 9-11 memorial at the Pentagon and the Gettysburg National Battlefield Museum Foundation. Odell, Simms & Lynch also has done work for economic development agencies around the world, such as providing ""market intelligence services"" for the London Development Agency.
\
But his focus began to turn toward life in New Hampshire more than 20 years ago when he bought an old farmhouse and close to 100 acres near Hurd Pond in Lempster, intending to use it as a weekend getaway. Long divorced, Odell began dating Sandy Biuso, the interior decorator he had hired, and took her to the first President Bush's inaugural in 1989.
\
The couple eventually married in 1996 and settled into the Lempster farmhouse, where she tended chickens, sheep and pigs. Odell decided to run for the House in 2000, after he became disturbed that state regulators wanted a major employer in Charlestown to install a deer tunnel under Route 12, which he and others considered unnecessary, then two years later unseated state Sen. George Disnard, a popular Democrat from Claremont.
\
He and Sandy also bought a small lake house on Little Sunapee Road in New London in 2007 for $919,000, according to assessing records, another sign that Odell's career as a fundraiser was a lucrative one.
\
Sandy Odell, who shared her husband's sunny personality, died after a yearlong battle with ovarian cancer in 2009, but Odell remains close to her two daughters, as well as his two children, a daughter who is an art history professor at Lewis & Clark College, and a son in South Dakota.
\
Odell said he enjoys ""goofing around"" at his lake house, mowing the pastures in Lempster, and reading history books -- he's a fan of Lincoln, Churchill and Eisenhower in particular.
\
He also said he enjoys traveling and one day will ""happily pass the mantle on,"" but for now enjoys a sold command of his Senate seat.
\
He made clear that the challenges of the state budget, and the discussion about the children in need of services, are the type of issues that motivate him.
\
""I grew up being in the operations side of politics, and now I've become kind of a policy wonk. I don't want to overstate that, but I take a lot of interest because I feel strongly about"" the families in need, he said.
\
""That is real serious business, and we have 400 kids who have had a problem and when we don't support that program, these kids are going to be in welfare offices and arrested and found to be delinquent,"" Odell said. ""That's a plague, because then there are burglaries, and things go south. That ruins families. That ruins a state.
\
""But on the other hand,"" he continued, ""I'm not sure where we find the money.""

82,"Vermont history is replete with examples of Vermonters recognizing when it is time to change business as usual. For example, years ago burning trash -- long a Vermont tradition -- was recognized as a practice that was harmful both to the environment and to the health of our citizens. Banning the practice was a common sense solution. More recently, we required proper disposal of used tires and motor oil.\Despite these important steps, today's biggest single contribution to air pollution in Vermont -- the burning of fossil fuels -- continues unchecked. The coalition known as Energy Independent Vermont, of which the Vermont Sierra Club and its 3,000 members are proudly members, believes the time has come to account for the carbon pollution released by burning fossil fuels. The environmental damage resulting from this pollution has a monetary cost and it is not small. Prices for a ton of airborne carbon pollution (including estimates from Exxon Mobil and the U.S. government) range from $40 to $109 . This is money we are all already tacitly paying in the form of a degraded environment and increased health risks.\Imagine a neighbor who, accidentally or not, pollutes a stream, pond or aquifer that impacts your day-to-day life. Your access to safe drinking water, a clean place to swim, healthy fish to catch and maybe even the value of your home would likely be negatively impacted. Would you not expect the polluter to ""make it right?"" The notion of ""if you make a mess, you have the responsibility to clean it up"" is a Vermont value that has already been applied in several environmental arenas. Why then permit those responsible for the carbon pollution that damages our air, climate and health to walk away scot-free?\This is money that we are already spending in the form of environmental degradation. It is as if a dirty neighbor spills toxins on a shoreline and the neighborhood pays for clean up in order to preserve property values. At what point should the polluter be held responsible for the damage? Some will argue that a tax on carbon pollution -- in the form of a fee per ton, paid at the distribution level -- will simply be passed on to consumers in the form of higher fuel prices. But what if the fees collected by the state, at the distributor level, are returned to Vermonters in a way that (a) encourages conservation, (b) makes adjustments for household income and (c) pays for energy efficiency?\Several benefits\Such a carbon pollution tax would benefit Vermont in several ways (source: based on material from Regional Economic Models Inc.\1. Funds, ranging upward from $35 million per year in 2018, would be put into tax cuts, green jobs, home weatherization, energy improvements, and would include special compensation for those most in need.\2. The money we are already spending on pollution-related damage would be recouped from those responsible -- the out-of-state oil companies that take Vermont money and cart it out of state.\3. A new incentive for cleaner transportation would be created.\4. Cleaner sources of heat, drawing on Vermont's relatively clean sources of electricity, could be promoted, with rebates for Vermonters and Vermont businesses most in need.\5. Much of the nearly $2 billion per year that Vermonters spend on fuel for heating and transportation -- only to see it go out of state -- would remain in state.\6. Future generations would recognize Vermont's lead in creating a green economy. The made-in-Vermont label would become even more valuable.\Our Legislature has a golden opportunity to do right, not just by the environment, but by the economy as well. Rebates structured to compensate low-income Vermonters and reward those who burn little or no fuel can be structured in a manner that is fair and forward thinking. A polluter-funded Energy Independence Fund that supports weatherization, efficiency, clean energy and green jobs is an idea whose time has come. Let's reaffirm the Vermont belief that those who make a mess should be held accountable for paying the cleaning bill. The time is now.\David Ellenbogen of Calais the vice chairman of the Vermont Sierra Club."

Case for a Carbon Tax
\
To the Editor:
\
The Valley News ran a Bloomberg View editorial Nov. 30 that said, ""the best climate policies rely on a carbon tax.""
\
I hope this opinion gains increasing visibility and support in the Twin States. This is an opportunity for historic regional cooperation.
\
New Hampshire and Vermont have strikingly different approaches to the taxation needed to fund their governments and serve their people. Both states do a remarkably good job. Nonetheless, different tax policies act as a brake on each state's efforts to improve its own situation. For example, Vermont's bottle bill was a highly successful motivator in 1973 when it was first implemented at 5 cents a bottle. It is no longer much of a motivator, since in 2015 it is stuck at 5 cents. Retailers on the Vermont side of the Connecticut are afraid of losing customers to New Hampshire retailers should the bottle deposit quadruple as the cost of living has, so the deposit hasn't gone up for 42 years.
\
Unlike a single state's bottle policies, an aggressive effort to limit fossil fuel emissions -- a carbon tax -- would address the global problem of unsustainable atmospheric CO2 levels and global climate change. Every citizen on this Earth is challenged by climate change.
\
Concurrent, linked efforts by Vermont and New Hampshire would mitigate cross-border tax inhibitions. Their cooperation could inspire a larger regional effort and even a national or international tax on fossil fuels.
\
At every level of jurisdiction -- state, regional, national or international -- the tax receipts from a carbon tax could be used to create jobs, to promote investment in renewable energy development and to decrease property taxes.
\
I salute the Valley News for publishing Bloomberg View's endorsement of a carbon tax.

Ways to Help Refugees
\
To the Editor:
\
This fall, a number of individuals from across the Upper Valley began to meet at Our Savior Lutheran Church in Hanover to learn about the current status of refugees, primarily from Syria, but also throughout the world. We realize that the war in Syria has displaced millions of individuals both internally and to neighboring countries, but due to worsening conditions at refugee camps, it has forced hundreds of thousands on a dangerous migration to Europe and beyond.
\
The war has been going on now for over five years and doesn't seem to be abating anytime soon. We need to support the various aid organizations (Church World Service, cwsglobal.org/www.supportimmigrationreform.org; International Rescue Committee, www.rescue.org; Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, lirs.org; American Refugee Committee, arcrelief.org) helping those in the camps. We would hope that their aid would improve the conditions at the camps and dissuade many from attempting the journey to Europe. This may sustain the hopes of migrants of being resettled in Syria at the conclusion of the conflict.
\
The issue of refugee resettlement will not stop at the conclusion of the conflict in Syria. There will always be conflict zones, and with the effects of climate change, many more individuals are expected to be displaced. The Upper Valley will have a role in helping these displaced individuals. This ad-hoc group plans to continue to meet, and to act as a support group for individuals here who wish to address the issue of refugees as we go forward. If you would like information on being involved, please contact Lars Johanson (amkolari@aol.com) or Paul Manganiello (paul.d.manganiello@dartmouth.edu). In the meantime, especially with the holiday season upon us, give generously to the organizations listed above.

A Slow Transition on Energy
\
To the Editor:
\
The opinion column by Randall Balmer (""Free the Rivers"" Dec. 6) calling for the removal of dams, and the Dec. 7 ""Outside Story"" column on the negative effect of increased Connecticut River water temperature on the shad population, illustrate changing standards on the use of the environment.
\
Building dams for energy and later for flood control was seen as a triumph at the time. Our society seemed to have believed that the environment was an unlimited store of resources and an unlimited sewer. We know better now.
\
Even from the start, Vermont Yankee had cooling towers added during initial construction to protect the river. The ""Outside Story"" column cites Vermont Yankee as using the river (and its cooling towers) for cooling, but a plant making steam by burning biomass would have had the same effect. We have learned that the cooling towers might have been used differently, as the article seems to imply, but that does not make what was done at the time incorrect.
\
We learn through experience with technologies, as well as from careful study before they are used. Hull, Mass., had a wind turbine generator and had to take it down. It was too close to homes and affecting health with its below-hearing-level downstream air pulses (infra sound). There are many objections to certain locations for solar power installations. We keep learning. If we did something under earlier standards, that doesn't make those who did them the ""bad guys.""
\
If scientific advances and experience show us that what was once OK is not, what do we do? We are dependent on many technologies. We can't immediately shut them down, which would wreck our economy and lives. The issue seems to be how we transition, and how long it will take. We need to transition as fast as possible, but, for example, it appears that we will be burning coal for long time.

84,"It's a basic understanding that parents make clear to their children: If you make a mess, you clean it up.\As fundamental as that concept seems, it's one we have ignored when it comes to burning fossil fuels. Consequently, the health of our ecosystems, and the economic benefits we derive from them, continue to decline while those responsible for the mess don't pay a penny for the damage they cause.\Passage of a carbon pollution tax will change that by charging fuel dealers a modest, but gradually increasing, fee that begins to reflect the harm their products wreak upon the environment.\Of course dealers will pass the carbon pollution tax on to consumers, but by returning these funds to the public in a progressive manner that is sensitive to household income, it is the dealers - not the public - who will bear the tax burden.\Consumers will have a new and compelling incentive to reduce fuel use. The less fossil fuel a citizen burns, the less the person pays out and the more the person will benefit financially.\With 10 percent of the funds raised going into a clean energy fund and used to increase efficiency and conservation, the only people who stand to lose are the oil companies who will sell fewer gallons of fuel. After decades of paying nothing for making our shared environment worse, this seems only fair. The time for a carbon-pollution tax is now.\DAVID ELLENBOGEN\Calais"
85,"Can 'carbon tax' help?\By Dan McLean\SOUTH BURLINGTON -- A ""carbon tax"" might help wean people from fossil fuels, an author told college students and members of the Vermont Council on World Affairs on Friday.\""The world is at an energy crossroads,"" Vijay Vaitheeswaran, an environment and energy correspondent for The Economist magazine, said before giving his formal remarks. ""The current energy system is unsustainable.""\Much of the world's oil is concentrated in the Middle East -- creating layers of economic and political problems, he said.\""Oil is really at the heart of the problem,"" said Vaitheeswaran, who is the author of ""Power to the People: How the Coming Energy Revolution will Transform an Industry, Change our Lives, and Maybe Even Save the Planet.""\Despite the over-reliance on fossil fuels, there is reason to be optimistic, he said.\The energy market is becoming more open to innovations and becoming more competitive, he said.\Vaitheeswaran said he believes government subsidies for all types of power production need to be eliminated, allowing the economic playing field to level.\A federal ""carbon tax"" also should be created to reduce greenhouse gases, he said.\Wind power and nuclear power would not have to pay the tax because they don't create greenhouse gas emissions, he noted. Vaitheeswaran said he is not opposed to nuclear power as an energy source.\A group of Middlebury College students, who were reading Vaitheeswaran's book in their environmental studies class, were pleased to have an opportunity to meet the author before the luncheon.\Ian Hough, a 22-year-old senior at Middlebury, said he likes Vaitheeswaran's carbon tax concept and supports an additional tax on gasoline to help encourage public transportation.\The event was held at the Doubletree Hotel Burlington.\Contact Dan McLean at 651-4877 or dmclean@bfp.burlingtonfreepress.com"
86,"This is in response to Vermont Republican Party Chairman David Sunderland's recent My Turn where he spouts nonsense and rhetoric about the Democrats pushing an 88 cents per gallon carbon tax on working Vermonters.\Already, in total, 509 bills have been introduced in the Vermont House of Representatives by legislators from all parties this biennium. They include thousands of proposals on how to move Vermont forward but, being the political opportunist that he is, Sunderland picked this particular one to say that Democrats are ""fast tracking this tax."" That simply isn't the case.\The misinformation coming out of the mouths of Vermont Republicans plays to the lowest form of politics. Their agenda of fear and ignorance parallels that of the national party and has no place in our state.\First of all, it's a proposed bill, and like all bills, has a long way to go if it were to become law. Level-headed Democrats and Progressives know that, unless a multi-state approach is taken, unless it is assured that working Vermonters will not be harmed, and unless we look at a long-term, phased-in approach, the carbon tax will not become a reality. However, this bill is certainly part of the greater discussion about the very real threat to the environment due to man made climate change.\The scariest part about Sunderland is that he totally denies climate change. He said in February on VPR that: ""I think there's science on both sides of the issue that both sides use against each other."" The truth is: scientists agree that we are experiencing serious climate change. Climate change is real and 80 percent of Vermonters agree. I guess Sunderland is just speaking for the 20 percent.\In the end, distortions, spin and fear mongering from Republicans/conservatives is just a tactic to try to win elections. Don't fall for it. Democrats and Progressives acknowledge science and climate change and are working hard in order to end global warming; considering solutions that can help solve problems in Vermont and around the world.\Democrats and Progressives create and support bills that will help working Vermonters. In contrast, Republicans vote against ordinary Vermonters, favor large corporations, then campaign about the so called ""affordability crisis."" If the Republican Party really cared about the working class, they would not be voting against wage and benefit increases necessary for people to make a simple living. Many people are working 40-hours a week and still live in poverty.\In actuality, Republican type policies have helped create the so-called ""affordability crisis,"" we cannot allow them to create an environmental crisis, too.\Cindy Humiston Weed lives in Enosburgh."
87,"Time is running out to address global climate change. Abrupt, drastic changes in climate are increasingly viewed as realistic scenarios as a result of melting land ice. The federal government has already allocated $48 million to assist our first climate change refugees by relocating the entire community of Isle Jean Charles in Louisiana.\Pollution has a social cost that is not currently being paid. A gradually introduced, carefully planned tax on carbon pollution could reduce fossil fuel use, without increasing the overall tax burden. The tax proposed in Vermont would be assessed at the ""upstream"" distributor level. It would reduce fossil fuel consumption while encouraging innovative approaches to energy efficiency and conservation, and clean, renewable energy.\The revenue would be returned to Vermonters via reductions in income and sales taxes, rebates targeted to low income citizens, as well as per-employee rebates for all employers. This would be good for the bottom line for individuals, businesses and the state while also helping to save the environment and address social inequities.\This is not pie-in-the-sky dreaming. Five years after its implementation in British Columbia, for example, the province had reduced fossil fuel consumption by 18.8 percent compared to the rest of Canada, and had one of the lowest income tax rates in the country. British Columbia's economy kept pace with the rest of Canada and there was no adverse impact on employment.\A successful carbon tax, emulated by other states and countries just might help save our planet. It might also allow us to look our children and grandchildren in the eyes when they ask what we did to prevent the death of Mother Earth.\STEVE SOBEL\Colchester"
88,"san francisco -- On Friday, Elon Musk will complete a journey almost as improbable as his vaunted quest for Mars.\In attending President Trump's first business advisory council meeting, the South African-born, self-made billionaire who is bent on saving the world from global warming will have become a counselor to a New York real estate mogul-turned-president who is eager to bring back the age of coal.\The move has many Musk-watchers scratching their heads, given he had not supported candidate Trump.\""Elon has always been very opportunistic,"" says Ashlee Vance, whose Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX and the Quest for a Fantastic Future chronicles the entrepreneur's driven path from Africa to Canada to the U.S. ""But still, this is weird.""\The opportunities are many, as are the risks.\As chief executive officer of companies that compete in the heavily regulated arenas of aerospace (SpaceX), automotive (Tesla) and energy (SolarCity), Musk, 45, can try to parlay his Trump connection into smoothing regulatory bumps and accessing federal funding as he expands his ventures.\In particular, Musk would appear to be on the brink of bringing sleek electric cars to the masses with his entry-level Model 3 sedan, whose success is key to Tesla becoming profitable and justifying the steep run in its shares.\He's hoping to start an alt-energy revolution with a SolarCity acquisition that could find him peddling affordable solar panels and electricity storage devices, an ambition that would benefit from policies like a carbon tax that penalizes fossil-fuel generation.\Trump, in turn, gets to associate himself with an industry maverick -- a disruptor like the political outsider the president has styled himself -- who is opening factories and expanding U.S.-based jobs. Musk's SolarCity and Tesla efforts are slated to employ tens of thousands in factories on both coasts.\Musk may appeal to Trump's professed love of American ingenuity, but Tesla and SolarCity have an elitist sheen that could spell disaster. Trump appears to be clearing the way for less regulation in the oil and gas industries, which wouldn't be a boon to an electricity enthusiast.\What's more, if anything happened to today's federal tax incentives on electric cars, Musk could find that his wares cost $7,500 more overnight, no small matter on the $35,000 Model 3.\In a recent Twitter exchange with Gizmodo, Musk suggested that his decision to engage with the new administration was out of a belief that it would yield better results than a battle.\""The more voices of reason that the President hears, the better,"" he wrote. ""Simply attacking him will achieve nothing. Are you aware of a single case where Trump bowed to protests or media attacks? Better that there are open channels of communication."""

Where they've been tried, the evidence shows, well-designed carbon taxes have succeeded in reducing greenhouse-gas emissions. But that doesn't necessarily end the debate over their effects - nor should it. The next question is whether that success is bought at the expense of jobs and incomes.
\
The answer is no. As long as the tax is well-designed, it can cut emissions at little or no economic cost. And that is a conservative assessment: In practice, a carbon tax has been shown to provide an economic boost. The reason is that the revenue raised by a carbon tax can be used to cut other, more damaging, taxes.
\
In general, taxes make economies less efficient. But some do more harm than others. Taxing ""bads,"" such as pollution, actually improves the allocation of resources, whereas taxing ""goods,"" such as labor, reduces the economy's capacity to produce. In principle, therefore, using the revenue from a carbon tax to cut other taxes can yield a double benefit: reducing pollution and expanding the economy.
\
There are transition costs that have to be reckoned with. But even making allowances for them, it's plausible that carbon taxes help the economy, and not just by reducing greenhouse gases.
\
The evidence shows it's worked in practice, not just in theory.
\
A study of countries that tax carbon compared two projections for gross domestic product - actual GDP with the tax in place, and hypothetical GDP with the equivalent revenue raised in other ways. The study found that, typically, GDP was a little higher thanks to the carbon tax.
\
So much for output; what about jobs? The Netherlands and Britain, which introduced some of Europe's narrowest and most targeted carbon taxes, saw no net impact on employment. Denmark made greater use of green taxes, and saw employment rise by about 0.5 percent - again, as compared with projections assuming no introduction of a carbon tax. In Germany, employment increased an estimated 0.2 percent. A 2013 review of nine countries by the Institute for European Environmental Policy found none where a carbon tax had led to job losses.
\
Such estimates come with two warnings - both of which suggest proceeding with caution. First, the economic benefits of a carbon tax can take time to come through. Second, while the economy as a whole may benefit from a carbon tax, that won't be true of every business or industry.
\
Energy-intensive sectors will be hit. In some countries, output of metals and minerals fell compared with what would have happened without the tax; in others, production of pharmaceuticals was reduced. In most cases, the drops were less than a tenth of 1 percent - but they were drops nonetheless. And jobs in those industries were affected accordingly.
\
The debate about a carbon tax shouldn't ignore the transition costs and the more long-lasting effects on jobs and output. How the tax is phased in and how to help those most affected by it should be part of the discussion, and answers will be necessary to win public support for the policy. But that's not an argument against doing it. Carbon taxes can help the economy as well as the environment - as long as the revenue is put to good use.

90,"
PARIS (AP) -- From elevator shoes to step-up boxes behind podiums, and even his own tippy-toes, Nicolas Sarkozy and his handlers have tried to compensate for his height -- or lack thereof.
\
Now, a factory worker's claim that she was chosen to stand near the French president during a photo shoot because she is short is making waves on the Internet -- and rankling Sarkozy's office.
\
The brouhaha was sparked during a visit to an auto parts plant in Normandy last week in which Sarkozy laid out his support for industry and defended his controversial plan for a ""carbon tax"" to help the environment.
\
About 20 employees in white work smocks were gathered to stand behind Sarkozy on a riser as he spoke to about 600 workers at the new Faurecia automotive parts production site in Caligny.
\
""I've been told you were chosen on height criteria,"" a reporter for the Belgian TV network RTBF asked a dark-haired woman in the lineup. ""Is that true?""
\
""Yes, yes,"" she said.
\
The reporter, Jean-Philippe Shaller, pressed on: ""That you shouldn't be taller than the president?""
\
""That's right,"" she replied, then nervously looked away as other white-suited employees looked on.
\
Two presidential spokesmen denied the allegation, terming it ""absurd and grotesque"" and saying no such order had come from Sarkozy's office.
\
In a statement Monday, Faurecia said it alone had organized the appearance involving employees from four factory sites in the area, and denied the president's office made any specific requests.
\
Two labor union leaders were quoted in the left-leaning newspaper Liberation on Tuesday as saying a hand-picked group of short workers had been requested. Neither Noel Djezairi of the Communist-backed CGT union nor Jose de Sa Moreira of the center-left CFDT could be reached for comment, though labor unions have had tense relations with the conservative Sarkozy on many issues recently.
\
Sarkozy regularly appears with crowds in the background, at times with people taller than he is. A spokesman said he didn't know the president's exact height, but said it is around 5 feet 7 inches.
\
Height has been an issue for many leaders over the years, from the famously short -- Napoleon is said to have been 5 feet 2 inches tall -- to the towering.
\
Charles de Gaulle had to struggle to find a bed that would fit his 6-foot-5-inch frame when he was on the road, and Francois Mitterrand had a complex about looking small next to the 6-foot-4-inch German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, according to Jean-Pierre Friedman, the author of books on Sarkozy and the psychology of leaders.
\
Questions have swirled about the exact heights of Russia's Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and President Dmitry Medvedev, and whether they try to appear taller than they are. Web chats dedicated to guessing their size compare them to other not-so-tall leaders, including Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, North Korea's Kim Jong Il and Italy's Silvio Berlusconi.
\
Stage-managing presidential appearances is nothing new, and Sarkozy and his aides are known to skillfully craft his image. Photographers have caught him standing on boxes behind podiums or standing on his tiptoes -- such as during a photo op with his wife, former supermodel Carla Bruni, and Barack and Michelle Obama in Strasbourg in April.
\
While Bruni told French television last year she's just shy of 5 feet 8 inches, other reports have put her at 5 feet 9 inches, and she is often photographed wearing flats in appearances with her husband.
\
Friedman said Sarkozy ""has had a complex with his height that has given him a sense of inferiority ... so he has had to prove himself.""
\
""Take a look at the way he walks -- it's very particular,"" he said. ""It almost seems as though he has lifts in his shoes that seem to disrupt his balance.""
\
Sarkozy's political rivals pounced on the Faurecia appearance while his supporters rushed to his defense.
\
""When the French president goes on official visits throughout France, the only thing that is actually directed by the Elysee is his security,"" said Frederic Lefebvre, a spokesman for Sarkozy's conservative party.
\
Socialist party spokesman Benoit Hamon called the alleged stage management ""shocking,"" telling AP Television News it amounted to ""the politics of spectacle.""
\
On the streets of Paris, the controversy drew a few shrugs.
\
""Frankly, for me, it is a little ridiculous, yes, absolutely,"" said Paris resident David Charley as he walked near Paris' Champs-Elysees. ""If he (Sarkozy) wants to play with his image, it's allowed.""

91," Democrats Won’t Miss Moore\ \Is anyone else puzzled by the oddly vacuous, content-free column by Marc Thiessen (“What The Democrats Lost On Tuesday,” Dec. 16)? Talk about a solution looking for a problem! \Like an alchemist trying to make gold from scrap metal, Thiessen is desperately trying to translate his anger about Roy Moore’s defeat into a problem for Democrats, implying that they lost a golden opportunity to go after this highly tainted and indecent man. “Instead, they got Doug Jones,” wrote Thiessen. Say what? \Two points: (1.) Our inept, mendacious and mentally unbalanced president already provides liberals and Democrats with more than enough fodder for criticism. Had he been elected, Moore would have been a sideshow, posing much more of a problem for Republicans than for Democrats. (2.) Decent people in Alabama, and Democrats everywhere, hoped for only one thing in that special election: Moore’s loss and Doug Jones’ win. And that’s what they got. \So now Moore, assuming he can control his horse, can ride off into the sunset. Nice try, Marc. \ \A.E. Norton WoodstockCarbon Tax Would Hurt Vermonters\Everyday Vermonters realize that a tax on gas and heating oil will leave us all with less money in our pockets. The carbon tax is meant to be punitive. It’s supposed to force consumers to swap to electric vehicles. Most people that are inclined to buy an electric vehicle probably already have them. Any change in the ratio of electric vehicles to gas-powered vehicles, influenced by a carbon tax, would be minimal, and the resulting effect on the rate of temperature change, infinitesimal. \Make no mistake, however, the financial drain on every Vermonter would be real, immediate and substantial. If your business uses a large truck, or any piece of heavy equipment, it can’t be replaced with an equivalent electric vehicle. Vermont convenience stores that sell gasoline all along the Connecticut River Valley would be hurt the most, with the double whammy of a sales tax and a carbon tax. The latest proposal would rebate some of your electric bill to make up for money paid out in a carbon tax. For most Vermonters, a smaller electric bill wouldn’t nearly make up for the additional carbon tax paid.\ Vermont has a lot of challenges ahead, the least of which is that we are not taxed enough already. The mandated cleanup of Lake Champlain, funding education, ending the opioid crisis and countless other problems will all demand more tax money from Vermonters. We consistently have a budget gap of $30 million to $70 million. For the last decade, that shortfall has been made up from increases in taxes and fees. Enough, already. \I fully support Gov. Phil Scott’s ideas to make Vermont more affordable. I applaud his reluctance to accept a carbon tax as a means to that end. There is plenty that can be done to help conserve energy and actually save money without doing harm to our economy. Local energy committees have done a lot to weatherize homes already. The Warm Home Bond Initiative is an idea that should be explored. We’ll accomplish more, faster, if we can work together rather than pitting Vermonters against one another.\Bill HuffThetford Center \ The Nature of Man\ \As I read the letters to the editor and read Steve Nelson’s column, I am aware that either I am very wrong about the nature of man or they are. I believe that violence against people is normal behavior. The only reason we do not see a lot more of it is because we spend a lot of time and effort teaching our children that most violence is wrong. We penalize violence from childhood through adulthood. Prejudice against “the other” is also normal behavior and tolerance results from huge efforts to encourage it.\Many of those who write in believe that violence and prejudice against others is both aberrant and learned behavior. I believe the opposite is true. This is important because it is very difficult to deal with complex problems one does not understand.\If one believes that violent behavior is aberrant and learned, then all we have to do is eliminate people who are violent and stop teaching it. I think we all know that would not work.\Human beings are the only creatures who do not live in the environment that they evolved in. We are also the only creature that has found ways to achieve population levels that are millions of times greater than those we evolved in. The result is that “natural” no longer works for us.\In my opinion, this issue is at the heart of the conflict between behavior that evolved over the eons and behavior that is desirable because of changes we have created that have so altered the environment we live in to the point that there is conflict between the two.\None of the above means that we should accept violence or prejudice. Neither of those things advance our society in the direction that most of us want to go. If I am right, however, it does make sense to explore this issue more deeply so that we come up with better ways of dealing with these issues. \Pat Colt Hanover Computers and Jobs\I was pleased to read Dec. 12 that the Springfield School District is starting a computer science program, the “first of its kind” in Vermont. \ I am confused, however. I graduated from that high school in 1969. I remember that in the spring of that year, some of us students were writing simple Fortran programs for a very basic IBM computer, perhaps a 1440.\Maybe that was not an actual elective. I don’t remember in what course we were taught to program. It wasn’t easy. Later, at UVM, I tried an introductory computer course. I dropped it early on because it focused on writing games and never mentioned the scientific or business applications that would have made it meaningful to me.\Fortunately, at Fellows Gear Shaper in 1974, I was accepted as a programmer-trainee on the strength of a good showing on an aptitude test. I taught myself COBOL while waiting to be released from my machinist position. Finally, a chance to see what computers were really intended for. I’ve made my living with them ever since.\I hope the new program focuses on topics that can lead to meaningful employment.\Peter R. Magoon Enfield\Trapping Isn’t Newsworthy\The maiming, torture and killing of defenseless animals should not be treated as front-page material, such as with the photo on the front page on Dec. 16. It saddens me that the Valley News believes that a photo of wild animal traps (and the human setting them) is newsworthy or noteworthy, and more astonishingly, that it should dominate the front page.  What are you thinking?\  A major clothing retailer, Gucci, recently announced that fur is out of style and consumer favor, and this luxury brand will stop using mink, coyote, fox or any other animal that is bred or caught for fur. When are New England states going to join this growing trend of stopping the senseless slaughter of wildlife? It should be banned, not front page news. Surely you could have found a better photo for the holiday season.  Animal lives matter, too!\Sharon CookWilder\ "

BURLINGTON The challenges facing the Vermont economy and the most effective solutions to boost it were topics of general agreement between the Democratic and Republican gubernatorial candidates who faced off in Tuesday's Digger Dialogue forum.
\
More than 350 people attended the event on economic issues at the ECHO Lake Aquarium and Science Center. The event was hosted by VTDigger.org and was also streamed online.
\
While nuanced differences emerged on how best to jump-start the economy, each candidate expressed the overarching sentiment that the state needs to bolster its population with young entrepreneurs capable of breathing life into deteriorating cities and towns throughout the state. All spoke against proposals they thought would hurt the economy, including one to tax carbon emissions.
\
""What struck me was the amount of agreement there was,"" said Eric Davis, a retired professor of political science at Middlebury College who attended the event. ""I think there was more consensus than disagreement, it didn't come across as a partisan event at all.""
\
Digger Dialogue
\
The forum began with a presentation by VTDigger publisher Diane Zeigler, who laid out a set of startling economic statistics in the state comparing the wealth of Bennington and Chittenden counties.
\
Included in the statistics, which are linked below, were some troubling figures: traffic in Vermont's visitor centers is declining, the state's median age is increasing and so is childhood poverty.
\
""We are looking at more than 40 percent of our state's children that are receiving free or reduced lunches,"" Zeigler said before scrolling to another chart -- one showing a 186 percent increase in opioid treatment statewide.
\
Democratic candidates Matt Dunne and Sue Minter and Republicans Bruce Lisman and Lt. Gov. Phil Scott spoke at the event. Democrat Shap Smith could not attend the forum because he was spending time with his wife, who just underwent surgery.
\
The candidates generally agreed on the causes of economic decline in the state, though some prioritized different causes.
\
Lisman highlighted the graying population as the most urgent economic issue facing the state.
\
""Population growth in this country is a terrific proxy for economic vitality, where people leaving shows the economy is being hollowed out,"" Lisman said.
\
Dunne and Scott also said population decline was troubling, and both set goals of increasing the population by tens of thousands over the coming years.
\
Minter agreed that population declined must be addressed, but highlighted opiate abuse as the most troubling problem in the state.
\
While the former transportation secretary said Rutland's ""Project Vision"" approach is showing signs of effectiveness, problems persist. She told the story of a Rutland law enforcement official who told her that school administrators recently found needles in a fifth-grader's backpack.
\
""The mother of this young fifth-grader put her needles into the backpack so that she would keep herself from using while her daughter was in school,"" Minter said. ""This is an issue that is confronting us very significantly.""
\
Dunne said poverty levels troubled him the most, and that all of the dire economic data in the state was related.
\
""What was the most interesting was to overlay all of those graphs together because it shows how connected these pieces are,"" Dunne said. ""When you see a rise in poverty, you see a rise in opiate addiction.""
\
While the candidates all portrayed a dim picture of the state, some towns were highlighted for their resurgence in the past few years, including Barre, Winooski, Waterbury and St. Albans.
\
The economic atmosphere of Chittenden County - and Burlington specifically - received the most praise from the candidates, but agreement emerged that the plethora of educational institutions and medical centers in the city made it a hard economic environment to replicate.
\
Scott said that while Chittenden has the most hopeful economic data in the state, it is still not as vibrant as it could be.
\
""If you just take Chittenden County alone and compare it to other bright spots in the country, even in the Northeast, it's just doing OK,"" he said.
\
Other towns were referenced as examples of places in dire need of an economic renaissance, including Bennington, Rutland and Newport.
\
Solutions
\
Much like the problems plaguing the state, a general consensus emerged on how best to fix the state's economic woes.
\
More young people must be enticed to live and work here, the candidates said, and more affordable housing for them must be made available. High-speed Internet must be increased throughout the state and downtowns need revitalization.
\
Minter said that the education system must be preserved, as it is a huge draw for families moving to Vermont.
\
""We know we have got a lot of conversations about how we fund [schools], but they are a magnet"" to out-of-staters, she said.
\
All the candidates agreed on other assets the state has in attracting families, including a high quality of life and access to fresh produce and other small batch products.
\
The candidates prioritized making the state more business friendly, and Lisman and Scott criticized the state government's changing permitting processes and expensive mandates as a deterrent for small and big businesses.
\
""We've created a predictable process for [renewable energy companies] to go through, a siting process,"" Scott said. ""They understand they can get from point A to point B, and there are tax incentives to do it.""
\
The candidates also generally agreed that while the state needed to attract and support entrepreneurs and exciting startup businesses, it should not be in the business of picking economic winners and losers.
\

\
""I actually don't think government is very good at predicting the economy or where innovation is going to happen,"" Dunne said.
\
Members of the public submitted more than 130 questions to VTDigger in the three days leading up to the event. The most popular question dealt with a Democratic proposal for a carbon tax that could, among other things, increase the price of gas by up to 88 cents over 10 years.
\
Lisman emphatically called the tax ""an insane idea,"" garnering the first round of applause for a candidate during the event.
\
""A carbon tax would raise the cost of living by some serious amount on the notion that we shouldn't be driving,"" he said, noting that many Vermonters have long commutes to work.
\
The other candidates echoed Lisman's sentiments, but Dunne and Minter added a caveat that environmental regulations in general are necessary.
\
Minter called climate change the most important political issue of the moment, but stopped short of supporting a carbon tax: ""I do not think at this time, with our economy, that this is something appropriate for just the state of Vermont.""
\
Davis said from an analyst's perspective, he thought all the candidates performed well. He said most of the issues didn't come across as partisan ones, though distinctions would emerge over the coming months as candidates outlines more specific policy proposals.
\
""As we get closer to the campaign, the discussion is going to get more concrete about taxes, spending, school funding, solar and wind sighting and other issues,"" he said. ""Differences will be highlighted as the primary approaches.""

93,"
Montpelier - Gov. Peter Shumlin signed into law an energy bill that promises to create 1,000 new jobs and help Vermonters save on energy costs over a 15-year period.
\
The bill, which was passed by the House and Senate May 15, repeals the Sustainably Priced Energy Enterprise Development Program and implements a renewable energy standard and ""energy transformation program"" that would start in 2017, according to the overview of the bill by Aaron Adler, legislative council member. A provision of the new renewable energy standard requires the state to provide leasing and on-bill financing for any Vermonter who wants to improve their home's energy efficiency.
\
By 2032, the renewable electric utility requirements - or the minimum requirements for anybody to install gas or electric service in a new or remodeled property - will be at 75 percent of power sales under this legislation, increasing from the 55 percent that will be required by 2017. Shumlin said this bill is part of the goal for energy to be 90 percent renewable by 2050.
\
""I think it is the most forward-leaning legislation in the country,"" said Mary Powell, chief executive officer at Green Mountain Power.
\
Adler wrote the bill, and Reps. Anthony Klein and Rebecca Ellis co-sponsored it.
\
""We're doing things that are good for people's pocketbooks and things that are good for the environment, and we're doing them together,"" said Sen. Christopher Bray, chairman of the Natural Resources and Energy Committee.
\
The pens used to sign the bill were given to Bray, Klein and Darren Springer, Shumlin's chief of staff, as thanks for their ""hard work"" getting it passed through the legislature.
\
Shumlin said that while talking to other governors about the bill, they responded that their state's utility companies would ""kill them"" if they did something similar and that there was no way their own utilities would cooperate with state government on such a business model.
\
""This is totally consumer-driven,"" Klein said.
\
Efficiency Vermont, a program which is included as part of the bill, has been around since 2000. Every electric customer - other than those at Burlington Electric Department - pay an Efficiency Vermont fee to help sponsor new initiatives and reduce costs of consumer products, such as subsidizing LED bulbs to make them more affordable.
\
Bray said that the renewable energy standard in the bill mirrors a carbon tax.
\
Over the next two years, the legislature will investigate whether Vermont could include such a tax with the renewable energy standard, he said.
\
Klein, who sponsored a carbon-tax bill during this legislative session, said he supports a carbon tax.
\
""All the major corporations know that carbon use needs to be managed,"" Klein said.
\
Powell said she is interested in learning more about carbon taxes, but right now she is focused on finding more innovative ways to reduce costs for Vermonters.
\
There are some solar companies that can do seven-hour installations, making it less expensive for Vermonters to get on solar power, Powell said.
\
She said she doesn't believe that there won't be other solar-power incentives in place by the time the current federal solar-power incentives die out, at the end of 2016.
\
Klein said that he is not convinced that incentives for solar power will die out.
\
The bill was signed outside of the Montpelier home of Green Mountain Power customers Dan and Mary Margaret Groberg, who have capitalized on the energy improvements.
\
The Grobergs moved into their home two years ago, Shumlin said. Under the bill, they have been able to upgrade their home's energy efficiency, saving them an estimated $1,400 a year on energy bills, according to a news release.
\
""We can't do fast enough what you are doing, and what you have the courage to do, across the state,"" Shumlin said to the Grobergs.
\
Green Mountain Power upgraded its first energy-efficient house in Rutland, Vt., a year ago, Shumlin said.

94,"For the first time, the Vermont Chamber of Commerce has gathered together a list of all the taxes, fees and mandates passed by the Legislature that affect Vermont businesses -- to the tune of $52 million in 2015 alone. The Chamber calls it ""The Impact List.""\""In 2015 there were so many proposals that would impact businesses we were having difficulty keeping up,"" said Betsy Bishop, president of the Chamber. ""In one of our strategy sessions each of us had made lists.""\Bishop put the lists together and took them on the road, presenting The Impact List to business audiences around the state, beginning on July 24 at the Central Vermont Chamber of Commerce in Barre and ending Jan. 25 in the Northeast Kingdom, at a time and location to be announced.\Bishop, who was deputy chief of staff and economic development commissioner for Gov. Jim Douglas before taking the reins at the Chamber in 2009, also works as a lobbyist.\This year, Bishop and her lobbying crew were worried about $220,300 in new restaurant licensing charges and $444,000 in new revenue from increases in Act 250 fees. Altogether, fee increases raise $3.6 million. They were worried about various income tax changes, including capping itemized reductions at 2.5 times the standard amount, eliminating the deduction of state and local income taxes and implementing a 3 percent minimum tax for filers with more than $150,000 in adjusted gross income. Those changes raise a total of $22.9 million. And there was more, to reach the $52 million total.\Looking ahead to 2016, The Impact List points out the state is already facing a nearly $50 million projected budget gap. Legislators will debate expanding the sales tax to services, mandating paid sick leave, costing employers up to $14.2 million annually, raising the rooms, meals and alcohol tax rates and implementing a carbon tax. Also, the minimum wage, set at $9.15 in 2015, will increase to $10.50 by 2018.\Bishop said she expects the list of concerns for 2016 from businesses to grow as she continues her Impact List road show around the state.\""When we started talking about 2015 and 2016 we had a lot of members say, 'It's not just about what happened this year, we're still trying to absorb a doubling of unemployment insurance tax from five years ago,'"" Bishop said.\A useful tool\Sen. Kevin Mullin, R- Rutland, chair of the Senate Economic Development Committee, rejects the notion that Vermont is anti-business, especially in the last couple of years when he said there has been more emphasis in the Legislature on creating jobs.\Mullin credits the Vermont Chamber of Commerce with acknowledging the positive steps the Legislature has taken, including support for tourism and economic development marketing, an updated law governing limited liability companies, making it clear that so-called ""cloud"" services on the Internet are not taxable, and expanded eligibility for the Vermont Employment Growth Incentive program.\Mullin calls the Impact List a ""useful tool,"" because it reminds legislators everything they do has a cumulative effect.\""Unfortunately a lot of the time in the Legislature people are working in the vacuum of their own committees,"" Mullin said. ""It's never one fee, regulation, tax or mandate, it's the cumulative effect that's stressful on business. Anything that drives up cost or the annoyance factor is hard on them.""\Mullin said he's committed to continuing to find ways to make doing business in Vermont easier.\""Vermont has a good message to send,"" he said. ""We're not like New York with hundreds of millions of dollars we can shower on people but we're still able to compete. The main reason is because of the Vermont worker. Talk to any business. Their productivity is outstanding. It's in the DNA of Vermonters to have a strong work ethic.""\Vermont Teddy Bear President and CEO Bill Shouldice agrees with Mullin that the quality of the Vermont worker is the state's main competitive advantage.\""We'll never compete on incentives, but we can compete on quality -- of our workers, and our living style,"" he said\Vermont is not anti-business, said Shouldice, secretary of commerce in the Howard Dean administration, ""but like any other place in the country we have work to do to improve the business climate.""\""We need vision and leadership,"" he said. ""We don't have it and haven't had it for some time, a decade.""\The office of Gov. Peter Shumlin did not respond to a call for comment. Secretary of Commerce Pat Moulton, however, said the administration is ""clearly pro-business.""\""We want to work with existing businesses, new entrepreneurs, and attract new businesses, in that order,"" Moulton said. ""It's important to take care of businesses in our back yard and make sure they're happy.""\Moulton acknowledges the state has economic challenges, including a permitting process that in some cases ""has not gone smoothly,"" but says the administration is committed to protecting the environment and quality of life that makes Vermont special.\""I've said publicly many times, we are not Anywhere USA, we are not Anywhere New England,"" Moulton said. ""We are Vermont. We have a unique brand. The brand sells product and tourism.""\Big picture optimism\Referring to The Impact List compiled by the Vermont Chamber, Moulton said there are several items the governor is opposing, including a carbon tax.\""It may be a good idea, but we can't be the only state in the region that does it,"" she said. ""It will put us at an economic disadvantage. Let's say Vermont adds 10 cents a gallon gas tax as a carbon tax. Everybody along our borders can trot across the border and gas up for less. It creates a disincentive to do business in Vermont.""\Looking at the big economic picture for Vermont, Moulton said the forecasts are good, and that companies are creating jobs. She referenced the recent ribbon cutting at Logic Supply in South Burlington, which opened a $3 million expansion to its headquarters.\""There's a lot of confidence in the market,"" Moulton said. ""Canadian companies are looking to Vermont as a potential location. All the big picture signs are looking good.""\Bill Shouldice countered that Vermont businesses need ""stability and predictability"" in tax policy, in regulations, and in the population of the state, which he points out grew less than half a percent from 2008 to today.\Lt. Gov. Phil Scott, who is a candidate for governor, goes further on the population question, saying that according to the last Census, Vermont lost 30,000 people between the ages of 25 and 45 years old.\""That's the working class, the folks who buy homes, have families,"" Scott said.\Uncertainty looming\Scott was a businessman, as owner of Dubois Construction in Middlesex, before he was a politician, and says he got into politics about 20 years ago because he was tired of complaining about government policies.\""I didn't have a political bone in my body, but I started to get extremely frustrated with what I thought they were doing to me in Montpelier,"" Scott said. ""They didn't have a complete understanding of what they were doing in terms of obstacles and impacts we faced as a result of actions they took. I thought maybe I should get involved instead of complaining.""\As a case-in-point of problematic legislation, Scott points to the dialogue around health care.\""What happened with single payer was the discussion went on for three or four years, it never came to a close in a timely fashion,"" Scott said. ""You had businesses that would be impacted that were very concerned by the uncertainty that was looming over them. What they did was play the wait-and-see game. Let's not do anything, let's not expand our business, let's wait and see what they're going to do in little old Vermont.""\Vermont needs to pay attention to demographics, Scott said, and find ways to address what he calls a ""crisis of affordability."" The state has a great story to tell, he said -- about quality of life and an innovative spirit -- but doesn't tell that story often enough or well enough.\The Impact List is right on the money, Scott said, but in an ironic twist, the list ""has a way of again creating that negative climate.""\""We can't put our heads in the sand,"" he said. ""I think we're in the stage where we need to make sure we understand we have a problem. If we can accept that, then we can move on to doing something about it, working together.""\No help needed from Montpelier\Vermont Teddy Bear has 164 employees, and every year hires up to 700 temporary employees for the company's busy seasons. The best of those employees can find permanent employment with core staff, Shouldice said. Finding so many temps is problematic for the company.\""Vermont needs population growth,"" he said. ""How do you grow? By making it more desirable for youth to stay, creating jobs.""\Bill Shouldice bristles at the notion of state-mandated sick leave, up for consideration by the legislature next year.\""I'm not sure I need Montpelier to tell me the right thing to do by my employees,"" he said. ""Mandated increases in the minimum wage, mandated family leave, those are the types of things I find insulting. We live in a free market society. We give our employees -- on day 1-- five weeks vacation. If we're not treating our employees well, they'll take their good skills down the street. We're competing every day to keep our labor force, and I don't need Montpelier to tell me what's best for our employees.""\That may be the case for Vermont Teddy Bear, said Sen. David Zuckerman, P/D-Chittenden County, but it's not the case for some Vermont businesses, which is why he supports mandated leave.\""I think it's important when a business is successful that they have such a good ethic, but not all successful businesses have that ethic,"" Zuckerman said.\Zuckerman also questions Shouldice's assertion that his employees can leave if they don't like their treatment at Vermont Teddy Bear.\""The right-to-work mentality that he presents is one way of thinking, but not everybody is in such a position as an employee to up and switch jobs as easily as he seems to suggest,"" Zuckerman said.\Zuckerman is also a businessman, having built Full Moon Farm in Hinesburg from a two-acre operation in 1999 run with his wife to 150 acres and 10 employees today.\""Farmers don't face all of the same regulatory hurdles other businesses face, but we have our own challenges,"" Zuckerman said. ""We still have to meet workers' compensation, payroll taxes and health care payments, and we've been able to grow successfully.""\Zuckerman agrees that the state sometimes makes things difficult for him with taxes, fees and mandates, but adds that the state also opens up ""pathways for success.""\""Whether it's transportation networks or job training or creating that level playing field so someone doesn't undercut us with unethical business practices,"" he said.\A rival farm that pays its employees cash under the table is a bigger problem for Zuckerman than taxes and mandates from the state, he said.\""When I pay $9.50 or $10 an hour, plus unlimited vegetables, it costs me $12 an hour between workers' comp, payroll taxes and social security,"" Zuckerman said. ""When a competitor pays employees $10 cash employees get more and it costs them less. That scenario competing for quality employees makes it much harder than anything the state imposes.""\Ultimately, Zuckerman said, Vermont will get the economy it deserves.\""Are we going to create and maintain an economy that values our workers and our environment/natural surroundings as equals with the sole financial bottom line, or do we want to join other states in a race to the bottom?"" he asked.\As for The Impact List compiled by the Vermont Chamber, Shouldice compares it to ""death by a thousand nicks.""\""When you're talking about raising taxes and a looming deficit, if you're someone who is thinking about investing in Vermont you ask yourself, 'Where is that money going to come from? Is it coming from me?'"" Shouldice said. ""That's not predictable.""\Vermont, says Shouldice, needs a ""wholesale conversation about what we can afford.""\This story was first published on MONTH DATE YEAR.

95,"An Independent Voter’s View\ \An independent voter asks: Why have the Republicans forsaken democracy and the U.S. Constitution? Their leader, the president, has praised tyrants over democracy, acted like an autocrat and refused to champion the human rights embodied in our Constitution. By their silence, Republicans are complicit.\ In 2010, a conservative voting bloc of Republican-appointed Supreme Court justices undermined our democracy by opening the floodgates of unaccountable money into politics. Republicans doubled down on this by passing a tax “reform” bill that gave wealthy interests even more money with which to influence elections and legislative action. It’s called corruption.\Further, our president, screaming voter fraud without any proof, started a Republican campaign of voter suppression laws that disproportionately target groups that don’t vote Republican. Then there is the undemocratic practice of gerrymandering — allowing politicians to choose voters rather than the reverse — which made headlines in several court cases in Republican-gerrymandered states. Republicans also seem remarkably unconcerned about Russian election hacking \ In 2016, Republican senators refused to perform their Constitutional duty to advise and consent — for 11 months — on a moderate Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland. Republicans have also failed to exercise constitutional checks and balances on a reckless president who has attacked the freedom of the press, undermined our law enforcement agencies and whose administration has demonstrated unprecedented corruption. \Similarly they ignore his contempt for the rule of law, his absurd conspiracy theories, his toxic tweeting, his lying, his dehumanization of immigrants, his insulting of allies, his racism and his submission to Vladimir Putin. They join him in ignoring climate change and in undermining our existing health care system, offering nothing better.\Much has been made of a healthy economy, but there’s no such thing as a free lunch. Americans have paid for it by giving up worker rights, their health from increased pollution, consumer rights, public lands, voting rights, women’s rights and their children’s future (global warming, a trillion-dollar debt). Such a deal!\This independent voter will not be voting for Republicans in the foreseeable future.\Allan MacDonald New LondonUnprecedented Venom From the Left\During a long life involved in politics, I have never seen the venom so clearly demonstrated coming from the left. Directing it at voters and politicians on the right who disagree with you is not the way to behave. When the insults are directed at the president and his administration, do you realize, or do you care, that you are insulting everyone who voted for the president?\The present administration has freed prisoners, reduced unemployment, arranged trade deals with Mexico and Canada, brought businesses back, improved the military with adequate funding and reset international relations.\A democratic republic allows for differences of opinion without abuse, verbal or physical. We need to get back to basics. Let’s not lose sight of the blessing that we all live in this great, free country. We are so fortunate.\Janet C. ConnollyMeridenA Balanced Government Is Better\With this year’s midterm elections almost here I ask all of our citizens to look closely at our incumbents and candidates. Local government has a much more direct effect on all of us, and our state elections are of the utmost importance.\There has been much discussion of a carbon tax at our recent forums. I oppose a carbon tax because it would be detrimental to our already struggling seniors, our young families and would further discourage business and economic growth in our state.\Our Vermont Heath Connect is a disaster. The current Legislature has decided it’s best to penalize those who can’t afford health care. I will work with others to find affordable solutions.\Wastewater spewing into our lakes and waterways is unacceptable. There is little point in cleaning our waters when we continue to pollute them. Farmers are already taking action. Why aren’t the municipalities?\I will introduce solutions like lowering the business tax, tax-free startups, reducing or eliminating the sales tax, welcoming a secondary vocational school to Windsor County and lowering utility costs. I promise to work with others to find better solutions to education funding, revamping or repealing Act 46 and Act 250, and improving our current drug programs with better prevention and treatment and eliminating lax punishment for dealers.\An unbalanced government benefits no one. Government works best with checks and balances. I ask for your vote on Nov 6. Every vote counts.\Randy GrayNorth Springfield, Vt.\The writer is a candidate for a Senate seat from Windsor County.\Merchant for Claremont’s Ward 2\ \In this dark time, when our federal government is all too eager to damage people’s lives and the environment — positions that ultimately affect states’ abilities to protect and educate their citizens — Claremont candidate Gary Merchant’s bid for New Hampshire state representative includes constructive approaches that can address deterioration in the environment and social fabric. \First and foremost, he will work to protect the environment, which is in fatal crisis. Without a healthy planet, nothing else much matters, because our welfare is at risk from violent natural disasters, spread of deadly disease, food and water shortages and the subsequent fear and insecurity that drive hatred and war. \Merchant sees the need to stop global climate change as a priority. From there, all his other goals can take root: adequate state funding (that does not raise local property taxes) for public schools; expanding technical-focused community colleges and training in the trades; rebuilding infrastructure such as roads, bridges and the internet in the context of disaster preparedness; adequate health insurance that includes coverage for pre-existing conditions and affordable medicine.\His positions are ones of pragmatic compassion that reflect the interconnections between health and education and environment and infrastructure and fair-wage employment and democracy. Together with Gary Merchant, we can reimagine the way forward — a way that honors all life, present and future — something we won’t have unless we elect people with integrity, vision, vigilance and wisdom like Gary Merchant for state representative representing Claremont’s Ward 2.\Meg HurleyClaremontFamily Leave Is No Vacation\ \It has been reported that our governor, Chris Sununu, has referred to family leave time as a “vacation.” While I disagree with much of the governor’s politics, I do not hold any animus toward him. \However, to describe family leave in this manner says as much about him personally as it does his position on the issue. \As a physician who has filled out countless family leave forms for family members of sick or dying patients, I can assure the governor that family leave is the farthest thing from a vacation.\Stephen JordanSunapeeScare Tactics in the Mailbox\ \I am disturbed by a large Republican political ad I found in my Bradford, Vt., post office box recently. It gave inaccurate information on what Vermont Democrats intend to do.\The ad was funded by an out-of-state political action committee, and not Vermonters. A state representative stressed to me that Vermont lawmakers keep a high standard of working together civilly, and do not use lies and hyperbole.\Addressing the three main points in the ad: \Vermont Democrats never proposed an 80 cent carbon tax on gas. The only proposal made would top out at 40 cents over a period of 10 years, only if such a tax were necessary to meet the Vermont climate goal.\The Vermont Legislature does not raise property taxes. It sets rates based on spending decisions made by local school boards.\A third comment about passing “regulations” was vague and made no sense. It appeared to be a scare tactic.\I’m new to these ideas. I found out it is easy to call or email your local state representative if you have questions.\Sue Cole Bradford, Vt."
96,"Valley News Staff Writer\White River Junction — Republicans or Democrats? Challengers or incumbents? Candidates who stand as principled purists or those who say a nuanced position is more practical?\Hartford voters in the two-seat Windsor 4-2 Vermont House district — which includes White River Junction, Wilder, Hartford Village and the area south and east of Route 4 in Quechee — have some choices to make on Nov. 8 about who they want to send to Montpelier.\Meanwhile, a Democratic lawyer from Hartford is running unopposed for the Windsor 4-1 district that represents the rest of Hartford, along with Barnard and Pomfret. State Rep. Teo Zagar, D-Barnard, is not seeking re-election.\The incumbents in the Windsor 4-2 district are Democrats Kevin “Coach” Christie and Gabrielle Lucke, who held off primary challengers Ashley Andreas and Jeff Arnold in August, and now look to defend their seats in the general election.\They’re being challenged by military retiree Kevin Stuart and telecommunications executive Charlie Davenport, who hope to become the first Republicans to represent Hartford in the Statehouse since the end of John Clerkin’s term in 2010. \Christie, 66, is the current ranking member on the House Committee on Education, and also sits on the Hartford School Board, where he has held a seat since 2007. He spent many years teaching and coaching in the Hartford School District, and has also been a case manager for foster children.\Christie said that he’s learned, over many years in the Statehouse, that party labels are less important than individuals.\“As people get to know how you respond to different issues and concerns, they have a very strong feeling that they can trust you to to react a certain way,” he said.\The 56-year-old Lucke, a former member of the Hartford School Board, has spent much of her professional life in academia as an administrator, faculty member and health educator. She currently works as a senior consultant with Dartmouth College’s human resources department.\“With my first term behind me, I have some insights and experience,” she said. “It’s exciting for me to think of hitting the ground running instead of being a little shell-shocked when I arrive.” \A member of the House Committee on General, Housing and Military Affairs, she said her top priority will be housing.\“I don’t know that we have gotten a handle on the wide range of housing needs for people who live in Vermont,” she said.\Davenport, 39, is a graduate of Oxbow High School and worked at Topsham Telephone Company for eight years, leaving in 2013 when he became president of his Lebanon-based company, SecureSyscom, Inc. He currently owns a few companies, including a property management firm in White River Junction, and says that most of Vermont’s ills could be solved by making the state more business-friendly.\“I’m not much of a fluff guy,” he said.\Stuart, a 63-year-old retiree, served active duty in the U.S. Air Force during 1973 and 1974, and has held various positions with the reserves and Air National Guard of Vermont and Massachusetts from then until 2008; he has also worked various civilian jobs in the computer industry, including two-year stints with Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center and TomTom forerunner Geographic Data Technology in Lebanon.\He said he’d like to freeze the state budget for a year.\“I know that would be harsh but I feel like it’s a tax-and-spend mentality that just permeates through Montpelier,” he said.\Carbon Tax\Stuart said that his No. 1 priority if elected would be to defeat an active effort by some Democratic lawmakers to impose a tax on fossil fuels, including gasoline, commonly referred to as a carbon tax.\Lawmakers have proposed measures that seek to curb fossil fuel use by taxation, and redistribute the large majority of the revenue collected to reduction of the sales and income taxes, and a per-employee rebate to employers, with the balance going toward weatherization and energy independence programs.\“You want to slap an 85 cent tax on gas per gallon?” said Stuart. “To me, that’s going to drive Vermonters far away. They’re either going to be so poor they can’t move away, or they’re going to have enough so they can barely get out of the state.” \Stuart said the idea runs counter to how he would grow Vermont’s tax base, which would be by enticing business to come to the state through tax incentives.\Christie said the idea of a carbon tax affects such a broad spectrum of Vermont life — the economy, the heating bills of low-income Vermonters, the environment — in such complex ways, that his position would be informed by the details of projections of the bills’ impacts. \“In order for me to feel that it does what it would need to do for folks that I represent, we’d have to get a lot of more information to start,” Christie said.\He said he wouldn’t be an idle spectator to the proceedings.\“It isn’t just a wait-and-see approach,” he said. “If it moves forward and I’m part of the process, I have to take that strong view. If it’s going to be done, let’s attempt to do it right.” \Lucke said that she wanted to see more specifics before she committed to a stance on the carbon tax.\“You can talk about the general theme of an issue,” she said, “but until you see the actual language of the bill, it’s hard to turn down or support. … There’s a lot of rumor and speculation.” \Lucke said she was wary of a bill that might be seen as good for Vermont, at the expense of communities like Hartford, which border New Hampshire.\“One of the key components I’ll be paying attention to is the impact on a border community,” she said. “This is one of the areas where I get really Hartford-centric.” \Davenport, like Stuart, had harsh criticism for the carbon tax.\“That is absolutely asinine that we would do that,” he said, adding that it would be certain to drive more businesses out of the state. “Leave it to Montpelier to come up with some crazy idea like that.” \He said the tax would be most punishing for those who don’t make enough money to live comfortably, but who make too much to qualify for government assistance with their heating bills.\He accused Lucke, Christie, and other Democrats of expressing concerns about the tax only because it is politically expedient.\“I think their real reservations are, they need to be reserved about it until after election time,” he said.\Marijuana Legalization\Another issue that’s likely to come to the floor during the upcoming legislative session is whether to legalize marijuana — Christie and Lucke were among just a handful of Upper Valley lawmakers who voted against a measure that would have allowed Vermonters to cultivate two marijuana plants at home.\Lucke admits that this has been a particularly difficult issue for her.\“That is something that I wrestle with and continue to,” she said.\The cause for her angst, she said, stems from her position as a board member for Second Growth, an Upper Valley nonprofit that provides services and counseling for children. Second Growth has been staunchly opposed to marijuana use for years, arguing that it is a gateway to more dangerous drugs. Lucke said she now feels torn because, in the last session, she heard compelling testimony that has her at least partially convinced that legalization could reduce, rather than increase, usage among youths.\Lucke also echoed Christie’s concerns about a broader legalization bill they didn’t support, and which failed, that they say would favor a big, centralized distribution system.\“It was a framework that was designed without Vermont in mind,” she said.\Her positions on the issue have changed since May, when she first cast a vote against the bill. She said in late May that her position was evolving, and that “I recognize we are in a process as a state and I really want to do it right.” \This month, she said she’s decided not to take a position until after the November vote.\“I’m putting that decision off until after I’m re-elected,” she said. “If I’m not re-elected, my no vote stands firm. If I am re-elected, this is where my due diligence has to take a role.” \Christie said that, though he voted against the legalization bill, he would vote in favor of a bill that addressed his two main concerns.\First, he said, in the original bill, “there were still a number of unanswered questions that hadn’t been resolved around testing,” which he said muddied the waters around both employee drug testing and testing for the impairment of drivers.\Second, he said, he was concerned about a legalization framework that would allow a few large entities, possibly from other states, to come in and control a centralized distribution market, which he said goes against the Vermont ethos of backyard farming.\“We don’t just create three or four millionaires,” he said. “We would hope to allow as many Vermonters who are capable to be involved in a constructive way within a new system. That’s probably the nicest way to put it.” \Davenport said he doesn’t have a firm stance on marijuana legalization, but “there are bigger issues in Vermont that we need to focus on.” \He said legalization would bring with it moral conflicts for adults across the state.\“You tell kids ‘don’t do drugs’ and all of a sudden you’re legalizing marijuana,” he said. “That’s a difficult place to be.” \Stuart’s position held a lot of principle, if less nuance.\“I’m dead set against it,” he said. “That will not ever change.” \Stuart said his position was informed by his time in the military, when he worked with drug interdiction forces in the Bahamas and Colombia, as well as a five-year stint urging youth camp attendees to avoid drug use as a member of the Vermont National Guard’s Counterdrug Task Force \“It’s a gateway drug, as far as I’m concerned,” he said. “We have such an opiate addiction problem, let’s not make it any easier.” \Stuart said that, after seeing the benefits of medical marijuana on pain levels experienced by his mother during a battle with lung cancer, he supports the fact that Vermont has legalized medical marijuana.\Education Reform\Lucke, Christie and Stuart all said that they favored reviewing Act 46, the education reform law passed last year that pushes school districts to merge into larger units. The law has come under fire for several reasons, but one of the primary objections is that some districts, including those in Hartland, West Windsor and Weathersfield, cannot currently merge with a district that operates a high school without giving up school choice.\Lucke, who voted for Act 46, said the law gave some districts the push they needed to better serve students. Other districts, including many in the Upper Valley, now need more tools, she said.\“There are places it has worked and places it has not,” Lucke said.\Davenport called Act 46 “a joke.” \“I’m not a fan of taking local control away from our communities when it comes to the education of their children,” he said. “That’s essentially what they want to do.” \Davenport said education funding would come more easily if Vermont would be more business-friendly, which he said would bring more employers and families into the state and allow schools to grow instead of shrink.\Stuart said he favors school choice and would consider repealing Act 46 altogether, but he also said he favored an even more aggressive approach to merging school district administrative structures, so that each county would operate under the control of a single superintendent and school board. He said he envisioned larger towns, including Hartford, having the right to opt out.\Christie, who helped craft Act 46, said the law has accomplished some of its goals by allowing school districts more flexibility in addressing the needs of their students and families, but he acknowledged that the choice issue needs to be fixed somehow.\“We’re not going to be let off the hook until we resolve it,” he said.\Windsor 4-1 District\Sue Buckholz, who has owned a law office in Quechee since 1995, is running unopposed for the Windsor 4-1 District Seat representing Pomfret, Barnard and West Hartford and much of Quechee. She would replace Zagar, who is not seeking re-election.\Buckholz, a Yale graduate and former town and school moderator in Hartford, said her professional life revolves around children and families, and has informed many of her political positions.\Her top priority, she said, is gaining more and better support services, such as universal daycare services, for children under six years of age.\“If we don’t take care of our children from zero to five, we're never going to get a handle on our prison budget,” she said. “We’re never going to get a handle on our school budget.”\Buckholz said she was a strong supporter of both the carbon tax and of marijuana legalization, which she said would destroy the black market that brings otherwise law-abiding citizens into contact with other drugs.\Matt Hongoltz-Hetling can be reached at mhonghet@vnews.com or 603-727-3211.\CREDIT: By Matt Hongoltz-Hetling"

Tuesday November 9, 2010
\
WASHINGTON (AP) -- A leading House Republican climate skeptic on Monday called for his party to preserve a global warming committee created by Democrats so Republicans can use it to rein in the Obama administration on the issue.
\
Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., said that the economic threat posed by Environmental Protection Agency regulations deserves special attention in the next Congress.
\
The EPA is set to regulate greenhouse gases next year for the first time, after the Supreme Court ruled in 2007 that it could treat heat-trapping gases such as carbon dioxide as pollutants. Many Republicans, who take control of the House in January, argue that the regulations would hurt the economy and kill jobs.
\
""No panel has developed more experience on these topics than the Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming,"" Sensenbrenner said in a statement. ""These regulations are moving quickly, but the oversight and subpoena power wielded by the select committee would put a tall hurdle in the path and would further expose the economic destruction these policies would bring.""
\
Sensenbrenner, the committee's top Republican, is in line to become chairman if his party keeps the panel. Brendan Buck, a spokesman for the Republican Majority Transition Committee, said that the decision will be made by GOP leadership -- subject to approval by the full party conference.
\
Michael Steel, a spokesman for Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, who is expected to become House speaker, said he has not heard any discussion about the panel. But some Republicans have already advocated putting the global warming committee on ice.
\
""The American people do not need Congress to spend millions of dollars to write reports and fly around the world,"" wrote Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., in a recent Washington Times op-ed. ""We must terminate this wasteful committee.""
\
Upton is a candidate to become next chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.
\
Democrats established the committee in 2007, after taking control of the House. At the time, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., called global warming possibly ""the greatest challenge of our time, setting at risk our economy, environment and national security."" With the committee, she said, ""the House is giving these issues the high visibility they deserve."" But from the very start, Republican committee members scoffed at claims about global warming as ""hot air"" and ""extremism.""
\
The committee has been chaired by Rep. Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat who was co-sponsor of legislation that would have limited pollution linked to global warming and redirected the nation toward greater use of clean energy. The bill narrowly passed the House last year. But it withered way in the Senate this year, despite a call for a carbon tax on fossil fuels or a cap-and-trade system for curbing greenhouse gas emissions by the National Academy of Sciences, which labeled global warming an urgent threat.
\
Markey spokesman Eben Burnham-Snyder declined to offer an opinion on Sensenbrenner's call.
\
""While we agree with Congressman Sensenbrenner that the select committee is ambitious and highly experienced in energy and climate issues, renewing the committee is a matter for his party's incoming speaker,"" he said.

100,"
Gov. Peter Shumlin signed an energy bill into law that promises to create 1,000 new jobs and help Vermonters save on energy costs over a 15-year period.
\
The bill, H.40, was passed by the Legislature in May and repeals the Sustainably Priced Energy Enterprise Development Program (SPEED). The legislation sets a new renewable energy standard and creates an ""energy transformation program"" that would start in 2017.
\
Shumlin said the legislation will put the state on a path to become 90 percent renewable by 2050.
\
Mary Powell, chief executive officer at Green Mountain Power, said the state's renewable energy standard and energy transformation program, known as RESET, ""is the most forward-leaning legislation in the country.""
\
Rep. Tony Klein, D-E. Montpelier, and Rep. Rebecca Ellis, D-Waterbury co-sponsored the bill. Sen. Chris Bray, chair of the Senate Committee on Natural Resources and Energy, shepherded the legislation through the Senate.
\
The governor gave the pens he used to sign the bill to Bray, Klein and Darren Springer, his chief of staff, for all ""their hard work"" on getting it passed through the Legislature.
\
""We're doing things that are good for people's pocketbooks and things that are good for the environment, and we're doing them together,"" Bray said.
\
Klein said the legislation ""is totally consumer-driven.""
\
Shumlin boasted that other governors say utility companies in their states would ""kill them"" if they did something similar and that there was no way their own utilities would cooperate with state government in a business model like that.
\
The renewable energy standard in the H.40 bill is the mirror image of a carbon tax, according to Bray. The Legislature will be investigating whether Vermont could impose a carbon tax in tandem with the new Renewable Energy Standard, he said.
\
Powell said she is interested in continuing to learn more about the carbon tax, but right now she is looking toward finding more innovative ways to bring costs down for Vermonters.
\
Klein entertained the notion of a carbon-tax bill in the last legislative session, but no bill emerged.
\
""All the major corporations know that carbon use needs to be managed,"" Klein said.
\
Powell said she doesn't believe there won't be other incentives in place for solar power by the time the current federal incentives for solar power die out at the end of 2016.
\
Under the renewable energy standard the state will provide leasing and on-bill financing for homeowners to improve energy efficiency.
\
Efficiency Vermont, a local program which is included as part of the bill, has been around since 2000. All of Vermont's electricity consumers, except IBM, pay an efficiency charge on their bills that is used to pay for energy efficiency programs. Burlington Electric manages energy efficiency programs for its customers and Efficiency Vermont manages the program for all other ratepayers. IBM funds its own energy efficiency program.
\
The bill was signed outside of the Montpelier home of Green Mountain Power customers Dan and Mary Margaret Groberg, who have made efficiency improvements.
\
The Grobergs moved into their home two years ago, Shumlin said. Under H.40, they have been able to upgrade their home's energy efficiency, saving them an estimated $1,400 a year on energy bills, according to the June 11 press release.
\
""We know we can't do fast enough what you are doing, and what you have the courage to do, across the state,"" Shumlin said to the Grobergs. Green Mountain Power also upgraded a house in Rutland a year ago as part of a broader effort to help homeowners save money through efficiency improvements.

101,"Valley News Staff Writer\Fairlee — A Danish energy expert who helped his community produce 100 percent of its energy through renewable sources gave the keynote address on Saturday at a gathering hosted by the Vermont Energy and Climate Action Network to discuss how best to meet the state’s own goal of 90 percent by 2050.\Soren Hermansen, director of the Samso Energy Academy on the island of Samso, Denmark, opened his talk at the ninth annual Vermont Community Energy and Climate Action Conference with a disclaimer.\“I don’t know what you expect,” he told the crowd of more than 100 at the Lake Morey Resort.\Hermansen said his island, which won a national competition to reach full renewable energy sourcing, had succeeded thanks to Denmark’s “long history” of support for sustainable energy — and, more than technical prowess, thanks to the community’s ability to band together and do what was necessary.\“It’s not about how we’re going to do it, because the technology is already there, ... but about why we want to do it,” he said. “Are you ready to have that discussion?” \Political and social differences were a challenge to energy advocates even on Samso, an island of 43 square miles that is home to about 3,800 people.\Hermansen said there had been conflict between residents of the north and south of Samso, who, despite living less than 10 miles apart, speak different dialects and have different social expectations that shape their approach to renewable goals — a difference he compared to the regional identity of the Northeast Kingdom versus Vermont’s more cosmopolitan areas.\Hermansen encouraged the audience to accept other Vermonters’ viewpoints, and seek consensus rather than absolute agreement.\“If we can agree to have common ground and talk about this, it’s OK to have different reasons to be at the table,” he said.\But he also addressed an unavoidable reality, one that sometimes requires compromise or sacrifice from some communities: renewable siting.\“We need to go a little farther than to say, not in front of my window,” he said. At some point, he said, people must recognize that to meet their goals “we need to find space for this.” \A large part of Samso’s energy — tens of thousands of megawatt-hours each year — comes from wind turbines, Hermansen said.\In Vermont, communities and politicians from both major parties have opposed industrial wind, citing concerns about turbines’ effect on the local environment and on the aesthetic value of ridgelines. Those opponents include Gov.-elect Phil Scott, a Berlin Republican who will replace Gov. Peter Shumlin, a wind advocate, in January.\“The governor-elect does not support industrial wind sited on Vermont’s ridgelines,” Scott spokesman Ethan Latour said in an email Saturday. “This position is based on the feedback he’s received from local communities where these projects have been built or proposed and because these turbines could be obsolete several years down the road as technological gains are made in the other renewable fields.” \Hermansen said Samso also relied on a carbon tax to hit its target — a strategy that he said the United States should follow. The Danish renewables expert said he had marveled at the enormous trucks he saw on America’s roads — “very big, heavy trucks, with one guy in it.” \“Why don’t you keep gasoline prices at four-something,” and then use the extra revenue to fund renewable projects, he said. “This must be a political target. I’ll leave it to you.” \Scott also opposes a carbon tax; however, he does back the state’s renewable goal, his spokesman said. The governor-elect believes the energy objective will be achievable, Latour said, “as innovation continues to accelerate in the renewable field and we develop strategies to become more energy efficient.” \“He believes the ability to store energy will be a game changer,” Latour added.\In an interview after his talk, Johanna Miller, coordinator of the Vermont Energy and Climate Action Network and the energy program director at the Vermont Natural Resources Council, expressed support for a carbon tax and said it should be a legislative priority in the upcoming session.\Miller, who introduced Hermansen on Saturday, said that the public conversation around renewables had become too focused on the areas where Vermonters disagree, and not enough on the state’s overall goals and the values that residents share in common.\“It’s not all about the controversial issues,” she said in response to a question about opposition to turbines and a carbon tax. “Wind is only one piece of the puzzle.” Wind, she said, was only a small piece of a comprehensive plan that included many different forms of energy. “It has dominated the conversation, but it will not dominate the energy portfolio.” \Miller said she was looking forward to having a “fair conversation” with Scott about carbon taxes, which she said should be brought up in the context of wider tax reform — and not referred to as an onerous extra cost on Vermonters.\The larger, and mostly unseen, part of Vermont’s drive to 90 percent will be the unglamorous, overlooked work of retrofitting buildings, getting local renewable energy groups started and bolstering their efforts around the state, she said.\“We have to make a decision as Vermonters: What are our values, and what are we willing to pay for them?” Miller asked.\Activists, organizers, businesspeople and politicians at the day-long conference attended workshops on every aspect of the renewable energy push, including navigating the legislative landscape, reducing carbon in transportation and making municipal buildings more efficient. Before Hermansen’s talk, VECAN gave awards for excellence in renewable energy, and afterward, professional storytellers gave tips on how to weave effective narratives around the topic of sustainability.\Near the end of his remarks, Hermansen told the Vermonters in attendance that their state could be to America what Samso had been to Denmark: A pioneering community that shows the rest of the country how an energy system reliant on renewables can work in practice.\“Vermont will be the (model) for green innovation in America,” he said. “And not ‘will be’ — is already, and will be even more.” \ \Rob Wolfe can be reached at rwolfe@vnews.com or at 603-727-3242.\CREDIT: By Rob Wolfe "
102,"
Norwich - Though the race for the two Vermont House seats covering Norwich, Sharon, Strafford and Thetford has quieted down since a four-way Democratic primary in August, state Rep. Jim Masland, D-Thetford, and independent opponent John Freitag had some sharp words for each other in separate interviews Tuesday.
\
""He's quite misinformed on a number of things. On most issues, in fact,"" Masland said of Freitag, who for his part has targeted the incumbent this summer and fall in a series of critical listserv posts and letters to the editor.
\
Freitag, a Strafford selectman and longtime Democrat, says he is running as an independent to challenge Masland over decisions that ""have been disappointing to me"" - in particular, the eight-term veteran's vote this spring for a bill designed to consolidate Vermont's small school districts into larger, regional entities.
\
After Masland and newcomer Tim Briglin, of Thetford, carried the Democratic primary, the campaign has seen much less action, the three candidates say. Briglin and Masland have met voters at several events this fall, but have not met with Freitag, and said they don't plan to before Tuesday's election for the Windsor-Orange 2 seats.
\
The two top vote-getters will win , regardless of party affiliation.
\
First-time candidates Briglin and Freitag launched their campaigns after state Rep. Kathy Hoyt, D-Norwich, announced she would not seek re-election, citing personal illness.
\
School Consolidation
\
As is the case in much of the state, residents of the four towns are debating the merits of school district consolidation after a bill to regionalize Vermont's school districts was stalled in the Senate this spring. The bill, which would have made consolidation voluntary at first and then mandatory beginning in 2018, squeaked through the House but stalled in the Senate.
\
On Tuesday, Freitag dismissed Masland's argument that the bill would have allowed for better sharing of resources among unequally funded districts. Vermont's school funding law, Act 60 followed by Act 68, which established a standard education tax rate and a statewide funding pool above that rate, have already addressed that problem, Freitag said.
\
Masland countered that some school districts, sometimes rural ones that are geographically isolated, have trouble coordinating their sharing efforts, leaving their students ""essentially disenfranchised.""
\
In the past, Masland has said that the proposed legislation would have taken too much power from local school boards, a flaw he would have corrected, given the opportunity.
\
Currently the maintenance director at the Newton School in Strafford, Freitag has held numerous positions in the community, including justice of the peace and chairman of the recreation board.
\
""As someone who's worked in a local school for the last 30 years and gone to the local school board meetings for the last 40 years, I know how valuable they are,"" he said.
\
Briglin, who led this summer's Democratic primary in votes, has said that consolidation makes sense from the perspective of cost and educational quality, but that each school board should have the choice whether or not to participate.
\
On Tuesday, Briglin also mentioned declining enrollment as an issue in education funding, though he had no direct answer to the problem. ""I don't think there's a legislative fix to increasing the number of school-age children in Vermont in the next legislative session,"" he said.
\
What could work, Briglin said, was to pursue long-term strategies - improving Internet access and creating affordable housing, attractive jobs and a positive environment for children - to bring young people to the state.
\
A founding partner at Tuckerman Capital in Hanover, Briglin comes to the ballot following a long career in finance, and currently serves on the board of Mascoma Savings Bank.
\
Tax Reform
\
Though student enrollment is declining statewide, school budgets so far have not dropped. Combined with a slow economic recovery, many Vermonters are concerned about rising property taxes.
\
Freitag blamed the tax burden in part on Gov. Peter Shumlin and the current Legislature.
\
""I was offended that Gov. Shumlin would have the chutzpah to lecture school boards on keeping their budget down, while at the same time in this last legislative session, they passed new bills that would add to property taxes,"" he said.
\
""If elected I pledge not to add any more state programs to be paid with property taxes,"" he wrote in a recent listserv post.
\
Given how heavily taxed the state is already, there will have to be cuts, Freitag said, though he couldn't identify any particular areas that needed cutting.
\
Freitag also supported a tax on carbon-based fuels. The revenue from gasoline and diesel fuel he would put into the highway fund, while money from heating oil would go towards weatherization programs.
\
Masland , who sits on the House Ways and Means Committee, said he supported a carbon tax ""in principle,"" but ""it's not going to be easy,"" given how easy it is for motorists to go to West Lebanon to buy gas.
\
On property taxes, Masland had similar doubts.
\
With each change to property taxes, some regions inevitably missed out, forcing the Legislature to mollify certain representatives with ""a slug of money"" to their districts, Masland said. Right now, he said, the state lacks the funds for such measures, so implementation of any reforms may have to wait until after Vermont finances universal health care and the economy improves.
\
""Property tax reform at this point is a zero-sum game,"" said Masland.
\
That said, Masland favors income tax reform, which he says can slightly grow state revenue by taxing adjusted gross income, a figure that would exclude several federal deductions currently used when Vermonters calculate their state income tax .
\
Briglin said that with the upcoming project of funding Green Mountain Care, Vermont's move to a universal health care system, tax reform would likely be a project anyway, but that there would have to be some cuts in the meantime.
\
Programs like mental health and opiate addiction services would be ""very difficult to cut further,"" he said, as well as child and family services.
\
Implementing Single-Payer
\
Shumlin recently has said that he will wait until January to disclose his funding plan for Green Mountain Care, which is projected to cost about $2 billion. By law, the deadline to implement the plan falls in January 2017, a date the governor has said he will do his best to meet.
\
All of the Windsor-Orange 2 candidates expect the transition to universal health care to take some time, but Freitag differs with his Democratic opponents over what that process should look like.
\
Given the delay in releasing a financing plan, Freitag said that Vermont should wait until the after the 2016 election cycle to go forward with single-payer health care, so that voters have a chance to weigh in.
\
""I certainly am for universal, equitably funded health care, but the way you do it is you lay it out there and you fight for it. You put it out there so it has to withstand public scrutiny,"" he said.
\
But Masland said that Freitag's idea is impractical, because of the confines of the legislative calendar.
\
""I see his point, but if the Legislature devises a finance system and doesn't pass it within the biennium, then that bill dies,"" Masland said. ""That's the way it works. That bill is dead.""
\
As for when the new system was likely to come into effect, Masland said he ""wouldn't be the slightest bit surprised"" if a financing plan took two years to finalize, so 2017 was a likely ballpark guess.
\
In Briglin's view, the process was already likely to take a long time, long enough that the public would have every opportunity to contribute to the discussion.
\
""John might be getting what he's asking for anyway, in that, in November of 2016, we might still be debating some of these issues,"" Briglin said.

103,"This week’s frightening United Nations’ global warming report depicts a world unable to combat climate change unless it takes “unprecedented” action. It warns that the Earth’s temperature could rise by 1.5 degrees Celsius or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit above pre-industrial levels by the end of the century.\As a result of warming, most climate scientists predict worse and more frequent floods, wildfires in the West and droughts in the Midwest — as well as all the human suffering and property damage these disasters cause.\ Even the Trump administration pulled its head out of the sand in August to acknowledge that the planet is warming but then said it won’t fight it. This comes from an administration that is abetting polluters by cutting emissions standards on vehicles and coal plants, dropping out of an international climate-change agreement, cutting staff at the Environmental Protection Agency and putting it in the hands of cheerleaders for the fossil fuel industry. That’s suicidal. It would be extremely foolish for anyone to adopt the administration’s fatalistic attitude because there are solutions — the polluters just don’t like them.\ On Nov. 6, voters have a chance to elect candidates who are committed to fight global warming. One third of the Senate and all 435 House seats are up this year. If you’re not sure how to vote, just click on www.opensecrets.org and see which candidates are taking money from polluters.\ But even if voters across the country fail to elect a climate-sensitive Congress, they can make changes in their own states, which are picking up the job of protecting our environment.\ Next month, residents of Washington state will vote on a carbon tax that would cost polluters $15 for every ton of carbon dioxide they spew into our air. The state says it could raise over $2 billion in five years. Washington would invest the money in clean energy development and mass transit as well as programs to protect forests and streams. A similar initiative failed in 2016, but if this one passes, Washington would become the first state to impose a carbon tax, and others may follow.\Pennsylvania is a state deeply involved in both fracking and cracking — “fracking” means drilling into and fracturing rock to release gas; “cracking” is an industry term for breaking oil and gas into smaller molecules to create ethylene, used in manufacturing plastics — and it has a long way to go in being environmentally friendly, though Attorney General Josh Shapiro has joined other states in suing the EPA over the rollback of emission standards. New Jersey, generally better on environmental issues, is fighting offshore oil drilling with a tough new ban, updating its Shore Protection Plan, and making it easier for offshore wind farm development \ Consumers play an important role, too. They can choose clean energy to fuel their homes and vehicles. If they won’t, the government should hit consumers in the wallets with a consumer carbon tax on fossil fuel usage.\ Even small steps matter, including using mass transit, trading in plastic bags for reusable sacks, and supporting tree planting programs.\ If we don’t fight climate change now, we will lose our quality of life and condemn future generations to a world where just breathing could be dangerous.\The Philadelphia Inquirer "
104,"Vermont's choices for lieutenant governor come down to two clashing personalities and sets of priorities.\Progressive/Democratic candidate David Zuckerman of Hinesburg, who has been an lawmaker in the House of Representatives and Senate, hopes to use the lieutenant governor's office to organize grassroots support for issues such as marijuana legalization and a higher minimum wage.\Republican nominee Randy Brock of Swanton has his eye on big-picture discussions about growing and retaining businesses.\The former state auditor and state senator speaks cautiously about new economic programs, but has pledged to find new money for the state budget.\Vermont's lieutenant governor presides over the Senate and can cast a vote in cases of a tie. Though the lieutenant governor has little direct influence over policy, he or she helps decide who serves on Senate committees.\The lieutenant governor also serves as acting governor when the governor is away, and is next in line for the top job.\Here's where Brock and Zuckerman stand on some of the key issues facing Vermont:\State spending\Brock says state government has a ""spending problem"" and offers ideas he says will mean $100 million in new revenue or savings for Vermont. Those ideas include using the federal EB-5 visa program to finance public roads, bridges and Lake Champlain cleanup, attracting rental car companies to register vehicles in Vermont, and restoring the motion picture tax credit.\Zuckerman says average Vermonters have been taxed out. He has defended votes for past tax increases to protect programs that support working-class residents.\Marijuana\Brock has said, ""Now's not the time,"" citing concerns about statistics related to legalization in Colorado.\Zuckerman is a leading advocate for legal recreational marijuana, and would use the resulting tax revenue for drug abuse prevention, education and treatment, as well as several other policy goals.\Economic development\Brock wants to build a business-friendly culture in state government, particularly among mid-level employers. He has said that as lieutenant governor he would build relationships with business leaders and find CEOs in specific industries who might be willing to move their companies to Vermont.\Zuckerman would use revenue from legalized marijuana to invest in Vermont State Colleges as well as telecommunications and broadband infrastructure for rural areas. He also plans to create a task force focusing on Vermont's rural economy.\Carbon tax\Brock does not support a carbon tax proposal.\Zuckerman would consider a carbon tax if the state could return money to low-income Vermonters who would be affected. ""The devil's in the details, and it's not just a blanket support,"" Zuckerman said during a debate at the Tunbridge World's Fair.\Guns\Brock wants to leave Vermont gun laws alone.\Zuckerman supports background checks on all gun sales and has said Vermont should ""look at"" possible restrictions to clip sizes.\Vermont Health Connect\Brock would like to abandon Vermont Health Connect, the health insurance marketplace built under Obamacare, and move instead to the federal exchange.\Zuckerman would prefer that Vermont continue trying to solve problems with Vermont Health Connect rather than moving to an alternative. In a debate, Zuckerman said, ""We still have to reinvest in making it work right, which isn't a very popular answer.""\Health care\Brock has reservations about Vermont's new ""all-payer"" overhaul of the health care system, which would pay health providers based on patient outcomes. Brock says the all-payer model raises the possibility of people gaming the system. He says the state should pursue incremental, reversible changes to the health care system.\Zuckerman remains committed to a single-payer health care system for all Vermonters and is interested in a universal primary care system to build toward that goal.\Property taxes\Brock says tying property tax to income would make state revenue less predictable. He wants to see a model where local communities would see a greater impact from local school budget decisions.\Zuckerman supports a Progressive proposal to link property taxes to income for all Vermonters, making wealthy residents pay ""their fair share.""\Minimum wage\Brock does not support raising the minimum wage beyond what has already been written in state law. Vermont is on track to bring the minimum wage to $10.50 by 2018, then index the wage to inflation.\Zuckerman supports raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour over four or five years.\Environment and energy\Brock is skeptical of whether Vermont's 90 percent renewable energy goal is ""doable."" He is concerned about the environmental impact of large-scale wind projects, and would focus on energy efficiency, hydropower and smaller wind, biomass and solar projects.\Zuckerman supports wind energy as part of Vermont's 90 percent renewable energy goal.\Contact April McCullum at 802-660-1863 or aburbank@freepressmedia.com.

105,"Valley News Staff Writer\Hartland — Three Hartland residents are vying for two seats in the Vermont House district that represents Windsor, West Windsor and Hartland.\Four-term Democratic state Rep. John Bartholomew, a retired veterinarian, is running for re-election alongside newcomers Zachariah Ralph, a Democrat who champions nonprofits and community organizing efforts, and Wesley Raney, a Republican small business owner with libertarian views.\Bartholomew, 63, and Ralph, 31, who works for Sustainable Woodstock, have similar views when it comes to backing gun measures Gov. Phil Scott signed last session and instituting a carbon tax in some way, shape or form. Raney, 32, has polar opposite views on those two topics.\Bartholomew voted in favor of the gun regulations that expanded background checks, prohibited sales to people under the age of 21 unless they take a safety course, banned bump stocks and took firearms away from people in domestic violence and suicidal situations. He called it “common-sense legislation.” \Had he been in the House at that time, Ralph said, he too would have backed those measures, though he acknowledged that he isn’t sure how effective some of the changes will be. Nevertheless, he would like to see stronger gun regulations and to include gun owners on the conversation.\Raney, a Hartland native who works at the River Valley Club and owns Green Mountain Armory, strongly opposes the recent gun regulations, asserting “they only penalize law-abiding citizens.” He also opposes a carbon tax — or any additional tax, for that matter.\“I don’t want people to be interfered with by the government more than necessary,” said Raney, a lifelong Windsor County resident who described himself as a “strong supporter” of the U.S. Constitution.\Both Bartholomew and Ralph, who grew up in Woodstock, are strong advocates for renewable energy and combating climate change. As far as a carbon tax goes, Bartholomew said there are a lot of factors that still would need to be fleshed out but that it “makes sense.” He wouldn’t see it as a “tax” though, as it would need to be “revenue neutral,” he said.\There has to be incentives for people who cut their carbon footprint, and people who can’t afford to make changes shouldn’t be penalized, Ralph said.\Raney said he supports the use of nuclear energy, saying that “it outputs less (carbon dioxide) than solar energy.” \The three candidates have somewhat similar views on Act 46, the state’s school consolidation law. The Windsor and West Windsor school districts merged under the act, while Hartland stands alone and still offers school choice. \For the most part, all three candidates oppose Act 46, with Ralph and Raney saying they favor “local control.” Educators lacked guidance from the state about the consolidation process, making it confusing, Ralph said. \The state should stick with it for now and continue to figure out how to best fund education, Ralph added.\“I do support at least exploring the idea of moving education funding from property taxes to income taxes,” Ralph said.\Raney said he would rather have seen towns merge on their own accord.\The topic of education is tricky, especially with a declining student population, Bartholomew said. Cutting costs while providing students with a top-notch education must be balanced, he said.\“I didn’t think it did what it needed to do and it hasn’t proved to be any great benefit for our supervisory union,” Bartholomew said of Act 46, which he missed the vote for.\The three candidates also support recreational marijuana and taxing and regulating it, saying that prohibition hasn’t worked. Ralph and Bartholomew both agreed that a regulated system must be approached with caution.\Raney said he takes a libertarian view on the topic.\“It is just a plant,” Raney said. “I can’t come up with any kind of rational reason for why it shouldn’t be legal.” \Ralph said he doesn’t want the state to become dependent on revenue from a marijuana market and would work to keep the industry local. \He also would protect children from “predatory marketing practices and products.” \Bartholomew said a taxed and regulated system must be fully vetted.\“I am not eager to see commercial operations that are focused on increasing sales. That has me concerned,” Bartholomew said. “I think there are good reasons to explore it. ... (but it) needs to be custom-made for Vermont.” \Bartholomew and Ralph support increasing the minimum wage. Raney doesn’t.\If elected, Raney vowed to vote “against anything that erodes your freedom or livelihood.” \Ralph, who supports campaign finance reform, said his primary focus would be on climate change and the environment.\“If we are not addressing the issue of climate change, there is very little else that matters,” he said.\Climate change and energy also are on Bartholomew’s mind, as well as matching students’ education with available job opportunities. He said his experience in the Legislature and background in public service make him a good candidate for re-election.\“I also am good at listening to people,” he said. “I am not going to learn anything with my mouth open.” \The other seat in the district had been held by state Rep. Paul Belaski, D-Windsor, but Ralph defeated him in the Democratic primary.\Jordan Cuddemi can be reached at jcuddemi@vnews.com or 603-727-3248.\CREDIT: By Jordan Cuddemi "
106,"SIS:\MISSING TEXT: Several lines from ""Up in the Air,"" the article in the ""Car Less"" series that began on Page 1D in Sunday's Free Press, were missing from the top of Page 2D. Here is the complete text, from the last paragraph on Page 1D through the first paragraph on Page 2D:\To be sure, Vermont has taken some actions. Like most other New England states, Vermont has moved to improve the fuel efficiency of its state fleet and to upgrade the energy efficiency of state buildings and other operations of state government. Like most other New England states, it has adopted California's stricter tailpipe-emission standards for newer cars, and has signaled its intent to sign on to a new California standard that aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in new cars. Vermont has added bus lines in the northwestern part of the state, and like other states, has encouraged forms of ride sharing and alternative transit.\None of these measures has made a significant dent in Vermont's greenhouse gas emissions. State government accounts for less than 3 percent of Vermont's total emissions. Public transit and ride-sharing programs are used by a tiny fraction of the state's commuters. The new California emission standard would not go into effect until the 2009 model year.\Here's the bewildering thing about climate change: It's invisible. So, too, are the gaseous emissions believed to bring it about. Their supposed effects are complex, expensive, and for the most part, years away -- unseen. Emissions are easy to ignore.\It's the same with policies that try to limit climate change -- exceedingly complex, expensive, easy to ignore.\If nobody makes a serious effort to limit a state's total emissions of carbon dioxide, the most plentiful greenhouse gas, who will notice? Nobody gets sick from carbon dioxide in the great outdoors. Nor can anyone be sure if the year-to-year variations in temperature, or the severity of storms, has anything to do with the buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. If carbon dioxide and other ""greenhouse gases"" really do affect the climate in the Northeast, another generation or two might go by before people really start to see the effects -- such as the dwindling of the maples, the dulling of the foliage.\Nevertheless, most states in New England have started making serious, comprehensive attempts to do something about climate change. They have invested in analyzing where their emissions are coming from, and in what amounts -- a complicated and time-consuming technical undertaking, but necessary if a state is to determine, rigorously, how and where to reduce emissions.\Some states have hired consultants to help them develop climate-change policies. Some states began, two to three years ago, to convene meetings of ""stakeholders"" -- municipalities, private businesses, environmentalists and so on -- to formulate policy options and seek consensus. Three of the New England states have developed and published comprehensive climate-change action plans with specific measures and quantitative strategies for reducing or limiting total greenhouse gas emissions. Four states have each pledged to reduce total emissions to 1990 levels by 2010, in keeping with a regional goal set in 2001.\Not Vermont.\Vermont does not have a plan for reducing statewide greenhouse gas emissions. Vermont has not committed to reducing its emissions to 1990 levels by 2010. Vermont does not have an updated accounting of its greenhouse gas emissions. (The most recent year for which official data are available is 1990.)\To be sure, Vermont has taken some actions. Like most other New England states, Vermont has moved to improve the fuel efficiency of its state fleet and to upgrade the energy efficiency of state buildings and other operations of state government. Like most other New England states, it has adopted California's stricter tailpipe-emission standards for newer cars, and has signaled its intent to sign on to a new California standard that aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in new cars. Vermont has added bus lines in the northwestern part of the state, and like other states, has encouraged forms of ride sharing and alternative transit.\None of these measures has made a significant dent in Vermont's greenhouse gas emissions. State government accounts for less than 3 percent of Vermont's total emissions. Public transit and ride-sharing programs are used by a tiny fraction of the state's commuters. The new California emission standard would not go into effect until the 2009 model year.\Vermont's total emissions in 2001 were 23 percent higher than in 1990, according to an analysis released earlier this year by the New England Climate Coalition, which includes state Public Interest Research Groups and other environmental-advocacy organizations. Indeed, when it comes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, Vermont might face a tougher challenge than any of its New England counterparts.\That's because Vermont is the only state in the region whose emissions come primarily from cars. Officials working on climate-change policy in other states acknowledge that emissions from cars might be the toughest to contain -- tougher than those from industry, commerce or electric utilities.\Vermont's total Vehicle Miles Traveled increased 35 percent from 1990 to 2003, according to the state's statistics. As late as August, as gas prices rose, people in Vermont were driving about as much as before: Gas tax receipts for that month were down 1 percent from August the previous year; diesel tax receipts were up.\Halfway through the decade that was supposed to put a regional curb on climate-changing emissions, Vermont's primary challenge -- transportation -- is one that the state has barely begun to confront.\The regional initiative\Four years ago, not long after the United States refused to sign an international treaty to cut emissions, New England governors and Eastern Canadian premiers decided to take matters into their own hands.\In August 2001, they adopted a ""Climate Change Action Plan"" that established regional goals and set forth a framework for achieving them.\The short-term goal was to reduce the region's emissions to 1990 levels by 2010. Each state or province was to develop its own plan for making reductions.\Four states -- Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts and Rhode Island -- have drawn up climate action plans that commit to that goal at the state level. Officials in some of those states say they have a shot at attaining the goal, or at least coming close.\Vermont and New Hampshire have agreed only to work toward the regional goal.\When a bill in the Vermont House (H.49) was introduced this past session to establish that same 2010 emissions goal for the state, Jeffrey Wennberg, commissioner of environmental conservation, and Tom Torti, secretary of the Agency of Natural Resources, both took issue with the bill during hearings before the House Natural Resources and Energy Committee, asking the panel to defer action until next year. (The bill remains in committee.) Wennberg said that the goal would be ""exceedingly difficult to achieve,"" a ""far more difficult task"" in Vermont than in the other states or provinces.\Why more difficult in Vermont? In part because such a large share of Vermont's emissions come from transportation. All the other states have large fossil-fuel burning power plants, and most have bigger industrial and commercial sectors. Most of the electricity Vermont consumes is produced by non-emitting power generators, nuclear and hydro. So, Vermont's greenhouse gas emissions from the electrical sector are negligible, ""the envy of the nation,"" according to Wennberg.\As John Sayles, director of policy research and planning in the Agency of Natural Resources, put it recently, in discussing the challenge of reducing emissions: ""There's low-hanging fruit in other states"" -- for example, you can put a scrubber on a power plant to cut down on some emissions. Vermont has no ""low-hanging fruit,"" he said -- you can't put a scrubber on several hundred thousand cars.\The bill, which according to its principal sponsor, Rep. Steven Maier, D-Middlebury, was inspired by the regional plan, called among other things for Vermont to develop its own climate-action plan and its own inventory of greenhouse gas emissions.\Torti told the committee that the Agency of Natural Resources could not afford to do all the work the bill called for.\""We don't have the resources to do all the environmental work we're supposed to do now,"" Torti said. Wennberg said the bill provided no resources for a task that would likely require additional employees and hundreds of thousands of dollars.\Yet this is a financial commitment that other states have chosen to make. Detailed, comprehensive climate-action plans in Connecticut, Maine and Rhode Island have been hammered out over the past three years. Rhode Island's cost about $200,000; Maine's, about $250,000; Connecticut's, about $500,000. How did Connecticut come up with that kind of money, on top of all its other environmental regulatory responsibilities?\""It's a matter of deciding what your priorities are,"" said Chris James, director or air planning in the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection.\Vermont's priority has been to promote efficiencies in state government, following executive orders in 2002 and 2003 by Govs. Dean and Douglas, and this year, a detailed report drawn up by the Climate Neutral Working Group, a committee of state-agency representatives.\The regional plan calls state-government initiatives ""leading by example,"" and most of New England's state governments have sought to do so -- adding hybrid cars to state fleets, making state buildings more energy-efficient. (Vermont's state government accounted for about 2.2 percent of the state's total carbon dioxide emissions in 1990, according to the Agency of Natural Resources.)\Vermont also participates in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a cooperative effort of nine Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states to discuss the design of a regional ""cap-and-trade program"" covering carbon dioxide emissions. The program would apply just to electric power and not to Vermont's biggest greenhouse-gas bugaboo, transportation.\As for a statewide climate-action plan, Vermont will have one, and it will be funded, Wennberg said last week. He declined to specify a timetable for developing the plan. ""It's going to be announced in the near future,"" he said. Coming to grips with transportation\Vermont's total greenhouse gas emissions -- and the population that produces them -- are smaller than those of any other New England state.\Wennberg told the House committee that Vermont's emissions per capita were lower than for any other state in the region. (That's in part because each of the other states, unlike Vermont, has fossil-fuel burning power plants that account for about a quarter of total emissions.) Even if Vermont cut its emissions to zero, this reduction would have a negligible effect on the global greenhouse gas problem.\Does all of this mean that Vermont can ignore its rising greenhouse gas emissions?\If Vermont's emissions continue to go up, then for the regional goal to be reached, other states or provinces will have to compensate by cutting their emissions even more than they otherwise would. Moreover, the nature of the emissions problems vary from state to state, but each state is committed to working on its unique situation.\Only in Vermont does transportation account for more than half the carbon dioxide problem.\Compounding Vermont's transportation challenge are recent trends in the U.S. auto industry. Over the last 20 years, according to a study of cars and light trucks by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the thrust of technological innovation has been to increase vehicles' weight, power and acceleration. Average fuel economy hasn't improved significantly since about 1990. In other words, people have been buying bigger and more powerful vehicles, without regard for better gas mileage.\Why does this matter? ""Fuel economy is directly related to emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide,"" states the EPA. The more miles per gallon your car gets, the less carbon dioxide it gives out for each mile you drive.\Other states in New England are working on transportation measures that have yet to receive serious consideration in Vermont, among them:\Incentive to buy hybrids: Gas-electric hybrids are more fuel-efficient, and thus lower emitters. Connecticut dropped the sales tax on hybrids last year. A bill to do that was introduced in Vermont House in the spring, but it didn't get a hearing in the Transportation Committee.\In any case, hybrids are a small part of any solution. Of the 423,724 ""pleasure cars"" registered with the Vermont Department of Motor Vehicles, 1,150 are hybrids -- less than half of 1 percent. The state fleet, for its part, has 13 Toyota Priuses and 25 Honda Civic hybrids.\A ""feebate"" program: Connecticut, Maine and Rhode Island have included this idea in their climate-change action plans. In Connecticut, the legislature asked a task force to come up with a proposal for the next session. The program would apply to purchases of new vehicles: Gas guzzlers would be assessed a fee; fuel-efficient cars would get a rebate. The program could be designed to be ""revenue neutral"" -- that is, so that total fees would pay for total rebates.\A bill to establish a feebate program was introduced in the Vermont House during the last session. It didn't get a hearing in the Transportation Committee. Chairman Rep. Richard Westman, R-Cambridge, said, however, that there have been discussions about revising registration fees to promote ownership of fuel-efficient vehicles.\Slowing growth in Vehicle Miles Traveled: This is an explicit goal in Maine's and Connecticut's climate-change plans; in Rhode Island, it's a ""priority study option."" In Maine's plan, which ranks 55 policy options in order of carbon dioxide savings, slowing VMT growth is No. 17. One way to do that is to foster ""smart growth"" development, clustered housing or in-fill development. Connecticut's plan calls for ""smart growth"" initiatives coupled with transit improvements, and urges consideration of ""pay-as-you-drive"" insurance.\Reducing VMT growth is not a formal policy goal of Vermont's Agency of Transportation, beyond the state's promotion of public transit, ride-sharing, bike/pedestrian programs. Apart from such programs, ""Vermont has explicitly stayed away from reducing VMT as a policy goal,"" said Ian Grossman, spokesman for the agency. One reason is that ""This type of 'social engineering' is not something the agency sees as part of our mission.""\Transportation planning: Greenhouse gas emissions are not taken into account in the planning of Vermont's transportation projects. ""Because there is no adequate scientific knowledge to understand the effect of a single highway project on climate change, we do not consider potential increases in greenhouse gas emissions (or the effects on climate change) when planning specific transportation projects,"" Grossman said.\By contrast, Massachusetts' ""Climate Protection Plan"" states: ""Considering greenhouse gas emissions when making transportation planning and funding decisions will be a powerful tool in state efforts to reduce transportation's harmful impacts on the environment. There are many opportunities to curb growing GHG emissions through the transportation planning process, but traditionally these have not been considered."" The unavoidable truth\Sooner or later, all efforts to cut down on transportation emissions run up against an unavoidable fact: Any car that burns gasoline, no matter how efficient, emits carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is an inevitable byproduct of combustion.\So, if drivers want to churn out less carbon dioxide, they'll have to use less gasoline. They can do that by driving more efficient cars or by driving less. Either way means conserving energy.\That's why the most obvious policy measure to reduce emissions from transportation -- and from every other energy sector -- is one that promotes conservation. It's a measure that has been adopted in New Zealand and in some parts of Europe. In the United States, it's deemed so politically unpalatable that most states grappling with climate change aren't even considering it.\It's called a carbon tax: a tax on energy sources that spew carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Earlier this year, an endorsement of a national carbon tax emerged from an unlikely source -- the CEO of an electric utility.\Paul Andersen, of Duke Energy, gave a speech in Charlotte, N.C., that called for such a tax. He told his listeners that Americans have to confront the fact that they can't have it both ways -- a better environment and cheap energy.\""We need to face up to the inconsistency of our demands,"" Andersen said. ""It's time to recognize that if we want a better environment, we're going to have to pay more for energy.""\Contact Tim Johnson at 660-1808 or tjohnson@bfp.burlingtonfreepress.com"

The new California emission standard would not go into effect until the 2009 model year.\Vermont's total emissions in 2001 were 23 percent higher than in 1990, according to an analysis released earlier this year by the New England Climate Coalition, which includes state Public Interest Research Groups and other environmental-advocacy organizations. Indeed, when it comes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, Vermont might face a tougher challenge than any of its New England counterparts.\That's because Vermont is the only state in the region whose emissions come primarily from cars. Officials working on climate-change policy in other states acknowledge that emissions from cars might be the toughest to contain -- tougher than those from industry, commerce or electric utilities.\Vermont's total Vehicle Miles Traveled increased 35 percent from 1990 to 2003, according to the state's statistics. As late as August, as gas prices rose, people in Vermont were driving about as much as before: Gas tax receipts for that month were down 1 percent from August the previous year; diesel tax receipts were up.\Halfway through the decade that was supposed to put a regional curb on climate-changing emissions, Vermont's primary challenge -- transportation -- is one that the state has barely begun to confront.\The regional initiative\Four years ago, not long after the United States refused to sign an international treaty to cut emissions, New England governors and Eastern Canadian premiers decided to take matters into their own hands.\In August 2001, they adopted a ""Climate Change Action Plan"" that established regional goals and set forth a framework for achieving them.\The short-term goal was to reduce the region's emissions to 1990 levels by 2010. Each state or province was to develop its own plan for making reductions.\Four states -- Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts and Rhode Island -- have drawn up climate action plans that commit to that goal at the state level. Officials in some of those states say they have a shot at attaining the goal, or at least coming close.\Vermont and New Hampshire have agreed only to work toward the regional goal.\When a bill in the Vermont House (H.49) was introduced this past session to establish that same 2010 emissions goal for the state, Jeffrey Wennberg, commissioner of environmental conservation, and Tom Torti, secretary of the Agency of Natural Resources, both took issue with the bill during hearings before the House Natural Resources and Energy Committee, asking the panel to defer action until next year. (The bill remains in committee.) Wennberg said that the goal would be ""exceedingly difficult to achieve,"" a ""far more difficult task"" in Vermont than in the other states or provinces.\Why more difficult in Vermont? In part because such a large share of Vermont's emissions come from transportation. All the other states have large fossil-fuel burning power plants, and most have bigger industrial and commercial sectors. Most of the electricity Vermont consumes is produced by non-emitting power generators, nuclear and hydro. So, Vermont's greenhouse gas emissions from the electrical sector are negligible, ""the envy of the nation,"" according to Wennberg.\As John Sayles, director of policy research and planning in the Agency of Natural Resources, put it recently, in discussing the challenge of reducing emissions: ""There's low-hanging fruit in other states"" -- for example, you can put a scrubber on a power plant to cut down on some emissions. Vermont has no ""low-hanging fruit,"" he said -- you can't put a scrubber on several hundred thousand cars.\The bill, which according to its principal sponsor, Rep. Steven Maier, D-Middlebury, was inspired by the regional plan, called among other things for Vermont to develop its own climate-action plan and its own inventory of greenhouse gas emissions.\Torti told the committee that the Agency of Natural Resources could not afford to do all the work the bill called for.\""We don't have the resources to do all the environmental work we're supposed to do now,"" Torti said. Wennberg said the bill provided no resources for a task that would likely require additional employees and hundreds of thousands of dollars.\Yet this is a financial commitment that other states have chosen to make. Detailed, comprehensive climate-action plans in Connecticut, Maine and Rhode Island have been hammered out over the past three years. Rhode Island's cost about $200,000; Maine's, about $250,000; Connecticut's, about $500,000. How did Connecticut come up with that kind of money, on top of all its other environmental regulatory responsibilities?\""It's a matter of deciding what your priorities are,"" said Chris James, director or air planning in the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection.\Vermont's priority has been to promote efficiencies in state government, following executive orders in 2002 and 2003 by Govs. Dean and Douglas, and this year, a detailed report drawn up by the Climate Neutral Working Group, a committee of state-agency representatives.\The regional plan calls state-government initiatives ""leading by example,"" and most of New England's state governments have sought to do so -- adding hybrid cars to state fleets, making state buildings more energy-efficient. (Vermont's state government accounted for about 2.2 percent of the state's total carbon dioxide emissions in 1990, according to the Agency of Natural Resources.)\Vermont also participates in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a cooperative effort of nine Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states to discuss the design of a regional ""cap-and-trade program"" covering carbon dioxide emissions. The program would apply just to electric power and not to Vermont's biggest greenhouse-gas bugaboo, transportation.\As for a statewide climate-action plan, Vermont will have one, and it will be funded, Wennberg said last week. He declined to specify a timetable for developing the plan. ""It's going to be announced in the near future,"" he said.\Coming to grips with transportation\Vermont's total greenhouse gas emissions -- and the population that produces them -- are smaller than those of any other New England state.\Wennberg told the House committee that Vermont's emissions per capita were lower than for any other state in the region. (That's in part because each of the other states, unlike Vermont, has fossil-fuel burning power plants that account for about a quarter of total emissions.) Even if Vermont cut its emissions to zero, this reduction would have a negligible effect on the global greenhouse gas problem.\Does all of this mean that Vermont can ignore its rising greenhouse gas emissions?\If Vermont's emissions continue to go up, then for the regional goal to be reached, other states or provinces will have to compensate by cutting their emissions even more than they otherwise would. Moreover, the nature of the emissions problems vary from state to state, but each state is committed to working on its unique situation.\Only in Vermont does transportation account for more than half the carbon dioxide problem.\Compounding Vermont's transportation challenge are recent trends in the U.S. auto industry. Over the last 20 years, according to a study of cars and light trucks by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the thrust of technological innovation has been to increase vehicles' weight, power and acceleration. Average fuel economy hasn't improved significantly since about 1990. In other words, people have been buying bigger and more powerful vehicles, without regard for better gas mileage.\Why does this matter? ""Fuel economy is directly related to emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide,"" states the EPA. The more miles per gallon your car gets, the less carbon dioxide it gives out for each mile you drive.\Other states in New England are working on transportation measures that have yet to receive serious consideration in Vermont, among them:\Incentive to buy hybrids: Gas-electric hybrids are more fuel-efficient, and thus lower emitters. Connecticut dropped the sales tax on hybrids last year. A bill to do that was introduced in Vermont House in the spring, but it didn't get a hearing in the Transportation Committee.\In any case, hybrids are a small part of any solution. Of the 423,724 ""pleasure cars"" registered with the Vermont Department of Motor Vehicles, 1,150 are hybrids -- less than half of 1 percent. The state fleet, for its part, has 13 Toyota Priuses and 25 Honda Civic hybrids.\A ""feebate"" program: Connecticut, Maine and Rhode Island have included this idea in their climate-change action plans. In Connecticut, the legislature asked a task force to come up with a proposal for the next session. The program would apply to purchases of new vehicles: Gas guzzlers would be assessed a fee; fuel-efficient cars would get a rebate. The program could be designed to be ""revenue neutral"" -- that is, so that total fees would pay for total rebates.\A bill to establish a feebate program was introduced in the Vermont House during the last session. It didn't get a hearing in the Transportation Committee. Chairman Rep. Richard Westman, R-Cambridge, said, however, that there have been discussions about revising registration fees to promote ownership of fuel-efficient vehicles.\Slowing growth in Vehicle Miles Traveled: This is an explicit goal in Maine's and Connecticut's climate-change plans; in Rhode Island, it's a ""priority study option."" In Maine's plan, which ranks 55 policy options in order of carbon dioxide savings, slowing VMT growth is No. 17. One way to do that is to foster ""smart growth"" development, clustered housing or in-fill development. Connecticut's plan calls for ""smart growth"" initiatives coupled with transit improvements, and urges consideration of ""pay-as-you-drive"" insurance.\Reducing VMT growth is not a formal policy goal of Vermont's Agency of Transportation, beyond the state's promotion of public transit, ride-sharing, bike/pedestrian programs. Apart from such programs, ""Vermont has explicitly stayed away from reducing VMT as a policy goal,"" said Ian Grossman, spokesman for the agency. One reason is that ""This type of 'social engineering' is not something the agency sees as part of our mission.""\Transportation planning: Greenhouse gas emissions are not taken into account in the planning of Vermont's transportation projects. ""Because there is no adequate scientific knowledge to understand the effect of a single highway project on climate change, we do not consider potential increases in greenhouse gas emissions (or the effects on climate change) when planning specific transportation projects,"" Grossman said.\By contrast, Massachusetts' ""Climate Protection Plan"" states: ""Considering greenhouse gas emissions when making transportation planning and funding decisions will be a powerful tool in state efforts to reduce transportation's harmful impacts on the environment. There are many opportunities to curb growing GHG emissions through the transportation planning process, but traditionally these have not been considered.""\The unavoidable truth\Sooner or later, all efforts to cut down on transportation emissions run up against an unavoidable fact: Any car that burns gasoline, no matter how efficient, emits carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is an inevitable byproduct of combustion.\So, if drivers want to churn out less carbon dioxide, they'll have to use less gasoline. They can do that by driving more efficient cars or by driving less. Either way means conserving energy.\That's why the most obvious policy measure to reduce emissions from transportation -- and from every other energy sector -- is one that promotes conservation. It's a measure that has been adopted in New Zealand and in some parts of Europe. In the United States, it's deemed so politically unpalatable that most states grappling with climate change aren't even considering it.\It's called a carbon tax: a tax on energy sources that spew carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Earlier this year, an endorsement of a national carbon tax emerged from an unlikely source -- the CEO of an electric utility.\Paul Andersen, of Duke Energy, gave a speech in Charlotte, N.C., that called for such a tax. He told his listeners that Americans have to confront the fact that they can't have it both ways -- a better environment and cheap energy.\""We need to face up to the inconsistency of our demands,"" Andersen said. ""It's time to recognize that if we want a better environment, we're going to have to pay more for energy.""\Contact Tim Johnson at 660-1808 or tjohnson@bfp.burlingtonfreepress.com\BOX: CLIMATE CHANGE\What is it?\The surface temperature of the Earth has gone up by 1 degree Fahrenheit in the past century, and warming as accelerated in the past two decares. ""There is new and stronger edidence that most of the warming over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities,"" states the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. ""Human activities have altered the chemical composition of the atmosphere through the buildup of greenhouse gases -- primarily carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide.""\These gases exist naturally in the atmosphere, trapping some of the Earth's outgoing energy, naturally lowering the Earth's temperature to levels hospitable to life.\According to the EPA, ""Since the onset of the industrial revolution, atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide have increased nearly 30 percent, methane concentrations have more than doubled, and nitrous oxide concentrations have risen by about 15 percent. These increases have enhanced the heat-trapping capacity of Earth's atmosphere.""\Combustion of fossil fuels and other human activities are the primary reason for the increased concentration of carbon dioxide, scientists believe. ""Plant respiration and the decomposition of organic matter release more than 10 times the CO2 released by human activities; but these releases have generally been in balance during the centuries before the industrial revolution, with carbon dioxide absorbed by terrestrial vegetation and the oceans.\""What has changed in the last few hundred years is the additional release of carbon dioxide by human activities. Fossil fuels burned to run cars and trucks, heat homes and businesses, and power factories are responsible for about 98 percent of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions.""\Why is carbon dioxide considered the principal greenhouse gas? In its ""U.S. Emissions Inventory 2004,"" the EPA states: ""As the largest source of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, CO2 from fossil fuel combustion has accounted for a nearly constant 80 percent of global warming potential weighted emissions since 1990. Emissions from this source category grew 17 percent from 1990 to 2002....""\Impacts\""Rising global temperatures are expected to raise sea level, and change precipitation and other local climate conditions. Changing regional climate could alter forests, crop yields and water supplies.""\As for Vermont, ""by 2100 temperatures in Vermont could increase by 4 degrees Fahrenheit in spring and 5 degrees in the other seasons. ...an increase in the frequency and intensity of winter storms is possible."" The EPA details other possible impacts on human health, water resources, agriculture, forests and ecosystems in Vermont.\Source: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Global Warming Web site."

The Vermont's Olympic cross-country ski racers started skiing as children, they could set out from their doorsteps. Now, they say, the snow is disappearing, and their professional careers are threatened by climate change.
\
Olympic Winter Games athletes Hannah Dreissigacker, Liz Stephen, Ida Sargent and Susan Dunklee called for action on climate change on Monday at Morse Farm Ski Center in East Montpelier.
\
""We need to put a price on carbon emissions,"" biathlete Hannah Dreissigacker said.
\
The 27-year-old Morrisville native, who often flies around the world to race and visit friends and family, said even her own carbon-intensive lifestyle is disguised by the low cost of fossil fuels, which doesn't reflect the larger cost to the environment, she said.
\
""When we burn fuel, we're paying for the fuel and we're not paying for all the damage that that fuel does,"" she said. ""The idea of putting a price on carbon is that suddenly we're paying for what that fuel should actually cost.""
\
A carbon tax is among the policy options the Department of Public Service highlighted in its most recent draft Total Energy Study.
\
The ski racers were alarmed by the worsening snow conditions at many of Europe's most popular World Cup venues this year.
\
Nordic skier Stephen, 27, is a two-time Olympian from East Montpelier. She said the majority of her races this year were on narrow man-made tracks of slushy snow colored brown with rocks and dirt.
\
Ida Sargent, 26, got her start in Nordic ski racing in Barton.
\
""I could just go outside and ski from my door,"" Sargent said. ""And that sport is changing now. And it's very visible both here in Vermont and in Europe.""
\
The warm winter season last year forced her and her teammates to race laps on short man-made snow tracks one mile in length.
\
She said Vermont should model Europe's action on carbon emissions: smaller cars, public transportation, and rooftop solar, for example.
\
She supports Vermont's move toward industrial renewable power, such as the Kingdom Community Wind Project in Lowell, a project that has stirred an emotional debate on the state's energy future.
\
""I think that this is a huge step forward for Vermont,"" she said. ""And I'm actually proud to live so close to both of those, and I hope that other areas in Vermont and New England will also continue this movement.""
\
Biathlete Susan Dunklee, 28, earned the nation's top Olympic sprint finish for women this year. She grew up near Crystal Lake in Barton, which she described as ""wild and rugged.""
\
But now she is worried the Montreal-Portland Pipeline, which brings crude oil from South Portland, Maine, to Montreal, could be reversed to bring heavy Canadian crude oil.
\
""But that aside -- even if we were not to have a leak, the old pipeline worked out fine -- the fact is, we're enabling a system that's depending on fossil fuels,"" she said. ""We need to be finding more creative solutions.""

BRATTLEBORO -- Figuring out how to supply Vermont with the energy it needs via renewable sources would be like setting sail on the ocean without a compass, according to a report from the Vermont Energy Partnership.
\
VTEP's report was in response to a study issued by the Vermont Public Interest Group that contended the Green Mountain State doesn't need Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant to continue operation past 2012 and could instead rely on renewable energy such as solar, wind, hydroelectric and biomass.
\
""The fuel sources, generation mix and transmission systems proposed by VPIRG have never served any state or large jurisdiction,"" wrote Guy Page, VTEP's communications director. ""At best, such a structure is unproven.""
\
VPIRG's plan is nothing but a ""science experiment,"" wrote Page.
\
VTEP bills itself as ""a diverse group of business, labor, and community leaders committed to finding clean, low-cost and reliable electricity solutions to ensure Vermont stays a great place to live and work.""
\
Its partners include Entergy Vermont Yankee, Central Vermont Public Service, Green Mountain Power, Efficiency Vermont and the Brattleboro Development Credit Corporation.
\
Page wrote that the VPIRG report, which was released in August, ""fails to demonstrate realistically how and at what cost this (renewable) future will be accomplished.""
\
Even according to VPIRG's own calculations, it would take 23 years to establish the renewable energy sources necessary to supply 50 percent of Vermont's energy needs, wrote Page.
\
While VPIRG's suggestion that a ""futuristic grid of hundreds, even thousands of small power producers providing power through a complex, interdependent transmission grid ... is laudable,"" it's also unproven and will not ""bear fruit"" in a state where many communities lack reliable broadband and mobile phone service.
\
""If Vermont Yankee closes and VPIRG's vision fails to become reality, Vermont will be forced into a long-term relationship with spot-market, fossil-fuel based power,"" he wrote.
\
Entergy, which owns and operates Yankee, has applied to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to extend the operating license of Yankee for another 20 years, from 2012 to 2032. In addition to NRC approval, Entergy must also receive a certificate of public good from the Public Service Board and an OK from the Vermont Legislature.
\
About one-third of Vermont's power comes from Yankee. That's 55 percent of its overall 650-megawatt output, said Larry Smith, Yankee's communications director.
\
To replace the power from Yankee in 2012 would mean relying primarily on natural gas, wrote Page, resulting in a 19 to 39 percent increase in electric costs to Vermonters.
\
The state's participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which places a carbon tax on power purchased from fossil fuel plants, would add even more costs to the average consumer, wrote Page.
\
Vermont has a purchase agreement with Yankee, which, for 2009, supplies power to the state at 4.1 cents per kilowatt hour.
\
While current electric costs on the spot market are low, about 4.2 cents per kilowatt hour, he wrote, ""For nine-and-a-half years the price had been higher than Vermont Yankee -- sometimes almost three times higher.""
\
If the plant is shuttered in 2012, the state will also lose between $259 million and $1.4 billion in shared revenues that are paid back to the consumers via lower electric rates.
\
Placing wind turbines on 90 miles of ridgelines, as the VPIRG report suggests, would have a dramatic impact on the environment, wrote Page, including visual and noise pollution, bird kill and the loss of wildlife habitat caused by clearing ridgelines and building access roads.
\
And clearing 2,000 acres of land to install solar panels would be necessary to supply just one-fifth of the electricity that comes from Yankee, wrote Page.
\
""Solar power emits more carbon dioxide in its life cycle (materials, construction, etc.) than nuclear power,"" he wrote. ""In terms of greenhouse gases, it is a step backward.""
\
Relying on wood-fired plants also has its own environmental impacts to deal with, he wrote.
\
""Harvesting and hauling timber would require heavy logging truck traffic, causing significant noise, air and dust pollution, traffic hazards ad wear and tear on local and state roads that are already in disrepair,"" wrote Page.
\
VPIRG recommended ""gasification"" plants on the fringes of forested areas, wrote Page. Though gasification plants emit less carbon than traditional wood burning, it still emits twice as much as nuclear power, he wrote.
\
Failing to relicense Yankee would also mean an increase in Vermont's carbon emissions, currently the lowest in the nation.

Bruce Lisman is the competent economic leader that we need
\
If you ask any student what they want after college, you'll likely find that nine out of ten will say that they simply want a good job. 42,000 young adults are enrolled in our colleges and universities and most are leaving after they receive their education because they can't find work in the Green Mountain state.
\
It doesn't take one with 35 years of business development experience, like myself, to see that those in the highest political positions in our state are making some very basic mistakes. They are spending more than the state takes in, and are avoiding implementing any sound economic development programs to grow the businesses that we have. This has created an unbalanced budget with forced benefit cuts for the Vermonters that truly need them. We have leaders, like Governor Peter Shumlin, that have actually created an atmosphere that has discouraged new enterprise by imposing unnecessary taxes. This harms the industries that create jobs!
\
We're finding a decline in projected revenues, a drop in job growth that has spanned three decades, and shrinking wages. What's more is that this migration of our working class out of Vermont has driven down our tax revenues and has put a severe strain on our social programs and other important state projects. Governor Shumlin has also failed in his efforts to craft a balanced budget and our state is spending more than we are taking in. This is not how you encourage prosperity within a state or a business. We need a governor that is willing to partner with job creators to understand what they need to be successful. Fostering job growth will present more opportunities for young people to stay in our state and grow our economy.
\
Understanding the needs of small businesses and enacting policy that will help them grow will also present our state with new job opportunities. There is no reason that our state leaders should be hindering the success of local businesses, and, out of all the current gubernatorial candidates, it is Bruce Lisman that has recognized this best.
\
We need a governor who understands the importance of working with Vermont colleges in order to help structure education that fits the specific needs of our employers. Vermont needs Bruce Lisman, the only candidate who is fit to take use in a new direction.
\
Bruce is a businessman and understands the value of quality jobs. When he worked in the financial services industry, he employed and managed nearly 2,500 employees. As a successful and respected manager, he worked tirelessly to understand the needs of each and every one of his employees and worked with them to foster individual success. This is exactly what we need in our education programs. One of Bruce's plans is to develop an entrepreneurship-coaching program that links young adults with local businesses and professionals. This link will encourage future job opportunities and present small businesses with the properly trained work force needed for their business to thrive.
\
Bruce is against taxes that make Vermont unaffordable, like the Shumlin-supported carbon tax. While the tax is a seemingly benevolent tax with an aim to protect the environment, Bruce was able to look past the frosting and see that the tax would burden Vermonters with higher home heating costs, and also burden businesses while providing negligible, if any, environmental benefit.
\
Bruce recognizes legislation that is bad for hard working Vermonters and understands a tax like this would create greater economic uncertainty.. This is something that Vermont doesn't need any more of. This is why Bruce Lisman has my full endorsement for governor of Vermont. He is just the fiscally minded kind of person that would be able to take our state out of the hole that the Shumlin administration has dug us into. Bruce will appoint proper leadership and has already developed a comprehensive plan to take Vermont into a prosperous future.

Boston (ap) - Former U.S. Rep. Bob Inglis received the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award on Sunday for reversing his position on climate change despite the predictable political fallout that helped cost the South Carolina Republican his seat in Congress.
\
Kennedy's grandson, Jack Schlossberg, presented the award to Inglis on Sunday at the JFK Library in Boston.
\
""My grandfather's legacy is kept alive by Bob's courageous decision to sacrifice his political career to demand action on the issue that will shape life on Earth for generations to come,"" said Schlossberg, son of Caroline Kennedy and Edwin Schlossberg. Inglis, a member of the House Science Committee and ranking member of its Energy and Environment Subcommittee, had opposed legislation on climate change, but said he changed his mind after briefings from scientists and encouragement from his five children.
\
He advocated for a carbon tax to reduce dependence on fossil fuels, and was defeated in the 2010 primary for re-election to the 4th Congressional District seat he had held twice, from 1993-1998 and 2005-2010.
\
""When is America going to rise to the challenge on climate? Well, I think it's soon. I think it's before the decade is out,"" Inglis said in remarks for the ceremony, an allusion to JFK's 1960s call to send astronauts to the moon.
\
""I think we're going to come together and get this done because I believe that a pricing of carbon dioxide will be like someone said of the financial crisis, 'It's amazing how the impossible went to the inevitable without ever passing through the probable,'"" Inglis said.
\
The annual award to public servants is named for Kennedy's 1957 Pulitzer Prize-winning book about U.S. senators who took unpopular stands for principle. A bipartisan committee selects the recipients, who recently have included former President George H.W. Bush and former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona.

I listened to the recent debate in Montpelier between members of the Ethan Allen Institute and Energy Independent Vermont on whether Vermont should establish a carbon tax. I heard statements on both sides which deserve our consideration. It is unfortunate that the format chosen to discuss the issue was a debate. Debates set up an oppositional environment where the object is to win rather than to delve deeply into an issue of critical concern to all of us. The speakers wound up talking past each other. More importantly, they did not get to the over-arching context in which the debate took place. Once again, thoughtful people wound up exploring the eddies and back water without seeing the huge ocean before us.
\
They did talk about climate change, with varying degrees of belief that it is a problem. Perhaps, because there was no consensus on the issue, they could not even begin to examine the enormous implications of a climate approaching chaos.
\
As we debate whether Vermont should institute a carbon tax, whether we should try to continue our consumptive lifestyles by blanketing our mountains and fields with renewable energy devices, let us pause to consider what kind of living makes sense on a finite planet. Let us understand that while changing the way we live and consume will be hard, very hard, a planet whose climate is increasingly chaotic, will make life much harder, and for very many, much shorter.
\
I do not like to engage in hyperbole and scare tactics, but the moment requires blunt talk.
\
Nature does not negotiate. Physics and chemistry do not debate; they do not care about our economy, nor do they present us with many options. Either we stop pumping carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere or we do not. If we decide to do nothing, we opt for Miami and Manhattan to be underwater along with scores of other coastal cities around the world; we decide to have the Marshal Islands and other island nations underwater; we opt for spreading deserts and diminished agriculture; we decide to have hundreds of millions of climate refugees on the move, making what is happening today in Europe, with less than a million Syrian and Afghani refugees, look like a stroll in the park.
\
If we think some technological tinkering will save us, we are engaging in magical thinking. If we insist that business as usual, consumption as usual can go on forever, we are committing collective suicide. And we will be taking down with us most of the other creatures with whom we share this planet. Those of our children and grandchildren and/or great grandchildren who might manage to survive will curse us and our foolish greed.
\
None of us would sit quietly in the living room while a fire in the kitchen licked at the walls. None of us would put our kids in the car and drive it off a cliff, accelerating as we approached the edge. Yet most of us go about our daily lives oblivious to the greatest threat to life on earth which increases everyday. Worse, with gas prices low, many of us once again opt for that SUV and other gas guzzlers, build that 15,000-square-foot house and install that jacuzzi. We make sure our insurance policies are paid up while the capacity of earth to sustain life diminishes. Can we more easily imagine the death of millions, perhaps billions, than we can imagine an economic system not built on ever growing consumption of the natural world?
\
I support a tax on carbon, especially when the revenue will be returned to taxpayers in the form of lower sales and income taxes, and people struggling with inadequate incomes are held harmless. Additionally, we must include in any such approach to reduce our carbon emissions a plan to help those workers and businesses in the fossil fuel industry most negatively effected. If our representatives in the Legislature are able to achieve that, and do not divert the revenue to other purposes, I think Vermont will be taking a small but important step in the direction of environmental sanity. And if it works for Vermont, as it has in British Columbia, other states might follow.
\
As some of us enjoy the warm December in these early stages of the climate catastrophe, people around the globe, most in the poorest nations, are already having their lives disrupted, and in some cases shortened, by the floods, droughts and poor harvests, above and beyond the norm, associated with climate change. It is not going to get better, and these disasters will only spread globally if we continue with business as usual. As the climate negotiators in Paris once again fail to agree on meaningful and rapid steps to halt and reverse the damage, all in the name of defending their growth economies, Greenland, the Arctic and Antarctic melt, the glaciers disappear, and the deserts grow.
\
This does not have to be our future; we can still avoid the worse case scenarios of climate change. Together we can overcome our fear, which for many is expressed as denial, and build a society and economy which defends and nurtures the earth, our common home. We can accept the fact that our present way of life will and must change. As imaginative and creative beings, we can actually build a way of life more rewarding even as we reduce much of our material consumption. We can build a life where our highest ideals and greatest values are freely expressed in action; where we join with those we love and our neighbors to make sure that we each have enough to live in dignity. We can build, in the words of Pope Francis, a ""culture of care."" It will not be easy, we have gone too far down the road, there are powerful interests working to stop any progress toward a sustainable future; great and growing disparities in wealth make changing the status quo almost impossible; there are many human made crises in addition to the climate; we have not learned how to resolve conflict without violence; our economy, culture and the very way we view the world are under the thrall of militarist ideologies of dominance and violent reaction. It will be easy to give in to despair. But despair is a luxury we cannot afford. We must give in to our hope.
\
Vaclav Havel, late president of the Czech Republic, who had spent many years in prison under the former communist government of Czechoslovakia, said this of hope: ""Either we hope or we don't; it's a dimension of the soul. It's an orientation of the spirit, an orientation of the heart. It is the ability to work for something because it is good, not because it has a chance to succeed. The more unpropitious the situation in which we demonstrate hope, the deeper the hope is. Hope is not the conviction that something will turn out well, but the certainty that something makes sense.""
\
Creating a more just world, where we live within the earth's natural capacities to absorb our waste and renew what we use, where every person has the means for a dignified and fulfilling life, with a sense of purpose and meaning, makes sense.

I finish with an extended quote from Pope Francis' encyclical on the environment Laudato Si: On Care for our Common Home. I recommend everyone, whether or not you have religious faith, to read it as you prepare to face our common future: ""Yet all is not lost. Human beings, while capable of the worst, are also capable of rising above themselves, choosing again what is good, and making a new start, despite their mental and social conditioning. We are able to take an honest look at ourselves, to acknowledge our deep dissatisfaction, and to embark on new paths to authentic freedom. No system can completely suppress our openness to what is good, true and beautiful, or our God-given ability to respond to his grace at work deep in our hearts. I appeal to everyone throughout the world not to forget this dignity which is ours. No one has the right to take it from us.""
\
Earlier generation had to overcome wars, economic hardship, and great injustices. Will we meet the greatest challenge of our times with a spirit of hope and care?

114,"MONTPELIER - In her speech to open the year in Montpelier, Vermont House Speaker Mitzi Johnson asked all 14 policy committees to work on a bill related to climate change.\""Climate change affects every aspect of our lives, and we all need to be part of the solution,"" said Johnson, D-South Hero, speaking to the House of Representatives on Wednesday.\""With that in mind,"" Johnson continued, ""I'm asking every committee in the House to work on some piece of legislation within your jurisdiction that lessens Vermont's dependence on fossil fuels, reduces our carbon footprint and sets us up for a stronger, more resilient future.""\Johnson told reporters that she decided to focus on climate change after seeing a range of effects, including high temperatures in the fall.\""We have to stop talking about wondering if climate change is happening or whether or not it's good for Vermont, and we have to start taking some sort of steps,"" Johnson told reporters.\House Minority Leader Don Turner, R-Milton, was surprised by the directive. Turner would have rather had all House committees focus on education costs and rising education property taxes.\""I don't know anybody that doesn't believe that climate change may be real,"" Turner said, ""but Vermont's carbon footprint, even if it was zero, would have such a minimal change that I don't know why we would spend a bunch of time and have all the committees spend a bunch of time focused on that issue.""\Turner added that lawmakers should consider how legislation will impact the climate, but that it should not necessarily be the overarching focus for all committees.\Johnson has already rejected one policy approach that would attempt to reduce fossil fuel use through a carbon tax. A recent version, called the ESSEX plan, would tax fossil fuel distribution companies, increasing the cost of gas and other fuels, and would use the revenues to reduce electric rates and give rebates to lower-income and rural Vermonters. Johnson favors a regional approach with other states.\""We will have to recognize that Vermont is not an island, and we will have to be able to protect lower income and rural Vermonters,"" Johnson said in her remarks.\Senate President Pro Tempore Tim Ashe, D/P-Chittenden, also said Wednesday that the Senate is not prepared to support a carbon tax on the state level. A regional proposal, he said, would minimize the number of people who would cross borders to avoid taxes.\Johnson said she has a long list of ideas for responding to climate change through policy. She suggested to reporters that the House Education Committee, for example, might look at school heating and student transportation.\Other priorities in Johnson's opening speech included expanding the workforce for opiate treatment and mental health treatment, responding to data security breaches, paying for clean water efforts, and examining wages and supports for low-income residents.\""The issue of wealth and income inequality is the great moral and economic issue of our time,"" Johnson said.\Johnson also reminded the House to ensure a safe working environment free of sexual harassment and pledged to help create the ""gold standard of policies, reporting procedures and training in harassment prevention.""\Members of the Senate were required to spend part of their first day in Montpelier in training about sexual harassment.\Ashe predicted that the year would bring ""bigger policy topics with bigger implications,"" compared to 2017, when top leaders in Montpelier were adjusting to new roles.\Contact April McCullum at 802-660-1863 or amccullum@freepressmedia.com.

115,"As the 2015 Legislative starts Wednesday, the Burlington Free Press is publishing position statements from political leaders and advocates reflecting their goals and expectations.\Each was asked to answer:\What do you expect to be the biggest issue overall, or the biggest issue related to your topic area, during the upcoming session, and how will you approach it?\What other bills or issues can voters expect to see debated this winter?\Upcoming topics address the state's challenges with transportation, natural resources and taxes.\Today's topic is health care.\Christopher Pearson\The economy continues to leave far too many Vermonters behind. As we head into the 2015 legislative session we would do well to keep in mind that Vermont's median household income is under $53,000. When I think about friends and families living paycheck-to-paycheck earning $80,000, it's staggering to imagine trying to make do on half that amount. Still, this is the reality for our neighbors.\For better or worse, the Legislature is not made up of the half of Vermonters earning under $53,000. My well-meaning colleagues in Montpelier tend to be comfortably middle-class and so, too often, we forget how hard it is for families to get by.\Now that Gov. Shumlin has taken single-payer health reform off the table, the work of the House Health Care committee must be to reach concrete, short-term goals. The need for reform remains strong and, thanks to the past few years of debate, virtually all agree that every Vermonter should have health care. We must push for universal coverage.\I wish the governor had pivoted to a more manageable goal as he declared he was walking away from single payer. To my mind, universal coverage should be top of the list and combined with on-going payment reform and cost controls as we move forward.\As we've heard, this session we are likely to examine different strategies to pay for schools and give Vermonters much-needed property-tax relief. I have long believed we should pay for school using the income tax. Strategies to reduce school costs have been hard to come by. Whatever formulas we strike we must be mindful that the growth of income keeps going to the top of the economic ladder while most Vermont families have not seen significant wage growth.\In addition to this basic economic picture our budget debate must also recognize the climate crisis is not something we can simply wish away. We must invest in strategies to reduce our carbon output. We should begin the conversation about a carbon tax that includes a mechanism to refund working families, as it is, inherently, a regressive tax. The Canadian province of British Columbia is just one of several successful examples of a carbon tax that works, returns money to the families that need it, and reduces emissions.\Vermont is an incredible state. Our sense of community is strong and will continue to carry us through the many challenges ahead. Montpelier has to do its part to recognize and improves the tough economic reality for so many of our neighbors.\Rep. Christopher Pearson from Burlington is going into his fifth term in the House of Representatives. He is the Progressive Caucus leader and co-chairs the Climate Caucus.\Darcie Johnston\Vermonters for Health Care Freedom (VHCF) was relieved to hear Gov. Peter Shumlin announcement that he will not pursue a single payer health plan in 2015. The Governor unveiled his single payer plan which proved fiscally untenable. The plan would have required an 11.5 percent tax on businesses and up to 9.5 percent public premium assessment on Vermonters' incomes to pay for single payer.\As VHCF has been cautioning for over three years, the creation of a single payer system in Vermont would be devastating to Vermonters, employers, and the overall state economy. We said that it would cost more than the $2.2 billion. The Governor announced this week that it would cost $2.6 billion. Any amount in this range would be devastating to Vermont's economy.\However, based on the Governor's comments he is not ready to give up. He made clear he is setting the stage to implement single payer at a later date with the following initiatives:\Continue to pursue an ""all payer"" waiver with the Feds, which may threaten Medicare for Vermonters,\Enhance the authority of the hand-picked five-member Green Mountain care Board, and\Move Vermont Information Technology Leaders (VITL) under the authority and control of the Green Mountain Care Board.\As the politically appointed, Green Mountain Care Board tightens its grip on everything health care, the results will be that doctor's fees will suffer, patients care will be rationed and the government will insert itself between patients and their physicians.\Vermonters who want the government to get out of their health care once and for all must still remain vigilant. The battle is far from over.\Vermont Health Connect still doesn't work. VHCF began working with legislators to shut down the exchange and move Vermont to the Federal Exchange before another open enrollment comes around. We have also begun working to repeal the law forcing individuals and small businesses to buy only through Vermont Health Connect.\This mandate is unnecessary, restricts choice and competition and drives up the cost of health insurance.\Vermonters for Health Care Freedom will also work to pass legislation that protects patient rights, protects doctor's right to practice without government getting between them and their patients, and promotes choice and competition in the insurance market such as:\Repeal the mandate that forces individuals and small business to buy health insurance on Vermont Health Connect;\Promote choice and competition by allowing Vermonters to buy health insurance across state lines;\Protect the right of doctors to be in private practice;\Reduce health care cost by passing medical malpractice reform. This will also help attract doctors to come to Vermont to practice and reduce the practice of defensive medicine which drives up costs;\Reward businesses for providing health insurance and wellness programs. Wellness program result in lower health care costs and improve employees health;\Allow all individuals and employees to have pre-tax health saving accounts that are not capped. When individuals have skin in the game they are better consumers of health care;\Encourage doctors and hospitals to publish their rates for non-emergency procedures.\Vermonters for Health Freedom will be watching the Shumlin administration and the legislature very closely, advocating for reforms that promote freedom, choice and competition and reporting to Vermonters what is really going on.\Vermonters for Health Care Freedom is a grassroots organization, and we rely on support from individuals and businesses. To sign up for our newsletter, learn more or support our efforts please visit www.vthealthcarefreedom.org.\Darcie Johnston is founder of Vermonters for Health Care Freedom.\Ginny Lyons\The legislature must continue its work toward affordable, accessible and quality health care.\We recognize that unsustainable growth in health-care costs will continue unless we work together to reduce that rate of growth. Cost increases will continue to dominate health care conversations during the 2015 session. This does not diminish the importance of needed work on the mental health system, child protection, substance abuse, or oversight of proposed budget cuts.\The Legislature will continue to identify ways to reduce health care administrative costs, improve health care access and delivery, and encourage equitable payment reform.\Health care offices are mired in paperwork. A comprehensive consolidation to reduce the number of claims forms can relieve the administrative burden on health care providers.\Insurance programs must work with the Legislature to achieve this aim. Electronic hospital and health care office systems need to seamlessly interface in order to integrate clinical reports between offices, hospitals, and labs. Such initiatives can reduce costly unnecessary or duplicative medical testing and allow more time spent with patients and less with bureaucracy.\Legislative policies to improve health care delivery should begin with age-appropriate and condition-specific primary care. The team-care approach for those with chronic diseases like diabetes builds responsibility for care with a medical care team.\We must find a cost-effective way to extend Medicaid and private insurance dollars to cover necessary patient treatment, including counseling or community support for a growing number of patients with substance abuse issues and for seniors living at home. The team-care approach improves health outcomes and provides savings, but it must not do so by reducing payment to caregivers and counselors.\Ultimately, payment equity is important whether or not global payment reform is initiated.\If payment reform is to be successful, transparency of billing practices is critical. Billing and payment for procedures should be consistent between health care offices. Common billing codes for common treatment services can reduce administrative costs, improve treatment-related decision-making, and offer transparency.\In 2013, the Green Mountain Care Board (GMCB) reported a reduction of over $80 million in combined private health insurance premiums and hospital budget savings. The GMCB has approved payment-reform pilot projects to evaluate fee-for-service and global budgeting. The Legislature can oversee evaluation of these projects. Payment reform, team-care and transparent billing practices will lead to affordable health care environments that allow patients more time with caregivers, resulting in improved outcomes.\Sen. Ginny Lyons, D-Chittenden, lives in Williston and has served as vice chair of the Senate Health and Welfare Committee.\Join the debate\Have an observation about the direction of Vermont?

Gov. Peter Shumlin is scheduled to speak at the United Nations Conference on Climate Change in Paris next week, where he will discuss Vermont's ambitious plans for renewable energy.
\
""The White House had reached out to us to talk about what states are doing to make a difference,"" Shumlin said. ""Vermont's got a great story to tell.""
\
""We are building our renewables like mad,"" he said.
\
The two-week international conference, which began Monday, includes nearly 150 world leaders attempting to craft a deal that will mitigate the impacts of climate change. The overarching goal of the summit is to prevent a rise in global temperature of two degrees celsius, a goal determined by climate experts who say any rise above that would be catastrophic for Earth's population.
\
Shumlin will participate in a panel next Wednesday hosted by the Georgetown Climate Center called ""The Subnational (State and Provincial) Foundation for Action."" The panel includes representatives from throughout North America that are pushing for cleaner energy policies, including Quebec, California and Washington.
\
The event announcement describes the discussion as one where ""state and provincial leaders will speak about their commitments to reducing Greenhouse Gas emissions and preparing for climate change.""
\
Secretary of Natural Resources Deb Markowitz also will be attending. She is on a panel talking about transporation issues, specifically how to convert cars on the road to ones that emit zero or near zero emissions, the use of cleaner fuels and how to encourage non-motorized travel.
\
In Vermont, Shumlin has pushed aggressively to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through major wind and solar projects. The state has set a goal of reaching 90 percent renewable energy by 2050.
\
Shumlin said he would share the story of the state's plan to counter climate change, including the concerns in some communities that Vermont has rushed too quickly into renewable projects without proper consultation from residents.
\
""There's always obstacles and some resistance,"" Shumlin said. ""How you deal with that resistance is also important.""
\
While the state is generally supportive of comprehensive environmental policies, a number of candidates running for statewide office in 2016 have questioned the state's approach to the issue.
\
Republican candidate for governor Bruce Lisman called for a two-year moratorium on renewable energy projects in his campaign kickoff in October, saying they often damaged the well-being of those living close to the projects.
\
He suggested a law for energy projects similar to Act 250, which created a stringent review process for development in the state in order to preserve community and aesthetic characteristics.
\
In addition, a number of candidates for governor and lieutenant governor from both parties have come out against a proposed carbon tax that could raise gas prices by as much as 88 cents over 10 years.
\
The opponents of the carbon tax include Burlington Rep. Kesha Ram, who is running as a Democrat for lieutenant governor. She reversed her support for the bill after originally signing on as a co-sponsor of the legislation.
\
Shumlin defended the state's to push for altenative energy projects, noting Vermont was seen as a global leader on the environment.
\
In July, Shumlin attended the Climate Summit of the Americas in Toronto to discuss the state's model, and famed environmentalist Al Gore praised the Green Mountain State's leadership on renewable energy during a presentation given at the University of Vermont in October.
\
""This is a huge transformation of our economy, it's a huge transformation in the way we do energy,"" Shumlin said. ""And hopefully, if we can move fast enough, it's going to save the planet from extraordinary destruction.""

Gus Speth and his wife, Cameron, have found home in Vermont.
\
They've settled in a state that reminds them of what was good about the South of their youth, a place that de-emphasizes m aterial goods, values individuality, self-reliance and community arts, the antithesis of what much of their homeland has become.
\
""It's not merely that we have been welcomed warmly, or that we like Vermont's politics (as much as one can like any politics), or that the state is strikingly beautiful. It is those things, but it is also the startling realization that we have found here a place close kin to the South for which we hoped and dreamed,"" Speth writes in his new memoir, Angels by the River, published this week by Chelsea Green Publishing in White River Junction.
\
The memoir is framed by Speth's life from his childhood in Orangeburg, S.C., to his development into one of the nation's top advocates for the environment, a man who has served as an advisor to presidents and world leaders.
\
Although it traces his growth to the world stage from the sunny, carefree and callow days of his boyhood in a small Southern town cloaked in the shroud of Jim Crow era laws, supports for a culture that ke pt blacks and whites ""happily"" co-existing as long as everyone stayed in their places, the book's burden is to address the issues of race relations, economic disparity and climate change, subjects for which Speth, 72, has a deep passion.
\
""Race was the great issue of the day that I grew up with, and it's striking looking back about how oblivious I was of the real issues until I went off to college (in 1960 to Yale University) and had some sense knocked into me,"" Speth said during an interview last week at his home in Strafford.
\
""It had a big effect in a lot of ways on a personal level when all this cultural scaffolding collapsed around me. It was liberating. I was to free myself of this unmooring, to free myself from the past.""
\
He was able to develop a fresh take on the world, ""unencumbered by any cultural or family inheritance. It was not wise, I had learned, to uncritically accept the status quo,"" Speth writes in the book.
\
Speth, who now teaches at Vermont Law School in South Royalton, was further influenced and his career shaped, not only by his studies at Yale, where he graduated summa cum laude in 1964, and during his time at Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar, but also by the events around him - the civil rights movement and the February 1968 Orangeburg Massacre, a bloody night on the campus of the all-black South Carolina State College that left three unarmed students dead and 28 wounded, shot by white state highway patrol officers.
\
There were no convictions in federal court or substantial apologies from the state, and outside of South Carolina, the event has largely been forgotten.
\
But that night still divides his hometown along bitter racial lines, said Speth, an affable man with a broad smile, who retains his South Carolina Lowcountry accent and the gentle demeanor of a proper upbringing.
\
""The black community hopes for justice too long delayed, and many whites are still in denial, while some simply refuse to talk about the matter.""
\
The civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s le d to federal legislation that swept away Jim Crow laws and gave blacks in the South a chance to stand on equal, albeit shaky, footing. The civil rights effort also served as a prototype for the environmental movement that followed, Speth said.
\
""When we got to law school in that class of '69, we'd lived through a lot of that momentum, and we had seen what good lawyering could do and what good legislation could do with the Civil Rights Act of '64 and '65,"" he said.
\
""That had all happened right before we got to law school, and I think in many ways was the model for what we set out to do with the environment. How do we get these issues into Washington; how do we make a national statement with environmental concerns and how do we use these tools that are available to make deep change in the country?""
\
After graduating from law school, Speth served as a law clerk for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Hugo L. Black, and co-founded the National Resources Defense Council, where he served as senior attorney for seven years before joining the Carter Administration.
\
The idea for the council came to him during a train ride from New Haven to New York City after he read an article about a legal action brought by the NAACP legal defense fund.
\
""I had this thought, it was a good thought, of how do we create an NAACP legal defense fund for the environment. That was the beginning of my life of working on environmental issues, but it had its roots right in the civil rights movement.
\
""There's a lot of resonance there, but these two communities, the black community in our country and the environmental community, have ... never achieved the kind of synthesis that we should have. It's beginning to take shape in environmental justice and climate justice concerns, but there's been a period there between the two communities, even though the environmental community owed so much to the civil rights community, there wasn't much resonance between the two.
\
""Everybody was doing their own thing. The environmental community was all white folks, but it's changing.""
\
A sign of that change was the recent climate march in New York City, which attracted an estimated 400,000 participants.
\
""We're seeing this sort of confluence now. It was an amazing, positive experience to see the diversity of this march. It was all colors, all ages and all sections of this country. It was an extraordinary , diverse confluence of people who are concerned about the climate issue and related fossil fuel issues,"" Speth said, giving credit for the climate movement to Vermont's 350.org and its founder, Bill McKibben.
\
The march notwithstanding, climate change still hasn't become the burning issue that will push it toward meaningful legislation in this country or globally. It received scant notice during the midterm elections that concluded this week, and the new Congress is unlikely to move forward with environmental regulations that will curb greenhouse gases. Time is running out, said Speth, who came to Vermont a few years ago after three decades in Washington and a decade as dean of the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies.
\
""You have this plodding reality. The president is trying to get regulations out to deal with the power plants and the automobiles. There's the plodding process to try to get a global agreement in Paris next year. Then you have the reality of what's needed.
\
""That reality demands a really swift, major, progressive change on energy policy. They're two different worlds, and there's little we can do other than just continuing to educate, demonstrate, to pound the pavement and to get politicians to bring this issue into campaigns. These are the things we have to do to b uild a movement.
\
""Given the realities of our Congress right now, it's hard to imagine anything short of an even deeper crisis shaking people up. You have an effective veto in both houses of Congress of climate deniers and skeptics, and they can stop anything and apparently will. Some of them are in states that are heavily impacted, too.
\
""It's a real tragedy. It's the greatest dereliction of responsibility in the history of the Republic, and I really mean it. It's hard to describe these two worlds of what's really needed and the anxiety that people feel and the pressure that is building in the country for action, and this plodding process on the other hand. It's hard to link these things, as long as we have such a veto in the Congress.""
\
One answer outside of legislation may be to withdraw support for publicly-held corporations, encouraging people, schools and mutual and pension funds to sell stock.
\
"" I'm a strong advocate of the divestment movement. The big fossil-fuel companies are technology- and science-based companies. They know exactly what's going on. They aren't climate deniers. They know what they're doing, and they know the science. They trying to make as much money out of the fossil resource and make it as quickly as they can. They are doing it knowing that they're ruining the planet. They aren't only not stopping, but they're working hard every day to prevent the rest of us from regulating them. They have so much power they can do it.
\
""It really is a moral issue on this divestment. We know now how many deaths are caused by climate change and the economic costs. It is huge already. For these people to persist in the face of this is deeply immoral. We shouldn't be putting our investments with these people. I think it's a moral imperative to not support them in that way,"" he said.
\
However, global warming is hard for the general public to conceptualize. It has many moving parts, and recent studies have shown that big, broad issues tend to overwhelm supporters, who may be turned off by its scope.
\
"" People who are concerned about fracking and people who are concerned about mountain-top removal, they don't have any trouble envisioning their part of the problem, but the general idea of global warming is harder to see,"" Speth said.
\
""It's unfortunate that carbon dioxide isn't purple, so we could see it. We could see the sky dimming. If it were like that, it would be easier to promote action. ""
\
To get the general public's attention about the issue, it will take another crisis, like the ones provided by hurricanes Katrina and Sandy and closer to home Tropical Storm Irene. The good news and the bad news is that crises will drive a response, he said.
\
Global warming is nothing new. Speth and other members of the Carter Administration issued a number of papers during the 1970s about the build-up of greenhouse gases and action that was needed to reduce them. The reports received broad attention in the news media and momentum to pass corrective legislation was building; then Carter lost the election, and the effort died.
\
""T he tide not only at that moment, but in the country in general, began to shift in the other direction. I would say that it has gotten worse today than it was then.
\
""Carter pushed through a number of far-reaching energy (laws), and in the early '70s, we got almost all of the far-reaching environmental legislation: clean water, clean air and the National Environmental Policy Act, and Carter came along in the late '70s with the energy steps and other things, but it's been very hard to get action since,"" Speth said.
\
""Here we are in 2014, and the best tool we have to try to save the climate is a piece of legislation that was written in 1970. It's good that it's available and that the Supreme Court has upheld it, but it's a sad commentary.""
\
Fossil fuel subsidies need to be eliminated, and Congress needs to put strong economic incentives in place to promote alternative energy and penalize polluters, he said, citing new legislation that has been introduced that will impose a carbon tax and use the funds to rebate taxpayers.
\
""We need to get the polluters to be paying for the damage they're causing.""
\
A solution to the warming crisis is not going to come from legislation alone or from traditional ways of looking at the problem, Speth said. It's going to take major changes in lifestyle and the economy.
\
"" Right now we have a system that we struggle against, but it's fundamentally programmed in a very rapacious way. We need to rethink how do we get beyond the current system of political economy into something that is more benign and supportive of people and planet,"" Speth said.
\
""A lot of people have been saying that these are deep questions of values and lifestyle. We need to think about new types of corporations that are geared for social purpose and not for making a profit. They have to demonstrate that they are dedicated to making a social purpose. In exchange for that, they can get investments from private foundations. ""
\
Vermont is already leading the way in the new economy movement with a shift to local, grassroots enterprises and social organizations.
\
""It's something that we need to adopt as a regional approach. Have a real focus on regional economy that's sustaining people and sustaining the environment, so we can demonstrate that these things can be done at scale.""
\
Economic disparity is the major issue facing the country, and until it is solved, the environmental movement will go nowhere, he said.
\
""Most people are living just paycheck to paycheck. A huge portion of the American people, families who are not saving because they can't save and are very insecure economically. Lot s of people are dropping out of the middle class. These problems have to be integrated with environmental concerns because the environmental community is not going to get very far where there is such a vast social and economic insecurity in the county.
\
""It's not only right to see a level of fairness that we don't have now, but it's essential if we want to make environmental progress.""

After graduating from law school, Speth served as a law clerk for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Hugo L. Black, and co-founded the National Resources Defense Council, where he served as senior attorney for seven years before joining the Carter Administration.
\
The idea for the council came to him during a train ride from New Haven to New York City after he read an article about a legal action brought by the NAACP legal defense fund.
\
""I had this thought, it was a good thought, of how do we create an NAACP legal defense fund for the environment. That was the beginning of my life of working on environmental issues, but it had its roots right in the civil rights movement.
\
""There's a lot of resonance there, but these two communities, the black community in our country and the environmental community, have ... never achieved the kind of synthesis that we should have. It's beginning to take shape in environmental justice and climate justice concerns, but there's been a period there between the two communities, even though the environmental community owed so much to the civil rights community, there wasn't much resonance between the two.
\
""Everybody was doing their own thing. The environmental community was all white folks, but it's changing.""
\
A sign of that change was the recent climate march in New York City, which attracted an estimated 400,000 participants.
\
""We're seeing this sort of confluence now. It was an amazing, positive experience to see the diversity of this march. It was all colors, all ages and all sections of this country. It was an extraordinary , diverse confluence of people who are concerned about the climate issue and related fossil fuel issues,"" Speth said, giving credit for the climate movement to Vermont's 350.org and its founder, Bill McKibben.
\
The march notwithstanding, climate change still hasn't become the burning issue that will push it toward meaningful legislation in this country or globally. It received scant notice during the midterm elections that concluded this week, and the new Congress is unlikely to move forward with environmental regulations that will curb greenhouse gases. Time is running out, said Speth, who came to Vermont a few years ago after three decades in Washington and a decade as dean of the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies.
\
""You have this plodding reality. The president is trying to get regulations out to deal with the power plants and the automobiles. There's the plodding process to try to get a global agreement in Paris next year. Then you have the reality of what's needed.
\
""That reality demands a really swift, major, progressive change on energy policy. They're two different worlds, and there's little we can do other than just continuing to educate, demonstrate, to pound the pavement and to get politicians to bring this issue into campaigns. These are the things we have to do to b uild a movement.
\
""Given the realities of our Congress right now, it's hard to imagine anything short of an even deeper crisis shaking people up. You have an effective veto in both houses of Congress of climate deniers and skeptics, and they can stop anything and apparently will. Some of them are in states that are heavily impacted, too.
\
""It's a real tragedy. It's the greatest dereliction of responsibility in the history of the Republic, and I really mean it. It's hard to describe these two worlds of what's really needed and the anxiety that people feel and the pressure that is building in the country for action, and this plodding process on the other hand. It's hard to link these things, as long as we have such a veto in the Congress.""
\
One answer outside of legislation may be to withdraw support for publicly-held corporations, encouraging people, schools and mutual and pension funds to sell stock.
\
"" I'm a strong advocate of the divestment movement. The big fossil-fuel companies are technology- and science-based companies. They know exactly what's going on. They aren't climate deniers. They know what they're doing, and they know the science. They trying to make as much money out of the fossil resource and make it as quickly as they can. They are doing it knowing that they're ruining the planet. They aren't only not stopping, but they're working hard every day to prevent the rest of us from regulating them. They have so much power they can do it.
\
""It really is a moral issue on this divestment. We know now how many deaths are caused by climate change and the economic costs. It is huge already. For these people to persist in the face of this is deeply immoral. We shouldn't be putting our investments with these people. I think it's a moral imperative to not support them in that way,"" he said.
\
However, global warming is hard for the general public to conceptualize. It has many moving parts, and recent studies have shown that big, broad issues tend to overwhelm supporters, who may be turned off by its scope.
\
"" People who are concerned about fracking and people who are concerned about mountain-top removal, they don't have any trouble envisioning their part of the problem, but the general idea of global warming is harder to see,"" Speth said.
\
""It's unfortunate that carbon dioxide isn't purple, so we could see it. We could see the sky dimming. If it were like that, it would be easier to promote action. ""
\
To get the general public's attention about the issue, it will take another crisis, like the ones provided by hurricanes Katrina and Sandy and closer to home Tropical Storm Irene. The good news and the bad news is that crises will drive a response, he said.
\
Global warming is nothing new. Speth and other members of the Carter Administration issued a number of papers during the 1970s about the build-up of greenhouse gases and action that was needed to reduce them. The reports received broad attention in the news media and momentum to pass corrective legislation was building; then Carter lost the election, and the effort died.
\
""T he tide not only at that moment, but in the country in general, began to shift in the other direction. I would say that it has gotten worse today than it was then.
\
""Carter pushed through a number of far-reaching energy (laws), and in the early '70s, we got almost all of the far-reaching environmental legislation: clean water, clean air and the National Environmental Policy Act, and Carter came along in the late '70s with the energy steps and other things, but it's been very hard to get action since,"" Speth said.
\
""Here we are in 2014, and the best tool we have to try to save the climate is a piece of legislation that was written in 1970. It's good that it's available and that the Supreme Court has upheld it, but it's a sad commentary.""
\
Fossil fuel subsidies need to be eliminated, and Congress needs to put strong economic incentives in place to promote alternative energy and penalize polluters, he said, citing new legislation that has been introduced that will impose a carbon tax and use the funds to rebate taxpayers.
\
""We need to get the polluters to be paying for the damage they're causing.""
\
A solution to the warming crisis is not going to come from legislation alone or from traditional ways of looking at the problem, Speth said. It's going to take major changes in lifestyle and the economy.
\
"" Right now we have a system that we struggle against, but it's fundamentally programmed in a very rapacious way. We need to rethink how do we get beyond the current system of political economy into something that is more benign and supportive of people and planet,"" Speth said.
\
""A lot of people have been saying that these are deep questions of values and lifestyle. We need to think about new types of corporations that are geared for social purpose and not for making a profit. They have to demonstrate that they are dedicated to making a social purpose. In exchange for that, they can get investments from private foundations. ""
\
Vermont is already leading the way in the new economy movement with a shift to local, grassroots enterprises and social organizations.
\
""It's something that we need to adopt as a regional approach. Have a real focus on regional economy that's sustaining people and sustaining the environment, so we can demonstrate that these things can be done at scale.""
\
Economic disparity is the major issue facing the country, and until it is solved, the environmental movement will go nowhere, he said.
\
""Most people are living just paycheck to paycheck. A huge portion of the American people, families who are not saving because they can't save and are very insecure economically. Lot s of people are dropping out of the middle class. These problems have to be integrated with environmental concerns because the environmental community is not going to get very far where there is such a vast social and economic insecurity in the county.
\
""It's not only right to see a level of fairness that we don't have now, but it's essential if we want to make environmental progress.""

BENNINGTON -- A new group aims to ramp up the local discussion on environmental issues.
\
Organizers with 350Bennington are seeking input for projects, actions and other ideas, according to Barbara True-Weber. An organizational meeting is slated for Wednesday, 7 p.m., at the Second Congregational Church, 115 Hillside St.
\
The new group's goals include promoting education on issues like climate change and advocating for policies that members believe would create a more ""resilient and sustainable greater Bennington,"" according to True-Weber.
\
That could mean advocating for a statewide carbon tax, the subject of two bills in the Vermont legislature, or policies that encourage renewable energy like solar.
\
Organizers have met before, True-Weber said, but haven't settled on any specific projects. They have led outreach efforts at events like the recent All Species Day to gauge community members' interests.
\
""The first step is for us to be patient and have those conversations with people,"" True-Weber said Monday.
\
True-Weber said the group is open to residents in the greater Bennington area and those from other towns should attend. She said it's possible the group could someday partner with residents of nearby communities in New York or Massachusetts.
\
350.org is a nonprofit environmental organization founded by Vermont author and Middlebury College professor Bill McKibben in 2007. Its website describes 350.org as ""a movement more than an organization"" that uses ""grass-roots organizing to run adaptive, locally-driven campaigns"" with thousands of members across 188 countries. The name comes from the amount of carbon dioxide in parts per billion scientists say can be in the Earth's atmosphere without consequences from global warming.
\
350Bennington would be a ""node,"" or chapter, of Burlington-based 350Vermont. While affiliated with the national group, it operates independently.
\
True-Weber, a retired teacher, said she moved to Vermont from North Carolina to be closer to her daughter. She said she wanted to join a 350 node in Southern Vermont, but there wasn't one in the area. She said she was involved with local reading and discussion groups before becoming involved with 350Bennington.
\
""I think the environment is increasingly in crisis,"" True-Weber said.
\
True-Weber said anyone interested in the group should come to Wednesday's meeting with discussion topics and specific ideas relevant to the Bennington area.
\
She spoke of a need for citizens nationwide to bring pressure on elected officials and community leaders on issues around the environment.
\
""I think of this as an exercise in democracy,"" she said.
\

120,"
A very long time ago I was watching a television interview of an American soldier in a foreign war. His platoon was burning a village. Asked why they were burning the village, the soldier said it was believed some residents were enemy sympathizers. He then said: ""We've got to destroy the village so we can save it."" The Vermont we consider home may be facing a similar fate.
\
Act 56 is Vermont's new renewable energy law. It raises renewable energy targets on utilities from 55 percent of a utility's sales in 2017 to 75 percent in 2032, an important objective that most Vermonters support. Unfortunately, one prominent individual has sparked the idea that Vermont must meet those percentage goals by using only in-state renewable energy production. We certainly should pursue in-state renewable generation, but how much and how we produce it is a flammable topic. If the ""in-state only"" spark catches fire, the things Vermonters cherish most will be consumed in a conflagration of our own doing.
\
Think I'm needlessly pulling a false alarm? Meet David Blittersdorf, president of All Earth Renewables, developer of industrial-sized wind towers and solar arrays. He is also a major player in Vermont politics, as many Vermont politicians receive his campaign contributions. He recently gave a presentation to Addison County Democrats entitled: ""Vermont's Renewable Energy Future,"" a link to which appears at the end of this essay. He makes it quite clear the only proper way for Vermont to reach 75 percent renewable generation is with in-state produced power. There were at least a couple of well-meaning people in the room who agreed with him.
\
Getting to 75 percent renewables is a noble endeavor, but getting there by limiting ourselves solely to in-state production threatens to destroy our way of life. Mr. Blittersdorf's own numbers, taken from his vision of Vermont's ""future,"" demonstrate why. He says our current in-state renewable production of 100 megawatts will need to rise to 9,000 megawatts to meet our goal. To get there, he proposes 3,000 megawatts of industrial wind facilities and 6,000 megawatts of industrial solar arrays.
\
Okay, so what exactly does that mean? In the case of wind he says: ""(To reach) 3,000 megawatts, you can put about 15 megawatts per mile -- so that's 200 miles of ridges."" He did not say how much land would be needed for the additional 6,000 megawatts of solar, but he dismissed an audience member's suggestion to use rooftops with a sobering statistic. Installing solar on every usable rooftop in Vermont would only generate ""one to two percent"" of the state's energy needs. One can therefore surmise that Vermont would need to convert tens of thousands of acres worth of viable agricultural and forest land into solar fields to get the other 98 to 99 percent. He also says it's time to relax some of Act 250's strict land protections.
\
So imagine this new Vermont. Two hundred miles of ridgelines adorned with almost 500-foot tall whirligigs that blink at night, each one atop a concrete pad that has obliterated a pristine environment and disrupted wildlife habitat corridors. Untold thousands of acres of clear-cut forestlands and despoiled agricultural land covered with solar arrays.
\
And radical landscape transformation is not all. He continues: ""In Vermont, people like to live 10, 20, 30 miles from work. That's going to disappear. The 10-acre lot way out in the middle of nowhere on a dirt road is not going to be working anymore. So we have to c abandon the car c get people to live where they work c [t]hey can't be living everywhere."" He goes on to call for a moratorium on new roads, airports, gas stations, car dealers and natural gas pipelines. He wants a $100-per-ton carbon tax on distributors of fossil fuels, a tax that would hit the poorest Vermonters the hardest. In short, rural Vermont is no more.
\
It goes without saying that Mr. Blittersdorf stands to profit handsomely if we burn our village. The only remaining question is: how many state policy makers are picking up his torch? It is no sin to accept renewable power from out of state as we strive to meet our goals. But it would be a travesty to allow a vain sense of ideological righteousness to drive policy that is myopic in nature. We've long fought against acid rain to protect our ridgelines and supported regulations that thwart destruction of prime agricultural and forest lands. Destroying what we have heretofore protected needlessly divides a people who have traditionally stood together protecting their environment.

And Sanders did not disappoint.\""The issue that we're dealing with now: whether or not we're going to have a government which represents all of the people of our country or whether we're going to have a government owned and controlled by wealthy contributors,"" he said. ""We have a corrupt campaign finance system which is undermining American democracy. We have a system in which a small number of people are making huge campaign contributions.""\He played to the crowd, calling for free college tuition, refinancing student debt at the lowest possible interest rate, removing marijuana from the schedule 1 list of illegal controlled substances and raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour.\And he encouraged the crowd to turn out to vote during the primary March 8 and to continue the momentum his campaign gained with a landslide victory in New Hampshire last week.\""Our campaign has come a very long way in the last nine months. When we began, we were 30 points down in New Hampshire. Well, it didn't quite turn out that way. When we began, we were way down in Michigan, and it ain't going to turn out that way either,"" he said. ""What this campaign is about, in a very focused political way, is that we do well when turnout is large. We could struggle and lose when turnout is low.\""You are the future of the country.

\
We humans are faced with a staggering array of problems, not least the specter of global warming with its concomitant tragedies, both social and environmental.
\
Fossil-fuel emissions into the atmosphere of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases continue to escalate in the United States, China, and elsewhere above the safe (sustainable) level into the so-called atmospheric sink that we began to exceed in the 1960s.
\
As a result, glaciers are melting, the sea level is rising, floods, droughts and other adverse weather events are increasing and global biodiversity is suffering, as is so sadly demonstrated by the associated species extinctions. The outlook for both humans and nature remains bleak with the continued failure of governments to reach workable agreements.
\
And nowhere is the failure more conspicuous than in the general avoidance of the subject of population growth. Population is a double-barreled environmental problem, for not only is population increasing, so are the emissions per capita.
\
In 1970, when worldwide greenhouse gas emissions had just begun to transgress the sustainable sink capacity of the atmosphere, world population stood at about 3.7 billion; today it has risen to about 6.9 billion, an increase of 86 percent.
\
During that same period, worldwide emissions from fossil fuels rose from about 14 billion tons during 1970 to an estimated 29 billion tons during 2010, an increase of 107 percent.
\
From the above figures it can be seen that in 1970, emissions were about 3.8 tons per capita; today, despite the ever-growing awareness of looming climate-related disasters, such emissions have actually risen to about 4.2 tons per capita.
\
The still modest but growing fraction of energy produced by low to nearly emission-neutral means (solar, hydro, nuclear, wind, etc.) seems merely to be slowing down the rapidly growing dependence on fossil fuels in response to ever increasing energy demand.
\
Even in Vermont, one of the most efficiency-conscious and otherwise greenest of jurisdictions in the United States, emissions continue to rise in step with its population.
\
But inexplicably and inexcusably, recommendations by the United States, the United Nations and its affiliated agencies, and independent research and policy organizations essentially never include -- and certainly never stress -- population size as a contribution to global warming.
\
No rapid solution to the population problem is in sight. While those who can should speak up, we must continue, at the same time, to promote emission control measures ever more vigorously so as to return to the atmospheric sink capacity.
\
However, it is difficult for any government to impose major changes without the approval of the most vocal and powerful elements of its citizenry.
\
For this reason, nothing is more important than persistent education and publicity. And in the matter of global warming, no idea to be promulgated is more critical than the notion of a global commons. As with the high seas, the atmosphere must come to be regarded as a global commons, that is to say, as a common heritage of responsible humankind.
\
A principle of fairness follows from the idea of a global commons. Thus the time has come to apportion an overall safely sustainable level of emissions into the atmosphere to all the countries of the world in an equitable fashion.
\
Such apportioning cannot be based on amounts currently being discharged by various industrialized or rapidly industrializing countries. Neither can it be based on population, for this would reward over-populated countries (those populated beyond their human carrying capacity) and even encourage further growth.
\
Among the more environmentally friendly approaches to achieving the needed reductions in energy production are partial abstinence and frugality, greater use of energy-efficient devices, carbon capture and sequestration, emission-neutral means of generation, rain-forest protection, a levy on emissions (a ""carbon tax"") and the lease or purchase of emission rights by over-emitters from under-emitters (""cap-and-trade"" arrangements).
\
If appropriate international agreements could be forged (clearly no easy feat), cap-and-trade schemes would be in principle an excellent approach as long as (a) the worldwide level of emissions being sought is a safe and sustainable one, (b) a country's contribution to a safe level is equitably determined, and (c) inefficiency and corruption in its administration, monitoring and international verification are eliminated (or, to be realistic, kept to an acceptable limit).
\
An environmentally and socially equitable approach to cap and trade would be to base the discharge allocations on the country's area, that fraction of the atmosphere that its own land mass supports.
\
In such a scheme, many rich countries would currently be discharging more than their fair allotment, most of the poor countries probably less so.
\
The under-discharging countries would then be able to lease (not sell) some portion of their discharge rights until such time that they are able, with the help of this income, to develop their own necessary discharging infrastructure.
\
The leasing countries, for their part, would have time to institute changes to stay within their fair allotment, which might well include retrenchment of individual energy consumption or, barring that, even reduced population numbers, difficult as that might be.
\
In the end, we must all recognize that we have an obligation to share this earth -- the global biosphere -- with the other living things, an obligation that requires a reduction, by one means or another, in our population-driven demands on its natural resources and sink capacities.
\
To bring about this recognition is the task of civic education in the broad sense, a sustained effort to create public opinion powerful enough to give governments the incentive and ability to act.

"
123,"As the 2015 legislative session begins, the Burlington Free Press is publishing position statements from political leaders and advocates reflecting their goals and expectations.\Each was asked to answer:\What do you expect to be the biggest issue overall, or the biggest issue related to your topic area, during the upcoming session, and how will you approach it?\What other bills or issues can voters expect to see debated this winter?\Upcoming topics address the state's challenges with health care, transportation, natural resources and criminal justice/judiciary.\Today's topic is taxes.\Tom Torti: End endless debate\Today, the governor and the Vermont legislature will begin the work of the new biennial session. Like so many other years, education, state spending, taxes, health care, the environment and work force issues will take center stage.\Overwhelming feedback received by the Lake Champlain Chamber is that the endless annual debate, without action on these key issues, will continue to damage Vermont's fragile economic climate. These issues have been studied and debated long enough. It is time for leadership and action.\The education issue is not ""how"" we pay for schools. Simply put, we spend far too much for the number of students we educate. Administrative overhead and per-pupil ratios are out of synch with student populations. We must adjust the ""spend"" to come in line with best practice standards.\State spending has eclipsed the ability of Vermonters to pay for the host of current state programs. Funding must be allocated to programs that serve our most critical needs and that produce measurable results.\Vermont cannot tax its way out of the problem. Our current tax rates already act as an impediment to an expanding economy. Since the ""single payer"" debate has been sidelined, our health care focus can now be on quality improvement and cost control. Funding the Medicaid cost shift, investing in the Blue Print for Health, transitioning to an outcome based payment model and investing in a uniform records, billing and scheduling system are investments worth making.\On the environmental front, there is near universal agreement that our impaired waterways need help. Current rhetoric that labels segments of Vermonters as the ""problem"" and solutions that look for taxpayers to dig even deeper to bear the burden of clean water are themselves impaired. If policy makers believe that clean water is a priority, the state should find within its $1.5 billion dollar general fund budget the $15 million annually required to fund the clean up process.\Finally, our workforce is aging and many of those remaining need skills training in critical areas. Local education, job training, and technical center programs must be funded and directed to focus on advanced manufacturing and skills for science, technology, engineering and math. Without a commitment to workforce retention and training, Vermont will be unable to compete for jobs and talent in the 21st century.\None of this is a simple as this letter makes it sound, but it isn't that complex either. These are pragmatic decisions that need to be made within a political context. However, leadership requires moving from inertia towards action. Vermont needs our leaders to act this session.\Tom Torti, president and CEO of the Lake Champlain Regional Chamber of Commerce, resides in Essex.\Jane Kitchel: Not a battleground\Vermont's education funding system is complex, difficult to explain and understand. While it does provide equity, I believe experience has shown that it does not adequately address the growing costs of Vermont's K-12 system.\Presently, school budgets and spending are determined locally by the voters of each town or school district. The Legislature then sets a statewide property tax rate at the level necessary to raise the revenues needed to support the aggregate level of spending approved by all local votes.\In my opinion there is not a sufficient connection between spending decisions made locally and the statewide property tax rate that will ultimately be required. For example, under the existing system an individual town or district could vote a school budget that is level-funded or even decreases and yet the property owners in that town could still experience a property tax increase because of higher spending decisions made by other towns and/or possible changes to the town's Common Level of Appraisal (CLA) or the value of the statewide grand list or student characteristics. This is very difficult to explain and means that those voters experience no direct benefit from making difficult budgetary decisions.\For fiscal year 2015, Vermont's K-12 system will cost approximately $1.5 billion. Although property taxes are the largest revenue component of the Education Fund, many Vermonters are not aware that about 25 percent of all the state's nontransportation revenues also go into the fund. Specifically, 35 percent of all sales tax revenues, 33 percent of the purchase and use tax revenues on vehicles, all Lottery profits and a General Fund transfer of $296 million are dedicated to the Education Fund.\In addition, the state budget separately funds about $80 million for teachers' retirement and retired teachers' health care. To avoid future property tax increases would require one, or a combination, of the following actions -- reduce the growth in school spending, reduce the funds currently being used to support the functions of state government and transfer more revenues to the Education Fund, or increase other taxes. Since nearly 70 percent of all Vermont homeowners currently pay property taxes based on income, I would suspect most Vermonters would not want to simply replace higher property taxes with higher income taxes or other taxes.\As a legislator, I am committed to working in partnership with the secretary of the Agency of Education, educators and local school boards to identify the cost drivers within the system and to connect better spending decisions with tax impacts. We must develop policies and legislation that will effectively address the growing cost of Vermont's public education system. We cannot let our schools become a battleground, and we all should have a mutual goal of achieving a fiscally sustainable system.\Sen. Jane Kitchel is a Democrat who resides in Danville.\John McClaughry: Choice wins\Gov. Peter Shumlin's abandonment of his single-payer health plan -- at least for now -- affords Vermonters a reprieve from truly enormous increases in payroll and income taxes. However, tax issues will continue to be prominent in 2015.\The major pressure is to diminish the burden of the homestead school property tax. There are four options.\First, increase the General Fund transfer to the Education Fund and reduce the property tax rate. But with what? The General Fund already faces a $100 million deficit.\Second is the Democrats' intention to add an income tax surcharge to replace part of the homestead tax revenues. That will spur fierce resistance not only from upper income taxpayers, but from those who view with alarm the effect of high income tax rates on the state's economy. (Governors Dean, Douglas and Shumlin all shared this concern.)\Third is reorganizing the public school system and mandating ""savings."" Getting real ""savings"" would require a state takeover of public schools and enforcement of spending caps and mandates -- something like Lt. Gov. Phil Scott's Green Mountain Care Board for education. Even Democrats and Progs are leery of the politics of ""One Big School System.""\Fourth is the really innovative solution. Let public schools, charter schools, independent schools, and other providers compete for the parents' tuition dollars. (Example: the vibrant charter school competition in Houston, San Jose and Washington, D.C.) A lot of parents will choose alternatives that cost far less than overgrown and complacent monopoly public schools.\An environmentalist coalition is pushing hard for a carbon tax, to make Vermonters reduce spending on gasoline, diesel fuel, propane, natural gas and heating oil. This, they say, will make Vermont a leader in the battle against ""climate change."" As proposed, it will also allow the renewable industrial complex to skim off ten percent of the take to subsidize their interests. This is likely to be a nonstarter.\But there's a related measure that would subsidize renewable electricity in a way that won't be obvious to ratepayers: the Renewable Portfolio Standard. The RPS will require Vermont utilities to get specified percentages of their power from renewables like wind and solar. Since those two energy sources are as much as four times as costly as grid power, ratepayers will be hit with another tax, hidden in their utility bills.\My recommendation for the legislature: parental choice in education, and no tax increases, visible or hidden.\Former Senator John McClaughry is vice president of the Ethan Allen Institute. He resides in Kirby Mountain.\Patti Komline: Affordability\Vermont is in the midst of an affordability crisis. You know it. I know it. Unfortunately, Gov. Peter Shumlin's administration either hasn't realized the seriousness of the problem or lacks the skills and fortitude to truly address this challenge. It was reassuring to see the public register their frustration on Election Day. And, it would appear that the powers-that-be are paying attention, at least for a while.\Gov. Shumlin recently announced, what so many people knew to be inevitable, his health care plan is unworkable. The speaker of the House has stated that, finally, education and property tax reform will be a priority. Two big announcements signifying that change might be in the air. It is my hope that this change is approached on a macro, not micro level.\We need big picture solutions to our challenges. One only needs to look at our own budgets to know where the crux of problem lies. Expenses, especially in the unsustainable growth in property taxes and health care costs, are outpacing incomes. This is the very problem the state is facing, a budget deficit of $100 million due to the declining income tax revenue that can't keep up with budget increases.\Lt. Gov. Phil Scott has pledged to make affordability his priority. If legislators all get behind his efforts, working together with a laser-like focus on improving our economy, supporting businesses that provide career growth jobs and creating an environment that will encourage entrepreneurs to move to Vermont, we will begin to reverse this downward trend. We have been heading in the wrong direction for too long.\Providing better paying opportunities for more Vermonters addresses so many of the challenges that are dragging us down. A prosperous economy results in greater income tax revenue to the state to fund programs for the less fortunate and more money for our infrastructure needs. It results in less crime, less drug abuse and a healthier public. It would even bring in needed revenue to fund the cleanup of Lake Champlain, which will be another state priority this year.\It is my intention to work with the lieutenant governor and many other key legislators to make sure that the major issues that we tackle are those that will turn around our economy, enriching the lives of all Vermonters.\Rep.

124,"Bill McKibben's first book, ""The End of Nature"" (1989), was in the vanguard of climate-change warnings for a popular audience. Much of McKibben's later writing has focused on related themes.\He has profiled low-emissions lifestyles in Brazil and India. He has challenged the conventional goal of relentless economic growth. He has championed the cause of local food and detailed his experiences as a Vermont localvore.\A scholar in residence at Middlebury College, McKibben is also an activist: Two years ago he founded Step It Up, which staged 1,400 global-warming demonstrations in a single day in April in an effort to press Congress to act on limiting emissions.\As a follow-up he has founded another organization with a wider scope -- the world -- and a more sharply focused message that's compressed into what he calls ""the most important number in the world"" -- 350. By his reckoning, that's the safe upper limit of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, in parts per million.\The current concentration is about 390 and rising, and unless the level is brought down during this century, he believes, excessive temperatures will put the Earth past the tipping point, with melting ice caps, rising sea levels, and devastating new drought and rainfall patterns.\Like Step It Up, McKibben's 350.org expects to nurture and publicize hundreds of anti-global-warming demonstrations on a single day, Oct. 24, all with the aim of imprinting ""350"" on the world's consciousness. The aim is to raise the pressure on the world's leading nations to set meaningful limits on emissions in talks scheduled for December in Copenhagen. Even McKibben admits that's a tall order.\We talked to him recently at his home in Ripton -- which has more than a dozen large solar panels on the roof -- about recent climate-change developments and the 350 campaign: Tim Johnson: What's the latest science telling us about climate change?\Bill McKibben: Basically, all the latest science can be summed up by saying, global warming is way ahead of schedule. We're seeing huge changes with only fairly small increases in temperature -- a little over one degree Fahrenheit, and that's been enough to get the Arctic melting, every glacier in the world melting, changing hydrological cycles in profound ways, so we're seeing much heavier bursts of rainfall than have ever been recorded. The science has gotten very clear about what we need to do. This number that we've been working with, 350, is new. Two years ago, no one knew it was important, but now, probably, it's the most important number in the world. It represents the most carbon we can safely have in the atmosphere.\TJ: Some have said 450.\BM: That was the old hope. But if we're at 390 now, and the Arctic is steadily melting. What does that tell you? Would that it were otherwise. I'd much rather be running 450.org.\TJ: So if we're over the limit, why shouldn't people just throw up their hands?\BM: The Earth will scrub carbon out of the atmosphere. We're filling a bathtub, but the bathtub does have a drain. The problem is now, we're just filling it faster than it can possibly drain. If we stop putting more carbon in ... forests and oceans suck some carbon out of the atmosphere each year and they will continue to. The deep problem is that if we don't stop putting more in soon, then as the temperature rises and those sinks, forests and oceans, become steadily less efficient at removing carbon from the atmosphere. Forests begin to die, and so on. So, we've go to do it soon. That's the problem. It's a real time test. It's not like other social or environmental problems that we're used to dealing with. If we don't get it right soon, we won't get it right.\TJ: So, what about a carbon tax in this country?\BM: I think the important thing is to get a serious cap on carbon that reflects the science. Once that happens, the price of carbon will go up. You saw what happened last summer when the price of gasoline went up. All of a sudden, people discovered that they didn't really need semi-military vehicles to go grocery shopping in, and that was good. ...You can call it a tax, you can call it cap and trade, you can call it cap and dividend. There are a lot of different schemes. The important thing is the cap. I think the best system by far is one that's called cap and dividend, where you basically put a cap on carbon, charge Exxon a lot of money for the right to produce fossil fuels, and then take the money and distribute it as a check to everyone in the country every six months or so. You could raise the price enough to change people's behavior without bankrupting them. Congress hasn't gone down that route. They have a different set of imperatives that involve mostly rewarding large coal-fired utilities that are big campaign contributors.\TJ: Is cap and dividend in place anywhere?\BM: It's actually in place in a few places. British Columbia has scheme like it, working well. It's kind of based on the Alaskan model for what you do with oil revenues. But in any event, the key part is getting the cap, and getting it fast, and it has to be not just national, but global.\TJ: So how do you raise the price without harming poor people in developing countries?\BM: Around the world the key is to provide real assistance in terms of resources and technology to allow countries like China and India to leapfrog the fossil-fuel era and go straight to wind and sun and whatever else. We need the kind of carbon-equivalent of the Marshall Plan, with that same mixture of practicality and idealism. This is the most important problem that we've every faced as a planet. We can't solve it without bringing developing countries on board. We can't tell developing countries, sorry, we've filled up the atmosphere, you think of some other way to prosperity.\TJ: China keeps building new coal-fired power plants.\BM: Well, China's a great enigma, in many ways. I've spent a lot of time there in the last few years. The first thing to realize is what it says about us. So, yeah, the Chinese are adding a coal-fired power plant a week or whatever. The average Chinese person uses one-quarter as much energy as the average American. Another thing to keep in mind is, a large percentage of those coal-fired power plants that go on line are designed to provide electricity to build all the stuff that we've outsourced to China to build for us.\TJ: In ""The End of Nature"" you noted that affluence is an obstacle to reducing emissions, that would be very difficult to change lifestyles. That was 20 years ago. Any reason to think it's less of a problem now?\BM: It's not any less of a problem, and the fact that we've done very little to deal with the climate so far is sort of proof I'm afraid of how difficult in certain ways it is. Two things have changed. One, the climate risk has become so much more obvious. Things are happening so much faster, and on such a larger scale than we thought 20 years ago. And two, to a certain degree, technology has progressed to the point where it's at least possible to sort of imagine some kind of set of solutions. Twenty years ago, we were still talking about solar power with our fingers crossed, .and now it's powering my house\TJ: How much does ""success"" depend on persuading people to change their lifestyles, and how much on persuading political leaders to change policy?\BM: I think at this point the percentage has shifted steeply in the direction of trying to get government action. I've spent the last two or three years trying to build political movements large enough to have some effect on that equation, because it's become very clear as the science has gotten much darker that we're no longer in a position of being able to solve this one light bulb at a time, if we ever were. When we do this thing on Oct. 24, it will be probably the biggest, most widespread geographic day of political action ever on the planet.\TJ: Tell me some of the things that will happen on the 24th.\BM: There will be thousands and thousands of events all designed just to take these three numbers, 3, 5, 0, and drive them into the public imagination. So, there will be big cities around the world will have tens of thousands of people and some of them, in Sydney, Johannesburg, will have people making giant 3s with their bodies. London and Delhi, huge 5s, and Washington .... giant 0s. Like planetary scrabble. We hope CNN will put them together on the evening news. In the Maldives, one of my favorite places on earth, the president, who's a wonderful guy -- of a country that may disappear in the next 50 years -- he's got all his cabinet taking scuba lessons. They're going to have an underwater cabinet meeting on Oct. 24, down on their dying reef, send a resolution to Copenhagen. There'll be, all over the world, farmers cutting 350s into their mowing them into their fields, concerts, bike rides with 350 bike riders, you name it.\TJ: What will you be doing on that day?\BM: I'll be in New York City, where we'll be uploading pictures in real time to our Web site, and flashing them on a giant screen at the U.N. and in Times Square on those video boards. Our goal is to draw attention to what people are doing all over the world, because that's the real fun of it for me. We couldn't have done it even a few years ago. Most of the world doesn't have the Internet, but everybody has a cell phone, and so we figured out how to do this kind of work across cell phones, and it's been very exciting.\TJ: Do you hope to change the minds of people in power?\BM: Yeah, we've already got 92 countries or something that have signed on to this 350 target. They're the smallest, poorest countries in the world. They're not going to sway the negotiations in Copenhagen, but the fact that they're now aggressive for something that will allow the world to survive, that will allow their countries to survive. That's a very powerful part of this. I think more what will happen is, that we'll change the frame of reference for this debate. We're not going to get a great agreement out of Copenhagen, I don't think, but clearly we're changing the game some already, and we'll keep trying. Most of the big, credible thinkers about climate, beginning with Al Gore, and then more recently. the other person to win a Nobel prize, Rajendra Pachauri (chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), have backed this 350 number, which was difficult for them to do. It's radical in a sense. It upsets the apple cart of international negotiations ...\TJ: Because it's lower ... ?\BM: It's lower than people want to go.\TJ: But the emissions have gone up every year.\BM: Until last year. The recession seems to have actually cut carbon emissions in this country, and probably around the world, which illustrates the problem. In a world as fixated as ours is on constant growth, it's very hard to have that constant growth without some growth in the amount of fossil fuel you're using.\TJ: One of the words you used in that first book was humility. It seemed to be a pretty important quality necessary to lower emissions.\BM: Absolutely.\TJ: Perhaps you've got to have people leading the way, pointing toward lives of greater humility.\BM: Look, I don't know if you have to have people leading the way. You have to set up the structure, a set of conditions. Here's how all these things fit together. There's a hopeful scenario that goes like this: We reach some kind of global agreement to start taking seriously the biggest problem we face. We cap carbon and put a real price on it. So that does a couple of things. One, directly, you begin to use less fossil fuels, emissions go down, and you start to get things a little more under control. But the other thing it does is change the conditions under which the world economy operates. So, for instance, we ship food 5,000 miles at a crack, because we have cheap fossil fuel to let us do it. The day we don't have cheap fossil fuel any more is the day that, for Vermonters, Vermont food becomes not just delicious, but obvious, because it's no longer competing with something that's being subsidized by the endless destruction of the environment.\TJ: What would you like to see from the Obama administration?\BM: I'd like to see a little more effort at actually communicating and educating. These guys know how to campaign. That's what we need. This is the biggest problem we've ever faced, and it's not some future problem. It's breaking on us right now. This is the one that will define his and everybody else's legacy.\TJ: What does Vermont need to do most in terms of reducing emissions that it's not doing?\BM: Right now, our electricity is low carb, but it's probably not going to be that way much longer, and as far as I can tell, Montpelier is not exactly planning for that contingency. I think the things that Vermont can do, one would be rapid, real deep powerful encouragement of renewable development. Rapid promotion of local food. It's amazing how much we've gotten done both with renewable energy and local food in this state with almost no help from Montpelier. Our Achilles heel is going to be transportation. I don't see any substitute for trying to, hard as it is, bring trains back in a serious way. There was a period of time in a much poorer Vermont, where one could take a train anywhere in the state, and take it regularly and easily. There's got to be a way to make that happen now.\TJ: Local food -- you mean infrastructure?\BM: Absolutely . We need more slaughterhouses, canneries, all the things that used to be all over the place. I spent a year eating nothing but food from the Champlain Valley. You can do it, but it was harder than it should have been, and there were some things that were essentially impossible.. There's nobody in the state of Vermont processing oats any more.\TJ: Could Vermont feed itself?\BM: I think the answer to that question is incredibly positive. I think inside of a growing season we could be feeding ourselves. Our agricultural policy has been so slanted toward dairies, and increasingly toward big dairies, and now were in the same kind of export agricultural business that the rest of the country's in, and it's bankrupting farmers and it's pretty obvious that continuing down that road doesn't help. So, why aren't we investing those resources in helping people transition to growing things we want to eat?\TJ: What about energy?\BM: In energy, we're not even near the forefront of states. There are places with much tougher renewable standards going forward. We're really pretty far behind environmentally now. Vermont's notion that it's a really green state rests on things that were done 15 and 20 years ago, and they're no longer particularly innovative or unusual. Some of the Sunbelt states, places like Mississippi., have strong renewable portfolio standards. Texas is installing wind at a really fast rate. So, our idea that we're a particularly environmental place is more in the past than in the present. We could be deeply in the future. We still have the real possibility to emerge again as a leader in a lot of this stuff.\On the Net\-- For information on the 350 campaign and a list of ""Day of Action"" events scheduled for Oct. 24, go to: www.350.org\-- The full text of the paper by NASA scientist James Hansen and nine co-authors, ""Target atmospheric CO2: Where should humanity aim?"" -- http://bit.ly/HansenPaper\-- A detailed discussion of how emissions might be constrained in Third World countries without unduly hampering their economic development: ""The Right to Development in a Climate-Constrained World: The Greenhouse Development Rights Framework,"" a November 2008 report of the Stockholm Environment Institute"" -- http://bit.ly/GDRsFrame\-- ""The IPCC 4th Assessment Report,"" the latest report by the Nobel-prize winning U.N.

125,"I am writing this in response to David Ellenbogen's article in the Burlington Free Press regarding the recently introduced bill H.412, to enact a carbon pollution tax in the state (""Opinion: Hold polluters responsible,"" March 18).\Ellenbogen makes some excellent points on how Vermont is a state that hold's people accountable for the mess that they make and that this responsibility cannot be ignored by fossil fuel companies. These companies are polluting a shared, crucial resource: our planet. This is having a direct effect on human health and ecological stability.\We must recognize Vermont's goals for clean energy and energy independence.\The state has an overarching goal for 90 percent energy independence by the year 2050. In order for this to happen, funding and resources must be sunk into state capacity giving programs. One example of this ambitious plan is a goal to weatherize of 80,000 Vermont homes by the year 2020. Home weatherization is a priority area for investment from revenue from the carbon tax.\This proposal will allow our state's actions to represent the constituent bodies collective interest in protecting our environment while allowing increased and enhanced economic growth. These are interests shared by many Vermonters but that often cannot be satisfied simultaneously.\With this bill, H.412, Vermonters have a chance to benefit economically and environmentally while setting a precedent on carbon pollution accountability for the rest of the country.\HENRY SCHWARTZ\Burlington"

\
The tide may be turning on climate change and the public's willingness to take action. On Sept. 21, in the largest demonstration of its kind ever held, more than 300,000 people took to the streets of New York to demand action to curb global warming.
\
The next day, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, a philanthropic organization funded with oil money, announced that it was divesting itself of investments in fossil fuel companies. Apple CEO Tim Cook, speaking at the United Nations, told leaders that acting to protect the environment does not come at the expense of economic growth. It may, in fact, foster it.
\
On Tuesday, more than 100 world leaders met at the United Nations to discuss what each nation would do to reduce man-made emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Also on Tuesday, more than 400 companies from around the globe signed onto a campaign to put a price on carbon. Imposing a tax on carbon emissions is the fastest, fairest way to combat climate change. Nations that do, and use the revenue to reduce income taxes or otherwise refund it to taxpayers, could see emissions fall, air quality and health improve, and the economy grow.
\
The New York Times reported that Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google, announced that his company was dropping its membership in the American Legislative Exchange Council, a group backed by energy interests that lobbies against tax and regulatory action to curb global warming. People who oppose taking action, Schmidt said, ""are really hurting our children and our grandchildren and making the world a much worse place.""
\
In six weeks, New Hampshire voters will get to choose between congressional candidates who question the science behind human-induced climate change and oppose taxes or fees on carbon emissions, and candidates willing to act now before droughts grow longer, sea levels higher and hurricanes stronger. We're sorry to say that all of the candidates who oppose economic measures to address climate change -- Scott Brown, Marilinda Garcia and Frank Guinta -- are Republicans. Not all in their party take that position, among them Paul Volker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve; George Shultz, secretary of state under Ronald Reagan; and former South Carolina congressman Bob Inglis, who sponsored a carbon tax bill while in office.
\
The time for action on climate change is short.
\
Much of the world, including New Hampshire, is already experiencing unwelcome changes, and the effects of all the carbon dioxide already loosed on the atmosphere have yet to be felt. Each week, it seems, brings either news of another disaster that may be at least in part driven by climate change -- the strongest storm ever recorded devastated the Philippines last fall, wildfires have plagued America's West all summer -- or yet another doom and gloom report.
\
A study by researchers at Cornell and the University of Arizona just published in the Journal of Climate warns that coming decades could see the longest and deepest droughts in 2,000 years. Researchers put the odds of a generation-long drought in the American Southwest at between 1 in 5 and 1 in 2.
\
Some nations, including the United States thanks to executive orders issued by President Obama, are reducing carbon emissions. Among them is China, the world's major polluter. Laggards include Canada and Australia.
\
Convincing such nations to clean up their acts requires American leadership and example. That leadership will suffer if New Hampshire voters send to Congress politicians who use the economy as an excuse for inaction on climate change.

127,"
The Vermont Legislature has long been bent on saving the planet through government micromanagement of energy policy. The big issue this year appears to be passing a Renewable Portfolio Standard that would require utilities to sell a set percentage renewable power (and thereby forcing customers buy the more expensive product). The other issue, likely debated but not moved on this year, is a carbon tax designed to make fossil fuel use artificially expensive.
\
According to a recent report from Google, this is exactly the wrong thing to do. In 2007, Google launched RE<C to ""tackle the world's climate and energy problems."" The goal was to figure out how to improve renewable technologies to the point that they could deliver renewable energy more cheaply than a coal fired power plant could. In 2011, Google pulled the plug on the project. The science just didn't work.
\
""Trying to combat climate change exclusively with today's renewable energy technologies simply won't work; we need a fundamentally different approach."" Even if we were somehow able to shut down every fossil-fueled power plant immediately, it still wouldn't stop the planet from warming. ""We decided to combine our energy innovation study's best-case scenario results with Hansen's climate model to see whether a 55 percent emission cut by 2050 would bring the world back below that 350-ppm threshold. Our calculations revealed otherwise.""
\
A totally new technology will be necessary. We don't know, but one thing will drive its development: Profit Motive. Profit has wrongly become a dirty word for many in Vermont, but it is the only efficient fuel, if you will, that can propel technology far enough to achieve the environmental goal of cheap, abundant, reliable, renewable energy.
\
Across the board, we need solutions that don't require subsidies or government regulations that penalize fossil fuel usage. Of course, anything that makes fossil fuels more expensive, whether it's pollution limits or an outright tax on carbon emissions, helps competing energy technologies locally. But industry can simply move manufacturing (and emissions) somewhere else.
\
If shutting down all the fossil fuel power plants in the world today won't solve the warming problem, Vermont's goal of reaching 90 percent renewable energy by 2050 in our little state alone is really a worthless endeavor. Worse than worthless. It's potentially damaging to our economy as well as our natural environment while providing nothing in return.
\
Meredith Angwin of Vermont's Energy Education project calculated that in order to generate 90 percent of Vermont's energy requirements from local, renewable sources, which is the goal, it would require developing as much as 700 miles of ridge-line all on the scale of the Lowell wind project. Vermont is only 154 miles long, and only a fraction of that number is suitable for wind turbines.
\
Alternatively, we would have to cover an area one quarter the size of the Green Mountain National Forest with solar panels to achieve the same result. Driving through much of the state today and passing acres of unsightly panels where Woody Jackson's cows used to graze, it seems like we're already approaching that mass, but, despite the perception, we're not even close.
\
This kind of industrial development will have a devastating environmental and aesthetic impact on Vermont. The artificially high costs of energy will drive away businesses and jobs. The damage to the landscape will repel tourists. And, even in the best case scenario, this policy will do nothing to solve the issue of global warming.
\
So, rather than plow forward with expensive and invasive policies we know won't work, perhaps pull the plug for now, at least until a real solution has been identified. Our pristine landscape and the children who inherit it will thank you.

"
128,"WASHINGTON -- Jane Sanders raised some eyebrows about whether she was trying to send a message with her recent retweet of one of the ""Bernie or Bust"" crowd's favorite videos of her husband from the Democratic primary campaign.\The video clip, from an April 25 MSNBC town hall, shows Sen. Bernie Sanders responding to a college student who asked whether Sanders would encourage his supporters to vote for his then-rival Hillary Clinton if he lost the primary campaign. The student said many of his supporters were considering writing him in, voting for a third-party candidate or not voting at all.\""We are not a movement where I can snap my fingers and say to you or to anybody else what you should do, because you won't listen to me,"" Sanders, I-Vt., responded. ""You shouldn't. You'll make these decisions yourself.""\Sanders has since endorsed Clinton, and he has recently been speaking out against people casting ""protest votes"" as some millennials are showing a surprising interest in third-party candidates.\His wife's retweet of the video on Friday prompted the headline, ""Why Did Jane Sanders Tweet Bernie's 'Don't Listen to Me' Video?"" on the news site, Heavy.com. Jane Sanders is considered a close political adviser to her husband.\Michael Briggs, the senator's spokesman, wrote in an email, ""Jane's tweet makes the same point Bernie has made many times, that this election will be decided on issues like creating jobs, boldly addressing climate change and making college affordable. Jane was just saying listen to the candidates.""\The original tweet from Heath Byers included both of Sanders' Twitter handles and the hashtags #FridayFeeling, #JustAskBernie and #OurRevolution. The video headline read, ""Bernie Sanders The Movement Should Not Listen to Me"" and the hashtag #BernieorBust flashes at the end of the video.\Heavy.com notes that the video ""became a rallying cry for many #BernieorBust supporters, who believed it was Bernie's way of telling them not to vote for Clinton or listen to his future endorsements.""\The video clip doesn't show Sanders later during the town hall saying, ""I will do everything in my power to make sure that no Republican gets into the White House in this election cycle.""\What's included in the clip is Sanders' statement that it's incumbent upon Clinton, if she wins the nomination, to tell people ""who have serious misgivings about a candidate who has received millions of dollars from Wall Street and other special interests"" that the United States should take on ""the greed of the drug companies"" and pass a ""Medicare for all"" health care system. He said she should work to make public colleges and universities tuition free and ""come on board"" and say she'll take on the fossil fuel industry and pass a carbon tax.\""It is incumbent upon Secretary Clinton to reach out not only to my supporters, but to all of the American people, with an agenda that they believe will represent the interests of working families, lower income people, the middle class, those of us who are concerned about the environment and not just big money interests,"" he says."
129,"This winter will bring more problems than icy roads and blistering winds. In January, Republicans took over Congress, among them some of the most renowned climate change deniers such as Sen. Jim Inhofe, the chairman of the Environment Committee, who claims that global warming might actually help humanity.\Republicans have vowed to rein in regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency as one of their top priorities, specifically targeting the EPA's new regulations on carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants, which are the nation's largest source of emissions.\Attacking these regulations would be foolhardy seeing as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change confirmed in their 2014 report that continued emissions will cause long-lasting changes in the climate, ""increasing the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems.""\Climate change will affect everyone, but the distribution of its impacts will fall disproportionately on developing countries, with Africa as the region of greatest risk. Some major impacts include extreme weather conditions, water scarcity, increased poverty, and global food insecurity. There is hope, however, that substantial emissions reductions over the next few decades could reduce climate risks for the second half of the 21st century. The best policy to pursue is an annual cap-and-auction system on carbon emissions, applied to firms in all economic sectors, with an emission reduction target of 80 percent below the current level by the year 2050. Firms should not feel threatened by this target because it will gradually increase overtime, preventing an economic disruption and giving firms a chance to adapt to increasing emissions reductions.\The government will sell carbon permits, the amount available determined by that year's quota, in an ascending-clock style auction. The permits will be tradeable, giving firms control over how much they emit since they have the option of either selling their permits for a profit or purchasing more as needed. Since firms benefit from reducing their emissions, they will have incentive to invest in research and development for renewable energy and low carbon technologies. Investment is crucial because we need technological change to prevent permit prices from increasing with the target.\A major criticism of policies that curb emissions is that they will raise the prices of fossil fuels for American consumers, disproportionately affecting the working-class which spends a higher percentage of their incomes on fuel. The cap-and-auction policy, unlike a carbon tax, limits the extent to which prices increase for consumers because carbon-emitting firms will now have to pay the public for the right to pollute. This enables the government to capture the revenue (that rightly belongs to everyone, not just corporations) and redistribute it through payments (dividends) to all citizens equally.\Consumption patterns nation-wide will have to change overtime, but technological change will smooth and continue the transition towards a less fossil-fuel dependent economy. The question comes down to what will bring us the greatest welfare, if that is our desirable end. If we continue to increase consumption and economic growth, then we must be prepared to face the severe impacts of climate change.\We can still choose the other option and respond to climate change. The IPCC has confirmed that if we begin to make significant emission reductions now, we can mitigate climate change and preserve the welfare of current and future generations. Climate change is an increasing threat to human welfare and the need for a response is imperative. Immediate political action is necessary to prevent the Republican Party from gaining control over environmental decisions. As a world leader and the second largest carbon emitter, it is our duty to take the first step in transforming our global society to preserve human welfare.\Madison Dell of Burlington is a student at the University of Vermont."

Less than 1 percent of Vermont's state and municipal employees have chosen to invest their retirement savings in a fossil-fuel free mutual fund, according to an April report by the state treasurer's office.
\
The report says 171 state employees have invested in the optional retirement savings program, totaling about $517,636 in assets, since it was created in 2008. There are about 48,000 active and retired members of the retirement system.
\
The fund was created in 2008, but Vermont first offered it to state employees in 2014.
\
The program gives employees the option to invest in energy companies that do not extract, refine or sell fossil fuels. Over the past five years, the funds have earned returns below the benchmark of similar investment accounts that include fossil fuel companies.

There is a campaign underway to divest all of the state's retirement holdings from the largest fossil fuel companies. Divestment proponents want Vermont to pull its investments from fossil fuel companies in an effort to put pressure on those companies. They hope it will raise awareness for climate change policy initiatives such as a carbon tax. Others want the companies to go out of business.
\
State Treasurer Beth Pearce said the fund would cost about $10 million per year in lost returns, citing a November 2014 report by the Treasurer's Office. As an investor, she also says the state can change companies' business practices through ""stakeholder activism,"" which includes signing petitions and resolutions.
\
Pearce recently released a sustainability report that pointed to ways the state has leveraged its role as an investor to commit companies to changing business practices. Last year, Krispy Kreme Doughnuts Inc. committed to purchasing from only certified sustainable palm oil distributors that do not cause deforestation at the request of Pearce and other stakeholders.
\
Divestment proponents say fossil fuels companies are different. Asking them to change their business model of extracting, refining and distributing coals, oil and gas is like asking them to go out of business.
\
""It would be akin to asking Krispy Kreme to stop making doughnuts and to start selling some kind of health food. ExxonMobil is not going to become a clean energy company,"" said Eric Becker, chief investment officer of Norwich-based Clean Yield Asset Management.
\
Pearce believes divesting is not the best way to pressure companies to change.
\
""I think that walking away from the table is the worst thing we can do because then you've given up your shareholder rights and then someone else buys that stock and they may not care about the environment,"" she said Monday.
\
BP, the company responsible for the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster on the Gulf Coast, has promised to be more open about the company's impact on climate change following a resolution backed by 98 percent of shareholders. BP did not set targeted greenhouse gas emission reductions. For this reason, proponents of divesting the state's pension holdings from fossil fuel companies were not satisfied. They say there is still no evidence fossil fuel companies are changing their business model.
\
Pearce and a coalition of 47 other global investors requested that ExxonMobil adopt measurable goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Pearce will speak at an ExxonMobil annual meeting May 27 where she says she will ask the world's largest publicly traded oil and gas company to adopt emission reduction targets.
\
The Vermont Pension Investment Committee (VPIC) invests more than $4 billion with more than $100 million invested in oil, gas and coal companies.
\
Divestment proponents fundamentally disagree with Pearce on climate change investment strategies. But they are pleased Pearce is responding to their concerns. They also commend Pearce for several other steps the state has taken to address the issue through investments.
\
The state is also asking its investment managers to include in their examination of companies an analysis of the potential financial impact of climate change. The urged the SEC to require better disclosure of climate change risks in companies' annual financial filings.
\
Institutions, most recently the Church of England, and many local governments have pledged to divest more than $50 billion in assets from fossil fuel companies as of September, according to a recent study. No states have divested from fossil fuels yet, but there are active bills in Maine, Massachusetts and California, according to Maeve McBride, 350 Vermont coordinator.
\
The Senate Government Operations Committee is drafting a bill, S.28, that would require the state's pension managers to divest retirement holdings from the world's 200 largest publicly traded fossil fuel companies by 2020. There is a similar bill in the House, in addition to a resolution.
\
McBride said divestment is more than symbolic. She said divestment can avoid a climate change catastrophe. She said 80 percent of proven fossil fuel reserves must remain in the ground in order maintain no more than a 2-degree Celsius global temperature rise, at which point scientists still predict global sea-level rise and extreme weather.
\
The state employees union has adopted a resolution that opposes the Legislature's involvement in the state's retirement savings.

DAVIS, Calif. (AP) -- Unlocking economic prosperity in a low-carbon world was a key theme Monday at a climate-change summit headlined by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who is among regional government leaders seeking to join private investors with green technology projects.
\
The outgoing governor of California has been bringing together local government leaders from around the world for three years to reduce greenhouse gas emissions after saying the U.S. and other countries failed to take the lead.
\
""I know that together we can usher in a new era and build a cleaner and brighter, more prosperous future,"" Schwarzenegger told attendees at his third and final climate summit. ""So, I say let's do it.""
\
The two-day summit at the University of California, Davis, just west of Sacramento, drew more than 1,500 people from more than 80 countries.
\
Many of those who spoke during the opening session said state and provincial leaders want to tap private investment to generate jobs in the alternative-energy field while reducing emissions blamed for warming the planet.
\
Profiting from the emerging green economy remains a work in progress, especially with many countries still struggling to emerge from recession and a severe credit crisis that has hampered lending.
\
""It's time for us to recognize this is a significant economic challenge as well as an environmental challenge,"" said British Columbia Premier Gordon Campbell.
\
British Columbia has imposed a carbon tax that promises to lower the personal and corporate income taxes for residents and small businesses in the province. For example, money collected from taxing polluting companies means small businesses there will not pay any taxes on the first $500,000 of their income by 2012, Campbell said.
\
Michigan, which has been hit hard by the loss of manufacturing jobs, is aggressively pursuing green-tech companies. California is working with the federal government for what will be the largest solar and wind farms in the world.
\
These kinds of efforts can not only help the environment but bring jobs to places where governments act as partners with private companies, Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm said.
\
Granholm and three other Democratic governors -- Jim Doyle of Wisconsin, Ted Kulongoski of Oregon and Chris Gregoire of Washington -- are co-sponsors of the summit.
\
Tapping green investment is the underlying goal of a new organization Schwarzenegger and leaders from more than 20 countries are expected to announce at the summit on Tuesday, said Linda Adams, secretary of the California Environmental Protection Agency.
\
Named R20, the nonprofit organization incorporated in Geneva, Switzerland, is intended to match investors from the World Bank and private corporations with local governments in developing and industrialized countries to accelerate alternative-energy projects.
\
The idea that California, other states and leaders of provinces in such countries as Morocco and France are moving forward with their own nonprofit financing program gives hope to those in the environmental community who have been disappointed with the lack of an international treaty on climate change.
\
""Local governments and state leaders around the world are reacting to the tangible benefits of clean energy, economic development opportunities and the imminent threats they are facing, and realizing the problem doesn't have any borders,"" said Derek Walker, director of the California climate initiative at the Environmental Defense Fund.
\
One immediate action local governments can take would be to implement programs and policies to stem deforestation, actor and environmental advocate Harrison Ford said during the summit.
\
""Unlike many of the other climate solutions, tropical forest conservation is inexpensive and immediately available,"" said Ford, star of the ""Indiana Jones"" movies. ""But if we don't seize the opportunity now, we will lose this precious forest and we will lose the battle against climate change.""
\
Last December, countries participating in the United Nations climate talks in Denmark failed to agree on an international treaty that would have required them to cut greenhouse gas emissions.
\
They will meet again in two weeks to try to reach a global finance agreement that would give poor countries money to cope with the effects of rising temperatures and become more energy-efficient. The talks leading to that meeting, however, already have divided developing and wealthier nations over the issue of intellectual property rights.

Governors' Global Climate Summit 3, http://ces.ucdavis.edu/ggcs3/
"
132,"Grandma Moses said it best: ""There are no Vermonters in Heaven. No sir, once they get there and a get a look at the place they turn around and head back to Vermont."" Our state is truly a special place - we have our problems, but none that can't be solved when we work together. That's why I'm running for lieutenant governor, to find solutions to the issues that too many Vermonters are facing.\Economically we're falling behind. In 2010, there were roughly 359,000 people working in Vermont. Today, there are slightly less than 334,000. We've seen our population plateau, while our workforce shrinks and fewer of our young people choose to start their adult lives here. As our working population declines, the cost of state government becomes more and more of a burden on the rest of us.\In this same time, the cost of that burden has grown - significantly. Over the last six years, state spending has gone up nearly $700 million, helped by new taxes and fees. Property taxes have continued to rise while we educate fewer students every year. Gas taxes have gone up, fees at the DMV have gone up and as baby boomers begin to retire, Vermont continues to be one of the few states that taxes social security and full military pension benefits. And we wonder why so many of these Vermonters choose to spend just over half the year out of state.\As lieutenant governor, my focus will be on finding ways to improve our economy to help build a vibrant and prosperous future. I'll work with businesses, small and large, to help create an environment that is attractive to business, that fosters job growth and builds on the strengths of our economy.\As I did while serving as state auditor, I'll continue to look under the hood to see what state government does well and what it does poorly. My opponent feels that efficiencies and savings would be hard to find. I know better - and I know where to look. Every tax dollar we collect is important and should be serving the public good, and if it's not we should send it back to taxpayers.\I also don't believe more spending and higher taxes is the answer. My opponent's view couldn't be more different.\He's proposed raising income taxes on higher income Vermonters to help cover the increased costs of education, despite the risks from relying on a funding source that fluctuates greatly, likely leaving gaps that would have to be made up by additional taxes on everyone.\He wants to implement a carbon tax on everything from gasoline and diesel fuel to propane and home heating fuel. This policy would devastate rural Vermonters, some of whom travel great distances to work every day. It would leave our most vulnerable Vermonters out in the cold as winter heating costs would skyrocket.\And he wants to expand the sales tax to include services on everything from getting your oil changed, your driveway plowed and your haircut.\I don't believe Vermonters can afford these new taxes and I think after six years of Peter Shumlin's failed policies, doubling down on them would be a mistake.\I've spent the last year traveling around our great state listening to the voices of so many of you. From the mother in Danville who needs affordable childcare, to the returning veteran in Arlington looking for a new start; from the factory worker in Essex concerned about his company relocating, to the dairy farmer in Sheldon, wondering how to make the milk check stretch; from the family in Bennington still on hold with Vermont Health Connection, to the young woman in Castleton wondering how she'll pay off her student loans after graduation, Vermonters are counting on us to solve real problems for real people.\And that's what I'll work every day to do if given the honor of serving as your lieutenant governor.\Randy Brock, of Swanton, is the Republican candidate for lieutenant governor, a former state auditor and state senator."
133,"
There were some surprising numbers in the 45th annual Town Meeting Day Survey results released this week by state Sen. Bill Doyle, R-Montpelier.
\
Chief among them was that only 31 percent of respondents believe a carbon tax would benefit Vermont's environment (41 percent said it wouldn't) and that 65 percent of the 11,000 returns said the state should have a one-day sales tax holiday. And only 39 percent said Vermont should legalize marijuana, while 48 percent were opposed.
\
While Gov. Peter Shumlin's focus on cleaning up Lake Champlain got a boost - 69 percent said the lake was not as clear as they would like it to be - some of the numbers were brutal when it comes to the third-term Democrat.
\
Only 28 percent said Vermont's health care is better than it was five years ago, while 42 percent said it hadn't improved. Fifty-seven percent said they did not think Shumlin was doing a good job, while only 21 percent spoke favorably of his performance.
\
And 54 percent opposed a payroll tax - a Shumlin proposal - to help reduce Medicaid costs. On top of that, only 14 percent said Vermont was doing a good job in attracting jobs to the state.
\
The 88-year-old Doyle noted in a phone interview Wednesday that a tax on sugary drinks was also opposed by 48 percent of respondents, with 45 percent in favor.
\
""Obviously, it's not a year for taxes,"" Doyle said. ""I think the basic message is we really shouldn't be spending more money than we are taking in, and we're at a taxation limit to some degree.""
\
As often noted, the polling is not scientific, but Doyle's findings over the years on everything from public sentiment in favor of banning teens from using cellphones while driving to not extending the license for the Vermont Yankee nuclear plant have served as a harbinger for later political developments.
\
With the Vermont House on Wednesday voting in favor of a mandatory school consolidation bill, it's worth noting that 52 percent of Town Meeting respondents said Vermont has too many school districts, while just 26 percent said they were OK with the current number.
\
The poll also found New Hampshire has one less thing to worry about - only 28 percent of Vermonters in the Doyle poll said they thought Vermont's presidential primary should be on the same date as New Hampshire's.
\
Bill to Bank On
\
First-term state Sen. Jerry Little, the Weare Republican whose District 8 seat includes several towns in the Newport and Sunapee region, has helped steer an overhaul of the state's securities laws through the Senate.
\
A bill which would modernize New Hampshire's securities standards and practices by conforming them with the Uniform Securities Act passed the Senate last week and will be heard by the House Commerce Committee next week.
\
Little said current law in the state is ""confusing, complex and antiquated"" and makes it more difficult for Granite State high tech companies to raise money from financiers from outside the region.
\
""It's very, very dense language. It isn't something you would choose to read unless you were an attorney that was participating in this type of activity,"" said Little, a former head of the New Hampshire Bankers Association who now sits on the Finance, Energy and Natural Resource, and Fiscal committees.
\
Briefly Noted
\
--- A 1999 Lebanon High graduate who grew up in Meriden is playing a big role in the possible presidential campaign of former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina. The Associated Press earlier this week said Kerry Marsh, now the chairwoman of the Concord City Republican Committee, will be the New Hampshire director of Fiorina's political committee, Carly for America. Marsh was state director in 2012 for Texas Gov. Rick Perry's presidential campaign.
\
--- Enough with the ""draft Elizabeth Warren"" campaigns. The Massachusetts Democrat had this to say on NBC's Today show on Tuesday: ""No, I'm not running and I'm not going to run.""
\
--- Former Govs. Jeb Bush , of Florida, and George Pataki , of New York, brought in the big bucks in Grafton County Republicans' scarf and tie fundraising auction on eBay. Bush's blue silk Isaia tie collected $355, and a blue Ferragamo tie that Pataki wore at the 2004 Republican National Convention when he introduced then-President George W. Bush in New York fetched $350.
\
Grafton County Republican Chairman Bruce Perlo doesn't put much political significance into the sales prices, but said Jeb Bush, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who spoke at a Grafton GOP dinner last month, are generating the most buzz among Republicans in the country. ""There is a large component of very conservative people, and I think that Cruz excites them quite a bit,"" Perlo said.
\
For the record, a pink Donald J. Trump Signature Collection tie from you-know-who fetched only $142.

134,"
The groundbreaking ""Call for Action"" last month by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), followed by a warning that only an intensive worldwide effort can stave off potentially disastrous climatic changes, reflects the growing sense of desperation amongst the scientific community around humanity's continuing failure to take the requisite steps we must initiate if we are to avoid climate catastrophe.
\
Yes, there are hopeful pockets of action around the country and world: Transition and Resilience communities, the growth of solar and other sources of alternative energy, the development of community-based and regional food systems, as well as other mainly local initiatives. These are all absolutely necessary, not only to successfully adapt to the world of climate change that we have already entered, but also because they serve as the potential for the 100th monkey phenomenon to kick in, where seemingly modest efforts coalesce into a societal movement involving all of us.
\
But time is running out. As we've emphasized in recent columns, we are rapidly approaching the moment where human intervention will be too late, when climate change reaches tipping points and spins out of control. We need to act now, not only to continue with the local efforts amongst the minority choir, but to also create a will to act amongst the rest of us, the significant majority of our families, friends, neighbors, work and school mates who, unfortunately, have not felt the need to address this crisis as part of their daily lives. These larger numbers are absolutely critical to creating the grassroots political will imperative to countering the manic pursuit of the last drop in the ground by Big Oil and its political allies. This is a non-negotiable necessity. Failure to implement significant policies, like a carbon tax, only spells disaster, regardless of whatever else we do.
\
So how do we engage the unengaged? For one thing, we have to make climate change more of a presence in our daily lives. Right now, it's a subject that people prefer not to think about, to ignore. Much like death, itself, which climate change certainly evokes, we don't talk about it.
\
This conspiracy of silence has to cease. Climate change needs to be brought out into the open as the important fact of our present existence that it is, and will increasingly be. We need to acknowledge its reality out loud, publicly, talk with our family and friends, work and school mates about the melting of the Arctic ice, the acidification of the world's oceans, and the unprecedented droughts in California and Australia. We need to write letters to the editor and express our worries and concerns, our sense of impotence in the face of this unprecedented crisis, as well as our outrage with politics-as-usual.
\
We also need to sit down together as neighbors and begin discussing mutual aid and community-sufficiency, and what we need to do to take care of each other, and can start doing, right now.
\
We need to become activist citizens who come together to stop this crime against life -- against us, our children, and other living beings -- that the practice of profits before all else certainly is. From the divestment of fossil fuel stocks, to boycotting events, sports teams and media outlets sponsored by oil and gas companies, as Nobel Peace Prize laureate, Desmond Tutu, has called for, to non-violently direct action to stop fracking, tar sands pipelines, and new coal plants, we need to act as if our lives depended on it. Because they do.
\
At the same time we're being courageous, we also must be more imaginative and creative. We need to find a new language with which to communicate that truly engages by calling upon that which is best in us, especially around the sacredness of life. We must move our faith communities to be leaders of what is essentially a moral issue, and our local governments to engage in strategic planning for a crisis that can't be avoided
\
Interested parties are encouraged to join with Post Oil Solutions which has initiated a partnership with our area's arts community to collaborate around climate change. From painters and poets, musicians and singers, and actors and dancers, we're hoping to help create a rich and powerful expression about climate change.
\
And please join us at our 4th Tuesday of each month Climate Change Cafe at Brooks Library, which offers a welcoming environment for all who are concerned about this crisis. The Cafe features films, talks and presentations, and conversation about what we can do.
\
The next Cafe is tomorrow, Tuesday, May 27, 6 p.m. with the screening of the film, ""The Wisdom to Survive: Climate Change, Capitalism and Community,"" followed by a working session around specific things we can do to both adapt to, as well as mitigate climate change.
\
This won't be easy. Stopping big oil and adapting to climate change involves enormous change and sacrifice on our part, learning to live without our consumer-dominated society that is based on fossil fuels. There is also the inherent tension between go-it-alone American individualism and collaborative communities that our efforts to create resilient mutual aid neighborhoods will invariably bump up against. The same is true for our penchant for piecemeal silos vs comprehensive, strategic, and integrated, town and region-wide planning, a challenge that can afflict the otherwise admirable relocalization movement. Finally, we cannot resolve climate change and transition to a relatively sane society without at the same time creating the generous, compassionate, socially just society required.
\
Impossible? Of course. But only until we take the first steps. Which makes all the difference in the world.

\
In just over a month the 2013 legislature will convene, and a large question will as usual be ""where will we get the money to pay for all this?""
\
Administration Secretary Jeb Spaulding has tasked the agency secretaries to submit General Fund budget requests that maintain ""current services,"" and add on any new initiatives separately. Unlike, say, rebuilding the Champlain Bridge, General Fund expenditures just keep rolling on year after year, growing with more people, depreciated dollars, new political demands and governors thinking up new things to spend tax dollars on. Those agency requests are likely to produce a FY2014 ""budget gap"" of $50-70 million
\
Five years ago Senate President Peter Shumlin, already marching toward the governorship, repeatedly declared ""We are spending too much, and have used up our tax capacity There is no more money in the bank ... We are tapped out.""
\
Since that time Shumlin has nonetheless discovered all sorts of General Fund tax capacity, and proposed or enacted all sorts of new taxes. Here's a partial list: Higher taxes on hospitals, nursing homes, and visiting nurse services; tobacco; electric bills (Efficiency Vermont); health insurance claims; and the $21 million pilfered from the CVPS ratepayers to finance his favorite renewable energy subsidy programs, notably the Clean Energy Development Fund..
\
This list does not include the $27.5 million ""penalty tax"" on the Education Fund, because local voters failed to heed the governor's urging to restrain their school budgets. Nor does it include the two cent increase in both school property taxes, to raise the education money to compensate for the penalty tax.
\
Also urged by Senate President Shumlin, but rejected, were a new ""thermal efficiency"" heating fuel tax, a ""gas guzzler"" tax on SUVs and pickups, a tax on milk distributors, a novel ""unanticipated profits"" tax on Vermont Yankee, and a state cap-and-trade energy tax program.
\
So the tight fisted Senate leader of 2007 has since found lots more tax capacity, and numerous new ways to spend it, if he can get the bills passed by his hitherto largely compliant legislature.
\
There is plenty of pressure to accelerate General Fund spending. The entire Vermont labor movement and their many allies, chanting ""Put People First,"" are vocally demanding that state government spend lots more to meet ""every person's need for health, housing, dignified work, education, food, social security and healthy environment.""
\
This is clearly impossible, but Shumlin himself has committed to single payer Green Mountain Care in 2017. This will require $3 billion from somewhere, and his hoped-for new Federal funds will surely fall far short of that amount. He also knows well that Vermont's two state-managed retirement funds show an alarming $3 billion gap between promised benefits and expected revenues.
\
Reducing state spending, aside from completed Tropical Storm Irene repairs, is not an acceptable option for a liberal majority. So where can Governor ""No More Tax Capacity"" go to find the money to fuel all the state's obligations and his ambitions?
\
Raising income taxes ""on the rich"" is not a good bet. The Tax Foundation reported last month that Vermont in 2010 had the 13th highest state and local tax burden, a finding that the Shumlin administration concedes is pretty close to the truth. Taxing the incomes of people who make a lot of money is an obvious stimulus for them to make and spend it somewhere else. Also, Shumlin himself has boasted of reducing income tax rates in 1999 and 2009 (in both cases disproportionately benefiting high income taxpayers, although he never mentions that).
\
The short list of potential new taxes comes down to some form of carbon tax on fossil fuel energy (proposed by Shumlin in 2008), extending the sales and use tax to services (offered earlier this year by Speaker Shap Smith, who is now backing off), and a General Fund ""penalty tax"" of up to $276 million on the Education Fund, that translates into higher school property taxes. Green Mountain Care, if and when it happens, will almost certainly require stiff new payroll taxes, so that source can't be tapped now to meet other demands.
\
Of course the Shumlin administration, staring the facts in the face, could relieve a lot of people by telling them and the union red shirts that 2013 will be the year of ""Putting Solvency First."" That thought brings to mind that popular Buddy Holly song of 1958, ""That'll Be the Day .""

136,"MONTPELIER -- An issue that has divided the Legislature and the governor for months reared its head again Thursday as a panel pared its recommendations on climate change. The issue could soon be back on the governor's doorstep.\An offshoot of the Governor's Commission on Climate Change recommended Thursday that the commission consider creation of an energy-efficiency utility. The commission will in turn make recommendations to the governor by Sept. 4 on suggestions designed to cut Vermont's carbon emissions to virtually zero by 2028.\Most of the ideas -- from protecting Vermont's forests from development to offering priority parking to fuel-efficient cars -- went over with little dissent. The tenor of agreement hit a roadblock about halfway through the daylong meeting, when members came to an item that called for creation of an energy-efficiency utility that would offer incentives for Vermonters to make their homes and businesses use less heating fuel.\Just weeks ago, Gov. Jim Douglas vetoed a bill that would do just that, and the Legislature failed to override it. Thursday's meeting featured a new spat between some of the same players.\Public Service Commissioner David O'Brien argued that the utility had not been thoroughly vetted and would expand government services. Sen. Virginia Lyons, D-Chittenden, countered that the utility would not be implemented without thorough review and that it did not represent an expansion of government.\""It's about improving ways incentives and loans are given,"" Lyons said.\The 35-member panel was headed for a showdown when commission Chairman Ernie Pomerleau called for a lunch break. When the group came back, O'Brien had agreed to let the item pass with a caveat that became known as the ""O'Brien Doctrine."" The efficiency utility would be recommended, but like all other issues the panel was recommending, the cost must still be weighed.\""Rather than just pass on policies and mandates, they have to pass the litmus test of cost,"" Pomerleau said.\Lyons was satisfied. ""I think they supported the concept,"" she said of the panel.\Pomerleau said the commission can add or delete items from those the larger group recommended. He said he's intent on steering clear of politics while staying in line with the governor's philosophy. On the energy-efficiency utility, he said the group will look at the cost-effectiveness. ""We're going to get the numbers.""\The larger group recommended more than 30 items that would sharply reduce Vermont's carbon emissions by about 4 million metric tons by 2012 and 10 million metric tons by 2028. One item members veered away from was a carbon tax on carbon-producing energy sources. By a bare majority the group voted to recommend a pay-as-you-drive insurance plan that would decrease auto insurance costs for those who travel fewer miles and a surcharge on less fuel-efficient cars.\Along with carbon sequesterization, the items recommended would bring the state down to virtually zero emissions by 2028, said Ken Colburn of the Center for Climate Strategies, which is facilitating the commission's work.\Contact Terri Hallenbeck at 651-4887 or thallenb@bfp.burlingtonfreepress.com\BOX: CLIMATE PANEL\THURSDAY: The six-member Governor's Commission on Climate Change is being advised by a 35-member ""plenary group,"" which finalized its recommendations Thursday.\NEXT UP: The six-member commission will consider the larger group's recommendation and come to its own conclusions by Sept. 1.\PANEL: The commission members are: Chairman Ernie Pomerleau, president of Pomerleau Real Estate; Donald DeHayes, dean of the Rubenstein School of Environment and Natural Resources at the University of Vermont; Brian Searles, director of Burlington International Airport; Elizabeth Courtney, executive director of the Vermont Natural Resources Council; Theresa Alberghini DiPalma, senior vice president of Fletcher Allen Health Care; Parker Riehle, vice president of the Vermont Ski Areas Association.\INFORMATION: www.vtclimatechange.us"

Nature is the remedy for health ailments
\
Editor of the Reformer:
\
Society is witnessing an alarming growth in children's health concerns. We are seeing unprecedented levels of obesity, depression, anxiety, and learning disabilities. In searching for the cause, research increasingly points to the need for more time spent in nature. A clear connection is being seen between nature experience (or lack thereof) and the production of the stress hormone cortisol, and studies show that children who spend time outdoors are healthier, happier, more creative, have better concentration, and even get better grades.
\
The connection between people and the natural world is fundamental to human health and well-being. This is especially true for children. Unstructured free play in the out-of-doors brings them a host of benefits: cognitive (creativity, problem-solving, focus, self-discipline), social (cooperation, flexibility, self-awareness), and emotional (reduction in stress & aggression, increase in happiness). A local option emphasizing these benefits for children is the Coyote's Path Nature Awareness Program, held one Saturday a month in Putney.
\
Coyote's Path is founded upon addressing these many facets of children's health. It brings together skilled mentors, dynamic curriculum, beautiful environment, great peers, and healthy role models to foster the whole-person growth of each child. Stories recounted from Coyote's Path resound with personal integrity, relationship skills, problem-solving, and joy. For example, when faced with the challenge of a cold December day: ""Our activity for the morning was to create a 'winter village' with a nice roaring campfire and numerous tarp roofs to provide us some comfort from the biting cold and the snows to come. We all worked together to create this little village, and before long we had a huge fire to gather around and a great supply of wood to keep it burning brightly. We ate some snacks around the fire, and people's spirits headed toward delight: 'Hey, this is actually really fun to be out here, while everyone else is taking cover at home; it's kinda magical!'. By the end of our time together, all shared a feeling of real accomplishment at having spent an entire day outside, thriving and having fun adventures during one of the coldest days of the year!""
\
The take-away for children is huge. Upon parting for the summer: ""We gathered for a closing circle. We shared our stories, our highlights, our gratitudes, and we said our good-byes. There was lots of laughter and joy in the group as we parted ways - a tribe of sweaty, dirty, smiling, laughing, competent, courageous, and fully alive human beings who know the language of nature.""
\
Is there hope for our children? The answer is decisively ""Yes!"" By making the efforts as parents to get our children outside, we encourage their healthy development. Skilled mentoring further supports them by guiding them toward appropriate challenges and meaningful memories, a legacy they deserve.
\
The next program day for Coyote's Path is Dec. 6. For more information or to register, call 802-254-5800 or email info@ifnaturallearning.com.

Bronwen Jones, administrator, Institute for Natural Learning, Nov. 24A carbon tax makes sense for Vermont
\
Editor of the Reformer:
\
The carbon pollution tax initiative launched last week -- ""Energy Independent Vermont"" -- makes sense for our state. Destructive weather like Tropical Storm Irene and ""100-year floods'' that come every couple of years are becoming the new normal, and we can't afford to ignore this reality. We owe it to our children and grandchildren to tackle the source of this problem head on: pollution from fossil fuels.
\
It is outrageous that fossil fuel companies are allowed to dump pollution into our atmosphere for free, while sticking us with the clean-up bill after storms like Irene. This plan will make these companies pay their fair share for their pollution, while boosting clean energy and helping us get off fossil fuels altogether. And a great benefit of this proposal is that it will save us money. By making our public buildings more energy efficient, it will reduce property taxes, and by tightening up our homes, it will cut our fuel costs. Ninety percent of the pollution tax would be offset by tax cuts to individuals, businesses, and institutions, including rebates for low-income Vermonters, with 10 percent invested in energy efficiency.
\
The state has set ambitious energy and climate goals, and a carbon pollution tax is a realistic way to achieve them, using the power of the dollar. Putting a price on carbon is a powerful, market-driven mechanism for keeping more of our hard-earned dollars in the state. It is the single biggest thing we can do as Vermonters to build a clean, renewable, and affordable energy future.

\
Editor of the Reformer:
\
I am in complete agreement with a recent letter writer (""Missing the old look,"" Nov. 19). This is not the Reformer your readers have enjoyed for so many years. Change is good sometimes, if it's for the better. Your paper does not qualify. My guess is that very many of your readers will miss the old look we were accustomed to. Please consider making another change.

138,"Democrats in the U.S. House appear to be staying the course, opting on Wednesday to re-elect Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., as the House Democratic leader and Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., as the House Democratic whip, the number two position.\Both were in Congress when I was a wet-behind-the-ears Roll Call reporter in Washington almost 30 years ago. Ronald Reagan was still president. Pelosi is now 76, Hoyer 77. Do you think maybe some new thinking might be in order?\Yes, Hillary Clinton won some 2.3 million more votes than Donald Trump across the nation, but Republicans will hold key majorities in Congress and in a majority of statehouses across the country. Clearly, Democrats are doing something wrong.\Here are 10 ideas on how they could reboot for elections ahead:\1). Recognize that the most important issue for many swing-state voters was economic insecurity. The great recession and trade deals chased away their jobs, wages have been largely stagnant, pensions for private-sector workers are all but a thing of the past, and many families have health-insurance plans with high deductibles of more than $5,000 a year.\2). Stop being cozy with Wall Street and trial lawyers, and acknowledge that special-interest politics alienate many voters. Incoming Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who has long been tight with Wall Street, struck the right tone last month on Meet the Press when he said Democrats would be willing to work with Trump on getting rid of the so-called carried interest loophole, which lets hedge fund managers pay a lower tax rate on their earnings. And U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., showed the power of grassroots donations and the internet. Democrats can find a new source of donations — regular people.\3). Fight to protect Social Security and Medicare from any changes. With Trump’s pending nomination of U.S. Rep. Tom Price to be secretary of Health and Human Services, there is growing concern that Republicans will try to turn Medicare into a “premium support” program, aka vouchers. As the Kaiser Family Foundation has noted, this could “unravel the promise of a guaranteed set of benefits under Medicare.”\Middle-class families making $75,000 a year don’t have the ability to tuck enough money into their 401(k) program to save for a secure retirement while covering their health-care deductibles and dealing with college tuition. These parents — and there are tens of millions of them — need Social Security and Medicare benefits to stay as they are. \4). Keep a stiff spine on sensible gun control proposals. Gov. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., managed to defeat U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., while fully supporting the expansion of background checks.\5). Don’t play politics with abortion rights. Yes, Republicans in many statehouses and in Washington are trying to erode important protections for women, and those should be challenged. But absolutism is a loser. The Planned Parenthood Vermont Action Fund PAC spent $455,000 trying to tar Republican gubernatorial candidate Phil Scott in his race against Democrat Sue Minter. Scott supports abortion rights, but also parental notification. So do most voters. Scott won.\6). Climate change is real and science is important. But, by and large, concerns about the environment are not big winners at the ballot box. You have to win at politics before you can make environmental policy. Maybe things will change as millennials become a more important voting bloc. But for now, forget any talk of a carbon tax.\7). Democrats should also rethink their relationship with unions. They seem more closely aligned with teachers unions and other government-employee unions, as opposed to the trade unions who want to develop more infrastructure, including pipelines. Protecting Cadillac health-care plans for teachers may seem like the right thing to do, but it’s coming at the expense of other voters who no longer enjoy such benefits.\8). Stand up to members of your own party when they’re wrong. One reason Scott won in Vermont is that many voters were frustrated by a Democratic Legislature that didn’t challenge the health care failures of the Shumlin administration. As Pomfret Republican Scott Milne, who almost defeated Shumlin in 2014, has repeatedly said, lawmakers should be focused on fixing our problems, not on the next election.\9). Voters with jobs who often don’t qualify for subsidies under the Affordable Care Act only see their premiums or deductibles going up. Remind them of the crucial benefits that came with it, such as guaranteed coverage for pre-existing conditions, but also be prepared to work with Republicans on health care where possible. And consider whether tort reform, which many doctors have long sought, might actually have some merit.\10). Play the long game, as the GOP did in the past decade. Thanks to redistricting in 2012, Republicans have a comfortable hold on the New Hampshire Senate and the U.S. House. Democrats need to regain their balance, but they also need to get control of legislatures that will redraw political maps after the 2020 census. Common sense, and cartography, are both important in politics.\John Gregg can be reached at jgregg@vnews.com."

\
With snow gently falling as the holiday season winds down, I find myself reflecting on the New Year and what we might hope for. World peace of course, and solving the poverty conundrum would be great. But what about energy and the environment? Here are some thoughts.
\
We will finally put a value on carbon In mid-2012 the conservative American Enterprise Institute made headlines by sponsoring strategic meetings about the merits of a carbon tax. While not fully embracing the idea, AEI seems to be open to carbon taxes - generating ire among its conservative brethren. Also in 2012, former Republican Congressman Bob Inglis of South Carolina, launched an organization promoting carbon taxes, the Energy and Enterprise Initiative.
\
I have long favored some form of tax on carbon or non-renewable energy, rather than the more complex cap-and-trade approach that is being tried in a few places, most notably California. As Al Gore said in his 1992 book, ""Earth in the Balance,"" we should tax things we want to discourage, like resource consumption and waste generation, and not tax things we want to encourage, like earnings and savings. With elevated concern about climate change generated by Superstorm Sandy, perhaps 2013 will be the year to finally consider sensible ideas like carbon taxes.
\
More of us will recognize the connection between resilience and sustainability Following Superstorm Sandy some editorials appeared suggesting that New York City suffered more than it needed to because the focus had been on sustainability or green rather than resilience. I couldn't disagree more. I believe that the two are inextricably linked - or at least should be linked. Each benefits the other.
\
The Resilient Design Institute, the non-profit organization I created in mid-2012, will be working to strengthen this link between sustainability and resilience throughout 2013. I'm excited about that, as I believe that resilience can be the route to far greater buy-in to green building practices (along with sensible urban planning, ecosystem protection, and support for local food production). By the end of 2013 I'm hoping that resilience will be widely understood and increasingly embraced. Options will become available for low-interest, long-term loans to finance efficiency improvements The PACE (property-assessed clean energy) program, when rolled out in a few cities between 2008 and 2010, was touted as a key solution to allow more homeowners to affordably finance energy conservation retrofits and renewable energy installations. Loan payments in PACE programs were able to be paid back as part of a homeowner's property tax bill, and if the house was sold the loan would transfer with the house.
\
Unfortunately, concern about who's first in line for payment in the event of a default led to opposition to PACE financing by the loan agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Normally, property taxes are superior to debt obligations, and there was concern by lenders that PACE could enable home improvement loans owed to municipalities to be repaid before mortgage obligations to lending institutions.
\
As this issue is being worked out, residential PACE financing is not available in most places, though there are some exceptions. I'm hopeful that 2013 will see PACE financing - or something like it - become commonplace nationwide.
\
More utility companies will embrace solar power
\
Critics point out that photovoltaics (PVs) can't replace our conventional power generation options. Indeed, it can't do so alone, but it can be an increasingly important part of a longterm plan to move us toward a carbon-neutral society. Utility companies should look to Green Mountain Power, Vermont's largest utility company, for progressive policies to expand the implementation of solar.
\
Small-scale, distributed PV systems will play a key role in achieving Vermont's Comprehensive Energy Plan, which calls for a shift to 90-percent reliance on renewable energy sources by the year 2050. Utility companies will play a key role in getting us there.
\
Leaving the car at home will become cool
\
Of all the challenges we face in transitioning to a low-energy, low-carbon future, none will be harder than reducing our addiction to the gasoline-powered automobile. One solution to this dependence will be electric and plug-in-hybrid electric vehicles with distributed PV systems charging those car batteries. But we can also make tremendous strides by more actively embracing non-automobile transportation options.
\
Public transit needs to be a key part of this. Light rail is an option where population density justifies the huge investment. A far-less-costly system, bus rapid transit, was developed in Curitiba, Brazil in the early 1970s and allows low-cost buses to function more like light rail, with passengers quickly boarding from platforms at the floor level of the bus having pre-paid their fares.
\
Several cities in the U.S. are putting bus rapid transit systems into place.
\
In rural areas like much of Vermont, public transit can consist of smaller buses that travel the major routes on a regular schedule. Making these rural bus systems more viable may depend on increased frequency and employers helping to subsidize the cost.
\
Making our communities more accessible to pedestrians and bicyclists is also part of the answer. We need to implement traffic-calming measures and build bicycle paths and safer bike lanes on our streets. As improvements continue in 2013, for example, the new West River Trail that extends from the Marina Restaurant in Brattleboro to Rice Farm Road in Dummerston, will increasingly make sense for commuting. Maybe 2013 can put us on the path to a future that moves beyond the standard automobile.

\
When he received his party's nomination for president in 2008, Barack Obama stated that future generations would look back and say that ""This was the moment when the rise of oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal."" He pledged to make the United States a global leader in addressing climate change because, as he told another gathering, it is ""a security threat, an economic albatross, and a moral challenge of our time.""
\
The New Yorker's Ryan Lizza reported this past June, ""The President has said that the most important policy he could address in his second term is climate change, one of the few issues that he thinks could fundamentally improve the world decades from now.""
\
And yet, as we know, his actions (or, more accurately, inaction) thus far belie these fine words. Rather than helping to build a mandate for his second term around climate change, he was all but silent on the subject during the recent campaign. Though admitting that it wasn't a ""hoax,"" as his opponent claimed, he was nevertheless completely remiss in not presenting a major policy statement outlining his intentions for the next four years around, say, a carbon tax or building a green economy. Though the conventional wisdom had it that the subject was political poison, polls indicated that 70 percent of Americans not only acknowledge climate change, they also believe that it is human caused, and that we need to switch to lower-carbon emitting sources of energy to avoid certain catastrophe. These represented potential votes.
\
More revealing, perhaps, this is also the president who supports the Alberta tar sands, and arctic and offshore drilling. He has become the ""drill, baby, drill"" candidate that he ran against in 2008, seemingly oblivious to the potential disastrous consequences which were starkly outlined by Bill McKibben in his Aug. 2 Rolling Stone article ""Global Warming's Terrifying New Math.""
\
McKibben wrote that scientists and governments believe that any warming above a 2[degrees]C (3.6[degrees]F) rise would be unsafe. We have already raised the temperature 0.8[degrees]C, and computer models calculate that even if we stopped increasing CO2 levels today, the temperature would still rise another 0.8 degrees. In other words, no matter what we do, temperatures will still reach three-quarters of the way to the 2 degrees we must avoid. He went on to discuss how the fossil fuel industry is estimated to have five times more oil, coal, and gas in its known reserves than scientists think is safe to burn to keep the earth in livable shape. If all of this is burned, it would equal about 2,795 gigatons of CO2, or five times beyond the 565 gigatons scientists estimate that we can burn and still have some hope of staying below the 2 degrees threshold.
\
In short, and as graphically evidenced by the droughts and firestorms out West this summer, the Frankenstorm Sandy in the East this fall, and the unprecedented melting of Arctic ice that outstripped scientific computer models, we must seriously reduce the burning of fossil fuels - including leaving as much of it as possible in the ground - if we're to survive as a species.
\
So who do we have as our president? On the one hand, Mr.Obama did make Detroit agree to better gas mileage standards and directed $90 billion in clean energy investments during his first term, but on the other, he's yet to pursue measures, or assert a leadership, commensurate to the unprecedented crisis we face, as was sadly evidenced by his disappointing performance at the 2009 climate summit in Copenhagen.
\
Ultimately, the big question is how independent of Big Oil can Mr. Obama be? After all, to make a meaningful intervention into global warming and climate change entails greatly reducing our current extraction frenzy, and re-directing government subsidies and support away from Big Oil to alternative sources of energy. Not only would this have a negative impact upon Big Oil's record-breaking profits, it would adversely affect the significant investment these corporations have already made in technology and infrastructure to extract oil from the more challenging and expensive shale, tar sands, and deep water sources.
\
Such is the success of these efforts that earlier this month, the annual report of the International Energy Agency (IEA) stated that the United States would overtake Saudi Arabia as the world's leading oil producer by 2017 and will become a net oil exporter by 2030. Can President Obama stand up to such a juggernaut, even in the name of the rest of us 99.9 percent? Can he hear voices, like that of Michael Levi, senior fellow for energy and environment at the Council on Foreign Relations, who stated that ""The (IEA) report confirms that, given the current policies, we will blow past every safe target for emissions.""?
\
We should know which president we have in January when Mr. Obama delivers his second Inaugural Address and annual State of the Union message. It is difficult to exaggerate the importance of these two speeches. With only an 18 month window of opportunity to build a mandate before the 2014 Congressional midterms and 2016 presidential campaigns become major distractions, the president must sound the urgency of acting, right now, as he sets his agenda for the next four years. No longer having to concern himself with being re-elected, and with an eye on his historical legacy, this is a unique (albeit, fleeting) opportunity for the president to step forward and be the leader he has promised to be.
\
In short, will Obama put people above profits, and choose to be a climate president?

141,"
Following two of the most destructive years for climate catastrophes, President Obama is now calling for a ""wide-ranging"" conversation with scientists. Let's talk.
\
As climate scientists who've together spent decades studying how and why our climate is changing, we welcome that opportunity. ""Frankenstorm"" Sandy brought a message for you and all of us: climate change impacts are here now, right now.
\
Climate change clearly contributed to Hurricane Sandy, one of the most destructive superstorms in U.S. history. On the stretch of the Atlantic Coast where we call home, sea level is rising four times faster than the global average. Global warming is heating the Atlantic Ocean and increasing atmospheric water vapor loading, both of which contributed to Sandy's power and deluge.
\
Were Sandy just a single disaster, the story might end there. Unfortunately it is not. The insurance giant Munich Re reports annual weather-related loss events have quintupled in the United States, costing Americans more than a trillion dollars.
\
This year we have suffered through a string of record-breaking extreme weather events, all worsened by climate change. These included ""Summer in March,"" the hottest month in U.S. history (July 2012), the worst drought since the 1950s and a wildfire season that is rivaling the worst ever, a record set only six year ago. In 2011, the United States broke its record for the most billion-dollar weather disasters in a year: 14 totaling $47 billion. And this year's number of disasters puts it on track to be No. 2.
\
The last few years are part of a longer trend of climatic disruption that is impacting communities and the world here and now. Already, observations indicate that the ranges of more than a thousand species are shifting poleward and up mountainsides to escape the increasing heat; CO2-driven ocean acidification is starting to dissolve coral reefs; the number of regions experiencing drought have doubled since the 1970s; over the last 10 years, wildfires in the American West burned twice as much land area each year as they did just 40 years ago; twice as many new high temperature records have been set in the past decade compared to new record lows; and both the minimum area and minimum volume of Arctic sea ice each summer are well below their values of 30 years ago with new records set in 2012.
\
The danger of such large changes, accompanied by an increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather, loss of biodiversity, imperiled food systems, a 2-to-4-foot sea level rise, and myriad national security risks, will present enormous challenges to our nation's infrastructure and landscapes and to the well-being of people and communities around the globe.
\
An increasingly disruptive climate and a bankrupt nation could be the legacy we leave our children. According to projections presented to the U.S. Congress by Tufts University economist Frank Ackerman, inaction will cost our nation more than 1 percent of GDP by 2025 - more than $200 billion a year. And costs will skyrocket from there to an estimated $1.8 trillion a year by 2100.
\
The next four years - the second term of President Obama's administration - will be critical. Faith Birol, chief economist for the usually conservative International Energy Agency, has repeatedly said that real progress toward a low-carbon economy needs to start very soon to avoid warming of 6 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century. Patience and credence can no longer be given to those denying climate change. The delays that these so-called ""skeptics"" and vested fossil-fuel interests are causing in the face of convincing detection and attribution only increase the staggering costs of adaptation and relocation.
\
Having seen the devastating impacts of Sandy, at least a few leaders in Washington seem poised to acknowledge what scientific analyses have clearly shown: human activities are causing climate disruption. Whether encouraged and forced by regulations, product standards, a cap-and-trade policy, or a carbon tax (possibly with a proportional dividend to every American), we need a national policy to initiate the transition to a low-carbon economy.
\
Investing in energy efficiency and switching from use of coal, petroleum, and natural gas to primary reliance on renewable wind and solar energy is a change that we CAN make. Switching away from petroleum would also build independence from OPEC and fossil fuel cartels. According to Bloomberg Finance, the best wind farms in the world already produce power as economically as coal, gas and nuclear generators, and solar energy is proving a good investment in many states. Iowa now generates nearly 20 percent of its electricity from wind energy and Colorado and Oregon more than 10 percent.
\
Clean energy is the fastest-growing industry in the U.S. today, growing at a rate of 8.3 percent, creating vital American jobs despite the depressed economy and the fact that over the past century fossil fuels have received subsidies 75 times the size of those for renewables since the mid-1990s. We saw inspiring political leadership when Sandy struck. Now we need equally bold and visionary action that taps into the best in ingenuity and technology that our country has to offer. Encouraging both economic development and environmental well-being requires creation of a modern, clean energy system that protects both our nation and our environment. The scientific community is eager to engage in the conversation the President seeks, but we all must recognize that the conversation must turn quickly from talk to action.
\
This story can have an ending we can live with. It is up to us.

142,"What You’d Get With Trump\ \I’m no Hillary Clinton fan, but why in the world would anyone vote for Donald Trump? \Because he’s a friend of the American worker? Except when he doesn’t pay them for work or scams them (Trump University). Moneyed interests (e.g., Trump) love free trade, because U.S. workers must compete against billions of low-paid workers worldwide. No, he’ll continue to have his clothing line made in China and fill his hotels and golf courses with Chinese-made goods. \Because he’s a Christian? Does he strike you as being a compassionate man? Is he a role model for our children or for family values or for keeping the Commandments? Are the poor and vulnerable a high priority for him? Does he welcome the stranger/foreigner? Does he forgive those who offend him and meaningfully ask forgiveness when he has offended others? Or does Donald Trump worship himself, as false an idol as you could name? \Because he speaks truth to power? Can a serial liar do that? And what if he becomes the power? He’s a thin-skinned bully like his hero, Vladimir Putin. Give Trump the NSA data collected on all Americans, and he’ll silence truth-tellers. This is the man, after all, who says the Central Park Five are still guilty, even after DNA and the actual killer’s confession said otherwise.\Because he’ll make America great again? By being divisive? By appealing to the worst in us: racism, sexism, xenophobia, inciting violence? By creating a toxic, mean-spirited climate of insults and threats? And how seriously will we be taken on the world stage when our chief executive is a sexual predator and flim-flam man? \The Constitution, which all members of our three branches of government are sworn to uphold, is the single greatest document in human political history because it recognizes the corrupting influence of power. Donald Trump’s “leadership” style isn’t even remotely consistent with that document, but it’s a perfect match for fascism or a Third World dictatorship. \Allan MacDonald New London\ \Time for Change in Vermont\ \Vermonters have had to endure higher taxes, increased cost of living, a lack of good-paying jobs, higher housing rentals and a drug epidemic. We are looking at the government taking away our local control of schools. We experienced the waste of millions of our money with the completely impractical single-payer fiasco.\This is the year we should be drawing a line in the sand, saying enough! It is the year for a major change in Montpelier. The Democrats have an abysmal record, but keep asking for our vote and keep getting it. Name any professional that you keep going back to despite constant failures. If a doctor fails to make you better, you try a different one. If a mechanic can’t get your car to run properly, you take it elsewhere.\ So with our state becoming increasingly unaffordable, taxes going up every year with no attempt to stop it, and the inability to attract good-paying jobs, isn’t it time to try something different? \We have seen along with established taxes a new sugar tax — another way to grab more money from our pockets. Next up if they have their way is the carbon tax, a way to grab millions under the guise of saving our environment. We have some excellent choices for state Senate and state representatives with a mindset of fiscal responsibility, lower taxes and job growth. If you vote for a continued assault on affordability for Vermonters, then shame on you.\Keith Stern North Springfield, Vt.Help Needed With Christmas Dinner\ \ \For more than 30 years, volunteers from Lebanon and surrounding communities have worked together to make the Lebanon Christmas Day Dinner available for all.

When their demands are not met, they tend to blame others.\ Donald Trump is now using the conspiracy strategy to explain his possible defeat in this election. The conspirators include the press, the establishment, weak Republican leaders and on and on. His fact-lacking conclusion is that the election will be “rigged.”\Apparently immersed in a state of denial, he has failed to come to grips with the fact that his bullying behavior, his lies, lack of preparation, insensitive statements and arrogance are just some of the factors that have rigged this election against him.\It has led me to paraphrase a famous quote from the comic strip Pogo. He has found the enemy and it is him. Sadly, Mr. Trump doesn’t get it.\Porter Miller Orford More Recycling in Vermont\ \This is not about the election. I’m amazed that so many Vermonters know so little about battery and paint recycling programs. I’m somewhat embarrassed that those of us tasked with educating the public haven’t done a better job.

MONTPELIER The word ""structural"" has entered the lexicon in the pre-legislative rhetoric about the state's $100 million budget gap.
\
Gov. Peter Shumlin is fond of using the word, as are his fellow Democrats in the Legislature, perhaps because it's a way of soft-pedaling the restructuring of state government, lest they sound too much like Republicans.
\
Right-sizing state government is another euphemism Shumlin is using to sum up what will certainly be a painful budget-cutting exercise in the Legislature this session.
\
Budget-writers and legislative leaders are talking about making significant long-term changes to the way the state spends money in order to permanently close a $100 million gap in revenues and state expenditures in fiscal year 2016. The state has seen a $30 million to $75 million gap every year since 2010, and has filled the hole with one-time funds.
\
The reason? State spending is outstripping revenues. Expenditures have been increasing by 5 percent a year on average, while revenues have been increasing by about 3 percent since Gov. Peter Shumlin took office in 2010. Last year's total budget for all funds was $5.6 billion; the fiscal year 2010 budget was $4.6 billion.
\
This year is worse than usual, however, lawmakers and administration officials say. The gap is actually growing on a monthly basis because income tax receipts from wages are not keeping up with projections. This state of affairs began in April when income tax revenues were down by nearly $20 million. The only reason the state ended the year with a balanced budget was because of a $20 million estate tax windfall that otherwise would have gone to the Higher Education Trust Fund. In July, the state economists downgraded revenues by roughly $30 million.
\
Since then, the law of diminishing returns has continued to kick in. As of November, state revenues are down another $18.5 million, according to Jeb Spaulding, outgoing secretary of the Agency of Administration.
\
Since July, Spaulding has recommended $48.3 million in cuts this fiscal year - on top of next year's $100 million hole.
\
It's becoming more likely now that there will be a second downgrade in projections for state revenues again in January as the U.S. economy slows.
\
Shumlin insists that an increase in broad-based taxes, i.e. income and sales, is not an option. The Shumlin administration hopes to cut its way out of the hole.
\
Cutting $100 million is tantamount to cutting 25 percent of state government, according to Steve Klein, the executive director of the Joint Fiscal Office. That's because $988 million of the current $1.4 billion General Fund budget is untouchable. The state must pay debt service, contracted employee compensation, the General Fund transfer to the Education Fund and retirement obligations, for example. The rest of state government amounts to $432 million.
\
""It's a serious problem,"" Klein says. ""Cutting $100 million is not an easy thing to do.""
\
So expect to see some drastic changes to the budget next month. The elimination of a whole department, for example. Or the reconfiguration of the state workers contract. Or a reduction in Medicaid spending. It's possible the governor and the Legislature will consider a combination of all three.
\
Jim Reardon, commissioner of the Department of Finance and Management and the state's chief budget-writer, saw the crisis coming. ""I've told people 2016 was where the rubber hit the road,"" Reardon said. ""I've told people that for a long time and I'm absolutely right.""
\
Reardon says he will be presenting a balanced budget to lawmakers next month. His goal: To right-size the budget within available revenues.
\
Human services, which accounts for 40 percent of the budget, will come under the knife, but he says he's looking at everything outside of the Agency of Human Services, too. ""I'm not taking anything off the table,"" he says.
\
""I try to craft careful proposals,"" Reardon said. ""It's not just all about numbers, it's also about policies and services and programs. I don't just put on a visor and balance the books.""
\
Sen. Kevin Mullin, R-Rutland, wants to look at the possibility of cutting a whole program. ""What that is yet, I don't know,"" Mullin says.
\
""Rather than nickel and dime it, I think we should find something to eliminate and see if we could live without it,"" Mullin says. ""I don't think anyone can afford to pay more in taxes. The carbon tax proposal is dead, and any other tax proposal is dead.""
\
Medicaid funding and the Pay Act are at the top of Sen. Jane Kitchel's list of must-cut areas of the budget. Both areas of spending have been driving up annual budget increases, and it's time, she says, to look at the source the upward pressures on these large areas of spending.
\
The federal match rate for the $1 billion Medicaid budget has dropped, which means the state has to pick up more of the costs associated with subsidized health care.
\
One of the biggest areas of state spending is staff. Last year the Pay Act, the state contract with employees, resulted in a 4.5 percent hike in spending on state workers. Many employees get step increases in addition to cost of living increases.
\
""I think maybe this environment forces an examination of what are those base spending areas in state government,"" Kitchel says.
\
Rep. Mitzi Johnson, D-Grand Isle, vice chair of the House Appropriations Committee, agrees that the budget-writing committees will need to look at state employee contracts, even though in her opinion state workers are already spread too thin because demand for government services have increased.
\
""Me mentioning it isn't any kind of slam on state employees, it's just an acknowledgment that it's a place a very large amount of money is spent, and so we really need to look at it,"" Johnson said.
\
The long-term solution, in her view, is implementing results based assessments that would use data and other metrics to help the Legislature evaluate the effectiveness of state programs.
\
RBA, as it's called, could take time, however. And the state doesn't have the luxury of waiting.
\
House Speaker Shap Smith says the RBAs are a ""no-brainer,"" but could ""take a while.""
\
""It should be an expectation of government that we are spending money in areas where we get the best results and we insist that that's happening, but I agree with Kevin Mullin and Jane Kitchel that there may be things we no longer do,"" Smith said.

144,"
Monday, April 23 KEENE, N.H. -- Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn., celebrated Earth Day Sunday with a call for tighter controls on carbon emissions and a greater investment in alternative energy.
\
At the end of a four-day New Hampshire tour, the presidential candidate delivered a speech titled ""The New American Prosperity"" to a small crowd at the Historical Society of Cheshire County. The speech, which he rolled out in Washington, D.C., last Thursday, links energy policy with national security -- a theme of growing importance throughout the Democratic field.
\
""Our dependence on foreign oil and fossil fuels is one of our biggest problems -- a problem that impacts our health, our environment, our national security, our competitiveness,"" Dodd said. ""But breaking that dependence is our single greatest opportunity -- for a brighter, greener, healthier, more prosperous and secure future.""
\
Dodd proposed a plan designed to reduce greenhouse gases by 80 percent in the next 50 years, a goal he said was feasible with the right political leadership -- namely, his.
\
If elected, Dodd said he would increase car mileage standards to 50 miles per gallon and, through tax credits and rebates, make hybrid cars affordable for all. ""In a Dodd administration,"" he said, ""being wealthy will not be a prerequisite to being green.""
\
The senator called for a ""corporate carbon tax,"" which he said would ""eliminate the last incentive there is to pollute"" and generate more than $50 billion a year. That money would be invested in alternative energy research and finding new ways to dispose of nuclear waste.
\
""An America that taxes the big polluters will have less pollution, more innovation and more freedom. It's that simple,"" he said.
\
Dodd addressed nuclear energy head-on during a question-and-answer session following the speech.
\
""I will not take nuclear power off the table,"" he said. ""If we're going to deal with global warming, we're going to have to deal with the grid.""
\
When asked specifically about Vermont Yankee's license renewal following the event, Dodd said he could not comment on a specific plant, but argued that nuclear energy may be necessary to adequately deal with global warming.
\
""There aren't many options at this point,"" he said. ""There are issues, obviously, with waste. The French are doing some interesting things with nuclear. There are things developing all the time. We're better managing today than we were 15 years ago with waste, with these heavy dry casts.""
\
Dodd lives a mile from Connecticut Yankee -- the nation's oldest power plant, which is now being decomissioned -- and said he understands the issue well.
\
""If you're truly interested in reducing, as we should, the use of fossil fuels and nonrenewable sources of energy, then you've got to have that option on the table at least for consideration. And I don't retreat at all from serious problems with waste and transportation.""
\
Throughout the speech Dodd argued that dependence on Middle Eastern oil posed a grave threat to national security.
\
""We are fighting terrorist organizations with one hand and financing their supporters with the other to the tune of $300 billion a year,"" he said.
\
As president, Dodd would host an ""international global warming summit"" that would go above and beyond the Kyoto Protocol, he said. Using research and technology as a tool of diplomacy, he said he would encourage the global community to pool its resources and innovation.
\
""By insisting upon sharing the same renewable energy technologies that will make America energy independent, never again will nations be dependent on oil bribes from Iran's Ahmadinejad and Venezuela's Chavez,"" he said.
\
Though Dodd spent much of the event on energy policy, he touched on several other key issues, interrupting himself at the start of his speech to praise New Hampshire's move toward allowing civil unions. ""I just want to congratulate members of the New Hampshire Legislature and Gov. John Lynch,"" he said. ""It's a proud moment for the state. It's shown real leadership in the country.""
\
Lynch announced last week he would sign a bill legalizing civil unions for gay couples. The bill is expected to be approved by the state Senate this week.
\
Dodd said he would bring fiscal responsibility to the White House while increasing the federal government's contribution toward education.
\
""In the 21st century, we can't let anyone slip through the cracks,"" he said.
\
He also called for an end to the Iraq war -- pointing out that he is the only presidential candidate to publicly support a Senate bill that would withdraw most American troops from the country by March 2008. He argued that a military solution was unreachable without political reconciliation, which he said was far from happening.
\
""The Iraqi people are not coming together as they've had the opportunity to do so,"" he said. ""The Iraqis need to know that our patience has run out on this.""
\
Dodd, who voted for the resolution permitting the use of force in Iraq, accused the Bush administration of presenting false reasons for going to war and for ""cooking the books."" He said America would never be in Iraq were it not for the country's tremendous oil reserves.
\
""If Iraq was producing turnips, we wouldn't still be in that place,"" he said.
\
Though Dodd is trailing in early polls and first quarter fundraising reports, he sounded optimistic about his chances in the New Hampshire primary, and he even launched a subtle dig at his two chief opponents -- Sen. Hillary Clinton, D-NY, and Sen. Barack Obama, D-Illinois.
\
""In 2008 some people say we need experience and others say we need hope. I say we need both,"" he said.

145,"
BRATTLEBORO Rep. Mollie Burke, P/D, knows about money challenges.
\
Introduced to her position as state representative in January 2009 right after the financial crisis of 2008, her first legislative session began with a big budget gap. While not on the House Appropriations Committee, she's very aware of the struggles that exist today.
\
""We have a lot of need,"" Burke said. ""The Legislature has been involved in this results-based accountability, looking at things like getting the results you want for the money you're spending. I think that's starting to permeate state government and how do we target our dollars so they're most effective and retain a sense of compassion for the least fortunate and provide enough economic incentive for people who want to get ahead.""
\
Burke has served as a state representative for Brattleboro for eight years. She's running again, she said, after enjoying the opportunity and privilege of the service.
\
In Brattleboro, every cent on the property tax rate is important. Burke pointed out the schools seeing about 60 percent of its kids being eligible for free or reduced lunch. She translates this to challenges at home, where parents are ""stressed in many ways.""
\
Making pre-k education mandatory in Vermont has presented challenges, said Burke, but it's an attempt to take pressure off the elementary schools.
\
Burke noted the disparity of wealth in the United States, saying she thinks it's creating a lot of problems. Even people who are working still need state services as they are not earning enough money or a living wage, she said. She has supported raising the minimum wage, which was accomplished a couple years ago, and paid sick days so parents can take care of their kids if they're sick. The latter was approved this year.
\
As a member of the Transportation Committee, Burke has looked at the effects of transportation on the environment as residents move away from using their own vehicles and depend more on public transit. She requested to be on the committee due to her interest in cutting carbon emissions.
\
""Our infrastructure in general in this country gets a C grade from the civil engineers,"" Burke said. ""But I think Vermont has done a good job maintaining its infrastructure in a safe way. There's a whole prioritization system. It's very transparent.""
\
As the state looks at ways to cut down on greenhouse emissions, one of the goals is to transition to 90 percent renewable energy by 2050. Burke said she sees a lot of interest in electric vehicles but the infrastructure isn't there to support it.
\
Another aspect of Burke's work focuses on making safer streets for pedestrians, bicyclists and the aging population. Four pedestrian fatalities in Brattleboro in 2013 caused some concern and a group called Safe Streets Collaborative formed in the wake. A forum at the River Garden in downtown Brattleboro will be held on the subject on Thursday from 5 to 7:30 p.m.
\
Four deaths of bicyclists in Vermont last year involved drunken or impaired driving, said Burke, who has cited this as an issue as conversations toward legalization of recreational marijuana moved forward at the Statehouse.
\
A carbon tax, which Burke said is ""pretty controversial,"" could cut taxes in other areas. She pointed to a successful implementation of one in British Columbia. She is supportive of the tax but only if it's ""economically feasible,"" meaning it won't put heavy taxes on people and fall disproportionately on lower-income power.
\
""I think that's going to be coming along in subsequent legislative sessions. There's been some bills that didn't go anywhere,"" Burke said. ""Often things need to be introduced as an idea and they sort of percolate there for awhile. Then the idea becomes more feasible. I think that's true for a number of things that happened.""
\
Take for instance Act 46, the education law that has school districts across the state scrambling to merge. Legislators starting forming ideas around addressing property taxes and student equity several years before the law was enacted.
\
At first, Burke was opposed to Act 46. But now, she said hopes it will do what it was intended to do.
\
""Change is really hard and changing the educational system is really hard,"" she said. ""Education funding has been a persistent issue in Vermont and there's the whole issue of local control versus state control. I'm sort of waiting to see what that's going to look like.""
\
She wonders if there's a better way to handle income sensitivity available to residents paying property taxes.
\
Currently, households bringing in up to $97,000 a year will have some portion of their bill subsidized by the state. New efforts are underway to make it beneficial for families to earn more than that.
\
""Instead of a cliff, there would be a leveling off,"" said Burke. ""The Legislature is constantly looking at ways to try and create a fair system of property taxes.""
\
Burke's interested in economic development, supporting the state's Working Lands program. A fund provides grants to groups or people hoping not only to conserve but keep farming or forestry ongoing on property. She's also happy with the Vermont Council on Rural Development, which is holding conferences on the climate economy. She said a lot of opportunities exist in moving to a non-carbon economy.
\
As co-chair of the women's caucus, Burke is looking at closing the wage gap between men in women.
\
""In general, women earn 83 percent of what men make,"" she said, calling it a rough figure. ""If that wage gap were closed, we could be contributing a lot more money to the Vermont economy.""
\
Also, Burke said there were a couple bills aimed at saving money while having better outcomes for incarcerated women. She worries not about violent offenders but those who are put back in prison after a small violation or technical issue.
\
Burke, a Brattleboro resident for 45 years, said the town has been ""very good"" to her and her family.
\
""It's a great town to raise children. My three children went to the public schools and got a great education. There are lots of opportunities,"" said Burke, who now has three grandchildren in the schools and says ""it's neat seeing them take advantage of what Brattleboro has to offer.""
\
Burke taught art at various schools, most recently at Hilltop Montessori School in Brattleboro, and ice skating at the local rink. On the ice is where she met a lot of people in town. That's what gave her ""the knowledge or sense of fabric of the town,"" she said.
\
School budget challenges in 1990 prompted Burke to run and win a Town Meeting Representative seat. The position enabled her to vote on articles and budgets at annual Representative Town Meeting.
\
""This was at a time when it was contested,"" she said. ""I really liked Town Meeting. It was sort of like a mini Legislature.""
\
Burke is currently running a nonprofit called Art in the Neighborhood. Free classes are offered to kids in low-incoming housing communities.
\
Burke is urging residents to vote in the primary on Aug. 9. She said it can be a challenge time because a lot of people tend to go on vacation then. Early or absentee-ballot voting can be done 45 days

146,"Dangerous Ideas on Education in N.H.\I read with disgust the views of candidates Margaret Drye, her daughter Virginia Drye and Tanya McIntire on education funding (“Sullivan County Split On Education,” Oct. 21). Using their logic, I should not have paid any school taxes in Claremont for the last 20 years because I didn’t have, and never had, any children attending any school.\As for these three candidates, they just want to avoid some or all of their property taxes so they can divert public funds to their own use. These schemes, along with those seeking to divert public funds to religious schools, should remind readers that in 1993 the New Hampshire Supreme Court affirmed that students are guaranteed a right to a public education. Twenty-five years later, the equalization of taxes for cities like Claremont and towns like Plainfield and Grantham is not resolved.\This assault on public schools, and attempts to divert funding to religious institutions, is a blatant attack on the U.S. Constitution itself. In the words of Jefferson, the First Amendment clause against establishment of religion by law was intended to erect “a wall of separation between Church and State.”\The extraordinary assault on women’s rights, human rights and individual rights by the current resident of the White House and his lackeys in Congress has been buttressed by the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation. The tentacles reach from Washington, D.C., to places like Plainfield, Grantham and Claremont. The shining city on the hill, “still a beacon, still a magnet for all who must have freedom,” is now building a wall to keep people out. We read about the president’s family attempting to sell visas to wealthy Chinese and the president’s real estate holdings reaping windfall profits from foreign dignitaries. \What does this have to do with education funding? Everything. Politics is local. The same dangerous ideas coming out of Washington have taken root in our backyards. We have a choice on Nov. 6: water the tree or kill the roots. Voting to oppose the Dryes and McIntire is a giant step.\Harvey Tabasky ClaremontCryans for Executive Council\ \I confess. I had no idea what the Executive Council does, how important it is, and that Executive Council District 1 covers territory from New London to the Canadian border.\Did you know the Executive Council:\ Has approval power over all state contracts with a value of $25,000 or more (and personal service agreements over $10,000)?\ Must approve receipts and expenditures of state and federal funds and transfers by state departments?\ Confirms all District, Superior Court and Supreme Court judges? \ Reviews and approves spending of $5.2 billion the Legislature appropriates annually? \ Must approve more than 300 gubernatorial appointments, including commissioners and other state employees? \ Hears all pardon requests? \ Oversees the 10-year highway plan?\The Executive Council is designed to provide checks and balances to the governor’s power and ensure no conflicts of interest. I believe in checks on government power. I won’t vote for an executive councilor to rubber-stamp the governor, like District 1’s current executive councilor, Joe Kenney. I looked at Kenney’s record. He did whatever the governor asked. No independent thinking or analysis.\So I looked at his opponent, Mike Cryans, of Hanover. With wide experience in the public, private and nonprofit sectors, Cryans is independent-minded, understands budgets and is geeky enough to read those hundreds of contracts and study the resumes of all those appointees. He understands the state and our area.\Now I know how important executive councilors are. I want someone who will do the job well. I’m voting for Mike Cryans for Executive Council in District 1.\Kim Rosenfield New LondonHallquist Better for the Job\ \The Charge of the Light Brigade is a good rehearsal for any candidate running against a first-term Vermont governor.\Gov. Phil Scott is going to have the massed batteries of public inertia to stop Democratic aspirant Christine Hallquist. It’s just the way we are: “Give the governor two more years to show the right stuff, then we’ll pass judgment.”\However, Hallquist is the better person for the job. She never inherited her father’s business; she had to work her way up the management ladder until she was able to prove herself CEO material — which she did handsomely by bringing a near-bankrupt utility to a top rating by Standard & Poor’s in only eight years, and having it commended by the U.S. government as one of the most innovative in the country. \As CEO, she ordered no pay increases for management until the workers get pay increases. She had learned the importance of employees and she values the role of unions. Vermont needs a worker-friendly governor. She also believes in health care coverage for Vermonters that stays with them even when their jobs vanish, and that does not force them to choose between family meals and medical care. \I urge all to resist the malaise of inertia and vote for Christine Hallquist.\Chuck GregorySpringfield, Vt.Christensen Has Worked Diligently\ \Rep. Annmarie Christensen has worked diligently to represent the citizens of Cavendish in Montpelier for the last two years. She listens to her constituents, stays informed about issues facing the town and works with the town manager and others for the benefit of residents. Among the actions she has taken: facilitating the introduction of Native American ceremonies (by a Cavendish resident) in correctional facilities in Springfield and St. Johnsbury; working to get Route 131 potholes patched (hopefully before winter); working with local groups to bring reliable, affordable internet access to our communities; and facilitating the proclamation honoring the 100th birthday of former Cavendish resident Alexander Solzhenitsyn.\We urge all residents to vote on Nov. 6. We support Annmarie Christensen’s return to Montpelier for another term representing Cavendish and Weathersfield.\Alan and Wendy RegierProctorsvilleO’Brien Stronger on Climate Change\ \As we approach an important local election here in Royalton and Tunbridge, I am struck by the dearth of public appearances by both candidates for the Vermont House, David Ainsworth and John O’Brien. \Ainsworth is certainly well ahead in the head-to-head signage division in both towns, though many careful readers of his “Burma Shave”-style signs could be turned off by cynical references to “socialism,” a $200 million tax surplus and a revival of the 2016 bogeyman: the carbon tax. Unfortunately, factually challenged political negativity has crept into rural Vermont.\One issue that all constituents, regardless of party affiliation, can agree on is the importance of protecting and sustaining the environmental health of our communities, the state, the nation and the planet. Scientific data, severe weather events, changing agricultural conditions and a wealth of anecdotal observations all point to rapid climate change being a true threat to life as we know it. Further delay in taking positive actions to change this dangerous climactic course is short-sighted and does a real disservice to the health and welfare of future living creatures.\Political leaders will continue to debate, or ignore, the consequences and reality of climate change. The time for action is now for citizens, businesses and governments. I believe that John O’Brien is more strongly committed to help effect positive change on the issue of climate change and the environment than his opponent.\To learn more about where both of these candidates stand on climate change and many other issues, attend their debate at the White River Valley High School in South Royalton on Monday. The doors open at 6 p.m. and the debate starts at 6:30.\Todd TysonTunbridge"
147,"VtDigger\MONTPELIER — When lawmakers reconvene in Montpelier this week, they will pick up where they left off after a hasty, frenzied adjournment last spring.\ \In May, the Democratically controlled House and Senate struggled to reach consensus on the party’s two major economic priorities — increasing the minimum wage and establishing a statewide paid family leave program.\ \They failed to send either proposal to the governor’s desk and departed the Statehouse leaving these bills, and other major debates, on the table for 2020. \This year, Democrats are teed up to resume the years-long debate about establishing a legal market for marijuana, have gathered momentum to pass climate action bills aimed at cutting carbon emissions and are poised to curb vaping use.\ \ \With many of their biggest priorities, Democrats are on course to clash with Republican Gov. Phil Scott, who opposes legislation he believes will raise the cost of living in the state.\ \Here is a rundown of everything you need to know about Vermont’s 2020 legislative session, which begins Tuesday.\ \Minimum wage and paid family leave\While Democrats couldn’t reach a compromise on these bills in 2019, House Speaker Mitzi Johnson, D-South Hero, and Senate President Pro Tem Tim Ashe, D/P-Chittenden, say they have a plan to swiftly send them to the governor’s desk in 2020.\ \Last year, while House leaders favored a more robust paid leave program and a moderate minimum wage increase, senators had wanted a $15 per hour wage by 2024 and a less expensive paid leave policy.\The leaders of the House and Senate say they have settled on moving forward a bill that would raise the minimum wage to somewhere between $12 and $13 in the next two years.\ \They also have tentatively agreed to a paid family leave package that is scaled back from the House’s version and would be funded by a $29 million payroll tax. \The House version was funded by an $80 million payroll tax.\ \But to win House approval, the Senate has agreed to put in a provision that gives employees the option to pay for additional insurance to take time off for personal injuries — a benefit senators had stripped from the bill. \Legal marijuana market in limbo\Legislation to legalize marijuana sales stalled in the House last year, and its fate remains uncertain.\ \While there is widespread support in the legislative body to pass the measure, the leader of the lower chamber has been resistant to creating a legal marketplace for the drug.\ \But Johnson said the bill will see a vote this year if it has the support to pass the House and legislators address concerns she and others have about the impacts a legal marijuana market could have on road safety, youth drug usage and the environment. \Climate change measures\Democrats and Progressives in the Statehouse have united behind two major climate initiatives they plan to move forward.\ \One, the “Transportation Climate Initiative,” would authorize Vermont to take part in a regional push to charge companies for bringing fossil fuels into the state. Governments would then use the funds to invest in carbon cutting measures.\ \The other legislation known as the “Global Warming Solutions Act,” would require Vermont to reduce its carbon emissions by about 25% by 2025. \ \The governor has signaled he would likely oppose both measures. Republicans have called Transportation Climate Initiative a “carbon tax” because it could increase fuel prices by as much as 20 cents per gallon.\ \Prison reform\After Seven Days published an investigation last month detailing allegations of sexual abuse and harassment and widespread drug use by guards inside Vermont’s women’s prison, legislative leaders pledged to take on prison reforms this year.\ \Johnson said that the House Institutions Committee will review the situation at the state’s only prison for women, the Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility, during the first week of the session, and will determine the “systemic changes” that can be made with a “legislative fix.”\Ashe has said the Senate will look to change protocols “for the handling of high-level accusations of staff misconduct” in the correctional system, and will reexamine the state’s requirements and training for corrections officers.\ \Flavored vapes could go up in smoke\Senate Health and Welfare Committee Chair Ginny Lyons, D-Chittenden, will propose a bill to ban flavored e-cigarette and tobacco products — including menthol cigarettes.\The House and Scott have signaled they would support banning flavored vaping products. The Trump Administration announced Jan. 2 that it would forbid the sale of most flavored e-cigarette capsules. Menthol products, however, were exempt from Trump’s ban.\ \Gun control on the table\Sen. Phil Baruth, D/P-Chittenden, plans to introduce legislation that would prevent people from carrying semi-automatic weapons in some public areas including parks, stores, restaurants, airports, places of worship, auditoriums, theaters, childcare facilities, and during political demonstrations. Senate leaders, including Ashe, have signaled they are willing to consider the bill.\ \The proposal will come months after Scott vetoed a bill that would have established a 24-hour waiting period for handgun purchases.\ \Democrats in the House do not have the numbers to revive the vetoed legislation, but they will look to reintroduce a provision that would close what is known as the “Charleston loophole,” which allows those seeking to purchase firearms to receive certain weapons before their background checks are completed.\ \Scott has signaled he would support a measure to address this practice.\Challenge on medical monitoring\Democratic lawmakers plan to override the governor’s veto of legislation that would give individuals the right to sue companies for the cost of monitoring health issues caused by toxic pollution.\ \Scott struck down the bill in June over concerns that it could place an undue burden on the state’s business community by increasing legal exposure and ramping up insurance costs.\ \When the Senate voted on the measure last year, it passed 19-11, meaning Ashe would need to flip one vote to successfully reverse the veto. In the House, the bill passed with 100 votes — exactly enough to override the governor.\ \Ashe said he hopes to hold an override vote early in the session.\ \Rethinking Act 250\In 2018, a commission tasked with studying Vermont’s 50-year-old land use law released a report recommending lawmakers change the policy to promote development in downtown areas, protect forest blocks and further restrict development on mountain ridgelines.\ \House lawmakers took time to review the commission’s report and were mulling possible changes to Act 250 in 2019. But they plan on actually moving forward with reforms to modernize the law this year.\ \Under the radar\A push to decriminalize possession of the widely used opioid treatment drug, buprenorphine, didn’t move out of committee last session, but will be back on the table in 2020.\ \The Senate will once again take up a constitutional amendment to extend gubernatorial terms from two to four years, a measure that likely will pass both chambers.\Senate Democrats will look to continue the conversation on a housing bond worth about $38 million. \Last year, opponents, including Treasurer Beth Pearce, raised concerns about adding to the state’s debt for a housing measure.\CREDIT: By XANDER LANDEN; KIT NORTON "
148,"Scientists have spoken on global warming, but the window of opportunity for action is closing fast, and it will take a mass political movement -- something like the civil rights movement -- to avert catastrophe.\So said author and environmental activist Bill McKibben in a talk at Champlain College on Monday afternoon. The difference with the civil rights movement, he said, was that leaders of that knew they would eventually win. By contrast, there's no assurance that the movement to avert disastrous climate change will prevail.\Only a few years remain to make a difference, he said. He pointed to some positive signs: The national awareness of the problem is rising, and the ""Step it Up"" campaign, which generated more than 1,000 demonstrations across the country last year, set a useful precedent.\The necessary changes are huge, but they have to be made rapidly, he said.\""We have to stop building coal-fired power plants. We have to phase out coal over the next 20 years, not develop oil from shale and tar sands,"" he said. That's just for starters.\When asked for one thing an individual could do, he replied: ""Politically organize.""\McKibben's remarks were Champlain College's keynote to ""Focus the Nation,"" a week of activities on campuses across the country designed to take on the challenge of climate change.\The University of Vermont kicked off its program with a panel discussion of carbon trading -- an enterprise that some in the environmental movement see as an answer to the question of how to rein in greenhouse gas emissions.\Introducing the panel, forestry specialist William Keeton of UVM's Rubenstein School of Environment and Natural Resources cautioned the audience of about 60 that carbon trading ""is not a silver bullet"" in addressing climate change. That proved to be the understatement of the morning, as some panelists disputed that existing carbon-trading patterns have any climate-change-reducing effects at all.\The discussion covered carbon trading primarily in two forms: a regulated ""cap-and-trade"" system, a version of which has been implemented in industrialized Europe; and a voluntary, largely unregulated market, growing rapidly in the United States, in which carbon-dioxide emitters can buy offset credits in the form of investments in projects that absorb carbon dioxide (such as a new forest in Brazil) or that displace fossil fuels as an energy source (such as wind turbines in South Dakota).\The larger, global issue is how -- and how fast -- to reduce the human-produced emissions of greenhouse gases (principally carbon dioxide, a byproduct of burning fossil fuels such as oil and coal) that most scientists agree have a heat-trapping, or global warming effect when they continue building up in the atmosphere. One commonly cited goal is to reduce emissions 80 percent by 2050. The sense of urgency grows, and Keeton quoted NASA scientist Jim Hansen as putting the tipping point less than 10 years away.\The remedies won't come cheap, said Keeton's Rubinstein colleague, Cecilia Danks. Substantially cutting emissions will impose a substantial cost, she said, but that cost in the United States is unlikely to come via a carbon tax, which is widely seen as politically unfeasible.\An easier political sell would be a cap-and-trade system, which several panelists agreed is likely to be set up in the United States before long. Under such a system, major emitters -- power plants, for example, are assigned emission ceilings, or caps. If they want to exceed the caps, they have to buy credits to compensate. The caps, which would diminish gradually over years, would be determined in keeping with a national goal of emissions reductions.\Two panelists from the United Kingdom took sharp issue with both forms of carbon trading.\The problem with the cap-and-trade system in Europe, said Larry Lohmann of The Corner House, an environmental advocacy group, is that it hasn't worked. Major polluters have used their political clout to get their caps raised, he said, and they've been able to exceed their limits by buying offset credits of dubious environmental value. An example of the latter might be a hydroelectric project in India that inundates traditional, low-emitting farming communities and is then counted as an offset for pollution in an industrialized country.\An offset is just what it sounds like, Jutta Kill of the United Kingdom's SinkWatch reminded the audience: It's compensatory, but it does nothing to reduce overall emissions. More likely, she said, it can be used as an excuse for someone to produce even more emissions.\Much more effective, she said, would be to stop subsidizing fossil-fuel industries and shift that money to renewable and decentralized energy projects.\Another panelist, Secretary of Natural Resources George Crombie, suggested that the efficacy of a carbon-trading system ""is only as good as its design.""\One of the few upbeat thoughts came from UVM economist Josh Farley, toward the end. He pointed out that the country could cut its energy use and its emissions by a third and still leave people with the same living standard that Americans enjoyed in 1969, when the poverty rate was even lower than today.\Contact Tim Johnson at 660-1808 or tjohnson@bfp.burlingtonfreepress.com\BOX: Warming week events\The main events\A Web cast Wednesday night intended as a springboard to teach-ins to be held Thursday and Friday at campuses across the country.\The live, interactive Web cast, ""The 2 Percent Solution,"" takes place starting at 7:45 p.m. The sites of the Web cast include: Champlain College, Hauke Family Center; Johnson State College, Bentley 207; University of Vermont, Davis Center's Livak Ballroom.\Champlain College\TODAY: Voter registration drive and sustainability expo, 4-6:30 p.m. in Fireside Lounge of IDX Student Life Center.\Film ""Escape from Suburbia"" shown at 8:30 p.m., Alumni Auditorium.\THURSDAY: College goes car-free.

149,"Valley News Staff Writer\Fairlee — Environmental action and prominent figures from the Green Mountain State galvanized attendees at the Vermont Energy and Climate Action Network’s Community Energy & Climate Action Conference, pushing Saturday’s event to its highest attendance yet after 11 years.\But the biggest name on the slate, keynote speaker and 350.org founder and author Bill McKibben, did his part to jokingly tamp down the excitement after an impassioned introduction by to VECAN’s Johanna Miller.\“My old friend (Miller) is short and enthusiastic, and I’m tall and depressive,” said McKibben, of Ripton, Vt. “My job is to dig the hole from which you then have to climb out of.”\McKibben’s sobering tone was typical of the calls to action heard on Saturday morning at the Lake Morey Resort event, which included presentations from a trio of Upper Valley natives in addition to McKibben — Jared Duval and Sarah Wolfe of the Montpelier-based Energy Action Network and Burlington Mayor Miro Weinberger — to kick off a daylong series of workshops centered on reaching clean energy targets.\But the dire climate forecasts didn’t deter enthusiasm for the cause. At $50 per ticket, the seminar drew more than 300 individuals, according to VECAN​​​’s Johanna Miller, nearly 280 of whom had preregistered. That’s an all-time high for the conference, which has been held at Lake Morey for the last several years.\“It shows that support for these causes has never been stronger,” said Miller, VECAN’s energy and climate action program coordinator, after the opening presentations. “So many people across the state are in this fight to take the planet back and make progress on doing the right thing.” \During her opening remarks, Miller called Vermont’s population of 620,000 people “essentially a small city” that nonetheless is home to some of the country’s biggest champions of climate change action, many of whom were packed into the resort’s Terrace Ballroom on Saturday.\And those champions of climate change action found plenty of reason to keep working.\During his keynote speech, McKibben displayed photographs from his recent trip to Greenland, including an image of an electronic chart suggesting he and his party were about a mile inland — even though they were in the open water on a boat.\“The captain said, ‘Oh, that machine is five years old,’ ” McKibben said, echoing an anecdote also included in a recent essay, “How Extreme Weather is Shrinking the Planet,” published in The New Yorker. “He told me, ‘This area was ice as far as you could see five years ago.’ ”\McKibben went on to display a video of a massive ice chunk disintegrating into water in real time.\“It’s somewhat beautiful in it’s own way,” he said of the disappearing ice. “But every time something like that happens, the ocean goes up a fraction of an inch, and it’s happening every day in different parts of the planet.”\McKibben said it was “nothing new” to see recent projections from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change forecast that a global temperature increase of 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit could be reached in as little as 11 years, triggering even more record-breaking storms, forest fires, droughts, heat waves and flooding than the planet has seen in the last 10 years.\“Scientists are saying it louder now because more time has passed and the line of the curve we have to travel is getting steeper,” he said.\McKibben did go on to praise activists in Vermont, citing the more than 1,000 residents who joined him for a march to protest a pipeline in the western part of the state 12 years ago and, more recently, an initiative set forth by state legislators vowing for Vermont to consume 90 percent of its energy from renewable sources by 2050. But, he said, 2050 is coming faster than people might think.\“I know it’s hard for some of you to imagine the passage of 32 years, but it’s coming,” McKibben said. “There is a need for action at real speed.”\Vermont so far is falling well short of its “90 by ’50” target identified as a goal seven years ago, according to a presentation by Energy Action Network’s Duval and Wolfe. Duval, a former Fairlee resident and Lebanon High graduate, and Wolfe, a Sharon Academy alumnus who grew up in Strafford, showed a chart indicating that current emissions standards would put Vermont on track for only about 30 percent renewable energy by 2050. They later noted that Vermont’s greenhouse gas emissions have actually increased 16 percent since 1990, sending it from the second-highest-rated state for carbon emissions per capita to fifth in the nation.\The pair said that Vermont’s transportation sector accounted for 43 percent of the state’s greenhouse gas emissions in 2015 and that nearly 28 percent was released via thermal heat such as propane and oil to heat buildings.\“That’s more than 70 percent of emissions from those two areas alone,” Duval said following the presentation. “If Vermont wants to get serious about its renewable energy goals, we need a much more ambitious energy plan to reduce fossil fuel use.” \Weinberger, a Hartland native in his seventh year as Burlington’s mayor, said part of that ambition should include what he called a “revenue-neutral carbon fee” that would place tariffs on fossil fuels and be redistributed to the economy.\He used the floor on Saturday to call on Vermont to be the first state to implement such a fee, and announced the formation of the Northeast Mayors for Carbon Pollution Pricing, a newly formed partnership between mayors from throughout the region aiming to put a price on fossil fuel emissions.\Weinberger called current market prices on fuels such as oil and gas “artificially low” for failing to incorporate costs to human health and the environment. He disputed that carbon fees are harmful to local economies, citing a successful carbon tax program in British Columbia and emphasizing that every dollar collected under his proposal would be redistributed to citizens in some form.\“People in this room know that climate change is the real threat to the economy,” he said. “It will shrink the GDP of this country 10 percent by the end of the century, more than double the effects of the great recession.” \Workshops continued throughout the day, hitting upon a variety of environmental topics with titles like “Energy Burden: What it is, how it’s felt and what you can do to help,” “Land use, transportation and housing for low-carbon communities” and “Beneficial Electricrification: A Key Decarbonization Strategy.” \And early birds were able to graze a roomful of information booths upstairs before the presentations, including many Upper Valley Residents. Laura Simon, of Wilder, and West Fairlee resident Geoff Gardner were part of a group collecting signatures for a petition demanding an end to all new fossil fuel infrastructure projects in Vermont.\Simon said she looks forward to the VECAN conference each year.\“It’s an opportunity to gather, brainstorm, and figure out ways to make real change,” she said.\Jared Pendak can be reached at jpendak@vnews.com or 603-727-3216.\CREDIT: By Jared Pendak "
150,"Bookstores Help Us Dive Into Other Worlds\ \Bookstores thrive because they cater to people who love books. The beginning of the end for me with the Dartmouth Bookstore was the opening of the Clinique bazaar on the first floor. But, because I loved the Travel section, I avoided looking at it and went there. Then the Travel section moved upstairs, a not easy staircase for those of us who are growing older.\In its place, we could buy sweatshirts. I no longer wanted to dart into the Dartmouth Bookstore on my way to the Canoe Club or the Nugget, for the experience of getting away from the hurly-burly of my daily life. I can’t count the number of times I spent $22 on a travel guidebook, and then to read it and say to myself, “I don’t have to go there. I can go there in the pages of a book.”\And that’s the sadness of what’s happened to the Dartmouth Bookstore. Bookstores are places that take ourselves out of ourselves, that give us a chance to dive into the world of another person or place. We often buy that experience and bring it home.\I mourn for Main Street in Hanover. Something of its soul is being lost. I hope a deep-pocketed loyal Dartmouth graduate who cares about the life of the mind will come in and give us the equivalent of one of the great bookstores of the world.\Susan GillottiNorwichThe Choice Is Clear\ \At the bottom of the Oct. 12 Opinion page is a Bloomberg News column headlined “Progressives’ War on Big Business Hurts Workers.” Directly above that is a Tribune News Service column, “While We Fiddle and Stall, the Earth Burns.” I ask you, where’s the balance? \Compare the accumulated momentum associated with the techno-fiscal (nee “Military-Industrial”) complex with ecological concerns. Which can muster dominance before time runs out? As a gentle reminder of urgency, consider Tom Toles’ editorial cartoon positioned above both columns and consider what drives the weather: solar. And the generator is a safe 93 million miles away, enforcing our choice of a balanced ecosystem or fiscally ravaged population of remaining species.\Vote progressive, like your kids’ lives depended on it.\Kevin McEvoy LeveretWhite River JunctionRestore the Office of Register of Probate\I’m running for re-election as Grafton County register of probate in order to continue my efforts over the last two years to restore this important constitutional office to its rightful role, which is to oversee the probate process in such a way as to prevent the estates of the deceased from being looted by corrupt judges and corrupt judge-appointed administrators of estates.\Transfer of the sale of property from one person to another is recorded at the Office of Register of Deeds. The register of probate’s constitutional function is to see that property belonging to the deceased is honestly transferred to rightful heirs.\During the 2011-2012 session of the Legislature, the state’s judiciary, using the pretense of saving money by streamlining the courts, colluded with House and Senate leadership to cause the repeal of every statute associated with the functioning of the Office of Register of Probate except for those few needed to perpetuate the fraud that the register of probate function remained in existence to protect the assets of the deceased from corruption. The justices and House leadership then made an end run around the constitution in order to achieve their self-serving ends.\They crafted a bill that was cleverly presented to the House and Senate, without a word in its language that would have given any member a clue of what was actually afoot. It passed both chambers and was signed into law. Today, to the detriment of every New Hampshire citizen, the register’s office exists as an impotent shell. The register can’t protect anyone.\Those of you who may be concerned with protecting the legitimate transfer of your property to your heirs should want the Office of Register of Probate restored. House Bill 476, created to achieve just that, passed the House last spring but has been languishing in the Senate.\I’d like to continue to work on fixing this problem and I ask for your vote for Grafton County register of probate.\We need to move forward.\Paul MirskiEnfield Center Oxenham Is a Leader On Energy in N.H.\ \I write in support of Lee Oxenham, who is running for re-election as state representative for Plainfield, Cornish, Grantham and Springfield. \Her support of House Bill 466 to expand renewable energy in New Hampshire to create jobs, to foster a clean environment and to combat climate change leads in a positive direction. Although the bill was vetoed by the governor, Oxenham will continue to promote clean energy for the future and deserves our vote on Nov. 6.\Helen Davidson PlainfieldClarkson, McCormack For Vermont Senate\ \I write to encourage you to vote for Alison Clarkson and Dick McCormack for the Vermont Senate. \Both exercise fiscal discipline and genuine compassion when dealing with every issue that touches our lives — be it jobs, health care, education, climate change, public safety, etc.\If you’ve had the good fortune of hearing them speak from the Senate floor, you know that their knowledge is deep and that they have a pragmatic vision for the challenges confronting us. Moreover, both respond rapidly and thoroughly to personal concerns voiced by their constituents. And both showed real political courage backing the gun-reform measures in the wake of the Fair Haven threat.\We are fortunate to have Alison Clarkson and Dick McCormack represent us in the Vermont Senate. I ask you to support them on Election Day with your vote.\Bob WilliamsonSouth WoodstockSupport Bill Huff for Orange Senate Seat\Bill Huff is offering a new view for Vermont. The Orange Senate district candidate strongly believes that we need to leave Vermont a better place for our children and grandchildren. We can’t continue to drive businesses out of the state with new laws, regulations and taxes. We have a governor who is trying to slow this pace, but he needs allies in the Legislature. Huff wants to keep the jobs in Vermont that will keep our young people here.\When our current senator and his colleagues passed Act 60, I said this would be the end of local control of our schools. With a little modification to the Miller formula, we would not be in this terrible mess. Our school boards put their faith in the state Agency of Education and we will now pay the price. Huff proposes a sensible, comprehensive plan that is more sensitive to rural needs. (See his website: huffforvtstatesenate.com)\Huff would also take a hard look at Act 250, local zoning and the future of our Vermont landscape. We are putting too much trust in people who want to control their neighbors. \Consider the proposed carbon tax that Democrats have supported. You can expect, on average, a $15 increase for each gas fill-up, and more on heating oil. There would be a similar hike in the cost of propane, natural gas, kerosene, butane and aviation fuel. And for what? Vermont’s energy consumption is already one of the lowest in the country, and our forests regularly removed more CO2 from the atmosphere than the emissions we produce. What we do in Vermont will have virtually no impact on worldwide carbon in the atmosphere.\If we are to keep Vermont as a manufacturing, farming, logging, skiing and water recreation state, we need common-sense elected officials who are ready to make tough decisions. Bill Huff is a down-to-earth candidate who I strongly support. You have a choice on Election Day: more taxes and regulations, or a fresh approach to Vermont.\Doug LyfordChelseaSusan Hatch Davis Makes Things Happen\ \In the last election, Susan Hatch Davis, after five terms of service in the Vermont Legislature, lost her seat by a handful of votes. The campaign to oust her was, in my opinion, shamefully distorting of her role and impact there. Now, two years later, it is time to set the record straight. \Hatch Davis is a quiet person, neither a fiery speaker nor a glad-handing politician. What she is, is an incredibly hard worker and a passionate advocate for the well-being of working families in this state. But this does not convey the full picture of her effectiveness. According to insiders, Hatch Davis is one of a handful of legislators — perhaps a few dozen out of 150 — who is fully engaged in the legislative process; by virtue of that, she has become one of its more influential members, someone who actually makes things happen. Her defeat would be a serious loss to the causes she furthers, and to the values of fairness, justice, frugality and moderation that she represents. \I hope voters in her district (Williamstown, Chelsea, Washington, Vershire, Orange and Corinth) are aware of this, and will not let that defeat happen.\Dan BreslawWest Corinth"

"
153,"
Saturday, August 25 The ""energy crisis"" of the early 1970s made it clear we had to learn to use energy much more efficiently. States have the power to address the usage of electricity more than other forms of energy. Using less electricity and reducing peaks in demand could keep money in people's pockets and in local economies. It would also result in a cleaner environment and avoid costly increases in the size of the transmission system.
\
For the last 35 years here in Vermont, many of us have worked to implement energy efficiency programs, demand-side management and new rate designs. At the same time we have tried to move toward renewable generation sources and distributed generation.
\
While Vermont has done more energy efficiency than most states, we have only accomplished a fraction of what we should have. Just enough so the electric companies can justify bragging about it. The same goes for demand-side management, renewable generation and distributed generation.
\
Our efforts have only been marginally successful because of the political power wielded by the electric companies who profit by selling more power, not less.
\
The first energy efficiency programs were designed to be implemented by the electric companies themselves. After years of corporate foot-dragging, one exasperated legislator remarked that ""trying to make the electric companies do energy efficiency is like trying to push a wet noodle uphill.""
\
The Legislature finally gave up on the electric companies and created Efficiency Vermont to implement efficiency programs. That simplified things for the electric companies. Now all they have to do is make sure Efficiency Vermont does not get enough funding to be more than marginally successful.
\
We learned the lessons of the first energy crisis of the 1970s, but 35 years of corporate influence has kept us from implementing them.
\
Now, in 2007, we are in a second more serious energy crisis. Again we are realizing that we have to make more efficient use of energy, and in addition, address global warming. The world is also at, or near, peak oil. How ironic that now we are also being told that because electric demand is up we need to build up the capacity of the transmission system, that is, ""upgrade"" the Southern Loop.
\
A few years ago, VELCO did a similar project called the Northwest Reliability Project. (VELCO is the Vermont Electric Co., which owns the transmission system in Vermont. VELCO is owned by Vermont electric companies, mostly Central Vermont and Green Mountain Power.)
\
The Public Service Board told VELCO to do good public outreach and planning, and to smooth the waters for the project. VELCO did an outreach program, but clearly not enough. The firestorm over the project ended up in the courts, in the Legislature and before the Public Service Board.
\
The courts were not happy. The legislature was not happy. The Public Service Board was not happy. VELCO was ordered to put part of the line underground at great expense. VELCO was not happy either. The chairman of the Public Service Board stated that the whole project could have been avoided ""with more efficiency earlier on.""
\
When Central Vermont, the largest owner of VELCO, applied to ""upgrade"" the Southern Loop, the Public Service Board was much more specific in its requirements for public outreach -- much more specific. No one wanted a replay of the last firestorm.
\
For the Southern Loop, VELCO and CVPS conducted what is probably the most comprehensive public outreach program ever done in Vermont for an electric infrastructure project. They hired the Star Group, which bills itself as being able to ""turn adversaries into advocates on infrastructure projects.""
\
A ""community working group"" of local people, including political and energy activists, was convened and met for most of 2006. They were not charged with looking at specifics such as location affects.
\
The group dealt with the present transmission needs created by 35 years of failing to do aggressive energy efficiency, installing distributed generation and demand-side management. They ended up supporting the transmission ""upgrade"" in the short term to deal with reliability and supply problems.
\
The group also recommended that CVPS do energy efficiency, demand-side management and install distributed generation going forward. It was like an echo of the lessons from the energy crisis of the 1970s.
\
Unfortunately, the ""upgrade"" will leave us more dependent on, and using more power from the regional grid.
\
This otherwise comprehensive public outreach program did not reach out to affected landowners. The scrub pastures of a few decades ago have transformed into maturing forests full of long absent species. Landowners and neighbors have a new appreciation for what used to be the ""back 40.""
\
With the Public Service Board, the courts and the Legislature watching the local uproar, CVPS and VELCO are very willing to move the line. They got too close to the flames last time.
\
Where ever it ends up, it will still represent 35 years of failure. Corporate influence has stalled implementation of the lessons we learned from the energy crisis of the 1970s for 35 years.

154,"
Wednesday, August 29 VERNON -- The partial collapse of a cooling tower last week at Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant drew expressions of concern from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Gov. Jim Douglas and all three members of the state's congressional delegation.
\
But the constituency perhaps most important to the power plant's continued operation past 2012 -- the state Legislature -- is sounding alarm bells of its own.
\
""I think that legislators are definitely paying more attention. I think that event is going to have more people looking at what we're dealing with,"" said Rep. Sarah Edwards, P-Brattleboro.
\
""I've had calls from several legislators who asked me what happened. Their concerns were, 'if this wasn't known through inspections, what else isn't known through inspections?'""
\
While the NRC has the final say in Vermont Yankee's request for a 20-year extension in its operating license, the legislature in 2006 reserved for itself the right to prevent the plant from staying active past 2012. All it would take is a 'no' vote in either body of the legislature to shut the plant down.
\
It is unclear exactly when such a vote could take place -- let alone what its outcome would be -- but officials involved with the decision say it will likely occur in early 2009.
\
Senate President Pro Tem Peter Shumlin, D-Windham, said he has ruled out a vote in 2008, and state power utilities have said they need to know the Legislature's decision before the end of 2009.
\
According to Joint Natural Resources and Energy Committee chairman Sen. Mark MacDonald, D-Orange, ""What happened last week will be old news by 2009.""
\
But others in the Legislature say they believe the incident could spur a wider debate about the wisdom of relying on Yankee to provide one third of the state's electricity.
\
""I would hope that with what happened at the plant in the last few weeks, that it would absolutely grab the attention of all Vermonters,"" said Rep. Tony Klein, D-East Montpelier, who also serves on the committee. ""Voters need to be as educated as possible about this type of power generation before they just blindly accept it. They need to know all the positives and negatives as well.""
\
According to Shumlin, ""At some point, that nuclear power plant won't be safe to run. Most Vermonters will want to know when that point is. This week's events just point to the fact that you can't trust Entergy to make safety determinations because they're working for their stockholders.""
\
But Shumlin said he believes it will be an uphill battle to convince legislators outside of Windham County to vote against Yankee's extension.
\
""We have to remember that most Vermonters view Windham County as somewhere down there near Massachusetts, and they really don't have much concern about the challenges we're facing,"" he said. ""Most legislators would happily vote to continue to let us be the nuclear waste dump for the state of Vermont.""
\
The debate in Montpelier will likely be shaped by the Department of Public Service, which was charged by the Legislature to provide studies of various elements relating to the license extension. That process will begin next year, after Entergy officially files for a new Certificate of Public Good with the Public Service Board -- some time between January and March, said Entergy spokesman Brian Cosgrove.
\
But according to Cosgrove, the timing of the Legislature's vote is ""really an enigma wrapped in a riddle wrapped in a mystery. I have not gotten a clear answer.""
\
No matter when the vote takes place, the Legislature will have to tread carefully when making its decision, as it is barred from considering issues having to do with radiological safety.
\
The federal Atomic Energy Act gives the NRC sole discretion to consider that issue -- leaving state lawmakers to consider only such issues as the plant's environmental impact, alternative sources and the need for power.
\
Entergy waived its right to dispute the state's ability to veto the plant's continued operation in a memorandum of understanding signed when it purchased Vermont Yankee. Cosgrove confirmed Tuesday that, ""Entergy will abide fully by the agreement in the M.O.U.""
\
All that leaves one very hot political potato in the hands of legislators -- and a statewide election between the cooling tower mishap and a 2009 vote.
\
""My district is very aware of it, but is it an issue that's going to decide an election? I don't think so,"" Klein said. ""But I'm hopeful that with all that's going on, people are talking about, 'is generation of electricity with this kind of danger worth it?'""
\
Edwards agrees.
\
""No one expected this. It happened. What else don't we expect? What else could happen?"" she said. ""Those are the questions people are asking now all over the state. Those are good questions.""
\
Much of the debate over Yankee's extension will likely center around the question of how to provide reasonably-priced electricity for the state without the nuclear plant.
\
""We are ready, willing and able to continue to produce nonfossil fuel emitting, affordably priced electricity with the 600 excellent workers we have at Vermont Yankee,"" Cosgrove said. ""I think when all the facts are in, people will be confident that it is a safe and reliable source of electricity going forward.""
\
But according to MacDonald, Entergy and its allies have been setting themselves up for a debate on their own terms.
\
""One of the reasons there's going to be a lot of pressure to relicense Vermont Yankee is the orchestrated, deliberate and far-sighted work by investor-owned utilities and Entergy to quash and delay and destroy energy efficiency and demand-side management activities that would have reduced the need for big power generators and more poles and wires,"" he said.
\
""First of all, they create the environment for being able to say it's an emergency, and then they say it's an emergency.""
\
Shumlin said he would not rule out voting for Yankee's extension, but first he wants the plant to undergo an independent inspection and to find a place other than the banks of the Connecticut River in which to store its high level nuclear waste.
\
""If we can address the waste issue and the safety issue, I'm open-minded to discussing the question of letting Vermont Yankee continue to run,"" he said.
\
""When I saw the photograph of what just transpired, my first thought was I was looking at a shot of a bomb that went off in Baghdad. I'm extremely concerned that we have to have a really objective outside evaluation of the safety of the plant -- regardless of the outcome of the legislative vote.""

155,"Breaking news\For those of you too busy to read the newspaper when September rolls around, here is what everyone else will be reading:\Investigators have discovered ""clear evidence"" of Iraqi biological weapons and missile programs, according to David Kay, the former U.N. weapons inspector appointed by President George Bush to investigate weapons of mass destruction in Iraq"" (or something like that).\Now how, in less than two months, could David Kay, a man with no science degree, find evidence that 1,000 U.N. weapons inspectors and 1,800 U.S. military investigators couldn't find in six months?\In fact, the evidence that will come out in September will be exaggerated or fabricated, just like the forged Niger documents, the ""bioweapons"" trailers, and the aluminum ""centrifuge"" tubes.\Bush knew all along that there wasn't any ""imminent threat"" in Iraq. How else can we explain why, after loudly demanding that Iraq allow the U.N. weapons inspectors in last fall (which they did) Bush now refuses to allow them back into U.S.-controlled Iraq.\We may not have a recall option like in California, but we do have an impeachment option, and it applies to all lying presidents, Republican or Democrat, especially when hundreds of U.S. soldiers, and thousands of innocent Iraqis have died because of those lies. KEITH LEVENSON Burlington\Accountant's dilemma\The Free Press accounting department is going to face a bit of a dilemma in filing its 2003 corporate income tax forms.\Given that Sam Hemingway appears to be on Howard Dean's payroll as indicated by the series of puff pieces he is generating, how much of his salary will be considered a political contribution?

156,"COLCHESTER -- The abundant economic promise of the new green economy was not much in evidence last week at the ""Green Career Fair"" in the St. Michael's College student center.\Of the 10 environmental organizations that were supposed to be on hand to discuss employment ""opportunities,"" four were no-shows. With one exception, the opportunities all were for volunteers or interns.\Students wandered by during the lunch hour, to and from the dining hall, and some paused to chat with representatives or to pick up literature, but the reps didn't get much business. At the end of two hours, the tables with sign-up sheets had no more than a handful of signatures.\Ironically, it didn't help that the green career fair was held during Earth Week. Most job fairs take place earlier in the spring.\The notion of a green career is tied to that of a ""green economy"" -- low-carbon, environmentally friendly, driven by renewable energy, and so on. But whether green enterprise will become a major economic engine in American society at large -- and create myriad new jobs of all kinds that somehow tip society's balance in favor of ""sustainability"" -- remains to be seen.\The subdued tenor of the event at St. Michael's probably says as much about the job market for college graduates as it does about the green economy. Permanent entry-level jobs can be hard to find, so many students apply for internships as a fallback.\Cassandra Burns, a job-hunting senior, said a lot of her fellow students were headed for volunteer duty in programs -- such as the Peace Corps, or Americorps -- that would ease their loan burdens. She has applied for several paid internships offered through Vermont Businesses for Social Responsibility -- one of the organizations represented at the fair.\""I'm not looking for anything permanent,"" Burns said. She just wants to save some money before going to graduate school.\Increasingly, internships serve as bridges to full-time employment, said Ingrid Peterson, the college's associate director of employer relations and career counseling.\""Many employers use internships as a kind of test-drive,"" Peterson said. ""Hiring is so expensive. They can't afford to make a mistake.""\Heather Ellis, who organized the fair, served in two internships before landing her current job, as the college's sustainability coordinator.\One of the organizations on hand, Yestermorrow, was represented by a community-outreach intern. Another, Native Energy, was staffed by an employee, Owen Glubiak, who had done a three-week internship of the ""test-drive"" variety after he graduated from St. Michael's in 2008. Now he works in sales and business development for Native Energy, which markets carbon offsets from renewable energy projects.\Native Energy, headquartered in South Burlington and the only for-profit organization with a table at the fair, also was the only organization inviting applications for a regular, paying job.\Matt Stillman, a senior, was the only student to show up who expressed a strong interest in that position. And what was the one green job being proffered at the green career fair?\Marketing and sales assistant manager.\Shades of green\Just what is a green job?\The definitions vary widely. By many interpretations, green jobs are not limited to hands-on conservation or renewable-energy work, and yes, they can include marketing -- that is, if the marketing is in support of some sort of ""sustainable"" activity.\The definitions matter to the extent that they're connected to numbers -- jobs now or in the future -- and to government policies that aim to promote the creation of such jobs.\""As we recover from this recession, the transition to clean energy has the potential to grow our economy and create millions of jobs -- but only if we accelerate that transition,"" President Obama said last summer, after the federal stimulus program had committed billions of dollars to renewable-energy sources.\How many green jobs are out there?\A 2009 survey by the Vermont Environmental Consortium reported 19,370 employees in the state's environmental sector, defined as ""engaging in activities which decrease the use of fossil fuels, promote sustainability and protect our natural environments."" A majority of the firms surveyed said they expected to grow during the next five years.\The U.S. Conference of Mayors, in a 2008 report using a more elaborate definition, pinpointed the nation's green jobs at 751,051. They included 581 jobs in the Burlington metro area.\More telling are the projections for green-job expansion, part of a vision for a reconfigured economy powered by a green engine. The mayors' report forecast a seven-fold increase in Burlington's green jobs by 2038, and a national green-job employment of 4.2 million.\""We spend $350 billion a year to import oil,"" Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., told hundreds of students at a University of Vermont appearance last week. If that money were used instead ""to transform the energy system,"" he said, ""it would create millions of good-paying green jobs.""\""Green Recovery: A program to create good jobs and start building a low-carbon economy,"" proposed by the Center for American Progress, called for an expenditure of $100 billion over two years in six ""green infrastructure areas,"" including building retrofitting, wind and solar power. The projected result: 2 million jobs.\The BlueGreen Alliance, a partnership of labor unions and environmental organizations, reported that $93 billion invested in ""the green economy"" under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act created nearly 1 million jobs.\Yet these and other bullish claims for green jobs don't go unchallenged. The voluminous literature promoting public investments in the green economy has spawned a countervailing literature contending green jobs are not all they're cracked up to be, and that they can even be economically damaging.\As with many public-policy questions these days, the discussion of ""green jobs"" has taken on a familiarly partisan ring, fed by reports by dueling think tanks.\The green-jobs boosters tend to be political liberals who support governmental intervention on the environment's behalf; the critics tend to be conservatives who favor limited government and a regime of market forces.\Sanders, who chairs the Green Jobs and New Economy subcommittee in the Senate, contends many critiques of green jobs and the green economy are cut from the same cloth as the campaign funded by fossil-fuel industries to refute climate change.\One of the recurrent arguments by critics is that government subsidies and tax breaks that create green jobs lead to the elimination of other jobs, because those subsidies and tax breaks divert economic resources that could be used more productively elsewhere.\The boosters counter that any public blandishments for green jobs pale beside the subsidies and tax breaks enjoyed for many years by oil, coal, natural gas and nuclear industries, and they cite a University of California study that found that, per unit of energy, alternative-energy technologies generate more jobs than fossil-fuel technologies.\All of which might leave a layman wondering whose assumptions, conclusions and data to trust. The good news is that, beyond the partisan divide surrounding the ""green economy,"" there's another form of greening that goes on under the policy radar and that both the environmentalists and their critics can embrace, although its impact on overall energy savings or greenhouse-gas emissions is probably rather limited:\The greening of the existing economy.\This can take the form of producing goods and services more efficiently, with less waste and at less environmental cost. ""Lean manufacturing"" -- using fewer inputs to make the same product for the same profit -- is one example.\""Or take hospitality,"" Mathew Barewicz, of the Vermont Department of Labor, wrote in an email. ""Many establishments have taken the time to minimize the use of resources (water, electricity, etc.) as part of a social mission or because patrons value it. The industry didn't become green but it did become greener.""\Fair enough\At the Green Career Fair, perhaps the most prototypical ""green"" positions -- outdoor work, maintaining trails and shelters -- were offered by the Green Mountain Club. The club receives more than 100 applications a year for 30 paid positions, said Jenna Whitson, group outreach coordinator. The summer slots already were filled, but students were invited to apply for five fall internships, which provide housing and a small stipend.\Similar opportunities -- stints as volunteers or unpaid interns, with some expenses covered -- were available throughout the United States through the Student Conservation Association, and overseas through ProWorld.\Tara Pfeiffer-Norrell, intern program manager for Vermont Businesses for Social Responsibility, was recruiting for 14 paid internships at various member firms. Members' commitment to social responsibility extends to the environment, she said, explaining VBSR's participation in the fair.\Logos for two of Vermont's best-known firms with social missions, Ben & Jerry's and Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, were featured in Native Energy's table display. They're among Native Energy's corporate customers.\Ben & Jerry's has bought offsets for 15,000 tons of carbon-equivalent emissions since 2022, according to Native Energy's website, and Green Mountain has purchased 90,000 tons' worth since 2003. Both companies are said to be helping build ""a Native American wind farm"" -- the sort of project that serves to reduce net greenhouse-gas emissions and generate certifiable carbon credits that Native Energy sells as offsets.\If reducing greenhouse-gas emissions is a green enterprise, then selling carbon offsets would seem to qualify as a green job.\Stillman, who is majoring in psychology and minoring in marketing, chatted with Glubiak and concluded that the sales position would be a good fit for him. He said he'd already done two internships and was ready for a real job.\""I'm going to write a cover letter right now,"" he said on his way out.\Web resources\* Bureau of Labor Statistics, ""Measuring Green Jobs"" -- www.bls.gov/green\* Vermont Environmental Consortium, ""Vermont's Environmental Sector: Identifying Green Workforce Training Needs and Opportunities"" (2009) -- http://bit.ly/GreenForce\* U.N.

157,"
Wednesday, August 29 VERNON -- The partial collapse of a cooling tower last week at Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant drew expressions of concern from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Gov. Jim Douglas and all three members of the state's congressional delegation.
\
But the constituency perhaps most important to the power plant's continued operation past 2012 -- the state Legislature -- is sounding alarm bells of its own.
\
""I think that legislators are definitely paying more attention. I think that event is going to have more people looking at what we're dealing with,"" said Rep. Sarah Edwards, P-Brattleboro.
\
""I've had calls from several legislators who asked me what happened. Their concerns were, 'if this wasn't known through inspections, what else isn't known through inspections?'""
\
While the NRC has the final say in Vermont Yankee's request for a 20-year extension in its operating license, the legislature in 2006 reserved for itself the right to prevent the plant from staying active past 2012. All it would take is a 'no' vote in either body of the legislature to shut the plant down.
\
It is unclear exactly when such a vote could take place -- let alone what its outcome would be -- but officials involved with the decision say it will likely occur in early 2009.
\
Senate President Pro Tem Peter Shumlin, D-Windham, said he has ruled out a vote in 2008, and state power utilities have said they need to know the Legislature's decision before the end of 2009.
\
According to Joint Natural Resources and Energy Committee chairman Sen. Mark MacDonald, D-Orange, ""What happened last week will be old news by 2009.""
\
But others in the Legislature say they believe the incident could spur a wider debate about the wisdom of relying on Yankee to provide one third of the state's electricity.
\
""I would hope that with what happened at the plant in the last few weeks, that it would absolutely grab the attention of all Vermonters,"" said Rep. Tony Klein, D-East Montpelier, who also serves on the committee. ""Voters need to be as educated as possible about this type of power generation before they just blindly accept it. They need to know all the positives and negatives as well.""
\
According to Shumlin, ""At some point, that nuclear power plant won't be safe to run. Most Vermonters will want to know when that point is. This week's events just point to the fact that you can't trust Entergy to make safety determinations because they're working for their stockholders.""
\
But Shumlin said he believes it will be an uphill battle to convince legislators outside of Windham County to vote against Yankee's extension.
\
""We have to remember that most Vermonters view Windham County as somewhere down there near Massachusetts, and they really don't have much concern about the challenges we're facing,"" he said. ""Most legislators would happily vote to continue to let us be the nuclear waste dump for the state of Vermont.""
\
The debate in Montpelier will likely be shaped by the Department of Public Service, which was charged by the Legislature to provide studies of various elements relating to the license extension. That process will begin next year, after Entergy officially files for a new Certificate of Public Good with the Public Service Board -- some time between January and March, said Entergy spokesman Brian Cosgrove.
\
But according to Cosgrove, the timing of the Legislature's vote is ""really an enigma wrapped in a riddle wrapped in a mystery. I have not gotten a clear answer.""
\
No matter when the vote takes place, the Legislature will have to tread carefully when making its decision, as it is barred from considering issues having to do with radiological safety.
\
The federal Atomic Energy Act gives the NRC sole discretion to consider that issue -- leaving state lawmakers to consider only such issues as the plant's environmental impact, alternative sources and the need for power.
\
Entergy waived its right to dispute the state's ability to veto the plant's continued operation in a memorandum of understanding signed when it purchased Vermont Yankee. Cosgrove confirmed Tuesday that, ""Entergy will abide fully by the agreement in the M.O.U.""
\
All that leaves one very hot political potato in the hands of legislators -- and a statewide election between the cooling tower mishap and a 2009 vote.
\
""My district is very aware of it, but is it an issue that's going to decide an election? I don't think so,"" Klein said. ""But I'm hopeful that with all that's going on, people are talking about, 'is generation of electricity with this kind of danger worth it?'""
\
Edwards agrees.
\
""No one expected this. It happened. What else don't we expect? What else could happen?"" she said. ""Those are the questions people are asking now all over the state. Those are good questions.""
\
Much of the debate over Yankee's extension will likely center around the question of how to provide reasonably-priced electricity for the state without the nuclear plant.
\
""We are ready, willing and able to continue to produce nonfossil fuel emitting, affordably priced electricity with the 600 excellent workers we have at Vermont Yankee,"" Cosgrove said. ""I think when all the facts are in, people will be confident that it is a safe and reliable source of electricity going forward.""
\
But according to MacDonald, Entergy and its allies have been setting themselves up for a debate on their own terms.
\
""One of the reasons there's going to be a lot of pressure to relicense Vermont Yankee is the orchestrated, deliberate and far-sighted work by investor-owned utilities and Entergy to quash and delay and destroy energy efficiency and demand-side management activities that would have reduced the need for big power generators and more poles and wires,"" he said.
\
""First of all, they create the environment for being able to say it's an emergency, and then they say it's an emergency.""
\
Shumlin said he would not rule out voting for Yankee's extension, but first he wants the plant to undergo an independent inspection and to find a place other than the banks of the Connecticut River in which to store its high level nuclear waste.
\
""If we can address the waste issue and the safety issue, I'm open-minded to discussing the question of letting Vermont Yankee continue to run,"" he said.
\
""When I saw the photograph of what just transpired, my first thought was I was looking at a shot of a bomb that went off in Baghdad. I'm extremely concerned that we have to have a really objective outside evaluation of the safety of the plant -- regardless of the outcome of the legislative vote.""

And what was the one green job being proffered at the green career fair?\Marketing and sales assistant manager.\Shades of green\Just what is a green job?\The definitions vary widely. By many interpretations, green jobs are not limited to hands-on conservation or renewable-energy work, and yes, they can include marketing -- that is, if the marketing is in support of some sort of ""sustainable"" activity.\The definitions matter to the extent that they're connected to numbers -- jobs now or in the future -- and to government policies that aim to promote the creation of such jobs.\""As we recover from this recession, the transition to clean energy has the potential to grow our economy and create millions of jobs -- but only if we accelerate that transition,"" President Obama said last summer, after the federal stimulus program had committed billions of dollars to renewable-energy sources.\How many green jobs are out there?\A 2009 survey by the Vermont Environmental Consortium reported 19,370 employees in the state's environmental sector, defined as ""engaging in activities which decrease the use of fossil fuels, promote sustainability and protect our natural environments."" A majority of the firms surveyed said they expected to grow during the next five years.\The U.S. Conference of Mayors, in a 2008 report using a more elaborate definition, pinpointed the nation's green jobs at 751,051. They included 581 jobs in the Burlington metro area.\More telling are the projections for green-job expansion, part of a vision for a reconfigured economy powered by a green engine. The mayors' report forecast a seven-fold increase in Burlington's green jobs by 2038, and a national green-job employment of 4.2 million.\""We spend $350 billion a year to import oil,"" Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., told hundreds of students at a University of Vermont appearance last week. If that money were used instead ""to transform the energy system,"" he said, ""it would create millions of good-paying green jobs.""\""Green Recovery: A program to create good jobs and start building a low-carbon economy,"" proposed by the Center for American Progress, called for an expenditure of $100 billion over two years in six ""green infrastructure areas,"" including building retrofitting, wind and solar power. The projected result: 2 million jobs.\The BlueGreen Alliance, a partnership of labor unions and environmental organizations, reported that $93 billion invested in ""the green economy"" under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act created nearly 1 million jobs.\Yet these and other bullish claims for green jobs don't go unchallenged. The voluminous literature promoting public investments in the green economy has spawned a countervailing literature contending green jobs are not all they're cracked up to be, and that they can even be economically damaging.\As with many public-policy questions these days, the discussion of ""green jobs"" has taken on a familiarly partisan ring, fed by reports by dueling think tanks.\The green-jobs boosters tend to be political liberals who support governmental intervention on the environment's behalf; the critics tend to be conservatives who favor limited government and a regime of market forces.\Sanders, who chairs the Green Jobs and New Economy subcommittee in the Senate, contends many critiques of green jobs and the green economy are cut from the same cloth as the campaign funded by fossil-fuel industries to refute climate change.\One of the recurrent arguments by critics is that government subsidies and tax breaks that create green jobs lead to the elimination of other jobs, because those subsidies and tax breaks divert economic resources that could be used more productively elsewhere.\The boosters counter that any public blandishments for green jobs pale beside the subsidies and tax breaks enjoyed for many years by oil, coal, natural gas and nuclear industries, and they cite a University of California study that found that, per unit of energy, alternative-energy technologies generate more jobs than fossil-fuel technologies.\All of which might leave a layman wondering whose assumptions, conclusions and data to trust. The good news is that, beyond the partisan divide surrounding the ""green economy,"" there's another form of greening that goes on under the policy radar and that both the environmentalists and their critics can embrace, although its impact on overall energy savings or greenhouse-gas emissions is probably rather limited:\The greening of the existing economy.\This can take the form of producing goods and services more efficiently, with less waste and at less environmental cost. ""Lean manufacturing"" -- using fewer inputs to make the same product for the same profit -- is one example.\""Or take hospitality,"" Mathew Barewicz, of the Vermont Department of Labor, wrote in an email. ""Many establishments have taken the time to minimize the use of resources (water, electricity, etc.) as part of a social mission or because patrons value it. The industry didn't become green but it did become greener.""\Fair enough\At the Green Career Fair, perhaps the most prototypical ""green"" positions -- outdoor work, maintaining trails and shelters -- were offered by the Green Mountain Club. The club receives more than 100 applications a year for 30 paid positions, said Jenna Whitson, group outreach coordinator. The summer slots already were filled, but students were invited to apply for five fall internships, which provide housing and a small stipend.\Similar opportunities -- stints as volunteers or unpaid interns, with some expenses covered -- were available throughout the United States through the Student Conservation Association, and overseas through ProWorld.\Tara Pfeiffer-Norrell, intern program manager for Vermont Businesses for Social Responsibility, was recruiting for 14 paid internships at various member firms. Members' commitment to social responsibility extends to the environment, she said, explaining VBSR's participation in the fair.\Logos for two of Vermont's best-known firms with social missions, Ben & Jerry's and Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, were featured in Native Energy's table display. They're among Native Energy's corporate customers.\Ben & Jerry's has bought offsets for 15,000 tons of carbon-equivalent emissions since 2022, according to Native Energy's website, and Green Mountain has purchased 90,000 tons' worth since 2003. Both companies are said to be helping build ""a Native American wind farm"" -- the sort of project that serves to reduce net greenhouse-gas emissions and generate certifiable carbon credits that Native Energy sells as offsets.\If reducing greenhouse-gas emissions is a green enterprise, then selling carbon offsets would seem to qualify as a green job.\Stillman, who is majoring in psychology and minoring in marketing, chatted with Glubiak and concluded that the sales position would be a good fit for him. He said he'd already done two internships and was ready for a real job.\""I'm going to write a cover letter right now,"" he said on his way out.\Web resources\* Bureau of Labor Statistics, ""Measuring Green Jobs"" -- www.bls.gov/green\* Vermont Environmental Consortium, ""Vermont's Environmental Sector: Identifying Green Workforce Training Needs and Opportunities"" (2009) -- http://bit.ly/GreenForce\* U.N.

160,"
Tuesday, February 10 BOSTON (AP) -- Gov. Deval Patrick is considering asking the Legislature to raise the Massachusetts gasoline tax by 27 cents per gallon as part of a comprehensive package aimed at solving lingering state transportation problems, The Associated Press learned Monday.
\
Such an increase would stave off a doubling of Massachusetts Turnpike tolls planned for this spring, and finance a wholesale change in the way state runs its transporation system, but leave it with the highest gasoline tax in the nation at 50.5 cents. And the plan calls for increasing that tax annually, based on the Consumer Price Index, starting Jan. 1, 2011.
\
A policy draft obtained Monday by the AP said the added taxes would be dedicated to paying down the debt of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, funding regional transit authorities and revamping tolls on the Turnpike.
\
Tolls would be removed west of Route 128 by the end of next year. Tolls within Route 128, from Weston to Boston, would come down as the state shifts to a program of tracking -- and charging -- all Massachusetts drivers based on the miles they travel.
\
Trips would be measured by a chip installed in a vehicle inspection sticker as soon as 2014, and in-state drivers would receive a gas-tax refund for their mileage to avoid double payments. Out-of-staters would remain subject to the higher gasoline tax.
\
New York currently has the nation's highest state gas tax, at 41.3 cents per gallon.
\
""The Patrick administration recognizes that a greener, more fuel-efficient transportation system means that the gas tax will become a less viable (means) of funding our transportation system,"" said the document prepared by Transportation Secretary James Aloisi. ""A user-fee based system, collected electronically, is a fair way to pay for our transportation needs in the future.""
\
The draft says the ""average user will pay about an additional $120 per year, less than the cost of two small Dunkin' Donuts coffees per week."" Last month, Aloisi downplayed a new $6 annual Turnpike Fast Lane transponder fee as less than the cost of his turkey sandwich that day.
\
An administration spokesman said the governor has made no final decisions about his plan, which he has promised by the end of the month.
\
""We're finalizing our transportation reform plan,"" said Joe Landolfi, Patrick's communications director. ""It will be a comprehensive initiative, but no final decisions have been made -- especially on a gas tax.""
\
Patrick has repeatedly said that he opposes any broad-based tax increase without accompanying policy reforms, yet the Turnpike Authority's vote in November to hike tolls effective this spring touched off a public rebellion and a search for alternatives.
\
Under the Turnpike plan, tolls at the Boston Harbor tunnels would increase from $3.50 to $7, while tolls for cars traveling inbound at the Weston and Allston booths would rise from $1.25 to $2. Patrick has already proposed eliminating western Massachusetts tolls.
\
The scale of the projected toll increases has created an environment where legislators are openly debating the kind of massive transportation overhaul favored by Patrick, as well as a gas tax increase as a more equitable means of charging drivers for using public roads.
\
Rep. David Linsky, a Natick Democrat who represents MetroWest Turnpike users, has filed a bill proposing an even greater gas tax increase than the governor, 29 cents per gallon.
\
Meanwhile, Senate President Therese Murray and Sen. Steve Baddour, co-chairman of the Joint Committee on Transportation, filed legislation last week that embodies their own overhaul proposal, and the new House speaker, Robert DeLeo, has said passing a bill will be one of his first priorities.
\
The MBTA has $5.1 billion in debt, while the Turnpike has $2.3 billion in debt, much of it from inherited repayments costs for the $15 billion Central Artery project.
\
Under Patrick's plan, the state would streamline its disparate transportation agencies into four divisions: Highway, Rail and Transit, Aviation and Port, and Registry of Motor Vehicles.
\
The state would also have a Massachusetts Transportation Trust Fund that would be a protected repository for gasoline taxes, Registry fees, tolls, MBTA fares and other transportation funding.
\
The plan calls for the state's Highway Division to receive $325 million, or 12.5 cents, of the added 27 cents-per-gallon gas tax. The MBTA would receive $286 million, or 11 cents, while the regional transit authorities would receive $39 million, or 1.5 cents.
\
The Highway Division would oversee all state-owned roads and bridges, except for Department of Conservation and Recreation parkways and bridges and the Tobin Bridge. It would continue to collect tolls at the Boston Harbor tunnel crossings, as well as the state borders with New York and Connecticut.
\
The Rail and Transit Division would encompass the MBTA and the regional transit authorities, while the Aviation Division would assume the functions of the Massachusetts Aeronautics Commission. The Massachusetts Port Authority would remain an independent entity within the division, overseeing Logan International Airport and Hanscom Field in Bedford.
\
The Registry would continue the regulate drivers and vehicle licensing while developing the VMT -- or Vehicle Miles Traveled -- program. Inspection fees would increase by $10 per year to fund ""RMV modernization,"" according to the draft.
\
The proposal also includes changes for Massport, including mandating a $2 parking fee increase so the authority can contribute to mutually beneficial transportation initiatives. The proposal would have the transportation secretary become Massport's board chairman, a potentially controversial element after agency leadership was professionalized following the terrorist hijackings at Logan on Sept. 11, 2001.
\
In perhaps one effort to build political support for the program, Patrick is considering expanding a resident toll discount program from Charlestown, South Boston, East Boston and the North End to include Winthrop -- DeLeo's hometown.
\
Residents would be charged 50 cents more than a one-way MBTA fare to encourage the use of public transportation, with their payment increasing in step with future MBTA fare increases.
\
Some of those residents currently pay only 40 cents to use the tunnels, since they are forced to use it to reach the remainder of the city.

161,"
Enfield -- More than 100 Upper Valley bridges have been flagged for reconstruction or repair, but many remain years away from a fix as officials in Concord and Montpelier try to find money to shore up or replace the aging -- and sometimes crumbling -- structures.
\
In Enfield, plans to replace the two-lane Shaker Bridge over Mascoma Lake may be pushed back from 2010 to 2013 as New Hampshire transportation officials concede their 10-year transportation plan could take 35 years to complete.
\
In Bethel, the Route 107 bridge over the White River isn't slated for repair by the Vermont Agency of Transportation until 2012, according to Town Manager Del Cloud, though it is No. 5 on the state's priority list for state highway bridges and the deck and superstructure are both rated in poor condition.
\
""That's still some distance out. I assume they've determined it will last until then,"" Cloud said. ""It's been on its deathbed for quite a while.""
\
Transportation officials in both states say they are putting emphasis on the most critically needed bridge repairs -- a process that started before the deadly Aug. 1 collapse of an interstate bridge in Minneapolis -- in a difficult fiscal climate.
\
""We all acknowledge that we have unlimited challenges with very limited budgets to meet them, and that's part of the challenge of setting priorities, which is what we've been doing,"" said Vermont Secretary of Transportation Neale Lunderville.
\
About 16 percent of Vermont's 2,691 bridges -- about 85 of them in the Upper Valley -- are deemed ""structurally deficient,"" a federal rating system that indicates some components need to be replaced or monitored closely. And 36 of those bridges, the majority of them town-owned spans, have been placed on Vermont's new priority list for funding, created two years ago.
\
More than 13 percent of New Hampshire's 3,745 bridges are on the state Department of Transportation's more established ""red list,"" which calls for closer monitoring or repairs due to structural deficiencies or functional obsolescence. Sixty-seven of those are in the Upper Valley.
\
A notorious example is the rusting Shaker Bridge, built in 1938, which has patches of plywood under its deck, officials said, to help shore it up, and has been on the replacement list for about a decade already.
\
""It's rough. We've got concerns with it, being the condition it is, primarily because our sewer force main is attached to the outside of it,"" said Enfield Public Works Director Ken Daniels. ""If something were to happen to it, that would be quite a pickle.""
\
Carrying about 1,200 vehicles a day, Shaker Bridge has been posted to 15 tons, and Daniels said loaded fuel trucks ""are pushing it"" if they use the Main Street span, which connects Route 4A to downtown Enfield.
\
In an interview yesterday, DOT Assistant Commissioner Jeff Brillhart conceded that the Enfield bridge needs to be replaced -- at a cost of about $8 million -- and said its timeline would be reassessed as part of a statewide review following the Minnesota tragedy. But he also said the limited traffic that relies on the Shaker Bridge, and the availability of alternative routes around the lake, could count against it.
\
""It's in terrible condition and needs to be replaced. The one good thing, if there is a good thing, is the detour is not as long, and the traffic is lighter than in other areas,"" Brillhart said. ""That has to be worked into the priorities.""
\
In Vermont, the Route 107 bridge in Bethel ""is in poor to good condition. The deck and the superstructure continue to deteriorate,"" says a state bridge inspector's report in 2005. The cost to replace the truss on the bridge, which carries about 5,900 vehicles a day, including 600 trucks, is estimated at $9 million, and state officials have yet to gain environmental clearances or rights of way. They say they ""hope"" to begin construction about three years.
\
VTrans Chief Engineer Richard Tetreault said the Bethel bridge is ""unique"" because of its proximity to a railway overpass and said the fact that other bridges lower down the priority list are getting construction funding now was due to their ""momentum"" prior to the creation of the statewide priority list.
\
New Directions
\
Lunderville, a former political aide to Republican Gov. Jim Douglas who took over the AOT a year ago, also has instituted a ""road to affordability"" plan that puts a priority on bridge and culvert maintenance and reconstruction, rather than on new highway projects.
\
""We need to make sure that with the money we have, we are spending it in the right way,"" Lunderville said.
\
Vermont is spending about $55 million for bridge replacement work this year and about $15.5 million for maintenance of culvert and bridges, which he said was an 84 percent increase.
\
The state was helped immensely by the large federal transportation reauthorization approved in 2005, including $30 million in earmarks for town highway bridges and an annual $8 million directed to state-maintained bridges, part of a swan song from retiring U.S. Sen. Jim Jeffords, a senior member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.
\
The Douglas administration's focus on maintenance and repair has won plaudits from officials involved in road repair, including some Democrats.
\
Lunderville ""put the emphasis on culverts and bridges, and I couldn't agree with him any more. I thought that was a great idea,"" said state Sen. Dick Mazza, a Democrat from Colchester who chairs the Senate Transportation Committee. ""It wasn't very popular (to focus on maintenance), but what we had done over the years was promise too much for too many.""
\
Vermont's priority list is compiled, in part, through recommendations by regional planning commissions.
\
Chuck Wise, senior transportation planner for the Woodstock-based Two Rivers-Ottauquechee Regional Commission, said the ""fix-it first"" mentality appears to have helped. He said the commission's two top priorities, Marble Bridge in Woodstock Village and Route 12 bridge in Randolph, both won badly needed funding for reconstruction.
\
""At a local and regional level, we've been pushing the state to keep up with the repairs,"" Wise said. ""You've seen projects advance now a lot faster than they did before.""
\
In New Hampshire, state officials are glumly reordering their priorities after interim Transportation Commissioner Charles O'Leary last month suggested $1.1 billion in projects should be cut from the state's $4.1 billion, 10-year transportation plan. He also would delay some projects, including the long-awaited reconstruction of the Route 12A near Interstate 89 in West Lebanon, which might be pushed back until 2009.
\
Some local officials say plans to widen Interstate 93 in southern New Hampshire leading to the Massachusetts border -- which has ballooned in cost to an estimated $750 million over 20 years -- threaten to deprive dozens of other projects around the state. The main work has yet to start pending resolution of an environmental lawsuit.
\
""I think the I-93 project is the fiscal black hole which happens to be absorbing almost everything we've got right now,"" said state Sen. Peter Burling, a Cornish Democrat and vice chairman of the Senate Transportation and Interstate Cooperation Committee. ""I don't know how we can put it aside, since there is so much political power devoted to completing that project. Remember, it's where the population is.""
\
Brillhart, the DOT assistant commissioner, said more than a dozen bridges along the I-93 corridor are red-listed and need to be fixed, and that the I-93 project was of statewide importance.
\
""It's the central artery for New Hampshire, and not fixing it is problematic for the whole state,"" Brillhart said.
\
Bill Boynton, a New Hampshire DOT spokesman, said officials try to avoid politics through the ""bottom-up process"" of approving the 10-year plan, which includes regional hearings and recommendations that must be approved every two years by the Legislature.
\
Boynton also said New Hampshire is doing its best to fix problem bridges, but that even as it took care of 18 bridges on its red list last year, another 15 were added.
\
""You have slow and steady progress, but you are never going to catch up at the current level,"" Boynton said.
\
Some of the available bridge money in Vermont in recent years has been devoted to the $40 million replacement of the Missisquoi Bay Bridge, which crosses the northeast arm of Lake Champlain and is a major link to Quebec. Vermont officials also acknowledge that politics has played a role in speeding bridge projects in the past.
\
Senate Majority Leader John Campbell, a Quechee Democrat, said that he and then-Senate President Pro Tempore Peter Welch, a Hartland Democrat and now the state's lone member of the U.S. House, pushed to win funding to replace the corroded West Hartford bridge, which links the village to Quechee, and to repair a Route 5 bridge in Hartland.
\
""Are our voices a little louder than others? Probably yes,"" Campbell said. ""We are in leadership, so I think that does have some (effect). When we pick up the phones, someone is going to pick up on the other end.""
\
But Campbell also said the bridge repairs were badly needed, not a boondoggle. ""I think that (West Hartford) bridge, in my mind, should have been closed. We just really escaped by the skin of our teeth on that one,"" he said.
\
Lunderville said the project priority list, which relies largely on objective and scientific criteria, will help ""remove politics from the process.""
\
But he also said there are some ""hiccups"" in the new system, such as the fact that newly prioritized projects may still take a backseat for a few years to bridge work that has been in the pipeline for years. For example, although bridges on Interstate 89 between Hartford and Royalton are at the top of Vermont's interstate bridge priority list -- in part because of the amount of traffic they carry -- they are still only candidates for design funding.
\
New Revenue Needed?
\
The focus on road and bridge repair has raised the question of whether states have sufficient revenue to devote to aging infrastructure, especially in snow- and salt-battered places like Vermont and New Hampshire. The state gas tax in both states is around 20 cents a gallon.
\
O'Leary last month raised the prospect of higher tolls on roads and raising New Hampshire's gas tax, last increased in 1992.
\
""We see the need for more revenue. With that said, revenue is not the sole answer,"" Brillhart said. ""We need to come to grips with what needs to be done, and what can be put off.""
\
A higher gas tax has long been supported by Executive Councilor Ray Burton, a Bath Republican and prominent figure in determining state bridge projects.
\
""It's lack of money, always,"" Burton said. ""I would hope that legislators and the governor would just sit back and take a good look ... It isn't going to come from pennies out of the sky.""
\
In a written statement, a spokesman for Democratic Gov. John Lynch steered away from raising the gas tax but did not rule it out completely.
\
""Before looking at revenues, he believes we need to re-examine how we are using current revenues,"" Lynch spokesman Colin Manning wrote, saying the governor wants O'Leary to examine what Highway Fund money is not being used for roads and bridges and to see whether the turnpike system is self-supporting through tolls.
\
In Vermont, the Senate majority leader said a higher gas tax is needed. ""The longer we let these roads and bridges go, the more costly it will be,"" said Campbell. ""I think it's inevitable that we're going to have to look at some increase in the gas tax to help offset some of these costs.""
\
And House Speaker Gaye Symington, a Jericho Democrat who has been warning about Vermont's aging road system for years, noted that her chamber approved a 4-cent increase in the gas tax in the spring of 2006, only to see it die in the Senate.
\
Symington said David Wyss, chief economist at Standard & Poor's, told attendees at a Boston conference of state legislators from around the country yesterday that a higher gas tax is necessary to maintain roads and bridges.
\
""We're not coming close to actually taking care of what we have,"" said Symington, who supports the new focus on maintenance and upkeep but said the state is falling short by as much as $140 million a year in needed road and bridge work. ""We have to have a number of issues back on the table. Certainly we need to consider the revenues that support our infrastructure.""
\
But the notion of a higher gas tax was dismissed by both the Republican Douglas and by Mazza, the conservative Democrat who leads the Senate Transportation Committee. ""We're not going to raise the gas tax. Gasoline taxes are high enough,"" said Mazza. ""It would take 10 or 15 cents a gallon to make a difference, and people just aren't prepared financially here to do that.""
\
Jason Gibbs, the spokesman for Douglas, said he ""strongly opposes raising the gas tax"" because it would counter the governor's ""affordability agenda.""
\
Burling, the New Hampshire state senator from Cornish, said he favors a ""fuel consumption charge"" on gas guzzlers and incentives for efficient cars, but also said the Granite State's two-year election cycle -- which Vermont also shares -- means politicians are always concerned about the ballot box, rather than such problems as education funding, roads and bridges and corrections policy.
\
""All three are systems that need our attention, and they are all three things that suffer from the fact that our political decision-making is not set up to deal with long-term problems,"" Burling said. ""Nobody ever has the time to sit down (while) not in 'election mode'... we never have a chance to get there.""

162,"
Tuesday, April 29 GRAHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton criticized Barack Obama on Monday for opposing proposals to suspend federal gas taxes this summer, a plan she and Republican John McCain have endorsed. Obama didn't take the bait. He ignored Clinton and focused on McCain.
\
""My opponent, Senator Obama, opposes giving consumers a break from the gas tax,"" Clinton said at a firehouse. ""I understand the American people need some relief,"" she added, implying that Obama doesn't get it.
\
He has said motorists would not benefit significantly from suspending the gas tax.
\
""This is his solution to the problems of the energy crisis and your tax bills,"" Obama told several thousand at a noisy rally in Wilmington. \
\
The idea to suspend the 18.4 cent federal gas tax and 24.4 cent diesel tax from Memorial Day to Labor Day was first proposed by McCain, the likely Republican presidential nominee, as a way to lessen the pain at the pump for consumers this summer.

Austrians: Man admits holding daughter captive 24 years
\
AMSTETTEN, Austria (AP) -- The children locked in the basement never saw the light of day for years.
\
A retired electrician has confessed to imprisoning his daughter for 24 years and fathering seven children with her in a windowless cell sealed by an electronic keyless-entry system, police said Monday.
\
One of the children died in infancy and was tossed into the furnace of what stunned Austrians have labeled a ""house of horrors,"" officials said. The suspect owned the gray stone apartment building, lived there with his family, and rented the other units to relatives.
\
Austria is still scandalized by a 2006 case involving a girl who was kidnapped and imprisoned in a basement outside Vienna for more than eight years, and residents of this working class town west of the capital were puzzled as to how the latest instance could go undetected for so long.
\
Questions were being raised as to how the suspect -- identified as Josef Fritzl, 73 -- deceived neighbors, social workers and police for so long.
\
Obama's pastor defies critics
\
WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a defiant appearance before the Washington media, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright said Monday that criticism surrounding his fiery sermons is an attack on the black church and he rejected those who have labeled him unpatriotic.
\
""I served six years in the military,"" Barack Obama's longtime pastor said. ""Does that make me patriotic? How many years did (Vice President Dick) Cheney serve?""
\
Wright spoke at the National Press Club before reporters and a supportive audience of black church leaders beginning a two-day symposium. He said the black church tradition is not bombastic or controversial, but different and misunderstood by the ""dominant culture"" in the United States.
\
He said his Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago has a long history of liberating the oppressed by feeding the hungry, supporting recovery for the addicted and helping senior citizens in need. He said congregants have fought in the military, including in Afghanistan and Iraq.
\
""My goddaughter's unit just arrived in Iraq this week while those who call me unpatriotic have used their positions of privilege to avoid military service while sending over 4,000 American boys and girls to die over a lie,"" he said.

Officials: More than half of sect girls have been pregnant
\
SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- More than half the teen girls taken from a polygamist compound in west Texas have children or are pregnant, state officials said Monday.
\
A total of 53 girls between the ages of 14 and 17 are in state custody after a raid 3 1/2 weeks ago at the Yearning For Zion Ranch in Eldorado. Of those girls, 31 either have children or are pregnant, said Child Protective Services spokesman Darrell Azar. Two of those are pregnant now, he said; it was unclear whether either of those two already have children.
\
""It shows you a pretty distinct pattern, that it was pretty pervasive,"" he said.
\
State officials took custody of all 463 children at the ranch controlled by the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, saying a pattern of teen girls forced into underage ""spiritual"" marriages and sex with much older men created an unsafe environment for the sect's children.
\
Under Texas law, children under the age of 17 generally cannot consent to sex with an adult. A girl can get married with parental permission at 16, but none of these girls is believed to have a legal marriage under state law.

Iranian official takes new shot U.S. 'destructive' culture
\
TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- A top Iranian judiciary official warned Monday against the ""destructive"" cultural and social consequences of importing Barbie dolls and other Western toys.
\
In the latest salvo in a more than decade-old government campaign against Barbie, Prosecutor General Ghorban Ali Dori Najafabadi said in an official letter to Vice President Parviz Davoudi that the doll and other Western toys are a ""danger"" that need to be stopped.
\
""The irregular importation of such toys, which unfortunately arrive through unofficial sources and smuggling, is destructive culturally and a social danger,"" said the letter, a copy of which was made available to The Associated Press.
\
Iranian markets have been inundated with smuggled Western toys in recent years partly due to a dramatic rise in purchasing power as a result of increased oil revenues.
\
While importing the toys is not necessarily illegal, it is discouraged by a government that seeks to protect Iranians from what it calls the negative effects of Western culture.

Two state Senators from the Upper Valley have landed plum committee assignments and roles in Concord.
\
With Democrats, and women, firmly in charge of the chamber state Sen. Deborah Reynolds has been named Senate Democratic Whip and chairwoman of two committees, Judiciary, and Rules and Enrolled Bills.
\
Reynolds, a Plymouth Democrat and attorney whose district includes the Upper Valley towns of Canaan, Dorchester, Haverhill, Lyme, Orange, Orford and Piermont, also landed spots on the Commerce, Labor and Consumer Protection panel and the tax-writing Ways and Means committee.
\
The Commerce panel gives her a perch to press her top priority, bringing more high-speed Internet coverage to the North Country.
\
Meanwhile, Gov. John Lynch's favorite Republican, state Sen. Bob Odell, R-Lempster, retained his chairmanship of the Senate Ways and Means Committee, despite being in the minority, and will also continue serving on the Finance committee and Energy, Environment and Economic Development.
\
Lynch crossed party lines to back Odell, who represents the Claremont area, in his race against Acworth Democrat Jay Phinizy this fall.
\
""The confidence that the Senate president (Sylvia Larsen) has placed in me underlines the importance of building the budget for the next biennium during this, the most difficult economy of our lifetimes,"" Odell said in a statement about his reappointment to serve a second term as Ways and Means chairman.
\
Meanwhile, one of the new faces in the chamber, Lebanon-area state Sen. Matthew Houde, was named to the Judiciary Committee and Rules and Enrolled Bills, and also will serve as vice chairman of Election Law and Internal Affairs and vice chairman of Public and Municipal Affairs.
\
Neither of the latter two committees are glamour panels, but that comes with being a freshman. And as for judiciary, Houde, a Meriden resident, is an attorney who works at Vermont Law School.
\
Gas Tax Ticker
\
With gas prices plummeting ($1.82 a gallon at some Upper Valley stations) and roads and bridges crumbling, a few politicians around New England are starting to talk about raising state gas taxes to help pay for infrastructure projects.
\
In Vermont, for example, Treasurer Jeb Spaulding has suggested a 5 cent increase in the gas tax, which would raise about $20 million, which he says could be used as a revenue stream to borrow tens of millions of dollars for road repairs.
\
Two prominent Democrats in the New Hampshire House are also proposing a gas-tax increase, though Gov. John Lynch long has been opposed to one.
\
And in Massachusetts, a suburban lawmakers wants an 11 cent gas tax increase to ease likely toll hikes on the Massachusetts Turnpike.
\
Unlike disparities in tobacco taxes, motorists in New Hampshire and Vermont currently pay essentially the same in state-related taxes at the pump -- about 20 cents a gallon. In neighboring Massachusetts, the state gas tax is 23.5 cents a gallon, and in New York state, it's 41 cents per gallon, according to the Tax Foundation.
\
Everyone, of course, pays an additional 18.4 cents per gallon in federal gas tax.
\
Raising gas taxes in one state, such as Vermont, could hurt local stations as motorists would cross the river and buy more gas in New Hampshire. But what if New Hampshire, Vermont and Massachusetts all agreed to raise their gas taxes by the same amount?
\
Vermont Gov. Jim Douglas this week said he would not support such an approach, saying it would be a mistake to raise taxes on the public, especially in a recession.
\
""Even though prices have come down recently, I think it's the wrong way to go,"" Douglas said. ""We have to look at other options.""
\
And Senate President Pro Tempore Peter Shumlin, a Putney Democrat, also said the gas tax is ""regressive by nature"" and a ""bad place to start"" in the search for revenue. Shumlin also said he doesn't want to take on a large debt load, as suggested by Spaulding's plan.
\
But if surrounding states also moved in concert to raise their gas taxes? ""Obviously, any bipartisan effort to raise revenues that doesn't just drive the business to another state ... I would be very open to a discussion like that,"" Shumlin said.
\
Briefly Noted
\
* U.S. Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., said he is too busy as ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee to serve on the oversight panel for the Troubled Asset Relief Program's $700 billion bailout of Wall Street. Fair enough, but Gregg is also up for re-election in 2010, and serving on the board would make fundraising from financial services and insurance firms politically risky. After all, Democrats this year made Sen. John Sununu look like R-Big Oil because of the money he accepted from energy companies.
\
Gregg this fall reported $879,845 cash on hand in his war chest. He'll need many times that to run again in 2010. Many of his major donors have been in the health care industry, but Gregg has also received donations in the past two years from political action committees linked to Citigroup, JP Morgan Chase, Aetna and UBS.
\
* Yet another Dartmouth College graduate is getting a mention as a possible member of Barack Obama's cabinet. The latest is former Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber, who majored in biology at Dartmouth, Class of 1969. He's a possible pick for Interior secretary.

164,"
MONTPELIER -- The Vermont Agency of Transportation will have to put $100 million worth of bridge, road and rail projects on hold if Congress does not shore up the federal highway trust fund by Aug. 1.
\
In all, 38 projects could be affected. The agency was counting on $195 million from the trust fund this year.
\
Unless Congress transfers $9.7 billion from the General Fund to the federal highway trust fund by the end of the month, all states will be forced to cut projects. The trust fund is running out of money because gas tax revenues have declined; Americans are driving less and using more efficient cars. The national gas tax is 18.4 cents per gallon and has not been increased since 1993.
\
Republicans in the U.S. House and Senate are ideologically opposed to raising the gas tax -- or any other tax -- to shore up the fund.
\
The partisan brinksmanship over the solvency of the trust fund has gone further this time than in years past. Republicans in the Senate want to cut transportation spending instead of raising the gas tax.
\
The trouble is, the money has already been obligated to the states.
\
Brian Searles, the secretary of the Agency of Transportation, says the federal government approved 80 to 100 projects for Vermont in this budget cycle. The state has moved ahead with construction on most of those projects, but now that the federal reimbursement rate could be reduced from 80 percent to as little as 30 percent, Searles said the agency had no choice but to put 38 projects on the back burner.
\
""This year we're more worried because we're literally within a couple of weeks of important dates in the legislative process,"" Searles said. ""This bill has to be passed in House and the Senate and then it has to get to the president for his signature (by Aug. 1).""
\
Most of the state's construction program is already under contract, Searles said, ""and we've got to pay those bills."" The state treasurer has set aside up to $15 million for current projects.
\
Searles said the agency will not seek bids for projects that were teed up for construction later this year. ""We don't want to take on additional projects if Congress hasn't acted,"" he said.
\
Twenty of the 38 projects are bridges; the rail funding is for crossing improvements. The agency has not yet decided which projects will have to wait, he said, but the agency would most likely stall the largest projects that consume more money ""so we can get largest amount of payback.""
\
A project that would likely be on the chopping block is one of the largest bridge projects in the history of Vermont -- a $60 million bridge over the West River in the Brattleboro area, he said.
\
The agency has 800 to 1,000 projects under phases of development at any given time. The state's capital program for rail, roads and bridges is $400 million to $450 million out of a total transportation budget of $685 million this year.
\
""It's the most aggressive capital program we've ever had,"" Searles said. The agency was operating under the assumption the state would have the funds to carry out the federal program.
\
The state is still replacing temporary bridges that were installed after Tropical Storm Irene damaged 500 miles of roadway in Vermont.
\
It can take years for projects to obtain federal approval and reach the construction phase. At that point, delays in construction are costly.
\
""This is not the way we should be doing business,"" Searles said. ""Hopefully they'll resolve this because it's a lot of work at the state level, in every state, just to make sure we are managing the work load, paying the bills and not blowing budgets.""
\
Searles is dismayed by congressional infighting over the trust fund, and he says the bickering is a prelude of things to come. The transportation spending legislation known as MAP-21 expires on Sept. 30 and must be reauthorized. He said it's likely Congress will temporarily extend MAP-21 for a few months instead of passing a new capital spending plan for five to six years. MAP-21 took Congress three years to pass; it went into effect in 2012.
\
""I remember a time when transportation was nonpartisan,"" he said. ""You made an investment to build this infrastructure and you needed to maintain it. Most of this is not adding capital construction, we're talking about timely maintenance and rehabilitation to existing infrastructure.""
\
Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who serves on the Environment and Public Works Committee, supports a six-year reauthorization bill.
\
The immediate crisis -- the trust fund gap -- could spur the cancellation of 112,000 construction projects and 700,000 job losses, according to a statement from Sanders' office.
\
Sanders blames Republicans for the job losses and says the nation's infrastructure resemble that of a Third World country if Congress refuses to maintain roads and bridges.
\
""For most of our history, the United States led the world in transportation innovation, from a network of canals, to the transcontinental railroad to the interstate highway system,"" Sanders said. ""These innovations gave our economy a competitive advantage and our workers a decent standard of living. These investments made us the economic leader of the world.
\
""Unfortunately, however, right-wing Republicans have a different vision,"" he said. ""Their anti-government, anti-tax ideology is so extreme that they are prepared to allow America to descend into a Third World infrastructure and, in the process, sabotage our economy and job growth.""
\
On Thursday, the House Ways and Means Committee will consider an eight-month extension of MAP-21. Senate Finance that day will resume markup of a 3-month extension and consideration of an $8 billion highway trust fund bailout.
\
House Republicans wanted to gut funding for Saturday postal deliver service in exchange for bolstering the trust fund. Rep. Peter Welch, D-Vt., led an effort to kill that bill.
\
Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., told Bloomberg News that a compromise on the trust fund is ""the very highest priority this month.""

Health care: We must acknowledge the financial crisis in our health care system and come to the consensus, as a society, that health care should be accessible and affordable for all. Cost-shifting proposals must be fair, and must support the goal of having the resources to provide quality health care for all. Overall costs of health care must be contained or no revamping of insurance plans will work. Methods to help people stay healthier must be supported.\2. Prescription drugs: Vermont must take an active role in the issues affecting the price of prescription drugs and use leveraging power to purchase drugs at affordable prices.\3. Roads: More federal support is essential. Bonds, versus gas or other taxes, and project priorities, must be debated if essential services are to be preserved.\4.

Health care: Vermont's Medicaid program is generous, covers more people as a percent of our population than other states and will absorb more of our future state income. We need to determine whether our optional Medicaid program benefits should be modified, eligibility requirements changed or co-pays, deductibles or fees increased. immediately, Vermont should impose limits on new enrollment until we develop a sustainable Medicaid program. I do not support a tax increase to sustain this program.\2. Prescription drugs: Purchasing assistance or coverage for prescription drugs should be financially sustainable and means tested with co-payments. I support Gov. Douglas' drug re-importation and multi-state purchasing pools efforts.\3. Roads: One-third of our transportation revenue ($81 million) is diverted to non-transportation purposes. Vermont should rededicate that money back to transportation and not raise the gas tax.\4. School choice: Parents and students are the most important individuals involved with school choice. I favor expanding choice to all public schools in Vermont.\5.

Health care: There is no easy answer or quick remedy. I support the collaborative public/private efforts of the Snelling Center for Government to assure that all Vermonters have health insurance. Cutting benefits does not make sense when the number of Vermonters uninsured is increasing and more employers are finding the costs of covering their employees unaffordable. Eliminating high administrative costs and lowering the costs of prescription drugs will help make more funds available without increasing taxes.\2. Prescription drugs: Extend benefits from negotiated discounts and rebates to middle income Vermonters. Publicize Canadian purchasing options. Don't cut existing programs serving elderly and low-income Vermonters.\3. Roads: Do not raise the gasoline tax; rather consider using our bonding capacity (e.g. GARVEE bonds) to raise the funds to fix our deteriorating roads and bridges.\4. School choice: I support Vermont's current school choice law. I want to read the results of the ongoing analysis of Vermont's system of public school choice.\5. Smoking: It's a public health issue.

Health care: The current crisis in health care cannot be easily summarized in a few words. There needs to be a serious evaluation of the way that care is currently provided and charged to the consumer. There may be some instances where free or reduced-cost care can be supported by the patient, likewise savings from those with healthy lifestyles could be transferred to those with more critical concerns. There is no pat one answer ""magic pill."" Legislature will need to make some hard choices.\2. Prescription drugs: The state should join with several other states challenging the ban against re-importation of prescription drugs. Bulk purchase of common medications could be explored for state programs.\3. Roads: Every avenue for federal assistance should be explored. There should be consideration of fees placed on some commercial concerns that use the system the most. Additional taxes should be used as a last resort.\4. School choice: Vermont should fine tune the current school choice system. There are many instances where a child cannot participate in a valuable educational program in another school because the two systems do not have the required agreement. I do not feel it should be expanded to elementary schools.\5. Smoking: I support a smoking ban. Over two million new people a year suffer from the effects of secondhand smoke. The deadly consequences of ingesting someone else's smoke also raise our health-insurance costs.\Chittenden 3-10, one seat, South Burlington\Helen Head\+ PARTY: Democrat\+ INCUMBENT: Since 2003\+ AGE: 51\+ RESIDENCE: South Burlington\+ FAMILY: Married, one son, one daughter\+ OCCUPATION: Planning and development consultant\Answers to questions\1. Health care: With over 60,000 uninsured Vermonters and employers facing a health-care insurance crisis, this is not the time for cuts in state subsidized health-care benefits. There are no easy fixes. I support the Snelling Center for Government's efforts to insure all Vermonters through a public/private solution. And I remain optimistic that we can eliminate the very high administrative costs in our current system, allowing expanded coverage without increasing taxes over the long haul.\2. Prescription drugs: The state should extend negotiated discounts and rebates to middle-income Vermonters, while ensuring re-importation from Canada and increased price disclosure.\3. Roads: GARVEE bonds and other forms of bonding should be considered. I do not favor a higher gas tax to fix roads and bridges.\4. School choice: I support our current school choice law. Public funding should stay with community schools, protecting both the schools and local decision-making about them.\5.

BRATTLEBORO -- Gov. Peter Shumlin's comprehensive energy plan includes a significant portion dedicated to improving the Vermont transportation infrastructure, calling for a greater focus on pedestrian/bicycle projects and increasing the number of in-state vehicles powered by renewable sources.
\
Chris Cole, a planning and policy director with the state's Agency of Transportation, said during a Thursday forum in Brattleboro that the governor's plan reduces petroleum consumption in Vermont while reducing energy use in the transit sector.
\
Shumlin's energy goals overlap with the measurable objectives within the transportation goals, such as having 25 percent of all registered vehicles powered by renewable sources by 2030. Furthermore, increasing public transit ridership by more than 100 percent (to 8.7 million trips) by 2030 is also a target in the plan.
\
On Vermont's railroads, Shumlin calls for quadrupling passenger rail trips (to 400,000) within two decades and double the amount of freight tonnage during the same time period. The plan also calls for twice the number of bicycle and pedestrian commute trips and triple the amount of Park-and-Ride spaces in the state.
\
""It's a bold plan with specific goals,"" Cole said. But VTrans recognizes it has to begin now in the planning process to replace revenue streams if current taxes are reduced as the number of vehicles and fees decline.
\
""Because transportation funds are state funds in Vermont, it's really composed of three sources -- the Department of Motor Vehicles fee, purchase-and-use tax and the gas tax -- and they're roughly a third each in what they contribute to the transportation fund. If we are successful in achieving the transportation goals in the comprehensive energy plan, we're going to reduce the gas tax revenue that comes into the transportation fund and we're going to reduce the available revenues we have to take care of the highways and bridges,"" Cole added. ""So it's an interesting dynamic in that as you're successful in achieving the results of renewable energy, you're actually reducing the funding available to take care of the infrastructure, which we all know we need for a healthy, vibrant economy.""
\
Shumlin, a first-term Democrat, released the final comprehensive energy plan on Thursday, recommending the state strive to obtain 90 percent of its total energy from renewable sources by 2050, largely eliminating Vermont's reliance on fossil fuels by mid-century.
\
""Vermont needs to move forward to protect our environment, gain greater energy independence, and drive innovation and jobs in the energy sectors. This plan puts us on that path,"" Shumlin said in a statement. ""I am proud of the incredible work put in by the many agencies involved and the thousands of citizens who took the time to participate in shaping the ideas and actions that are included.""
\
In addition to the transportation aspect, the plan outlines a greater use of renewable sources for electricity and heating.
\
State Rep. Mollie Burke, a Progressive/Democrat from Brattleboro who sits on the House Transportation Committee, said it is exciting to have conversations at the state-level with changes in Vermont's transit systems.
\
""It was just so exciting to see the vision of our governor being taken down through the agencies and people in those agencies who are committed to a different kind of vision for transportation,"" Burke said at the forum. ""Other countries have done it better than we -- we really have been stuck in the dark ages, I think, in terms of how much we spend for transportation and what we've gotten for it.""
\
Also at the forum was Senior Planner Matt Mann with the Windham Regional Commission. He does not expect too much expansion of the existing infrastructure.
\
""No new roads, so then you're looking at trying to maintain what you already have, and I think we all can attest to the fact that the maintenance of this infrastructure right now has increased over the last 10 years,"" Mann said.
\
But in larger terms of Vermont's infrastructure, Tropical Storm Irene changed almost everything.
\
The Aug. 28 storm hammered the Green Mountain State, causing millions of dollars worth of damage and isolating more than a dozen towns for nearly a week.
\
""Aug. 28 changed my job pretty much forever, and changed Vermont,"" Cole said. The response was immediate, with personnel going into the field to aid motorists and clear roads.
\
Command centers were established in Dummerston and Rutland shortly after the storm, sending VTrans employees throughout Vermont.
\
At the height of the reconstruction, more than 3,000 workers from Vermont and neighboring states were in the field. Cole said the state knew not getting the infrastructure back together fast enough meant losing much-needed tourist dollars in the fall.
\
Thursday's forum, with only a handful of residents in attendance, was sponsored by the Southeast Unit of League of Women Voters and the Brattleboro branch of the American Association of University Women.
\
In May, the league adopted a position supporting alternative modes of transportation, good health for Vermonters and looking at environmental concerns. Shared public transportation is also seen as a strength for Vermont's communities, according to the league.
\
Members did disagree on financing and are focusing on identifying how other states fund their transportation and how that could work in Vermont.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Driving onto an Interstate highway? Crossing a bridge on the way into work? Taking a tunnel under a river or bay? Get ready to pay.
\
With Congress unwilling to contemplate an increase in the federal gas tax, motorists are likely to be paying ever more tolls as the government searches for ways to repair and expand the nation's congested highways.
\
Tolling is less efficient and sometimes can seem less fair than the main alternative, gasoline taxes. It can increase traffic on side roads as motorists seek to evade paying. Some tolling authorities -- often quasi-governmental agencies operating outside the public eye -- have been plagued by mismanagement. And some public-private partnerships to build toll roads have drowned in debt because of too-rosy revenue predictions.
\
Tolls are hardly a perfect solution. But to many states and communities, they're the best option available.
\
""It's very hard in this environment for states to add capacity without charging a toll because they can't afford to do it,"" said Joshua Schank, president of the Eno Center for Transportation, a Washington think tank. ""They're barely able to maintain what they've got, and there is an urgent need for capacity.""
\
Some changes already are under way.
\
In addition to the tolls allowed on Interstates in 15 states, mostly in the Northeast and Midwest, the U.S. has agreed to pilot toll projects on Interstate 95 in Virginia and North Carolina and on Interstate 70 in Missouri.
\
A commission created by Congress to recommend ways to pay for upkeep of the nation's transportation system predicted in 2009 that the U.S. will face nightmarish congestion unless it spends more. The commission estimated all levels of government were spending a cumulative $137 billion less each year than is necessary to maintain and expand the current system. Without action, there will be a $2 trillion-plus backlog by 2035, it said.
\
It's been nearly two decades since Congress last increased the federal gas and diesel taxes that have historically paid for highways. Meanwhile, the cost of road and bridge construction has gone up and the purchasing power of fuel taxes has declined by more than a third. Revenue is also down because people have been driving less due to the uncertain economy and because cars are becoming more fuel-efficient.
\
Federal and state fuel tax revenues peaked in 2007 at $72.4 billion, then dropped to $68.6 billion in 2010, the most recent year for which data are available. Meanwhile, state toll collections rose from $4.9 billion in 2000 to $8.9 billion in 2010, and locally administered tolls rose from $1.6 billion in 2000 to $2.5 billion in 2009.
\
The trust fund that pays for federal highway programs is forecast to go broke sometime next year, though the House and Senate are trying to negotiate a bill to shore up the funding and overhaul transportation programs. It's unclear whether they'll reach a deal, but if they do, it's likely to contain only a short-term financial fix. That means lawmakers will be back again, scratching for more.
\
Tolling is the easiest near-term way to pay the bills, says Robert Atkinson, who chaired the financing commission. ""If you could allow modest tolling on Interstates, you could raise a lot of money,"" he said.
\
Fifteen states, mostly in the Northeast and Midwest, that had turnpikes before the 1956 advent of the Interstate system have grandfathered permission to collect tolls on 2,900 miles of the 47,000-mile system. But federal restrictions prevent other states from placing tolls on federal-aid highways except in limited circumstances.
\
States want Congress to increase their ability to charge tolls and to allow them to use the money for a variety of transportation needs -- not just upkeep of the roads where tolls are collected, said Eugene Conti, North Carolina's transportation secretary, at a Senate hearing last month.
\
But states also have a history of slapping tolls on roads traveled by a large share of out-of-state motorists. When Pennsylvania applied to put tolls on Interstate 80, a route favored by truckers, the federal government rejected the plan partly because some of the money raised would have gone to support public transit in Philadelphia, even though the highway doesn't touch the city's metro area. In 2004, Chicago leased its Skyway, an eight-mile road and bridge, to a private toll operator for 99 years in exchange for $1.8 billion that was used to pay off city debt. The resulting toll increases fell heavily on Indiana commuters who use the road to get to jobs in Chicago.
\
Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., has introduced a bill to give the secretary of transportation oversight of tolling practices. The financing commission made a similar recommendation.
\
What to do about tolling isn't addressed in the highway bill now before Congress because of a standoff earlier this year between senators who favor and oppose easing tolling on Interstate highways.
\
The issue is expected to be revived next year after the retirement of Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, who has led the opposition to greater tolling.
\
One concern is that the Interstate system is aging, which means money must be found to repair and replace the roads.
\
""The roads are out there and we've paid off the mortgage, but that doesn't mean the system is paid for. ... Now the roads are crumbling and we have to upgrade them,"" said Patrick Jones, executive director of the International Bridge, Tunnel and Turnpike Association, which represents toll facilities.
\
Some relaxation of the ban is in the works. The Transportation Department has selected the three states -- Virginia, North Carolina and Missouri -- for pilot toll projects.
\
Under another program, a $2 billion project now under way would add High Occupancy Toll lanes on Interstate 495 in the Virginia suburbs of Washington. The state can't afford to build the lanes on its own, but money raised by a private investment partnership and a $586 million federal loan made the project possible.
\
Motorists who buy an E-ZPass that can be read electronically will be able use the lanes. Toll prices will fluctuate depending on traffic density. If toll lanes are crowded, prices will keep rising until enough motorists decide to remain in the slower lanes. The aim is to give motorists a way to travel quickly, but only if they are willing to pay for it -- an idea that has stirred controversy. Cars with three or more passengers will be able to use the lanes without paying.
\
The administrative costs of tolling are far greater than the gas tax, even when using electronic tolling, said Phineas Baxandall, a senior analyst with the private, consumer-oriented U.S. PIRG.
\
Some tolling agencies could also use ""a dose of sunshine,"" Baxandall said. Because many are quasi-governmental, public disclosure, open meeting and other transparency rules don't always apply, he said. As a result, they frequently operate out of public sight, creating opportunities for corruption or manipulation by industry, he said.
\
A report by the New Jersey comptroller in March said cronyism and mismanagement at the Delaware River Port Authority had wasted millions of dollars. The authority operates four bridges, a ferry and a rail line across the Delaware River between New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
\
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey recently raised cash fares on six Interstate bridges and tunnels to $12 for cars. By 2015, it will cost a five-axle truck paying cash $105 to cross between New York and New Jersey, three times as much as for any other bridge or tunnel in the country, according to the American Trucking Association. Bill Baroni, the authority's deputy executive director, told a Senate hearing the fare hikes are necessary to make up for years of neglect and mismanagement.
\
Despite concerns about more and higher tolls, it's difficult for lawmakers to tell state and local governments not to pursue greater tolling when Congress isn't providing a comparable alternative source of funds.
\
Jones, of the tolling industry association, predicted that as traffic congestion worsens, people ""are going to demand, 'We need better roads, we need more efficiency,' and they are going to ask for tolling and direct user fees to build the transportation that they need.""

When President Barack Obama announced Tuesday that he will impose tougher rules for both vehicle fuel efficiency and tailpipe emissions, his plan was applauded not only by environmentalists but also by representatives of the car industry. My, how things have changed. It wasn't that long ago that the Big Three, if that term still applies, reserved their enthusiasm for measures that made token gestures toward cleaner and more efficient vehicles but essentially allowed them to continue selling high-profit-margin gas-guzzlers.
\
The new standards, to take effect in 2012, go well beyond empty gestures. By 2016, new cars and light trucks would be required to get an average of 35.5 miles per gallon, with cars averaging 39 miles per hour and trucks 30. In 2008, new cars were required to average 27.5 mpg and trucks 22.6. Also in 2016, passenger vehicles would be required to emit no more than 250 grams of carbon dioxide per mile, a 34 percent reduction from what new cars sold today produce.
\
The benefits of requiring cleaner and more efficient cars are not limited to the environment, enormous though those might be in mitigating global warming. A United States that consumes less gasoline is affected less by what happens in the volatile section of the world that now supplies most of our oil.
\
But common sense was only one of the factors that pushed the Alliance of Auto Manufacturers into the same camp as the Sierra Club and the Safe Climate Campaign. Instrumental was the push by California and 13 other states to adopt greenhouse-gas emission standards that were much more rigorous than federal rules. With the federal government now much more likely to grant those states the waiver they needed to impose the tougher rules -- the Bush administration had steadfastly opposed such a move -- the car manufacturers saw the advantage of adopting a national standard. The Obama administration deftly brought everyone on board by making sure that the national standards are as rigorous as those pushed by California. Vermont was one of the earliest states to join the coalition, and Gov. Jim Douglas deserves credit for supporting the movement, even when it meant he had to oppose a president from his own party.
\
Also helpful in nudging U.S. car manufacturers toward accepting the more stringent standards was a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that recognized the right of the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate carbon dioxide emissions.
\
And the fact that the car companies are struggling mightily for their very existence played a role. It's not just that a bankrupt Chrysler, a bailed-out General Motors and a limping Ford don't have the clout they once enjoyed; just as important is their need for some long-term regulatory certainty as they formulate business plans to regain health. Toward that end, federal policymakers should consider using the gas tax to help stabilize fuel prices and minimize the role played by fuel costs in shaping consumer demand. It became easier for car manufacturers to accept higher fuel-efficiency requirements when consumer demand was already pushing them in that direction. The last thing they need is another stretch of cheap gas to undermine their long-term business strategy and engineering investments.
\
We look forward to the day when the domestic automobile industry regains its economic health and is able to restore at least some of the good-paying American jobs that have been lost in recent years. When, and if, that day comes, however, let us hope that it doesn't also bring a return of Detroit's hostility toward all attempts to minimize the threat that gas-powered cars pose to the environmental health of the Earth.

Wednesday, December 10 Boards forum open to all
\
Shaftsbury, Bennington, North Bennington, Pownal and Woodford residents are invited to participate in a community forum to be held on Wednesday at 7 p.m. in the Mount Anthony Middle School cafeteria.
\
The purpose of this meeting is to bring together local select board and school board officials to explore whether there are ways we may be able to collaborate as a greater community in a very challenging economic environment.
\
All boards are under tremendous pressure as we enter a new budget preparation season. Indeed, many of our towns' residents are under difficult financial pressures as well. The Shaftsbury Select Board reached out to our School Board and the North Bennington town and school boards in an attempt to determine if cost savings could be realized by pursuing such avenues as joint purchasing, sharing of town equipment, etc.
\
As a result of some of the questions that were raised at that meeting, a request was made to expand the participants. The joint meeting next week will bring together many local officials from our surrounding community. We hope that the public will participate in this forum.

Gas tax hike a bad idea
\
I recently read that state Treasurer Jeb Spaulding supports increasing the gas tax. Notwithstanding the fact that Mr. Spaulding doesn't have the political courage to actually call this a tax -- referring to it instead as an ""assessment"" -- this proposal is precisely the wrong idea at the wrong time.
\
The treasurer should not use lower gas prices as an excuse to push through a new tax during what is becoming a deeper recession by the day. Even if gas prices are relatively low compared to what they have been, struggling families need to keep and save as much as they possibly can during this difficult time. If the state needs a revenue source for transportation projects, it should consider stopping the raid on the transportation fund, as Governor Douglas has begun to do in recent years.
\
The Legislature should not raise a tax that will hurt struggling workers the hardest because it didn't have the good sense to use the transportation money it already had on transportation. If Governor Douglas continues to accelerate the decline of the transportation fund raid -- as he has promised to do -- we can make infrastructure improvements without imposing a punitive tax on our state's work force and families.

Up with Upward Bound

I read with personal interest the Dec. 5 piece, ""SVC's Upward Bound seeks high school applicants,"" both because I had the good fortune to be on the staff of the federal ""war on poverty"" when this brilliant program was created and because I later had the occasion to be instrumental in bringing it to Southern Vermont.
\
For more than four decades, Upward Bound programs at colleges and universities around the country have quietly and effectively gone about the business of preparing tens of thousands of young people, who would not otherwise have such an opportunity, for a successful college experience and a brighter future.

"
171,"washington -- Business and labor groups kicked off a week of dire warnings and noisy jackhammers to promote highway and bridge construction and overcome congressional reluctance to boost funding for the projects.\""If we don't do anything, nothing is going to happen,"" Thomas Donohue, CEO of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said at a panel discussion Monday at the Newseum. ""All of us have got to go up and explain to our representatives that we're so glad to have them -- and we need the money, or we might not keep them.""\In the same vein, Laborers' International Union of North America announced a $1million campaign in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan for radio ads and billboards to highlight the costs and safety perils of deteriorating highways and bridges.\The radio ad, which features jackhammers, says the country doesn't need another bridge collapse like Interstate 35W in Minneapolis in 2007, which killed 13 people. Billboards say potholes cause injuries and prompt $80 billion in auto repairs.\""We're not trying to scare people -- we are trying to inform the American public,"" said Terry O'Sullivan, the union's general president.\Construction funding is urgent because the highway trust fund is projected to run out of money for new projects in August.\The size of the shortfall is uncertain, depending on construction spending and tax revenues. The Transportation Department projected in March a $700 million deficit by September. But the American Road and Transportation Builders Association expects Congress will need to provide $16 billion to cover the gap. States are expected to halt or postpone projects at that point, which business and labor groups say would eliminate jobs and hurt the economy.\Even if lawmakers plug the shortfall of billions of dollars this year, a broad spectrum of business, labor and state governmental advocates are urging Congress to create a new funding source for highway and bridge construction that would last four or five years. A long-term bill is important because states must budget for projects months or years in advance.\To promote the need for repairs, advocates cite a study of Federal Highway Administration data that says 63,000 bridges nationwide need repairs.\AAA, the automobile club, estimated that poorly maintained roads cost each motorist an extra $324 a year for repairs and operating costs.\Pete Ruane, CEO of the American Road and Transportation Builders Association, said the funding solution can't be ""one of the mystery-meat proposals that are out there -- not one-off stuff, real money the states can plan on over a sustainable period of time.""\Funding is contentious because the highway trust fund has traditionally been paid for by a gas tax of 18.4 cents per gallon, a rate set in 1993 that hasn't kept pace as cars became more fuel efficient. But raising the gas tax or overhauling the corporate-tax code -- as President Obama proposed instead -- is unlikely in an election year.\Major business and labor groups have endorsed a boost in the gas tax. ""Increasing the gas tax, however, is going to require some courage, which seems in short supply in Washington these days,"" Donohue said.\The week of advocacy coincided with the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee planning a vote Thursday on a highway bill, but without deciding on additional funding."
172,"
The New Hampshire Constitution stipulates that money from the gasoline tax and motor vehicle registration fees shall be ""used exclusively for the construction, reconstruction and maintenance of public highways within the state, including the supervision of traffic"" and that ""no part of such revenues shall, by transfer of funds or otherwise, be diverted to any other purpose whatsoever.""
\
Clear enough?
\
Not to the Legislature, which interprets this language broadly. So broadly, in fact, that money intended for roads and bridges often takes a detour and ends up in departments far, far away from Transportation.
\
Surprised? Don't be. This is the sort of ingenuity necessary to keep the wheels of government turning in a state that is always running on empty, or nearly so.
\
Over the past decade, money from the highway fund has been transferred over to health and human services (help for those traveling on life's rocky road, perhaps?); to the Office of Information Technology (upkeep on that information highway, no doubt); to courts (traffic congestion?) and even to cultural affairs (the art of asphalt paving?).
\
To be fair, some of the transfers make some sense. The Department of Safety, for instance, got $70 million this year to cover costs including highway patrols by the state police. But some $30 million of the $273 million fund was transferred out of DOT to help pay for services that have a tenuous connection, at best, to road construction and repair and supervision of traffic.
\
In other words, the New Hampshire gas tax appears not to be a dedicated tax for roads but rather a multi-purpose tax for ... whatever.
\
Where the money comes from and where it goes is important, because the state is trying to figure out how to pay for a so-called 10-year transportation plan originally estimated at $4 billion. Much of the money comes from the federal government -- but not enough. Revenues are so short that completing all the projects on the state's wish list -- including important work in the Upper Valley such as bridge repairs along Route 4 and a new Route 12A interchange -- would take about 35 years, according to officials. So the state has drafted a new $2.9 billion plan and is holding hearings. ""It would still take 22 years to complete all the projects on the list,"" says Bill Cass, the DOT director of project development, who came to City Hall in Lebanon last week.
\
One logical step is to increase the gas tax, which at 20 cents a gallon hasn't been raised since 1992; inflation and fuel efficiency have diluted the value of the highway fund, and the sale of gasoline is falling somewhat as gas prices rise. The combined gas taxes in New Hampshire (39 cents for both federal and state) are low relative to other states, including several in the Northeast -- gas taxes are 10 cents higher in Connecticut and Rhode Island, for instance. And the tax has some beneficial effects on the environment, as it encourages people to share rides, to take public transportation and to buy more fuel-efficient cars.
\
But you won't hear any of these arguments from Gov. John Lynch, who says he's not ready to raise the gas tax or to talk revenue. ""Before we consider the need for additional revenue -- which I don't think is there -- we need to manage the funds that we have today,"" he told the Associated Press. He wants to take a close look at those transfers out of the highway fund.
\
Unfortunately, the state's tank is as empty as the governor's rhetoric. Don't get us wrong: We're all for fiscal discipline. But the transfers out of the existing highway fund are merely examples of how the state sputters along in order to pay for essential services. Road maintenance is just one of many casualties.
\
If Gov. Lynch wants to take a direct route to solving this fiscal problem, then there's only one way to go: toward an income tax.

Rising aboveour foibles
\
Editor of the Reformer:
\
In response to a recent letter (""On religion, gender ..."" March 4) and the rather negative view of religion this individual expressed: Many of the issues this individual voices are sadly true. There have indeed been too many wars waged in the name of religion and they continue on today. Throughout history many cultures were not properly respected. The three major Western religions rooted in the Bible have been fundamentally patriarchal and woman for centuries have been marginalized and often mistreated. However, I believe the letter writer grossly mistakes the purpose of religion, and the fundamental concepts behind these three.
\
As a Christian, I know that the human element often falls short of the lofty goal and ethic of religion. Throughout the ages, pure religion has suffered from the human intervention of creeds and dogma and greed and lust for power, which have corrupted their primary principles.
\
At the core of Christianity is the simple rule to love God, the Creator of all good things, and to love your neighbor, to love those that love you and to love your enemies as well. To be compassionate, to be humble, to be merciful, gracious and kind. At the root of all three major Western religions are the Ten Commandments including respect for elders, not to steal, covet, lie, commit adultery or kill. All of these key elements are worthy human qualities we should all strive to embody.
\
For a long time I did not have faith, mainly because of what I perceived to be hypocrisy. But I also always realized there was something much bigger than me. And at some point I realized the hypocrisy was not part of true religion, it was part of mortal existence, and religion is a structure which encourages and enables one to strive to live beyond those foibles.
\
We live in a vastly beautiful world/universe in which one cannot help but wonder about its origins and the simple truths that govern it. Religion at its core is a worship of the Creator, which I take to be principle, or law, truth, life and love.
\
As it would turn out my particular sect of Christianity was discovered and founded by a woman, Mary Baker Eddy, a New Englander. Through this religion I have grasped a higher idea of life, a more ethereal consciousness of being, which also brings about healing to myself, to others and to the world.
\
I should also mention that woman are making wonderful strides forward both in societies around the world and in religious hierarchies. In fact my sister-in-law is a Methodist minister whose church provides a place of worship for LGBT individuals (though not exclusively) and strives for their equal place in our society.
\
Simply put, the God and behavior that this letter writer associates with these religions in not the God I worship or the behavior I approve of. I have no problem with this person's desire to remain an atheist, but in doing so I wish they could find a way to accept and respect those who strive to live by laws of goodness which they find in religion.

The gas tax and education funding
\
Editor of the Reformer:
\
A statement attributed to the chair of Westminster School Board (""Westminster voters approve 'breathtaking' tax increase,"" March 3) warrants closer attention and a correction.
\
As an explanation for an increase to the statewide property tax rate increase, the chairman of the School Board claimed that this was due to a lack of revenue generated by the state's gasoline tax, as environmentally friendly Vermonters are purchasing less gas for their fuel-efficient vehicles.
\
I have great empathy for the chairman because he has the unenviable position of having to explain the unexplainable to the voters of Westminster, while trying to keep up with a complex system that continues to evolve into an even more complex web of shifting pieces. For this reason, I don't fault him for getting it wrong on his comment about lower gas tax revenues having an impact on the property tax rate.
\
To set the record straight -- the gasoline tax does not support the state's education fund, nor does it have an impact on the statewide property tax rate. While not relevant to the education fund, it is worth pointing out that the gas tax was increased last year to replace lost revenues attributable to lower gas and diesel consumption. Revenue from the gas tax funds the transportation fund, which goes towards the maintenance of our roads and bridges.
\
There are a number of factors driving up the statewide property tax rate, but they principally come down to statewide growth in per pupil spending that exceeds the rate of inflation, a stagnant grand list, growth in income sensitivity payments, and erosion of general fund support for the education fund (as a proportion of overall funding).
\
While reasonable people can disagree on whether we have the right education finance system, there can be near universal agreement that we have an incredibly complex system. The system has become so unwieldy that it is now virtually impossible to understand the link between school spending decisions and tax impacts.

Pageant not about perfection
\
Editor of the Reformer:
\
In regards to a recent letter regarding the Winter Carnival's Princess Pageant (""What do we value?"" March 5), I would first like to say, congratulations to the letter writer's daughter and all of the other contestants for even trying the pageant. It's not easy to get up and perform in front of people. I never felt the pageant was about perfection, but about getting over your fears and making new friendships and finding new strengths.
\
At last year's pageant, we had all different shapes, sizes and colors of participants. And there was a nice variety of talent as well. Every year is different because you never know what kids want to participate or what parents will let their daughters participate. The committee and Kelly's has nothing to do with who participates (except when it comes to age). I believe a good number of girls from Kelly's participate, but it's because they want to and their parents let them.
\
Kelly donates a lot of her time to this and many other events in the community. She has done tap dance classes at pre-schools (to which she also donated tap shoes) and she choreographs the dances for the Princess and Queens Pageants, which is donated time as well. My girls used to go to Kelly's and they loved it. She did a great job with the kids and I'd recommend her dance classes to anyone. My girl no longer dance because they have fallen in love with sports, otherwise they'd still be dancing. I don't know Kelly personally, but for someone to bash her and the girls that go to her academy and participate in the pageant is just absurd to me.
\
Because of people like the letter , it makes ""new"" people to these experiences very hesitant to join. Not everyone is going to win, not everyone is going to have a great or good experience in something like this. But to single out someone that has nothing to do with who or how the pageant is run is disgusting to me. She should be more focused on reassuring her daughter and encouraging her to try again. As for giving out the trophies on stage, that's a good idea and should be something the committee should look into.
\
My point is that Kelly is a great person that donates her time and studio for events and that's the only way she's involved in the pageant. As for a variety of girls, that's all in the girls wanting to participate and parents letting them. This is a great pageant and I don't want the letter writer's experience with it to discourage others from trying it.

I'd like to welcome the residents and Town of Vernon back to the regular (unsubsidized) status of the rest of the smaller towns in Windham County. We have no town police departments and use the Windham County Sheriff's Department out of Newfane and the Vermont State Police who have a barracks in West Brattleboro. We pay private companies (one of which is in Vernon) for our trash pickup. We have modest recreational activities programs. We pay our fair share of local and state property taxes. I realize you've felt like you ""had it good "" for over 40 years and have gotten used to the lowest costs of living in Windham County. But you have also born the burden of potentially highly toxic environment with Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant in your backyard. We'll all feel safer with it closed, once the highly toxic 40 years worth of spent fuel is dealt with. You can stop complaining about having to now pay your way instead of having Vermont Yankee paying it for you. Welcome to the real world.

It resurfaced briefly on the Senate floor Wednesday, met some fiery criticism, but could be back for another appearance before the legislative session is over.\Sen. Matt Dunne, D-Windsor, offered an amendment to the transportation bill Wednesday, calling for a $50 surcharge on the sale of new vehicles that get 20-24 miles per gallon, $250 on those that get 19 miles per gallon or less, and $300 on vehicles over 8,500 pounds. Pickup trucks would be exempt.\The surcharge would generate $3.9 million, based on 2005 Vermont vehicle sales figures.\""We have an extraordinary number of vehicles"" with low gas mileage, said Dunne, the driver of a Volkswagen Jetta. The surcharge would discourage people from buying gas hogs while also taxing the vehicles that do the most damage to the roads and the environment, he said.\His amendment didn't last long before his fellow senators raised questions about the surcharge and the procedural impropriety of springing it on them just as the transportation bill was about to receive final approval. Dunne withdrew the amendment after a quick debate over its merits.\Sen. Richard Mazza, D-Chittenden/Grand Isle, chairman of the Senate Transportation Committee, was furious that his committee had not seen the amendment before Wednesday. ""It impacts thousands of people in Vermont,"" Mazza said. ""No one's had a chance to comment on it.""\Sen. Wendy Wilton, R-Rutland, said the surcharge would unfairly hit those who need large vehicles. ""In a sense this amendment is anti-family.""\Dawn Terrill, state Agency of Transportation secretary, listened to the debate and said afterward that the administration opposes the surcharge. Vehicles that use more gas already pay more of the existing gas tax, she said, and there's not enough time left in the session to study the surcharge.\Sen. Ann Cummings, D-Washington, chairwoman of the Senate Finance Committee, said her committee briefly considered the gas-guzzler tax before concluding it was too complicated to tackle in the time the committee had available. However, she said, ""We thought it was an interesting concept.""\It appears to interest other legislative leaders, too, and could resurface in a conference committee or on a tax bill as the session winds down. ""It's not off the table,"" Senate President Pro Tempore Peter Welch, D-Windsor, said after Wednesday's floor debate.\""It does have life,"" said Sen. Susan Bartlett, D-Lamoille, chairwoman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. ""I'm real supportive of it.""\So is House Speaker Gaye Symington, D-Jericho, who said Vermont faces serious road and bridge maintenance issues in the coming years, and the increase in motor-vehicle fees in the Senate's version of the transportation bill won't provide the money needed. The Senate bill also doesn't include the $2 million that towns need for their roads, she said.\""The House is looking for a sustainable source of revenue,"" Symington said. ""Vermont is seriously behind in the upkeep of its roads.""\Rep. Robert Dostis, D-Waterbury, chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, said constituents who complain to him about the House's vote to increase the gas tax tend to be more favorable toward a tax on low-gas-mileage vehicles. ""People are resoundingly supportive of that,"" he said.\Harold Schwartz of Wolcott, who was parking his Honda CR-V sport-utility vehicle along a Montpelier street Wednesday afternoon, said the surcharge sounded reasonable to him. His car, rated at 20-24 mpg, would fetch a $50 surcharge upon purchase, according to Dunne's plan. ""That wouldn't be that much money,"" Schwartz said. And the $250 fee for bigger vehicles? ""I think those people can afford it,"" he said.\Mike Bushey was less enthusiastic. He's a consultant for Handy Chevrolet in St. Albans and said the surcharge would be one more hit on working people who need the vehicles to fit their families, while the oil companies continue to make huge profits. He suggested a tax on alcohol instead.\Contact Terri Hallenbeck at 229-9141 or thallenb@bfp.burlingtonfreepress.com"

\
For almost as long as the internal combustion engine has propelled vehicles on public roads, states and the federal government have paid for maintaining those roads with a tax levied on each gallon of gas.
\
In Vermont, that's about 20 cents a gallon. The federal government collects 18.4 cents per gallon in taxes.
\
In 2006, Vermont collected taxes on 361 million gallons sold, but by 2011, that amount had dropped to 330 million gallons, according to the Associated Press. While it's true that many of us have cut down on unnecessary car trips in the past few years, most of the drop in gasoline sales is attributable to carpooling and higher fuel economy and the use of hybrids and electric cars.
\
While that's good for the environment, it's not good for the Agency of Transportation, which hoped to raise $232 million in the 2012/2013 fiscal year but is falling short of that goal, just as it has over the past six years, according to the AP report.
\
Expect the tax revenues to drop even further as higher fuel-efficiency standards are implemented. By 2025, cars are mandated to average 54.5 mpg.
\
But it's not just about using the roads less or more efficient vehicles on our highways. In 1993, the gas tax was equal to 17 percent of the cost of a gallon of fuel. Today it's only 5 percent.
\
Now some states, including Vermont, are mapping out a possible alternative: Taxing drivers not based on how much fuel is burned but how far each vehicle travels.
\
Lawmakers in Oregon are hoping to introduce legislation that would impose a ""vehicle miles traveled"" tax on cars of 2015 model year or later that get 55 mpg or better. In Washington state, owners of electric vehicles will soon have to pay a $100 tax. In Massachusetts, the state is considering raising the gas tax or implementing a VMT.
\
Mileage fees would also go a long way to getting trucks to pay for the actual damage they cause to roads. According to the Federal Highway Administration, heavy trucks only pay for about half the damage they cause.
\
The Government Accountability Office recently issued a report that concluded mileage-based user fees ""can lead to more equitable and efficient use of roadways by charging drivers based on their actual road usage and by providing pricing incentives to reduce road use.""
\
Mileage fees could range from .9 cents a mile for cars and 3.2 cents for trucks to 2.2 cents per mile for cars and 8.4 cents for trucks, according to the GAO, depending on whether we want to maintain the status quo or actually improve the infrastructure.
\
Vermont Transportation Secretary Brian Searles told AP that calculating how much of a VMT tax is owed would be done through the global positioning system devices that are expected to be standard equipment in cars later this decade.
\
""It's a GPS device that is capable of tracking location, time,"" he said, adding that he was aware that might raise privacy concerns.
\
While Allen Gilbert, executive director of the Vermont chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, didn't say whether he believed it was an invasion of privacy, he did tell AP ""I'm sure there's going to be a big public outcry when people hear about this.""
\
But it's not just GPS technology that can be used.
\
One device records miles traveled since a fill-up and then communicates with the gas pump on the next fill-up how much tax is owed.
\
There's a discussion about a flat tax, but it would be unfair to those who drive less than, say, 5,000 miles a year, while others are driving 10,000 or 20,000 miles a year.
\
Other people suggest we should just raise the tax, tack on a carbon fee and also use congestion pricing. Or electrics and hybrids could pay a tax separate from the tax paid by fossil-fueled vehicles.
\
Another question we would like answered is should a vehicle such as the Escalade pay the same VMT as a vehicle that registers one-third of the weight?
\
Other than the privacy and technical questions that need to be answered, there's also the question of whether the gas tax would be eliminated in favor of the usage fees. We hope a VMT would replace a per-gallon tax, but we wouldn't put it past the state or federal government to tack on the VMT without eliminating a per-gallon tax.
\
One thing is for certain, as mileage increases and more and more electrics and hybrids come onto the roads, a new system of taxation to help pay for our bridges and roads will need to be implemented. We look forward to hearing all the ideas.

177,"Can tax-shifting promote clean industry and promote behavior that's good for the environment? \Given the choice of spending the same money to live and work in a clean, healthy environment or to be stuck in a polluted, congested one, almost everyone would choose the clean place. \What if Vermont instituted tax policy designed at no additional cost to help guarantee residents the clean, healthy place most of them want? This is the intriguing idea behind the notion of green taxes: shifting taxes on traditional sources such as income, property and payroll to things such as gas and fuel oil. \004 . 0000.09While the proposal is radical and in its infancy two centuries of tax code will not change without upheaval it deserves study. Vermont should not be afraid to explore tax reforms that discourage pollution, protect clean air and water, and promote the creation of well-paying jobs in clean industry. \Lawmakers indicated last week they favor spending $$@$!5,500 to study the concept of green taxes in Vermont. This is a good step. The study should examine the impacts of several tax-shift scenarios. \These should include a major employer such as IBM, to see how the company's bottom line might be affected by reducing or eliminating the payroll tax but increasing taxes on energy use and hazardous waste production. \The study also should consider scenarios for a small business, a nonprofit enterprise, a dairy farm and a branch of state government. Likewise, the impacts on families especially low-income ones should be studied. \There will be many logistical questions. If property taxes are reduced, what formula will be used to shift new tax revenues on fossil fuels into municipalities? What implications will this have? \Some answers to tax-shifting consequences exist in European countries, which have for years imposed heavy gas taxes to help fund public transportation, social services and pensions. Just how these proposals would work in Vermont is unknown. A recent proposal to impose a tax on gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles and light trucks, for example, was shelved just weeks after it was introduced. \Supporters of green taxes point out that Vermont has moved in this direction with the 4-cent gas tax imposed by Act 60 to help pay for education. \An intriguing report by the state Public Service Department suggests imposing more fuel taxes could cut energy use for transportation, reduce emissions that cause acid rain and smog, and increase employment in the long run. \How the scenarios on paper might play out in reality is guesswork. Vermonters rightly put enormous importance in a clean environment. Tax policies that preserve and enhance this environment deserve more study. \004 . 0008.05 00000\OPINION; Pg. 04E"
178,"Concord Monitor\More efficient vehicles would pay a sliding fee to compensate for paying less gas tax under a bill going through the Legislature, which would start adding the penalty to vehicles getting as little as 21 mpg.\The bill passed the House floor, 194-143, last Thursday and now is being considered by the House Finance Committee. Fees would be highest for the most-fuel efficient vehicles, as the bill establishes a variable charge as high as $111 for electric vehicles, down to zero for vehicles that get less than 20 mpg.\It differs from laws in many other states that place a flat fee on all electric or hybrid vehicles. \A separate bill before the House Public Works and Highways Committee would do just that, adding $100 to the annual registration fee for all hybrid vehicles and $200 to all electric vehicles.\The motivation behind the various pieces of legislation is concern about how to pay to maintain roads and highways. For decades, road-repair money in New Hampshire and elsewhere has largely come from state and federal gasoline taxes, on top of fixed registration fees. \This means that the more a vehicle drives, the more its owner pays in gas tax, acting as a proxy for how much wear they caused on the roads.\The arrival of efficient vehicles using less gasoline — and now electric cars that use no gasoline at all — has upended this calculation, prompting the state to find new ways to bring road upkeep money in line with drivers’ road usage.\Opponents of such extra payments say they penalize vehicle owners who do less damage to the environment while rewarding the owners of inefficient, more-polluting vehicles. \The $111 figure in House Bill 1763 is the calculated amount that a 20-mpg vehicle would pay into the fund used to maintain New Hampshire highways if it drove 10,000 miles in a year. This charge would be paid on top of annual vehicle registration and kept in a separate fund for highway upkeep.\The amount paid by a vehicle would depend on its EPA-rated mileage. Vehicles that get better than 20 mpg would pay a small portion of the $111 figure, while vehicles with higher mileage would pay a larger portion, up to the full $111 charge for electric vehicles. \Details of what the specific charges may be are not included in the bill as it is written.\The bill says implementing the program would cost an estimated $330,000, partly for equipment to connect local registrars’ offices with official EPA mpg ratings.\CREDIT: By David Brooks "

Endres\+ PARTY: Republican\+ INCUMBENT: Since 2001\+ AGE: 55\+ RESIDENCE: Milton\+ FAMILY: Married, two children\+ OCCUPATION: former owner, Mountain Transit Inc.\Answers to questions\1. Health care: Our health programs are among the most generous in the nation. Last session, the Legislature moved to a premium-based system to save money. A bi-partisan Medicaid Sustainability Committee will report recommendations to the Legislature in January. Rather than raise taxes or cut benefits, I would put pressure on the federal government to eliminate charge-backs to the state program. I would also recommend transferring more General Fund dollars to the Health Access Trust Fund, which has been level funded the last two years.\2. Prescription drugs: 6We should continue to fight for re-importation. The multi-state purchasing pool is a good first step. Educating physicians on less expensive alternatives is also an effective tool. 53. Roads: 6Although we have recently added additional funds for these needs, we should use all of the Transportation Fund for road and bridges, not other programs.\4. School choice: I favor extending our current choice program to all public schools K-12 and see how that works before further expansion. Let parents decide what is best for their child.\5. Smoking: I would encourage local municipalities to continue making the smoking decision based on the needs and wants of their own communities.\Mary Ann Duffy Godin\+ PARTY: Democrat\+ AGE: 62\+ RESIDENCE: Milton\+ FAMILY: Married, five children\+ OCCUPATION: Retired high school business and technology teacher\Answers to questions\1. Health care: No one wants to raise taxes or cut benefits for our most vulnerable citizens -- the only alternative is to reform the entire health care system. I have no magical solution to this problem, but I think the first step is to elect people to the Legislature who are willing to recognize that a problem exists and have the gumption to do something about it.\2. Prescription drugs: I support the re-importation of American drugs from Canada and believe the right to negotiate for fair 5002 . 0000.006drug prices which has been blocked by the Bush administration should be reinstated.\3. Roads: State leaders must continue to fight for Jeffords' federal highway bill that would provide $1 billion over six years to Vermont to pay for aging road and bridges.\4. School choice: School choice is no choice. I support good teachers, rigorous curricula and improved class sizes. These are the ingredients for an excellent and equitable education.\5. Smoking: I support a statewide ban on smoking in bars. Smoking and second-hand smoke have been identified as leading causes of poor health; we must work everywhere to promote healthy lifestyles.\Lorinda Henry\+ PARTY: Democrat\+ AGE: 56\+ RESIDENCE: Milton\+ FAMILY: Two grown daughters\+ OCCUPATION: Writer, artist and elder care worker\Answers to questions\1. Health care: We need to look into areas where we can cut costs or raise revenue before we consider raising taxes. One example is the registration of lobbyists, where pharmaceutical companies prevail. Presently the employers get a steep discount for each lobbyist after the first. When was the last time we got a discount for registering a second care or snowmobile? One such change won't cover $52.7 million, but I think we owe it to people to look at small changes as well as large ones.\2. Prescription drugs: Vermont filed a lawsuit with the FDA on August 19, 2004, to get relief from an injunction prohibiting importation of drugs from Canada. This is a needed first step.\3. Roads: We need to look to Washington, where they load us with unfunded mandates, say that they haven't raised taxes and force states to raise them instead. Sen. Jeffords is working on a bill to get more highway money back to Vermont and I support that.\4. School choice: School choice is biased towards advantaged students, especially in rural states where transportation is an issue. I do not support any expansion of the program.\5. Smoking: Since smoking by adults in not illegal in Vermont and since bars are not places where children are affected, I believe any regulation of smoking in bars should be left to local jurisdiction.\Doran D. Metzger\+ PARTY: Republican\+ AGE: 30\+ RESIDENCE: Milton\+ FAMILY: Engaged\+ OCCUPATION: Associated Industries of Vermont\Answers to questions\1. Health care: Health care in Vermont has reached a crisis state. Looking the other direction hoping the problem would go away hasn't worked. Legislative leaders must make a commitment to address this problem during the next biennium. The Legislature should not adjourn until a solid plan of action is developed. The rising cost of health care is an issue that affects every single Vermonter. The Medicaid deficit is just one piece. All options need to be on the table.\2. Prescription drugs: The state must make every effort to make prescription drugs more affordable. Participating in a multi-state buying pool is one major step we must take.\3. Roads: New taxes aren't necessary. Priority in the state budget must be given to a modernized infrastructure. Vermont's economy will suffer without sufficient roads and bridges.\4. School choice: Vermont needs to continue to expand the option of school choice. Parents foremost should have the ability to control the educational decisions affecting their children.\5. Smoking: A statewide ban imposed from Montpelier would be very controversial. To continue town by town action would prove more informative, less intrusive and further legitimacy.\Chittenden 5-1, one seat, Shelburne\Joyce Errecart\+ PARTY: Republican\+ INCUMBENT: Since 2003\+ AGE: 54\+ RESIDENCE: Shelburne\+ FAMILY: Widowed, son and daughter\+ OCCUPATION: Former tax lawyer\Answers to questions\1. Health care: I'll review carefully the recommendations of the Medicaid Sustainability Committee, which includes members of the House and Senate and Governor's administration, and which will report to the Legislature in January of 2005. I am hopeful that much of the shortfall can be filled with federal funds that should be made available, and with state revenue collections that exceeded revenue forecasts. I do not support raising taxes.\2. Prescription drugs: Vermont should continue to seek approval for re-importing Canadian drugs, should expand the multi-state drug purchasing pool and should facilitate the formation of new purchasing pools.\3. Roads: We must devote gasoline tax revenue to improving Vermont's highways and stop diverting money from the Transportation Fund. I don't support increasing the gas tax.\4. School choice: One school can't be all things to all students. I support parents and students at all grade levels having broad choices in school programs.\5.

All revenues and creative financing would need to be looked into.\2. Prescription drugs: I believe Vermont has a responsibility to look at and evaluate every possible means to help its citizens attain affordable prescription drugs.\3. Roads: Our roads and bridges do need attention. I would look at what funding sources seem the most appropriate and available for the economic time at hand.\4.

We are a small state known for generous social programs, but we have a mismatch with the dollars our economy can raise. We need to re-examine the structure, eligibility and way we deliver health care before even thinking about raising taxes.\2. Prescription drugs: Support governor's multi-state buying pool and FDA suit for access to Canadian market. Press for less expensive generic equivalents and more brand name competition.\3. Roads: Reduce severe drain on transportation revenues that fund other things. Establish basic transportation infrastructure priorities. Take new approaches to doing business. No gas tax increase.\4.

Friday, September 12 WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress on Thursday sent President Bush an $8 billion rescue package for the federal highway trust fund. The infusion comes as the trust fund, which relies on declining revenues from the federal gas tax, verges on going broke, threatening road and bridge projects in every state.
\
The House passed the measure on a 376-29 vote Thursday, a day after the Senate overcame objections from conservative senators and passed it on a voice vote. The legislation transfers $8 billion from the Treasury's general fund to the highway fund, ensuring that ongoing construction projects won't be interrupted.
\
The White House had previously threatened to veto the measure, calling it ""both a gimmick and a dangerous precedent that shifts costs form users to taxpayers at large.""
\
But the administration shifted positions after Transportation Secretary Mary Peters last week revealed that the trust fund would run out of money this month, which would delay payments to states for infrastructure projects and threaten the jobs of hundreds of thousands of construction workers.
\
""We must act,"" said Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga. ""The trust fund is broke, out of money. Our state and local governments, drivers, construction workers and many others suffer when highway projects are delayed."" He and others pointed out that in 1998 the government moved $8 billion from the trust fund, then enjoying a large surplus, to the general fund for deficit reduction, and that this measure returned borrowed money.
\
It has long been anticipated that the 52-year-old trust fund would move into the red next year, a result of the reluctance of Congress to raise the gas tax, unchanged since 1993 despite inflation and soaring construction costs. The federal fuel tax is 18.4 cents a gallon, or 24.3 cents for diesel.
\
But the fund, which had a $10 billion surplus just three years ago, has had a rapid change in fiscal fortune as drivers, responding to higher gas prices, have curtailed their driving and switched to more fuel-efficient vehicles.
\
Peters on Wednesday commended the Senate for its swift action to address the immediate crisis but added in a statement that ""Congress must eliminate the billions in wasted spending, thousands of unneeded earmarks and hundreds of conflicting and contradictory special interest programs in order to make sure states don't face this situation again.""
\
Stephen E. Sandherr, chief executive director of the Associated General Contractors of America, expressed relief that Congress had finally acted. ""We knew this shortfall was coming and we have made this a priority for the last two years,"" he said. ""The money was set to run out, states were going to be left holding the bag and contractors would have been forced to lay people off.""
\
The few opponents of the bill blamed the current crisis on the 6,300 earmarks -- lawmakers' pet projects -- worth some $24 billion, included in the $286 billion highway bill Congress passed in 2005. That bill expires next year.
\
""Part of the reason we are having to steal money from the general fund,"" said Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., is ""we just went hog wild in 2005. We've got to stop this earmarking process.""
\
Democrats in turn thanked the White House and Republicans for letting the stalled bill move forward. ""I'm glad the Republicans came to their senses -- you can't play politics with 300,000 jobs when we're in a recession,"" said Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calf., chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works.
\
The American Road and Transportation Builders Association, using Transportation Department figures, said that without the fix federal highway aid to the states would drop from $35 billion in the fiscal year ending on Sept. 30 to $24 billion in the next fiscal year 2009. It estimated that 379,000 jobs would be lost without congressional action.
\
According to the estimate, California would lose 32,000 jobs, Texas almost 30,000, New York and Florida 20,000 each and Pennsylvania 19,000.
\
The House first passed the $8 billion relief bill in July, but Senate Republicans have thwarted several Democratic efforts to move the legislation in the Senate, demanding they first get votes on issues such as the proliferation of earmarks in highway spending bills.
\
""Much of this bill is not about roads and bridges,"" said Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C. ""It's numerous wasteful earmarks that I'm afraid could end up as part of this $8 billion.""
\
Because highway money is paid out over a number of years, postponement or delay in starting a project can have long-term ramifications. ""The urgency of this bill is very critical. We cannot delay it,"" said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash. Without the money, she said, next week federal reimbursements for state projects could drop to as little as 64 percent of promised funds.

Monday, December 22 State: N.H. businesses lost millions in storm
\
MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- New Hampshire officials estimate last weekend's ice storm will cost state businesses tens of millions of dollars in storm damage, lost productivity and missed sales.
\
Steve Boucher from the New Hampshire Department of Resources and Economic Development estimated the cost could be more than $30 million.
\
""The loss has been tremendous,"" he said. ""It is unprecedented in terms of scope. Most of the other (major weather) events were pretty much isolated in individual communities.""
\
As of Friday, 616 businesses had reported $16.7 million in storm-related losses to the state.
\
Bill Burke of Derry called last weekend ""brutal"" for his store, Dollar Bill's Discount World. He estimated that he lost about $115,000 in sales while the power was out.
\
""Inventory still sits on the floor that should have sold,"" he said.
\
The storm and ensuing power outage was a bust for some but a boon for others, especially restaurants and hardware stores. The malls also stayed busy, filled with people looking to keep busy -- and warm -- during the power outage.
\
Nancy Kyle, president of the Retail Merchants Association of New Hampshire, said some retailers around the state did well through the storm and others struggled. ""Again, it's like the retailing season in general this year,"" Kyle said.

Leahy: Death penalty views won't influence pick
\
MONTPELIER (AP) -- Sen. Patrick Leahy says someone's views on the death penalty won't influence his decision whether to nominate that person for the position of U.S. attorney serving Vermont.
\
The change in presidential administrations brings a change in chief federal prosecutors, and Leahy has been reviewing applications from people seeking to replace outgoing U.S. Attorney Tom Anderson.
\
A key decision awaiting the office is whether to seek the death penalty against Michael Jacques, the Randolph man accused of kidnapping, raping and killing his 12-year-old niece, Brooke Bennett, last June.
\
Leahy, who gets to make the nomination as Vermont's senior senator, says that won't influence his thinking.
\
Poll: Gas tax more favored than higher tolls
\
BOSTON (AP) -- Massachusetts residents appear more willing to pay higher gas taxes than higher tolls.
\
That's according to a new poll by The Boston Globe that found higher tolls proposed by the Turnpike Authority with Gov. Deval Patrick's support were the least popular of a series of suggestions to fix the state's transportation troubles.
\
When asked to choose between tolls or a gas tax, the tax won by 48 to 42 percent.
\
The poll also found that by a more than 2 to 1 ratio, those polled said the Big Dig wasn't worth the time and money.
\
The poll held good news for Patrick, whose favorability rating grew from 57 percent last September to 64 percent.
\
The poll of 501 Massachusetts residents has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.

Maine artist paints White House Christmas card
\
PORTLAND, Maine (AP) -- A Rockport artist has a global audience as the creator of this year's official White House Christmas card.
\
T. Allen Lawson is the latest Mainer to paint the scene for the annual White House card, which President Bush and his wife send to 1 million recipients around the world every year.
\
For this year's card, the 45-year-old Lawson painted a view from the White House's Truman Balcony overlooking a snow-covered lawn with the Washington Monument and Jefferson Memorial in the background.
\
Other Maine painters who have painted the White House Christmas card are Jamie Wyeth, who has done three of them, and Barbara Ernst Prey.

Frank says 'no' to Rev. Warren at inauguration
\
WASHINGTON (AP) -- The longest-serving openly gay member of Congress said Sunday it was a mistake for President-elect Barack Obama to invite the Rev. Rick Warren to deliver the invocation at his inauguration.
\
""Mr. Warren compared same-sex couples to incest. I found that deeply offensive and unfair,"" Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., said in a broadcast interview.
\
""If he was inviting the Rev. Warren to participate in a forum and to make a speech, that would be a good thing,"" Frank said. ""But being singled out to give the prayer at the inauguration is a high honor. It has traditionally given as a mark of great respect. And, yes, I think it was wrong to single him out for this mark of respect.""
\
Warren, a best-selling author and leader of a Southern California megachurch, is a popular evangelical who stresses the need for action on social issues such as reducing poverty and protecting the environment, alongside traditional theological themes.
\
But gay rights advocates, who strongly supported Obama during the election, are angry over Warren's backing of a California ballot initiative banning gay marriage. That measure was approved by voters last month.
\
Although Warren has said that he has nothing personally against gays, he has condemned same-sex marriage.

Lebanon -- The $11.6 billion 2010-2011 budget headed for final votes in the New Hampshire House and Senate next week cuts about $11 million over two years from Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, prompting concerns about care for the needy and specialized services for children.
\
""The safety net is unraveling,"" said Frank McDougall, DHMC's vice president of government relations. ""To say we are frustrated and disappointed is an understatement.""
\
DHMC officials initially hoped they might have warded off some of the most serious cuts, which include $10 million in Medicaid payments, much of it related to Children's Hospital at Dartmouth, and more than $1 million in medical education payments to the state's major teaching hospital.
\
But Senate support for restoring much of the DHMC-related funding dissipated after House negotiators were adamant that expanded gambling not be in the budget.
\
Several southern New Hampshire senators have been pushing for expanded gambling, in the form of slot machines at racetracks in their districts, among other sites,
\
""It's unfortunate that funding for a children's hospital and support for a teaching mission get wound up in a debate about whether or not gaming should happen in the state,"" McDougall said. ""That's just an unfortunate circumstance that we find frustrating.""
\
DHMC is the largest health-care provider in New Hampshire, and officials said the cuts were among the largest in the budget to a single institution.
\
""I think they did take a huge hit, and I think it was unfortunate,"" said state Sen. Bob Odell, a Claremont-area Republican and chairman of the Senate Ways and Means Committee. ""They took a disproportionate hit, in my perspective, but others took hits.""
\
State Rep. Sharon Nordgren, a Hanover Democrat and one of the negotiators in the House-Senate conference, which ended around 1 a.m. yesterday morning, said lobbyists from Children's Hospital of Boston, and from some Granite State community hospitals, were battling for some of the money she thinks DHMC deserves.
\
""We still have a selling job to do to the rest of the state about the significance of this medical center, and what it means to the community of the state,"" Nordgren said. ""DHMC gets sent the (patients) that nobody wants, because they might be in the hospital for two weeks and they are Medicaid.""
\
The full House and Senate are expected to vote on the two-year budget on Wednesday, in time for it to take effect before the start of the 2010 fiscal year on July 1.
\
The spending plan includes a 45-cent increase in the cigarette tax, to $1.78 per pack. About 200 state workers face layoffs already, and more could lose their jobs if the state employees' union does not agree to unpaid furloughs to meet $25 million in additional personnel cuts also called for in the budget.
\
Odell said bumping rights -- which allow workers whose jobs are targeted for cuts to replace workers with less seniority -- are also suspended in the spending plan.
\
The budget also raises the rooms and meals tax to 9 percent and taxes dividends and interest earned by limited liability companies. But some other proposed taxes, such as an increase in the gas tax and a capital gains tax that were backed by the House, never made it into the final plan.
\
Democratic Gov. John Lynch yesterday released a statement praising the agreement.
\
""Our nation and our state are in the midst of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. This was a difficult budget to craft, but we were able to come together to make hard choices and major cuts to produce a responsible, balanced budget that protects essential services without an income tax, a sales tax or an increase in the gas tax,"" he said.
\
House Ways and Means Chairwoman Susan Almy, a Lebanon Democrat who also was one of the negotiators, said it was difficult to craft given competing priorities around the state.
\
""In this economic environment, it is impossible to produce a budget we would like, but I am going to like any alternative budget a lot less, and so will just about everyone else,"" Almy said.
\
Budget writers were helped by a $75 million increase in revenue estimates, and they also decided to tap about $70 million from the state's rainy day fund, leaving it with only about $20 million.
\
""None of us are very comfortable doing that. Twenty million is about as low as we want to go,"" said Almy, who said revenues have stabilized. ""We're not saying we are going to see growth next year; we're just saying it's not going to get worse from where we are now.""
\
Nordgren said lawmakers have been ""prudent"" and that they are using stabilization funds for their intended purpose. ""What's your definition of a rainy day? This is a rainy day,"" she said.
\
State Sen. Matthew Houde, a Lebanon-area Democrat who voted for expanded gambling in the Senate budget to protect social services, said he is still sorting out his feelings about the budget compromise. He said the plan includes a series of smaller tax increases because of opposition from various sources to larger sources of new revenue, whether it be an income or sales tax or gambling.
\
""The big ones are a hard sell -- there is a lot of opposition -- so then you only get to the smaller ones,"" he said.
\
Still, one likely outcome is that cities and towns may have to raise property taxes, or cut services, because of a projected $87.4 million statewide impact from provisions affecting municipalities. That includes increased local contributions to municipal employees' retirements; a suspension of revenue sharing with the state; and a cap on towns' share of the meals and rooms tax.
\
Hanover Town Manager Julia Griffin said those measures will cost Hanover more than $250,000 a year, resulting in a tax increase of between 3 percent and 4 percent.
\
""It's a shame, but we're going to pass it on to our taxpayers and give them the contact information (for lawmakers and the governor),"" Griffin said. ""We'll simply encourage folks to reach out if they are angry.""

183,"Reliable support\I will vote for Johannah Leddy Donovan and Richard Kemp to represent Burlington's South End in the House of Representatives. If you live in this district (Chittenden 3-5) and want reliable support in Montpelier for alternative energy, environmental protection, sensible transportation priorities, sustainable economic growth, and other forward-thinking policies, I encourage you to do the same. JOHN KASSEL Burlington\Rivers shares values\Cheryl Rivers is the best candidate for lieutenant governor. She understands the struggles and aspirations of middle and lower class Vermonters because she grew up as the oldest of nine children on an Addison County farm. Cheryl has fought for the causes that affect these hard working Vermonters throughout her 11 years in the Senate.\As chair of the Senate finance committee, Cheryl proved herself as a true coalition builder. That committee brought forth the Equal Education Opportunity Act, the Health Care Ombudsman, and campaign finance reform. These accomplishments happened because Cheryl has the skill to work with other legislators to bring about change.\Cheryl has served as the executive director of the National Legislative Association on Prescription Drug Prices, a bipartisan group which has dedicated itself to winning fair drug prices and prescription drug coverage for all.\We should elect Cheryl Rivers because she stands for our values and our goals: universal health care, fair prescription drug prices, and a livable wage for all Vermonters. PRISCILLA DAGGETT Calais\Oil inconsistency\A recent Free Press AP story quoted Alan Greenspan asserting that the 80 percent rise in crude oil prices in the last 12 months would not be as troublesome for the economy as the price spikes in the 1970's. He suggested that we will adjust with increased exploration, improved technology, and greater efficiency. Greenspan also stated that the current increases 'had the effect of imposing a tax on U.S. consumers equivalent to 0.75 percent of the country's total economic output, or about $80 billion.""\His prediction may or may not be true. It is interesting, however, that Greenspan said nothing about a long-term plan to reduce our dependence on foreign oil (and our massive trade imbalance).\He also failed to comment on the impact of higher prices on families. (Note that Greenspan has no qualms about urging long-term planning for Social Security.)\Over the last 30 years, many thoughtful analysts have called for modest gas tax increases to fund alternative transportation strategies, and for greater fuel efficiency standards. Almost without exception, these proposals have been met with derision because they would (supposedly) destroy the economy and harm rural families and small businesses.\So let me see if I understand. Huge price increases are manageable if the money goes to the Saudis and the oil companies, but gas tax increases and greater efficiency to help end our dependence are destructive. Shouldn't we ask Greenspan (and others who share his view) to explain this apparent inconsistency? And shouldn't articles that present his views be balanced with other perspectives? DOUG HOFFER Burlington\The Apprentice\Imagine this. A board of trustees elects 'an Apprentice"" to run their company for four years. Qualifications: 'I once owned a baseball team. I was born on third base but I'm great at convincing everyone I hit a triple."" It employs about 280 million people.\The company was very financially stable at this point. During that four year span, this company is now trillions of dollars in debt, millions of its employees have lost their jobs, their health insurance benefits and unemployment within the company is the highest it has ever been in decades. Retiree benefits have been cut, money for afterschool programs, once the pride of this company, have been cut, and environmental programs sponsored by the company have been mutilated. This business, once seen as a leading moral corporation with admirable integrity has now become a pariah in the business world because of its deceptive, irresponsible and immoral leadership. Its international decisions have been unjustified, irrational, myopic and lethal for thousands of its employees. International business leaders refuse to have any interaction or come to the aid of this company.\When asked to report on the progress of the company this 'Apprentice"" was chosen to run for four years he states the following: 'We'll stay the course. Things are great. We're showin' the world how ta be great leaders, how ta stand up for what we believe in. I pray. My Heavenly Father tells me what ta do I aint no liberal, I don't 'exxxxagurate."" We'll give the tools to our people and they can all go to Community Colleges and get retrained and no one will be left behind etc., ad nauseam.""\As a board member would you hire this guy again? I would not.\George W. you're fired! PAT HABIF Jericho\Consider appointees\In his campaign for governor, Burlington Mayor Peter Clavelle has pointed out how Gov. Jim Douglas is aligned with the Bush administration. While I agree this is important to consider, the more important parallel is how both Douglas and Bush have surrounded themselves with right wing and/or neo-conservative staffs sitting just beyond the public's view.\That may seem hard for some to believe. After all, Douglas is a likable guy. He is perpetually shaking hands, cutting ribbons, and flashing that sunny demeanor wherever he goes. And by most accounts, Douglas is a moderate. The problem is that while he is out in the public eye, others are running the shop.\That responsibility is delegated to Douglas' political appointees in the key state agencies: Administration; Agriculture, Food & Markets; Commerce & Community Development; Human Services; Natural Resources; and Transportation. I doubt many Vermonters know their names or would recognize their faces. We should know more since much of Douglas' performance comes down to what these un-elected officials do. This is where Douglas' public facade weakens and reality sets in for Vermonters.\These powerful appointees have a record that President Bush would be proud of. They are keeping the state from adopting a sound energy policy that reduces the state's dependence on big energy providers and encourages renewable energy and conservation. They side with the narrow interests of large, out-of-state businesses, including drug companies, box stores, and insurance companies. They take polarized positions on key business and economic issues, from worker's compensation to stormwater runoff. They invest significant dollars in recruiting out-of-state companies, rather than improving the environment for Vermonters to start and grow their own businesses. They push school choice and vouchers that will ultimately weaken our public schools.\The list goes on, but my point is simple: a vote for Gov. Douglas is a vote for his conservative appointees. The same applies to President Bush and his neo-conservative zealots. Re-electing either administration will compound the problems already created by their policies, which is bad for Vermont. We need a governor with a track record of implementing solutions that serve the broader needs of Vermonters. We need a governor that will surround himself with people dedicated to support his stated political agenda. We need a governor willing to stand up to special interests, large corporations, and the federal government. We need Peter Clavelle. ROB SMART Montpelier\Health system destroyed\Universal health care! It has a nice ring to it, doesn't it? Just sit back and let the government take care of you. No more worries about how you will afford health care, no need to stay healthy to avoid costly medical bills. Just let a faceless bureaucrat take care of everything. Right?\Wrong! Universal health care will destroy our health care system over time. For instance, Medicare and Medicaid, our current government programs, have never paid 100 percent of the cost to provide care and are the primary reasons that health care providers need to shift expenses to other programs such as private health insurance. In fact they often pay less than 50 cents on the dollar. If we assume 100 percent government funded health care, who will providers shift their costs to? The only group available is the U.S. taxpayer. That's right, you and me. If you think deductions for your health insurance premiums have gone up, just wait until you see your tax bill.\So your tax bill goes out of sight and you start to complain. What do you think happens next? That is right, cost control! Doctors will be salaried and lose incentive to see more patients, work long hours and go the extra for their patients. Expect enrollment in medical schools to go down.\Reduced research and development funds, price controls and new regulations will stifle development of new drugs, medical equipment and treatments. Ah, and then will come rationing of health care. You won't be able to get treatment because that faceless bureaucrat says, 'No.""\The American public will not tolerate the constraints of a universal health care system. We are used to having health care on demand even when we complain about having to pay for it. I have observed the workings of the current system for 40 years as a nurse in various positions including administration. There are flaws in this system to be sure, but not flaws that a government financed and run system won't make much worse. Health Savings Accounts and incentives for staying healthy are a good start to making each of us more accountable for our own health care expense. MARY DALY Fairlee\Afghan elections\Although it was barely mentioned by the mainstream media, the people of Afghanistan voted for the first time in their lives this past weekend. To President Bush's credit this election went off rather quietly.\One can only imagine the headlines had there been widespread violence or fraud, i.e. 'Bush policies fail in Afghanistan"" etc., you get the point, but back to the election. The biggest confusion was for the Afghan women, as there were 16 candidates from which to choose. Prior to our liberation of Afghanistan their only decisions were whether to wear the black burqua or, well the black burqua. Proving the simplest solutions are sometimes the best, some genius came up with the idea to dye every voter's thumb blue to avoid voter fraud. Ironically, this was tried in the United States first, but the ACLU screamed that it unfairly suppressed the votes of Palmolive dishwashing detergent models and people who still sucked their thumb. It could be said that the election in Afghanistan was even more of a success than our last presidential election, as the losers only whined for four days, not four years. ALLAN McGREGOR Montpelier"
184,"Here's the bewildering thing about climate change: It's invisible. So, too, are the gaseous emissions believed to bring it about. Their supposed effects are complex, expensive, and for the most part, years away -- unseen. Emissions are easy to ignore.\It's the same with policies that try to limit climate change -- exceedingly complex, expensive, easy to ignore.\If nobody makes a serious effort to limit a state's total emissions of carbon dioxide, the most plentiful greenhouse gas, who will notice? Nobody gets sick from carbon dioxide in the great outdoors. Nor can anyone be sure if the year-to-year variations in temperature, or the severity of storms, has anything to do with the buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. If carbon dioxide and other ""greenhouse gases"" really do affect the climate in the Northeast, another generation or two might go by before people really start to see the effects -- such as the dwindling of the maples, the dulling of the foliage.\Nevertheless, most states in New England have started making serious, comprehensive attempts to do something about climate change. They have invested in analyzing where their emissions are coming from, and in what amounts -- a complicated and time-consuming technical undertaking, but necessary if a state is to determine, rigorously, how and where to reduce emissions.\Some states have hired consultants to help them develop climate-change policies. Some states began, two to three years ago, to convene meetings of ""stakeholders"" -- municipalities, private businesses, environmentalists and so on -- to formulate policy options and seek consensus. Three of the New England states have developed and published comprehensive climate-change action plans with specific measures and quantitative strategies for reducing or limiting total greenhouse gas emissions. Four states have each pledged to reduce total emissions to 1990 levels by 2010, in keeping with a regional goal set in 2001.\Not Vermont.\Vermont does not have a plan for reducing statewide greenhouse gas emissions. Vermont has not committed to reducing its emissions to 1990 levels by 2010. Vermont does not have an updated accounting of its greenhouse gas emissions. (The most recent year for which official data are available is 1990.)\To be sure, Vermont has taken some actions. Like most other New England states, Vermont has moved to improve the fuel efficiency of its state fleet and to upgrade the energy efficiency of state buildings and other operations of state government. Like most other New England states, it has adopted California's stricter tailpipe-emission standards for newer cars, and has signaled its intent to sign on to a new California standard that aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in new cars. Vermont has added bus lines in the northwestern part of the state, and like other states, has encouraged forms of ride sharing and alternative transit.\None of these measures has made a significant dent in Vermont's greenhouse gas emissions. State government accounts for less than 3 percent of Vermont's total emissions. Public transit and ride-sharing programs are used by a tiny fraction of the state's commuters. The new California emission standard would not go into effect until the 2009 model year.\Vermont's total emissions in 2001 were 23 percent higher than in 1990, according to an analysis released earlier this year by the New England Climate Coalition, which includes state Public Interest Research Groups and other environmental-advocacy organizations. Indeed, when it comes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, Vermont might face a tougher challenge than any of its New England counterparts.\That's because Vermont is the only state in the region whose emissions come primarily from cars. Officials working on climate-change policy in other states acknowledge that emissions from cars might be the toughest to contain -- tougher than those from industry, commerce or electric utilities.\Vermont's total Vehicle Miles Traveled increased 35 percent from 1990 to 2003, according to the state's statistics. As late as August, as gas prices rose, people in Vermont were driving about as much as before: Gas tax receipts for that month were down 1 percent from August the previous year; diesel tax receipts were up.\Halfway through the decade that was supposed to put a regional curb on climate-changing emissions, Vermont's primary challenge -- transportation -- is one that the state has barely begun to confront.\The regional initiative\Four years ago, not long after the United States refused to sign an international treaty to cut emissions, New England governors and Eastern Canadian premiers decided to take matters into their own hands.\In August 2001, they adopted a ""Climate Change Action Plan"" that established regional goals and set forth a framework for achieving them.\The short-term goal was to reduce the region's emissions to 1990 levels by 2010. Each state or province was to develop its own plan for making reductions.\Four states -- Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts and Rhode Island -- have drawn up climate action plans that commit to that goal at the state level. Officials in some of those states say they have a shot at attaining the goal, or at least coming close.\Vermont and New Hampshire have agreed only to work toward the regional goal.\When a bill in the Vermont House (H.49) was introduced this past session to establish that same 2010 emissions goal for the state, Jeffrey Wennberg, commissioner of environmental conservation, and Tom Torti, secretary of the Agency of Natural Resources, both took issue with the bill during hearings before the House Natural Resources and Energy Committee, asking the panel to defer action until next year. (The bill remains in committee.) Wennberg said that the goal would be ""exceedingly difficult to achieve,"" a ""far more difficult task"" in Vermont than in the other states or provinces.\Why more difficult in Vermont? In part because such a large share of Vermont's emissions come from transportation. All the other states have large fossil-fuel burning power plants, and most have bigger industrial and commercial sectors. Most of the electricity Vermont consumes is produced by non-emitting power generators, nuclear and hydro. So, Vermont's greenhouse gas emissions from the electrical sector are negligible, ""the envy of the nation,"" according to Wennberg.\As John Sayles, director of policy research and planning in the Agency of Natural Resources, put it recently, in discussing the challenge of reducing emissions: ""There's low-hanging fruit in other states"" -- for example, you can put a scrubber on a power plant to cut down on some emissions. Vermont has no ""low-hanging fruit,"" he said -- you can't put a scrubber on several hundred thousand cars.\The bill, which according to its principal sponsor, Rep. Steven Maier, D-Middlebury, was inspired by the regional plan, called among other things for Vermont to develop its own climate-action plan and its own inventory of greenhouse gas emissions.\Torti told the committee that the Agency of Natural Resources could not afford to do all the work the bill called for.\""We don't have the resources to do all the environmental work we're supposed to do now,"" Torti said. Wennberg said the bill provided no resources for a task that would likely require additional employees and hundreds of thousands of dollars.\Yet this is a financial commitment that other states have chosen to make. Detailed, comprehensive climate-action plans in Connecticut, Maine and Rhode Island have been hammered out over the past three years. Rhode Island's cost about $200,000; Maine's, about $250,000; Connecticut's, about $500,000. How did Connecticut come up with that kind of money, on top of all its other environmental regulatory responsibilities?\""It's a matter of deciding what your priorities are,"" said Chris James, director or air planning in the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection.\Vermont's priority has been to promote efficiencies in state government, following executive orders in 2002 and 2003 by Govs. Dean and Douglas, and this year, a detailed report drawn up by the Climate Neutral Working Group, a committee of state-agency representatives.\The regional plan calls state-government initiatives ""leading by example,"" and most of New England's state governments have sought to do so -- adding hybrid cars to state fleets, making state buildings more energy-efficient. (Vermont's state government accounted for about 2.2 percent of the state's total carbon dioxide emissions in 1990, according to the Agency of Natural Resources.)\Vermont also participates in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a cooperative effort of nine Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states to discuss the design of a regional ""cap-and-trade program"" covering carbon dioxide emissions. The program would apply just to electric power and not to Vermont's biggest greenhouse-gas bugaboo, transportation.\As for a statewide climate-action plan, Vermont will have one, and it will be funded, Wennberg said last week. He declined to specify a timetable for developing the plan. ""It's going to be announced in the near future,"" he said. Coming to grips with transportation\Vermont's total greenhouse gas emissions -- and the population that produces them -- are smaller than those of any other New England state.\Wennberg told the House committee that Vermont's emissions per capita were lower than for any other state in the region. (That's in part because each of the other states, unlike Vermont, has fossil-fuel burning power plants that account for about a quarter of total emissions.) Even if Vermont cut its emissions to zero, this reduction would have a negligible effect on the global greenhouse gas problem.\Does all of this mean that Vermont can ignore its rising greenhouse gas emissions?\If Vermont's emissions continue to go up, then for the regional goal to be reached, other states or provinces will have to compensate by cutting their emissions even more than they otherwise would. Moreover, the nature of the emissions problems vary from state to state, but each state is committed to working on its unique situation.\Only in Vermont does transportation account for more than half the carbon dioxide problem.\Compounding Vermont's transportation challenge are recent trends in the U.S. auto industry. Over the last 20 years, according to a study of cars and light trucks by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the thrust of technological innovation has been to increase vehicles' weight, power and acceleration. Average fuel economy hasn't improved significantly since about 1990. In other words, people have been buying bigger and more powerful vehicles, without regard for better gas mileage.\Why does this matter? ""Fuel economy is directly related to emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide,"" states the EPA. The more miles per gallon your car gets, the less carbon dioxide it gives out for each mile you drive.\Other states in New England are working on transportation measures that have yet to receive serious consideration in Vermont, among them:\Incentive to buy hybrids: Gas-electric hybrids are more fuel-efficient, and thus lower emitters. Connecticut dropped the sales tax on hybrids last year. A bill to do that was introduced in Vermont House in the spring, but it didn't get a hearing in the Transportation Committee.\In any case, hybrids are a small part of any solution. Of the 423,724 ""pleasure cars"" registered with the Vermont Department of Motor Vehicles, 1,150 are hybrids -- less than half of 1 percent. The state fleet, for its part, has 13 Toyota Priuses and 25 Honda Civic hybrids.\A ""feebate"" program: Connecticut, Maine and Rhode Island have included this idea in their climate-change action plans. In Connecticut, the legislature asked a task force to come up with a proposal for the next session. The program would apply to purchases of new vehicles: Gas guzzlers would be assessed a fee; fuel-efficient cars would get a rebate. The program could be designed to be ""revenue neutral"" -- that is, so that total fees would pay for total rebates.\A bill to establish a feebate program was introduced in the Vermont House during the last session. It didn't get a hearing in the Transportation Committee. Chairman Rep. Richard Westman, R-Cambridge, said, however, that there have been discussions about revising registration fees to promote ownership of fuel-efficient vehicles.\Slowing growth in Vehicle Miles Traveled: This is an explicit goal in Maine's and Connecticut's climate-change plans; in Rhode Island, it's a ""priority study option."" In Maine's plan, which ranks 55 policy options in order of carbon dioxide savings, slowing VMT growth is No. 17. One way to do that is to foster ""smart growth"" development, clustered housing or in-fill development. Connecticut's plan calls for ""smart growth"" initiatives coupled with transit improvements, and urges consideration of ""pay-as-you-drive"" insurance.\Reducing VMT growth is not a formal policy goal of Vermont's Agency of Transportation, beyond the state's promotion of public transit, ride-sharing, bike/pedestrian programs. Apart from such programs, ""Vermont has explicitly stayed away from reducing VMT as a policy goal,"" said Ian Grossman, spokesman for the agency. One reason is that ""This type of 'social engineering' is not something the agency sees as part of our mission.""\Transportation planning: Greenhouse gas emissions are not taken into account in the planning of Vermont's transportation projects. ""Because there is no adequate scientific knowledge to understand the effect of a single highway project on climate change, we do not consider potential increases in greenhouse gas emissions (or the effects on climate change) when planning specific transportation projects,"" Grossman said.\By contrast, Massachusetts' ""Climate Protection Plan"" states: ""Considering greenhouse gas emissions when making transportation planning and funding decisions will be a powerful tool in state efforts to reduce transportation's harmful impacts on the environment. There are many opportunities to curb growing GHG emissions through the transportation planning process, but traditionally these have not been considered."" The unavoidable truth\Sooner or later, all efforts to cut down on transportation emissions run up against an unavoidable fact: Any car that burns gasoline, no matter how efficient, emits carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is an inevitable byproduct of combustion.\So, if drivers want to churn out less carbon dioxide, they'll have to use less gasoline. They can do that by driving more efficient cars or by driving less. Either way means conserving energy.\That's why the most obvious policy measure to reduce emissions from transportation -- and from every other energy sector -- is one that promotes conservation. It's a measure that has been adopted in New Zealand and in some parts of Europe. In the United States, it's deemed so politically unpalatable that most states grappling with climate change aren't even considering it.\It's called a carbon tax: a tax on energy sources that spew carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Earlier this year, an endorsement of a national carbon tax emerged from an unlikely source -- the CEO of an electric utility.\Paul Andersen, of Duke Energy, gave a speech in Charlotte, N.C., that called for such a tax. He told his listeners that Americans have to confront the fact that they can't have it both ways -- a better environment and cheap energy.\""We need to face up to the inconsistency of our demands,"" Andersen said. ""It's time to recognize that if we want a better environment, we're going to have to pay more for energy.""\Contact Tim Johnson at 660-1808 or tjohnson@bfp.burlingtonfreepress.com"

The new California emission standard would not go into effect until the 2009 model year.\Vermont's total emissions in 2001 were 23 percent higher than in 1990, according to an analysis released earlier this year by the New England Climate Coalition, which includes state Public Interest Research Groups and other environmental-advocacy organizations. Indeed, when it comes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, Vermont might face a tougher challenge than any of its New England counterparts.\That's because Vermont is the only state in the region whose emissions come primarily from cars. Officials working on climate-change policy in other states acknowledge that emissions from cars might be the toughest to contain -- tougher than those from industry, commerce or electric utilities.\Vermont's total Vehicle Miles Traveled increased 35 percent from 1990 to 2003, according to the state's statistics. As late as August, as gas prices rose, people in Vermont were driving about as much as before: Gas tax receipts for that month were down 1 percent from August the previous year; diesel tax receipts were up.\Halfway through the decade that was supposed to put a regional curb on climate-changing emissions, Vermont's primary challenge -- transportation -- is one that the state has barely begun to confront.\The regional initiative\Four years ago, not long after the United States refused to sign an international treaty to cut emissions, New England governors and Eastern Canadian premiers decided to take matters into their own hands.\In August 2001, they adopted a ""Climate Change Action Plan"" that established regional goals and set forth a framework for achieving them.\The short-term goal was to reduce the region's emissions to 1990 levels by 2010. Each state or province was to develop its own plan for making reductions.\Four states -- Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts and Rhode Island -- have drawn up climate action plans that commit to that goal at the state level. Officials in some of those states say they have a shot at attaining the goal, or at least coming close.\Vermont and New Hampshire have agreed only to work toward the regional goal.\When a bill in the Vermont House (H.49) was introduced this past session to establish that same 2010 emissions goal for the state, Jeffrey Wennberg, commissioner of environmental conservation, and Tom Torti, secretary of the Agency of Natural Resources, both took issue with the bill during hearings before the House Natural Resources and Energy Committee, asking the panel to defer action until next year. (The bill remains in committee.) Wennberg said that the goal would be ""exceedingly difficult to achieve,"" a ""far more difficult task"" in Vermont than in the other states or provinces.\Why more difficult in Vermont? In part because such a large share of Vermont's emissions come from transportation. All the other states have large fossil-fuel burning power plants, and most have bigger industrial and commercial sectors. Most of the electricity Vermont consumes is produced by non-emitting power generators, nuclear and hydro. So, Vermont's greenhouse gas emissions from the electrical sector are negligible, ""the envy of the nation,"" according to Wennberg.\As John Sayles, director of policy research and planning in the Agency of Natural Resources, put it recently, in discussing the challenge of reducing emissions: ""There's low-hanging fruit in other states"" -- for example, you can put a scrubber on a power plant to cut down on some emissions. Vermont has no ""low-hanging fruit,"" he said -- you can't put a scrubber on several hundred thousand cars.\The bill, which according to its principal sponsor, Rep. Steven Maier, D-Middlebury, was inspired by the regional plan, called among other things for Vermont to develop its own climate-action plan and its own inventory of greenhouse gas emissions.\Torti told the committee that the Agency of Natural Resources could not afford to do all the work the bill called for.\""We don't have the resources to do all the environmental work we're supposed to do now,"" Torti said. Wennberg said the bill provided no resources for a task that would likely require additional employees and hundreds of thousands of dollars.\Yet this is a financial commitment that other states have chosen to make. Detailed, comprehensive climate-action plans in Connecticut, Maine and Rhode Island have been hammered out over the past three years. Rhode Island's cost about $200,000; Maine's, about $250,000; Connecticut's, about $500,000. How did Connecticut come up with that kind of money, on top of all its other environmental regulatory responsibilities?\""It's a matter of deciding what your priorities are,"" said Chris James, director or air planning in the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection.\Vermont's priority has been to promote efficiencies in state government, following executive orders in 2002 and 2003 by Govs. Dean and Douglas, and this year, a detailed report drawn up by the Climate Neutral Working Group, a committee of state-agency representatives.\The regional plan calls state-government initiatives ""leading by example,"" and most of New England's state governments have sought to do so -- adding hybrid cars to state fleets, making state buildings more energy-efficient. (Vermont's state government accounted for about 2.2 percent of the state's total carbon dioxide emissions in 1990, according to the Agency of Natural Resources.)\Vermont also participates in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a cooperative effort of nine Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states to discuss the design of a regional ""cap-and-trade program"" covering carbon dioxide emissions. The program would apply just to electric power and not to Vermont's biggest greenhouse-gas bugaboo, transportation.\As for a statewide climate-action plan, Vermont will have one, and it will be funded, Wennberg said last week. He declined to specify a timetable for developing the plan. ""It's going to be announced in the near future,"" he said. Coming to grips with transportation\Vermont's total greenhouse gas emissions -- and the population that produces them -- are smaller than those of any other New England state.\Wennberg told the House committee that Vermont's emissions per capita were lower than for any other state in the region. (That's in part because each of the other states, unlike Vermont, has fossil-fuel burning power plants that account for about a quarter of total emissions.) Even if Vermont cut its emissions to zero, this reduction would have a negligible effect on the global greenhouse gas problem.\Does all of this mean that Vermont can ignore its rising greenhouse gas emissions?\If Vermont's emissions continue to go up, then for the regional goal to be reached, other states or provinces will have to compensate by cutting their emissions even more than they otherwise would. Moreover, the nature of the emissions problems vary from state to state, but each state is committed to working on its unique situation.\Only in Vermont does transportation account for more than half the carbon dioxide problem.\Compounding Vermont's transportation challenge are recent trends in the U.S. auto industry. Over the last 20 years, according to a study of cars and light trucks by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the thrust of technological innovation has been to increase vehicles' weight, power and acceleration. Average fuel economy hasn't improved significantly since about 1990. In other words, people have been buying bigger and more powerful vehicles, without regard for better gas mileage.\Why does this matter? ""Fuel economy is directly related to emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide,"" states the EPA. The more miles per gallon your car gets, the less carbon dioxide it gives out for each mile you drive.\Other states in New England are working on transportation measures that have yet to receive serious consideration in Vermont, among them:\Incentive to buy hybrids: Gas-electric hybrids are more fuel-efficient, and thus lower emitters. Connecticut dropped the sales tax on hybrids last year. A bill to do that was introduced in Vermont House in the spring, but it didn't get a hearing in the Transportation Committee.\In any case, hybrids are a small part of any solution. Of the 423,724 ""pleasure cars"" registered with the Vermont Department of Motor Vehicles, 1,150 are hybrids -- less than half of 1 percent. The state fleet, for its part, has 13 Toyota Priuses and 25 Honda Civic hybrids.\A ""feebate"" program: Connecticut, Maine and Rhode Island have included this idea in their climate-change action plans. In Connecticut, the legislature asked a task force to come up with a proposal for the next session. The program would apply to purchases of new vehicles: Gas guzzlers would be assessed a fee; fuel-efficient cars would get a rebate. The program could be designed to be ""revenue neutral"" -- that is, so that total fees would pay for total rebates.\A bill to establish a feebate program was introduced in the Vermont House during the last session. It didn't get a hearing in the Transportation Committee. Chairman Rep. Richard Westman, R-Cambridge, said, however, that there have been discussions about revising registration fees to promote ownership of fuel-efficient vehicles.\Slowing growth in Vehicle Miles Traveled: This is an explicit goal in Maine's and Connecticut's climate-change plans; in Rhode Island, it's a ""priority study option."" In Maine's plan, which ranks 55 policy options in order of carbon dioxide savings, slowing VMT growth is No. 17. One way to do that is to foster ""smart growth"" development, clustered housing or in-fill development. Connecticut's plan calls for ""smart growth"" initiatives coupled with transit improvements, and urges consideration of ""pay-as-you-drive"" insurance.\Reducing VMT growth is not a formal policy goal of Vermont's Agency of Transportation, beyond the state's promotion of public transit, ride-sharing, bike/pedestrian programs. Apart from such programs, ""Vermont has explicitly stayed away from reducing VMT as a policy goal,"" said Ian Grossman, spokesman for the agency. One reason is that ""This type of 'social engineering' is not something the agency sees as part of our mission.""\Transportation planning: Greenhouse gas emissions are not taken into account in the planning of Vermont's transportation projects. ""Because there is no adequate scientific knowledge to understand the effect of a single highway project on climate change, we do not consider potential increases in greenhouse gas emissions (or the effects on climate change) when planning specific transportation projects,"" Grossman said.\By contrast, Massachusetts' ""Climate Protection Plan"" states: ""Considering greenhouse gas emissions when making transportation planning and funding decisions will be a powerful tool in state efforts to reduce transportation's harmful impacts on the environment. There are many opportunities to curb growing GHG emissions through the transportation planning process, but traditionally these have not been considered."" The unavoidable truth\Sooner or later, all efforts to cut down on transportation emissions run up against an unavoidable fact: Any car that burns gasoline, no matter how efficient, emits carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is an inevitable byproduct of combustion.\So, if drivers want to churn out less carbon dioxide, they'll have to use less gasoline. They can do that by driving more efficient cars or by driving less. Either way means conserving energy.\That's why the most obvious policy measure to reduce emissions from transportation -- and from every other energy sector -- is one that promotes conservation. It's a measure that has been adopted in New Zealand and in some parts of Europe. In the United States, it's deemed so politically unpalatable that most states grappling with climate change aren't even considering it.\It's called a carbon tax: a tax on energy sources that spew carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Earlier this year, an endorsement of a national carbon tax emerged from an unlikely source -- the CEO of an electric utility.\Paul Andersen, of Duke Energy, gave a speech in Charlotte, N.C., that called for such a tax. He told his listeners that Americans have to confront the fact that they can't have it both ways -- a better environment and cheap energy.\""We need to face up to the inconsistency of our demands,"" Andersen said. ""It's time to recognize that if we want a better environment, we're going to have to pay more for energy.""\Contact Tim Johnson at 660-1808 or tjohnson@bfp.burlingtonfreepress.com"
186,"Here's the bewildering thing about climate change: It's invisible. So, too, are the gaseous emissions believed to bring it about. Their supposed effects are complex, expensive, and for the most par, years away -- unseen. Emissions are easy to ignore.\It's the same with policies that try to limit climate change -- exceedinglycomplex, expensive, easy to ignore.\If nobody makes a serious effort to limit a state's total emissions of carbon dioxide, the most plentiful greenhouse gass, who will notice? Nobody gets sick from carbon dioxide in the great outdoors. Nor can anyone be sure if they year-to-year variations in temperature, or the severity of storms, has anything to do with the buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. If carbon dioxide and other ""greenhouse gases"" really do affect the climate in the Northeast, another generation or two might go by before people really sart to see the effects -- such as the dwindling of the maples, the dulling of the foliage.\Nevertheless, most states in New Enland have started making serious, comperhensive attempts to do something about climate change. They ave invested in analyzing where their emissions are coming from, and in what amounts -- a complicated and time-consuming technical undertaking, but necessary if a state is to determine, rigorously, how and where to reduce emissions.\Some states have hired consultants to help them develop climate change policies. Some states began, two to three yearsgo, to convene meetings of ""stakeholders"" -- municipalities, private businesses, environmentalists and so on -- to formulate policy options and seek consensus. Three of the New England states have developed and published comprehensive climate-change action plans with specific measures and quantitative strategies for reducing or limiting total greenhous gas emissions. Four states have each pledged to reduce total emissions to 1990 levels by 2010, in keeping with a regional goal set in 2001.\Not Vermont.\Vermont does not have a plan for reducing statewide greenhouse gas emissions. Vermont has not committed to reducing its emissions to 1990 levels by 2010. Vermont does not have an updated accounting of its greenhous gas emissions. (The most recent year for which official data are available is 1990.)\To be sure, Vermont has taken some actions. Like most other New England states, Vermont has moved to improve the fuel efficiency of its state fleet and to upgrade the energy efficiency of state buildings and other operations of state government. Like most other New England states, it has adopted California's stricter tailpipe-emission standards for newer cars, and has signaled its intent to sign on to a new California standard that aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in new cars. Vermont has added bus lines in the northwestern part of the state, and like other states, has encouraged forms of ride sharing and alternative transit.\None of these measures has made a significant dent in Vermont's greenhouse gas emissions. State government accounts for less than 3 percent of Vermont's total emissions. Public transit and ride-sharing programs are used by a tiny fraction of the state's commuters.

""There is new and stronger edidence that most of the warming over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities,"" states the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

These increases have enhanced the heat-trapping capacity of Earth's atmosphere.""\Combustion of fossil fuels and other human activities are the primary reason for the increased concentration of carbon dioxide, scientists believe. ""Plant respiration and the decomposition of organic matter release more than 10 times the CO2 released by human activities; but these releases have generally been in balance during the centuries before the industrial revolution, with carbon dioxide absorbed by terrestrial vegetation and the oceans.\""What has changed in the last few hundred years is the additional release of carbon dioxide by human activities.

In its ""U.S. Emissions Inventory 2004,"" the EPA states: ""As the largest source of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, CO2 from fossil fuel combustion has accounted for a nearly constant 80 percent of global warming potential weighted emissions since 1990.

\
Hundreds of Vermonters have contacted my office expressing outrage over the high cost of oil and gas. Workers have told me they no longer can afford to fill up their gas tanks as they travel long distances to work.
\
Older Vermonters are expressing real concern about how they will stay warm next winter with home heating fuel prices already averaging $3.89 per gallon. Truck drivers doubt whether they can remain in business. Clearly, we are facing a national crisis. The crisis not only affects consumers of gas and oil, it has an impact on food prices, small businesses, family farmers, tourism and, in fact, our entire economy.
\
Meanwhile, as energy prices soar and the middle-class continues to shrink, Exxon-Mobil has made more profits in the past two years than any other corporation in the history of the world. Last year alone, Exxon-Mobil made $40 billion in profits, and rewarded its CEO Rex Tillerson with $21 million in total compensation. (Several years ago they provided their outgoing CEO Lee Raymond with a $400 million retirement package). Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Shell and BP also have posted record profits.
\
In fact, the five largest oil companies in this country have made $595 billion in profits since George W. Bush has been president.
\
Sadly, as in so many other areas regarding the needs of ordinary Americans, the Bush-Cheney administration has had nothing relevant to say. In their previous lives, both Bush and Cheney were heavily involved in the oil industry. They are far more concerned about the needs of oil company executives than working families.
\
So with deafening silence from the White House, Congress must act and act now.
\
There is no single silver bullet that will lower oil prices. The solution rests with action on a number of fronts -- both long term and short term.
\
Long term, we must significantly increase our efforts at breaking our dependency on foreign oil and fossil fuels in general and move toward energy efficiency and such sustainable energies as solar, wind, geo-thermal and bio-mass. In the process, we can create millions of good paying jobs as we reverse global warming, clean up our environment and lower energy costs.
\
Short term, in order to address the immediate crisis, we need to:
\
* Impose an excise tax on oil companies. The $35 billion in new revenue would fund a six-month federal and state ""gas tax holiday."" This approach would lower the price of gas by up to 36 cents a gallon without reducing the Highway Trust Fund at a time when repairs to our decaying roads and bridges are desperately needed.
\
* End the ""Enron Loophole."" Created in 2000, this loophole exempts electronic energy trading from federal commodities laws. Virtually overnight, it freed over-the-counter energy trading from meaningful oversight, opening the door to excessive speculation and energy price manipulation. We also must regulate the secretive hedge fund industry which has also driven up the price of oil. Some experts believe a ""speculation premium"" is driving up oil prices by as much as 50 percent.
\
* Demand that Saudi Arabia and other OPEC oil-producing countries increase their production and put more oil on the market. Incredibly, Saudi Arabia is producing less oil today than it did two years ago. Experts believe that Saudi Arabia alone has the capability to increase oil production by 1.8 million barrels a day. The U.S. also should work to end the OPEC cartel which, in my view, functions in violation of international trade rules by illegally colluding to limit oil production and drive up prices. The exploding price of oil is expected to increase OPEC's crude oil export earnings by $300 billion this year to a record $980 billion.
\
* Stop the flow of oil into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and immediately release oil from this federal stockpile. With the Reserve at 97 percent of capacity, the release of oil into the market will send a strong signal to the industry that the U.S. government is serious about lowering oil and gas prices. This strategy pushed down oil prices during the administrations of George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton. Goldman Sachs has estimated that continuing to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve has increased gas prices at the pump by as much as 25 cents a gallon.
\
Let me be clear. Despite support from many members of Congress, it is not going to be easy to pass any of these initiatives to lower gas prices. Since 1998, the oil and gas industry has spent $616 million lobbying Congress. Since 1990, they have made more than $213 million in campaign contributions. Big Oil, hedge funds and the financial services industry also have enormous power in Washington, not to mention a very good friend in the White House.
\
Nonetheless, if there was ever a moment in time for Congress to stand up to the greed of Big Oil and powerful financial institutions, this is it. The American people are hurting and they're asking for help. Let's respond and lower the price of oil and gas.

Last year alone, Exxon-Mobil made $40 billion in profits, and rewarded its CEO Rex Tillerson with $21 million in total compensation. (Several years ago they provided their outgoing CEO Lee Raymond with a $400 million retirement package). Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Shell and BP also have posted record profits. In fact, the five largest oil companies in this country have made $595 billion in profits since George W. Bush has been president.
\
Sadly, as in so many other areas regarding the needs of ordinary Americans, the Bush-Cheney administration has had nothing relevant to say. In their previous lives, both Bush and Cheney were heavily involved in the oil industry. They are far more concerned about the needs of oil company executives than working families.
\
So with deafening silence from the White House, Congress must act and act now.
\
There is no single silver bullet that will lower oil prices. The solution rests with action on a number of fronts - both long term and short term.
\
Long term, we must significantly increase our efforts at breaking our dependency on foreign oil and fossil fuels in general and move toward energy efficiency and such sustainable energies as solar, wind, geo-thermal and bio-mass. In the process, we can create millions of good paying jobs as we reverse global warming, clean up our environment and lower energy costs.
\
Short term, in order to address the immediate crisis, we need to:
\
* Impose an excise tax on oil companies. The $35 billion in new revenue would fund a six-month federal and state ""gas tax holiday."" This approach would lower the price of gas by up to 36 cents a gallon without reducing the Highway Trust Fund at a time when repairs to our decaying roads and bridges are desperately needed.
\
* End the ""Enron Loophole."" Created in 2000, this loophole exempts electronic energy trading from federal commodities laws. Virtually overnight, it freed over-the-counter energy trading from meaningful oversight, opening the door to excessive speculation and energy price manipulation. We also must regulate the secretive hedge fund industry which has also driven up the price of oil. Some experts believe a ""speculation premium"" is driving up oil prices by as much as 50 percent.
\
* Demand that Saudi Arabia and other OPEC oil-producing countries increase their production and put more oil on the market. Incredibly, Saudi Arabia is producing less oil today than it did two years ago. Experts believe that Saudi Arabia alone has the capability to increase oil production by 1.8 million barrels a day. The U.S. also should work to end the OPEC cartel which, in my view, functions in violation of international trade rules by illegally colluding to limit oil production and drive up prices. The exploding price of oil is expected to increase OPEC's crude oil export earnings by $300 billion this year to a record $980 billion.
\
* Stop the flow of oil into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and immediately release oil from this federal stockpile. With the Reserve at 97 percent of capacity, the release of oil into the market will send a strong signal to the industry that the U.S. government is serious about lowering oil and gas prices. This strategy pushed down oil prices during the administrations of George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton. Goldman Sachs has estimated that continuing to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve has increased gas prices at the pump by as much as 25 cents a gallon.
\
Let me be clear. Despite support from many members of Congress, it is not going to be easy to pass any of these initiatives to lower gas prices. Since 1998, the oil and gas industry has spent $616 million lobbying Congress. Since 1990, they have made more than $213 million in campaign contributions. Big Oil, hedge funds and the financial services industry also have enormous power in Washington, not to mention a very good friend in the White House.
\
Nonetheless, if there was ever a moment in time for Congress to stand up to the greed of Big Oil and powerful financial institutions, this is it. The American people are hurting and they're asking for help. Let's respond and lower the price of oil and gas.

BRATTLEBORO -- On a chilly February morning in Brattleboro, local lawmakers were thinking about home heating.
\
Specifically, several officials who attended a legislative breakfast on Monday spoke about the need to weatherize tens of thousands of Vermont homes in order to save money and curb carbon-dioxide emissions.
\
State Sen. Peter Galbraith, D-Townshend, believes such an effort is far more valuable to the environment than building wind turbines.
\
""The best form of renewable energy is the energy you don't use - conservation,"" Galbraith said.
\
A recent report from a state Thermal Efficiency Task Force makes the case for a significant push to weatherize homes and businesses. By doing so, a report summary says, ""Vermonters will be less vulnerable to volatility in the fuel market and to effects from dramatic weather fluctuations, and more money will stay within the Vermont economy.""
\
Legislators had set a goal of improving energy efficiency in 80,000 homes by 2020.
\
But state Rep. Mike Hebert noted on Monday that ""we're not anywhere near meeting that goal.""
\
The efficiency task force lobbies for tens of millions in state investment annually to meet efficiency goals. That investment, officials said, will pay off.
\
""Each new public dollar invested would secure $6.18 in direct fuel-price benefits over the life of the measures installed,"" the task force report says. ""Overall, gross state product, including direct and other interactive effects of the recommended new spending and savings on the total economy, increases $1.47 for every $1 invested.""
\
The question, though, is where that state money will come from. Hebert, a Republican who serves Vernon and Guilford, said he does not support a proposal to impose an excise tax on homeheating fuel. Gov. Peter Shumlin has proposed taxing ""break-open tickets"" - a form of gambling - to generate money for clean-energy development, thermal-efficiency improvements and a state contribution to a heating fund for low-income residents.
\
Shumlin envisions raising $17 million from that ticket tax, and he said in his budget address that $6 million could be applied toward weatherization.
\
But Galbraith is not buying the governor's revenue projections.
\
""I think that's very unrealistic,"" he said. ""I think we're going to have to find a more realistic source of revenue.""
\
Galbraith said many homeowners are unwilling to reach into their own pockets for weatherization. That may be because they simply don't have the money, or they may wonder whether they'll own a home long enough for such a project to pay for itself through energy savings.
\
One way to get around those problems, Galbraith said, is a revolving loan fund.
\
For instance, homeowners could take out a weatherization loan that then attaches to their property tax. If the home is sold, the purchaser would be responsible for the balance of the loan.
\
Adding loan payments to a property owner's utility bills is another possible approach, Galbraith said.
\
Of course, he noted that still leads to an important question at the state level: ""How do we raise the money for the revolving loan fund?""
\
Lawmakers discussed a variety of other topics at Monday's breakfast, including: - State Rep. Mollie Burke, a Brattleboro Progressive Democrat who serves on the House Transportation Committee, said legislators are working on solutions to projected shortfalls in transportation funding.
\
That could include tweaks to the state gas-tax formula, which would lead to paying more at the pump.
\
Burke also said boosting the state's transportation funding is critical because that leverages significant federal cash.
\
""We do not want to leave federal money in Washington while our roads and bridges need attention,"" Burke said. - Hebert, who serves on the House Natural Resources and Energy Committee, said legislators are undertaking a comprehensive review of Act 200 and Act 250, Vermont's land-use regulations.
\
""It seems we're opening a can of worms,"" Hebert said. ""I'm hearing from everyone who's ever had an issue with Act 250.""
\
-- State Rep. Tristan Toleno, a Brattleboro Democrat serving on the Agriculture Committee, said there have been applications for more than $10 million in funding from the state's new Working Lands Enterprise Initiative.
\
That's 10 times the cash available under that program this year.
\
While noting that board members face a tough decision in deciding which of those projects are worthy, Toleno saw a positive in the program's immediate popularity.
\
""It shows the richness that's happening in that sector,"" Toleno said.
\
-- State Sen. Jeanette White, a Putney Democrat, said she expects the Legislature to tackle campaign-finance reform this year.
\
White also said her Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to hear testimony this week on a bill that would allow doctors to prescribe a lethal dose of medication to terminally ill patients who ask for it.
\
The bill passed the Senate Health and Welfare Committee last week.
\
White noted the various labels attached to the bill by supporters and opponents.
\
""I'm not calling it 'death with dignity' or 'assisted suicide,'"" she said. ""I'm calling it, 'patient choice.'"" - Galbraith said Vermonters must ""play to our strengths"" - including a clean environment and low crime - in order to attract more people and jobs.
\
But he also said the state desperately needs better high-speed Internet coverage.
\
""I know from talking to Realtors that houses without broadband sell for 20-percent less than houses with it,"" Galbraith said.
\
Shumlin has pledged that all Vermont homes will have broadband access by the end of this year. The state also has pushed for better cell-phone coverage.
\
Noting an earlier reference to a bill that would prohibit talking on cell phones while driving, Galbraith offered this take: ""We should have the cell-phone coverage before we ban it.""

190,"For the first time, the Vermont Chamber of Commerce has gathered together a list of all the taxes, fees and mandates passed by the Legislature that affect Vermont businesses -- to the tune of $52 million in 2015 alone. The Chamber calls it ""The Impact List.""\""In 2015 there were so many proposals that would impact businesses we were having difficulty keeping up,"" said Betsy Bishop, president of the Chamber. ""In one of our strategy sessions each of us had made lists.""\Bishop put the lists together and took them on the road, presenting The Impact List to business audiences around the state, beginning on July 24 at the Central Vermont Chamber of Commerce in Barre and ending Jan. 25 in the Northeast Kingdom, at a time and location to be announced.\Bishop, who was deputy chief of staff and economic development commissioner for Gov. Jim Douglas before taking the reins at the Chamber in 2009, also works as a lobbyist.\This year, Bishop and her lobbying crew were worried about $220,300 in new restaurant licensing charges and $444,000 in new revenue from increases in Act 250 fees. Altogether, fee increases raise $3.6 million. They were worried about various income tax changes, including capping itemized reductions at 2.5 times the standard amount, eliminating the deduction of state and local income taxes and implementing a 3 percent minimum tax for filers with more than $150,000 in adjusted gross income. Those changes raise a total of $22.9 million. And there was more, to reach the $52 million total.\Looking ahead to 2016, The Impact List points out the state is already facing a nearly $50 million projected budget gap. Legislators will debate expanding the sales tax to services, mandating paid sick leave, costing employers up to $14.2 million annually, raising the rooms, meals and alcohol tax rates and implementing a carbon tax. Also, the minimum wage, set at $9.15 in 2015, will increase to $10.50 by 2018.\Bishop said she expects the list of concerns for 2016 from businesses to grow as she continues her Impact List road show around the state.\""When we started talking about 2015 and 2016 we had a lot of members say, 'It's not just about what happened this year, we're still trying to absorb a doubling of unemployment insurance tax from five years ago,'"" Bishop said.\A useful tool\Sen. Kevin Mullin, R- Rutland, chair of the Senate Economic Development Committee, rejects the notion that Vermont is anti-business, especially in the last couple of years when he said there has been more emphasis in the Legislature on creating jobs.\Mullin credits the Vermont Chamber of Commerce with acknowledging the positive steps the Legislature has taken, including support for tourism and economic development marketing, an updated law governing limited liability companies, making it clear that so-called ""cloud"" services on the Internet are not taxable, and expanded eligibility for the Vermont Employment Growth Incentive program.\Mullin calls the Impact List a ""useful tool,"" because it reminds legislators everything they do has a cumulative effect.\""Unfortunately a lot of the time in the Legislature people are working in the vacuum of their own committees,"" Mullin said. ""It's never one fee, regulation, tax or mandate, it's the cumulative effect that's stressful on business. Anything that drives up cost or the annoyance factor is hard on them.""\Mullin said he's committed to continuing to find ways to make doing business in Vermont easier.\""Vermont has a good message to send,"" he said. ""We're not like New York with hundreds of millions of dollars we can shower on people but we're still able to compete. The main reason is because of the Vermont worker. Talk to any business. Their productivity is outstanding. It's in the DNA of Vermonters to have a strong work ethic.""\Vermont Teddy Bear President and CEO Bill Shouldice agrees with Mullin that the quality of the Vermont worker is the state's main competitive advantage.\""We'll never compete on incentives, but we can compete on quality -- of our workers, and our living style,"" he said\Vermont is not anti-business, said Shouldice, secretary of commerce in the Howard Dean administration, ""but like any other place in the country we have work to do to improve the business climate.""\""We need vision and leadership,"" he said. ""We don't have it and haven't had it for some time, a decade.""\The office of Gov. Peter Shumlin did not respond to a call for comment. Secretary of Commerce Pat Moulton, however, said the administration is ""clearly pro-business.""\""We want to work with existing businesses, new entrepreneurs, and attract new businesses, in that order,"" Moulton said. ""It's important to take care of businesses in our back yard and make sure they're happy.""\Moulton acknowledges the state has economic challenges, including a permitting process that in some cases ""has not gone smoothly,"" but says the administration is committed to protecting the environment and quality of life that makes Vermont special.\""I've said publicly many times, we are not Anywhere USA, we are not Anywhere New England,"" Moulton said. ""We are Vermont. We have a unique brand. The brand sells product and tourism.""\Big picture optimism\Referring to The Impact List compiled by the Vermont Chamber, Moulton said there are several items the governor is opposing, including a carbon tax.\""It may be a good idea, but we can't be the only state in the region that does it,"" she said. ""It will put us at an economic disadvantage. Let's say Vermont adds 10 cents a gallon gas tax as a carbon tax. Everybody along our borders can trot across the border and gas up for less. It creates a disincentive to do business in Vermont.""\Looking at the big economic picture for Vermont, Moulton said the forecasts are good, and that companies are creating jobs. She referenced the recent ribbon cutting at Logic Supply in South Burlington, which opened a $3 million expansion to its headquarters.\""There's a lot of confidence in the market,"" Moulton said. ""Canadian companies are looking to Vermont as a potential location. All the big picture signs are looking good.""\Bill Shouldice countered that Vermont businesses need ""stability and predictability"" in tax policy, in regulations, and in the population of the state, which he points out grew less than half a percent from 2008 to today.\Lt. Gov. Phil Scott, who is a candidate for governor, goes further on the population question, saying that according to the last Census, Vermont lost 30,000 people between the ages of 25 and 45 years old.\""That's the working class, the folks who buy homes, have families,"" Scott said.\Uncertainty looming\Scott was a businessman, as owner of Dubois Construction in Middlesex, before he was a politician, and says he got into politics about 20 years ago because he was tired of complaining about government policies.\""I didn't have a political bone in my body, but I started to get extremely frustrated with what I thought they were doing to me in Montpelier,"" Scott said. ""They didn't have a complete understanding of what they were doing in terms of obstacles and impacts we faced as a result of actions they took. I thought maybe I should get involved instead of complaining.""\As a case-in-point of problematic legislation, Scott points to the dialogue around health care.\""What happened with single payer was the discussion went on for three or four years, it never came to a close in a timely fashion,"" Scott said. ""You had businesses that would be impacted that were very concerned by the uncertainty that was looming over them. What they did was play the wait-and-see game. Let's not do anything, let's not expand our business, let's wait and see what they're going to do in little old Vermont.""\Vermont needs to pay attention to demographics, Scott said, and find ways to address what he calls a ""crisis of affordability."" The state has a great story to tell, he said -- about quality of life and an innovative spirit -- but doesn't tell that story often enough or well enough.\The Impact List is right on the money, Scott said, but in an ironic twist, the list ""has a way of again creating that negative climate.""\""We can't put our heads in the sand,"" he said. ""I think we're in the stage where we need to make sure we understand we have a problem. If we can accept that, then we can move on to doing something about it, working together.""\No help needed from Montpelier\Vermont Teddy Bear has 164 employees, and every year hires up to 700 temporary employees for the company's busy seasons. The best of those employees can find permanent employment with core staff, Shouldice said. Finding so many temps is problematic for the company.\""Vermont needs population growth,"" he said. ""How do you grow? By making it more desirable for youth to stay, creating jobs.""\Bill Shouldice bristles at the notion of state-mandated sick leave, up for consideration by the legislature next year.\""I'm not sure I need Montpelier to tell me the right thing to do by my employees,"" he said. ""Mandated increases in the minimum wage, mandated family leave, those are the types of things I find insulting. We live in a free market society. We give our employees -- on day 1-- five weeks vacation. If we're not treating our employees well, they'll take their good skills down the street. We're competing every day to keep our labor force, and I don't need Montpelier to tell me what's best for our employees.""\That may be the case for Vermont Teddy Bear, said Sen. David Zuckerman, P/D-Chittenden County, but it's not the case for some Vermont businesses, which is why he supports mandated leave.\""I think it's important when a business is successful that they have such a good ethic, but not all successful businesses have that ethic,"" Zuckerman said.\Zuckerman also questions Shouldice's assertion that his employees can leave if they don't like their treatment at Vermont Teddy Bear.\""The right-to-work mentality that he presents is one way of thinking, but not everybody is in such a position as an employee to up and switch jobs as easily as he seems to suggest,"" Zuckerman said.\Zuckerman is also a businessman, having built Full Moon Farm in Hinesburg from a two-acre operation in 1999 run with his wife to 150 acres and 10 employees today.\""Farmers don't face all of the same regulatory hurdles other businesses face, but we have our own challenges,"" Zuckerman said. ""We still have to meet workers' compensation, payroll taxes and health care payments, and we've been able to grow successfully.""\Zuckerman agrees that the state sometimes makes things difficult for him with taxes, fees and mandates, but adds that the state also opens up ""pathways for success.""\""Whether it's transportation networks or job training or creating that level playing field so someone doesn't undercut us with unethical business practices,"" he said.\A rival farm that pays its employees cash under the table is a bigger problem for Zuckerman than taxes and mandates from the state, he said.\""When I pay $9.50 or $10 an hour, plus unlimited vegetables, it costs me $12 an hour between workers' comp, payroll taxes and social security,"" Zuckerman said. ""When a competitor pays employees $10 cash employees get more and it costs them less. That scenario competing for quality employees makes it much harder than anything the state imposes.""\Ultimately, Zuckerman said, Vermont will get the economy it deserves.\""Are we going to create and maintain an economy that values our workers and our environment/natural surroundings as equals with the sole financial bottom line, or do we want to join other states in a race to the bottom?"" he asked.\As for The Impact List compiled by the Vermont Chamber, Shouldice compares it to ""death by a thousand nicks.""\""When you're talking about raising taxes and a looming deficit, if you're someone who is thinking about investing in Vermont you ask yourself, 'Where is that money going to come from? Is it coming from me?'"" Shouldice said. ""That's not predictable.""\Vermont, says Shouldice, needs a ""wholesale conversation about what we can afford.""\This story was first published on MONTH DATE YEAR.

191,"GLENN RUSSELL/FREE PRESS\Gov. Peter Shumlin and legislative leaders say they hear it all the time from business owners: They can't find workers with the right training for the jobs that are available.\So as the 2013 legislative session begins this week, state policy-makers say they are looking at making stronger links between schools and employers.\""The biggest challenge Vermont faces now is between the work employers have and the skills employees have,"" Shumlin said in a recent interview with the Burlington Free Press. ""I see Vermont on the precipice of a pretty vibrant recovery. Two things stand in the way: Federal government's inaction and Vermont not having the ability to train its workforce.""\In virtually every public comment about the upcoming legislative session, Shumlin emphasizes jobs and prosperity, phrases also oft-uttered by his predecessor. ""My goal is to continue to make progress growing jobs and growing prosperity for Vermonters,"" Shumlin said.\That, he said, will come from his previously promised statewide coverage of high-speed Internet by year's end, by continuing to build in-state renewable energy, by developing the nation's first single-payer health care system, and finally, by boosting the state's education system to give employers the help they need.\Shumlin said he plans to expound on the specifics of his job-education ideas in his inaugural address to the Legislature on Thursday. Some of the plans, he said, he's not even shared with legislative leaders yet.\Few would argue against doing more to help Vermonters find jobs, but plenty of people have different opinions about whether this is the biggest challenge standing in the way of job creation in Vermont. Some wonder whether schools really can prepare students for specific work when the market and technology is constantly changing.\Ask 100 business owners what help they need and you are likely to come up with at least 90 different answers. Some say that yes, they have a tough time finding qualified workers and that the state's education system holds the key to economic success. Others say they have no problem finding good workers right here at home.\What some say is the biggest inhibitor to job growth is something Shumlin and the Legislature aren't planning to do this year: Tell them how they're going to fund a single-payer health care system they plan to launch in 2017.\Some businesses could end up paying less, some more to insure employees under a new system, but without some sense of how much and by what means it will be paid, businesses don't know how to plan, said Lisa Ventriss, president of the Vermont Business Roundtable.\""The thing that would benefit job creation in the new year is helping business feel more secure around this issue of health care,"" Ventriss said. ""Businesses have been reluctant to invest in their human capital.""\Shumlin, by contrast, argued that a single-payer health care system will be a job creator by reducing the cost of health care and taking the burden of administering insurance coverage off the backs of employers. He said it's too early to come up with a financial plan for the system.\""We have two years to have a very transparent conversation about how to move from an unsustainable system to one that we can afford,"" Shumlin said.\Education, meet jobs\Shumlin offered a hint of what he has in mind for helping to link Vermonters with jobs at a news conference last week in which he announced some staffing appointments.\Susan Bartlett, a former state senator who has been special assistant to the governor for the last two years, will shift to the Agency of Human Services to work as special projects coordinator. Her job will include making sure that low-income Vermonters have access to the skills and education they need to find jobs at a decent wage, she said.\Other pieces of the plan will likely include the way secondary schools and colleges prepare students for the workforce.\House Speaker Shap Smith, D-Morristown, said his Commerce and Education committees will hear from Vermont State Colleges and the secondary-education technical schools about what they are already doing in that vein.\He said he also wants to know what businesses are doing to train their own employees. He said legislators will be asking, ""Are you doing anything more than complaining or are you working with these institutions?""\Senate President Pro Tempore John Campbell, D-Windsor, said the issue is also on the Senate's radar. He said he's interested in making it easier for students to get the job training they need without incurring crippling debt.\""Kids who don't want to go to college need more two-year programs,"" Campbell said. ""People can focus on learning a specific job with half the debt.""\Tom Torti, president of the Lake Champlain Chamber of Commerce, said his members are finding that students are graduating without basic skills needed to do the jobs that are available.\Torti said employers don't necessarily need a worker who knows a specific computer program. ""We want people who can critically solve problems and have basic math skills,"" he said. ""Employers are telling us that people who are showing up are not competent to do the job.""\Torti said he will be asking state leaders for more rigor at the high school level, possibly with an assessment of skills required during junior year so the student and school can focus on anything that's lacking during senior year. Those who've mastered the skills can restructure their senior year to take college classes, he said.\Bill Stritzler, managing director of Smugglers' Notch Resort in Jeffersonville, said he sees the education system as the state's single-greatest economic development tool. A member of the Vermont Business Roundtable, he said, ""We are convinced that's the answer. The best way to raise income is to raise the education level.""\Paul Millman, founder of Chroma Technologies, which makes optical filters in Bellows Falls, said that though his company's work is technical, the thing that stands out as lacking to him among some job prospects is ""they can't speak or write English very well. I'm very much in favor of everybody learning to read and write well.""\""We demand a lot of our employees,"" Millman said, as the company is employee-owned. ""We expect our people to be good problem solvers.""\Another challenge, he said, is his fairly rural location. ""Single people like to live in a bigger environment than Bellows Falls.""\Dan Smith, director of community relations and public policy at Vermont State Colleges, said the colleges already are working with employers to understand what kind of jobs are available.\His best advice for a solution to the issue of turning out more prepared employees: Money. Vermont has long rated near the bottom for state support of its public colleges and university.\""Part of my hope is that people realize the chronic complaint is the byproduct of over the last 30 years we've slowly divested in our colleges,"" Smith said. ""I hope people begin to see the connection. Our hope is that we see some support targeted to more students enrolling and completing college.""\Secretary of Administration Jeb Spaulding hinted the administration's budget would include some extra money for higher education. ""We are interested in trying to end four years of level funding of higher education.""\Stephan Morse, chairman of the state Board of Education, said that on the secondary school level, he thinks there is room for schools to better prepare students for the workforce. That's something the board has been looking at, he said, and he expects will produce recommendations for changes in graduation requirements this spring. That could pair with Shumlin's push for statewide math requirements in high school.\Cairn Cross, co-founder of FreshTracks Capital, a Shelburne entity that invests in Vermont companies, warned against trying to prepare students for specific jobs. ""That's an impossible task,"" he said. ""The job needs, particularly in the technology sector, change so dramatically.""\To encourage job growth, he recommended instead some other moves. Among them, he said, is that the state should steer clear of imposing the sales tax on ""cloud computing,"" or software accessed remotely. The House supports the tax, saying it's only fair to tax all products the same. Cross argued that many of Vermont's most robust new companies -- Dealer.com, MyWebGrocer and Inntopia -- are coming from that sector of business, have a worldwide audience to allow for further growth and should not be discouraged by a sales tax not charged in some other states.\Cross also recommended state law be changed to allow those receiving unemployment to work on starting their own businesses. ""We don't do a lot to encourage people who've lost their jobs to start their own businesses,"" he said.\Art Woolf, a University of Vermont economics professor who leans conservative, said the best thing the state can do to foster job growth is create a fertile economic climate through reasonable taxes and predictable regulations. That will allow entrepreneurs to generate jobs that the market will fill, he said.\He argued that Vermont doesn't have that due to its tax structure, relatively high energy and housing costs, and tight regulations.\By contrast, the liberal-leaning Public Assets Institute argued in an article published last week that the state is creating the right environment. The old ways of offering tax credits and relaxing regulations don't work, the group said, but laws passed in 2011 to shift the focus to how policy is impacting Vermonters' well-being will help.\""They acknowledged that tax and spending policies should be weighed by how well they meet Vermonters' basic human needs,"" Paul Cillo and Jack Hoffman of Public Assets Institute wrote.\There are signs that Vermont's economy is moving forward, like a train that has chugged its way uphill and finally reached the crest.\Reservations were up at Smugglers' Notch Resort even before the skies dropped buckets of powder the last couple weeks, Stritzler said. The company is opening new lodging and adding employees to staff it, he said.\Overseas demand is spreading for Chroma Technology's optical filters, Millman said.\Vermont Business Roundtable's survey of business last fall indicated that 43 percent expect to increase employment, compared to 33 percent earlier in the year.\There are also signs that Vermont's economy is not all it could be. Woolf pointed out that the state's population declined from 2011 to 2012, joining only Rhode Island in that category, according to U.S. Census Bureau numbers released in late December.\""That's not a sign of a robust economy,"" Woolf said.\Still, he said of the state's economy, ""We turned a corner maybe three years ago. The last few years we have been growing.""\Whether the state can do something to nudge business growth further remains to be seen.\Betsy Bishop, president of the Vermont Chamber of Commerce and a former economic development commissioner in the Douglas administration, said no single solution spurs jobs. ""Job creation is not a science,"" she said.\Bishop said her members are looking to the state for greater certainty -- on health care, on taxes and on regulations. On tax policy, she said, there has been a lot of uncertainty in recent years as the state ramped up its efforts on compliance.\""We are just headed out of a recession. Our hope is that the Legislature does not add any new regulations or taxes or new programs,"" Bishop said.\Ventriss said the Vermont Business Roundtable will push the Shumlin administration and Legislature to come out earlier with funding plans for the proposed single-payer health care system the system. She said, however, that she worries that a host of social issues that legislators and the governor have on their lists, from physician-assisted death to unionizing child care workers, could soak up all the energy.\""Every one of them could consume a legislature for an entire year,"" Ventriss said.\Not true, argued House Speaker Smith, Senate President Campbell and Gov.

192,"MONTPELIER -- Gov. Peter Shumlin and legislative leaders say they hear it all the time from business owners: They can't find workers with the right training for the jobs that are available.\So as the 2013 legislative session begins this week, state policy-makers say they are looking at making stronger links between schools and employers.\""The biggest challenge Vermont faces now is between the work employers have and the skills employees have,"" Shumlin said in a recent interview with the Burlington Free Press. ""I see Vermont on the precipice of a pretty vibrant recovery. Two things stand in the way: Federal government's inaction and Vermont not having the ability to train its workforce.""\In virtually every public comment about the upcoming legislative session, Shumlin emphasizes jobs and prosperity, phrases also oft-uttered by his predecessor. ""My goal is to continue to make progress growing jobs and growing prosperity for Vermonters,"" Shumlin said.\That, he said, will come from his previously promised statewide coverage of high-speed Internet by year's end, by continuing to build in-state renewable energy, by developing the nation's first single-payer health care system, and finally, by boosting the state's education system to give employers the help they need.\Shumlin said he plans to expound on the specifics of his job-education ideas in his inaugural address to the Legislature on Thursday. Some of the plans, he said, he's not even shared with legislative leaders yet.\Few would argue against doing more to help Vermonters find jobs, but plenty of people have different opinions about whether this is the biggest challenge standing in the way of job creation in Vermont. Some wonder whether schools really can prepare students for specific work when the market and technology is constantly changing.\Ask 100 business owners what help they need and you are likely to come up with at least 90 different answers. Some say that yes, they have a tough time finding qualified workers and that the state's education system holds the key to economic success. Others say they have no problem finding good workers right here at home.\What some say is the biggest inhibitor to job growth is something Shumlin and the Legislature aren't planning to do this year: Tell them how they're going to fund a single-payer health care system they plan to launch in 2017.\Some businesses could end up paying less, some more to insure employees under a new system, but without some sense of how much and by what means it will be paid, businesses don't know how to plan, said Lisa Ventriss, president of the Vermont Business Roundtable.\""The thing that would benefit job creation in the new year is helping business feel more secure around this issue of health care,"" Ventriss said. ""Businesses have been reluctant to invest in their human capital.""\Shumlin, by contrast, argued that a single-payer health care system will be a job creator by reducing the cost of health care and taking the burden of administering insurance coverage off the backs of employers. He said it's too early to come up with a financial plan for the system.\""We have two years to have a very transparent conversation about how to move from an unsustainable system to one that we can afford,"" Shumlin said.\Education, meet jobs\Shumlin offered a hint of what he has in mind for helping to link Vermonters with jobs at a news conference last week in which he announced some staffing appointments.\Susan Bartlett, a former state senator who has been special assistant to the governor for the last two years, will shift to the Agency of Human Services to work as special projects coordinator. Her job will include making sure that low-income Vermonters have access to the skills and education they need to find jobs at a decent wage, she said.\Other pieces of the plan will likely include the way secondary schools and colleges prepare students for the workforce.\House Speaker Shap Smith, D-Morristown, said his Commerce and Education committees will hear from Vermont State Colleges and the secondary-education technical schools about what they are already doing in that vein.\He said he also wants to know what businesses are doing to train their own employees. He said legislators will be asking, ""Are you doing anything more than complaining or are you working with these institutions?""\Senate President Pro Tempore John Campbell, D-Windsor, said the issue is also on the Senate's radar. He said he's interested in making it easier for students to get the job training they need without incurring crippling debt.\""Kids who don't want to go to college need more two-year programs,"" Campbell said. ""People can focus on learning a specific job with half the debt.""\Tom Torti, president of the Lake Champlain Chamber of Commerce, said his members are finding that students are graduating without basic skills needed to do the jobs that are available.\Torti said employers don't necessarily need a worker who knows a specific computer program. ""We want people who can critically solve problems and have basic math skills,"" he said. ""Employers are telling us that people who are showing up are not competent to do the job.""\Torti said he will be asking state leaders for more rigor at the high school level, possibly with an assessment of skills required during junior year so the student and school can focus on anything that's lacking during senior year. Those who've mastered the skills can restructure their senior year to take college classes, he said.\Bill Stritzler, managing director of Smugglers' Notch Resort in Jeffersonville, said he sees the education system as the state's single-greatest economic development tool. A member of the Vermont Business Roundtable, he said, ""We are convinced that's the answer. The best way to raise income is to raise the education level.""\Paul Millman, founder of Chroma Technologies, which makes optical filters in Bellows Falls, said that though his company's work is technical, the thing that stands out as lacking to him among some job prospects is ""they can't speak or write English very well. I'm very much in favor of everybody learning to read and write well.""\""We demand a lot of our employees,"" Millman said, as the company is employee-owned. ""We expect our people to be good problem solvers.""\Another challenge, he said, is his fairly rural location. ""Single people like to live in a bigger environment than Bellows Falls.""\Dan Smith, director of community relations and public policy at Vermont State Colleges, said the colleges already are working with employers to understand what kind of jobs are available.\His best advice for a solution to the issue of turning out more prepared employees: Money. Vermont has long rated near the bottom for state support of its public colleges and university.\""Part of my hope is that people realize the chronic complaint is the byproduct of over the last 30 years we've slowly divested in our colleges,"" Smith said. ""I hope people begin to see the connection. Our hope is that we see some support targeted to more students enrolling and completing college.""\Secretary of Administration Jeb Spaulding hinted the administration's budget would include some extra money for higher education. ""We are interested in trying to end four years of level funding of higher education.""\Stephan Morse, chairman of the state Board of Education, said that on the secondary school level, he thinks there is room for schools to better prepare students for the workforce. That's something the board has been looking at, he said, and he expects will produce recommendations for changes in graduation requirements this spring. That could pair with Shumlin's push for statewide math requirements in high school.\Cairn Cross, co-founder of FreshTracks Capital, a Shelburne entity that invests in Vermont companies, warned against trying to prepare students for specific jobs. ""That's an impossible task,"" he said. ""The job needs, particularly in the technology sector, change so dramatically.""\To encourage job growth, he recommended instead some other moves. Among them, he said, is that the state should steer clear of imposing the sales tax on ""cloud computing,"" or software accessed remotely. The House supports the tax, saying it's only fair to tax all products the same. Cross argued that many of Vermont's most robust new companies -- Dealer.com, MyWebGrocer and Inntopia -- are coming from that sector of business, have a worldwide audience to allow for further growth and should not be discouraged by a sales tax not charged in some other states.\Cross also recommended state law be changed to allow those receiving unemployment to work on starting their own businesses. ""We don't do a lot to encourage people who've lost their jobs to start their own businesses,"" he said.\Art Woolf, a University of Vermont economics professor who leans conservative, said the best thing the state can do to foster job growth is create a fertile economic climate through reasonable taxes and predictable regulations. That will allow entrepreneurs to generate jobs that the market will fill, he said.\He argued that Vermont doesn't have that due to its tax structure, relatively high energy and housing costs, and tight regulations.\By contrast, the liberal-leaning Public Assets Institute argued in an article published last week that the state is creating the right environment. The old ways of offering tax credits and relaxing regulations don't work, the group said, but laws passed in 2011 to shift the focus to how policy is impacting Vermonters' well-being will help.\""They acknowledged that tax and spending policies should be weighed by how well they meet Vermonters' basic human needs,"" Paul Cillo and Jack Hoffman of Public Assets Institute wrote.\Signs of growth?\There are signs that Vermont's economy is moving forward, like a train that has chugged its way uphill and finally reached the crest.\Reservations were up at Smugglers' Notch Resort even before the skies dropped buckets of powder the last couple weeks, Stritzler said. The company is opening new lodging and adding employees to staff it, he said.\Overseas demand is spreading for Chroma Technology's optical filters, Millman said.\Vermont Business Roundtable's survey of business last fall indicated that 43 percent expect to increase employment, compared to 33 percent earlier in the year.\There are also signs that Vermont's economy is not all it could be. Woolf pointed out that the state's population declined from 2011 to 2012, joining only Rhode Island in that category, according to U.S. Census Bureau numbers released in late December.\""That's not a sign of a robust economy,"" Woolf said.\Still, he said of the state's economy, ""We turned a corner maybe three years ago. The last few years we have been growing.""\Whether the state can do something to nudge business growth further remains to be seen.\Betsy Bishop, president of the Vermont Chamber of Commerce and a former economic development commissioner in the Douglas administration, said no single solution spurs jobs. ""Job creation is not a science,"" she said.\Bishop said her members are looking to the state for greater certainty -- on health care, on taxes and on regulations. On tax policy, she said, there has been a lot of uncertainty in recent years as the state ramped up its efforts on compliance.\""We are just headed out of a recession. Our hope is that the Legislature does not add any new regulations or taxes or new programs,"" Bishop said.\Ventriss said the Vermont Business Roundtable will push the Shumlin administration and Legislature to come out earlier with funding plans for the proposed single-payer health care system the system. She said, however, that she worries that a host of social issues that legislators and the governor have on their lists, from physician-assisted death to unionizing child care workers, could soak up all the energy.\""Every one of them could consume a legislature for an entire year,"" Ventriss said.\Not true, argued House Speaker Smith, Senate President Campbell and Gov. Shumlin, who set the priorities for the legislative session.\""They can juggle a lot of balls,"" Shumlin said.

I want to thank The Banner for excellent coverage of the Harvest Festival event at Mount Anthony Union Middle School on Nov. 1. Needless to say the event was a collaborative effort by a dedicated team of teachers and administrators within the school and was made possible by the generous support of numerous community members.
\
On behalf of the school we would like to express our gratitude to those who contributed to the success of our first school-wide Harvest Festival. In particular we would like to mention school board member Dave Durphy for the loan of his cider press along with Christy Nevius of Shaftsbury for her cider press and hard work making cider for 575 middle school students.
\
We would also like to thank: Rob LaPort of Terry's Orchard for his generous donation of apples, Keith Armstrong of Pownal for the pumpkins that were used to make scarecrows, Rick Heyniger and Deena Chapelle for providing the music that had children dancing in the halls, the employees of Abbey Foods who worked both in the kitchen and in the classroom to provide a fabulous lunch, Pastor Robin Greene for hours of leg work and outreach and finally all of the parent volunteers who helped make the event happen.
\
The feedback that we have received from within the school and by the participants has been overwhelmingly enthusiastic. The primary duty of any school is to provide a strong academic program and a positive learning environment for its students. A celebration of this nature provides a welcome opportunity for teachers and students to learn and interact in new and non-traditional ways, which fosters positive relationships and builds a stronger community for all.

Sustaionable Living teacher, MAUMSQuality child care is key
\
I am writing this letter in support of the early educators' right to organize. I encourage my legislators (Sen. Sears, Sen. Hartwell, Rep. Mook and Rep. Morrissey) to support that right also. Being at the table will help early educators to have a voice in the decisions that affect their lives.
\
The provision of quality child care and early education for every child is the key to fighting the cycle of generational poverty. Vermont's early educators provide quality child care so that Vermont families can work and earn a living.
\
I'm glad that Vermont Early Educators United is working on the bill and encourage visiting www.kidscountonme.org for more information.

Need a budget that puts people first
\
I am retired and I am a member of the Vermont Workers' Center and the American Legion Jay Peak Post 28. I attended the budget forums on Vermont Interactive Technologies on Nov. 5 because I am concerned about people. Many people are less fortunate than myself. I shared that I see many struggles in the community.
\
My neighbors struggle to balance heating fuel, food, health care, pay their electric bill, put gas in their car to get to work. You should take all these into account while creating the budget. Education is important but we also need to invest in making sure families can meet their basic needs so children can succeed. Last year was the first time the governor's administration held hearings early but then we just saw more of the same.
\
We heard that there were going to be no broad-based taxes last year then again this year, but last year the Legislature passed a gas tax. That seems like a pretty broad-based tax to me -- one that hits working poor really hard.
\
There are no free lunches -- everyone has to pay according to their ability to pay which means the more fortunate among us need to contribute more. We can't just keep hitting the vulnerable again and again. We need to raise money in a progressive way so we can create a budget that puts people first and doesn't just put the money first. After attending the hearings I really am left with the fear we are going to see more of the same this year again.
\
We, the people, must continue raising our voices so we can have a system that is truly participatory.

Tuesday, May 8 There was a half-page ad in a journal last weekend that showed a cute little baby, a newborn, snuggled up in a soft blanket. It was asleep, at peace with the world so it seemed. Underneath, in bold letters, was the declaration ""When the Supreme Court handed down its historic decision on global warming, it wasn't just a bunch of lawyers who won.""
\
The advertisement was paid for by Earthjustice, a group of lawyers apparently proud that they had forced the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) to accept the authority to mandate that the automobile industry produce more energy-efficient cars.
\
I am getting the message that if we just leave everything to the courts, global warming will be controlled just fine. We can sleep like a babe cuddled in the soft security that while we dream, the rest of the world is going to deal with what is clearly the greatest threat to the well-being of our grandchildren and those after them.
\
According to Bush science adviser John Marburger, ""The Bush administration acknowledges that global warming is man-made and a problem that must be dealt with."" If even our great oil-industry protecting leader sees the handwriting on the wall, we finally have to admit that we, you and me and everybody else especially in the developed countries, contributed to this looming catastrophe.
\
That leads to the moral question: Do we, you and me and everybody else, have the moral responsibility, for the sake of our grandchildren, to do everything we can to, if not avert, then at least moderate this inexorable decline in our environment's health?
\
One does not have to be a saint to agree that we do. Beginning with Adam and Eve, to be sure, most parents have wished that their children will lead a better and happier life than they did. Often they denied themselves luxuries and even necessities to give them a head start.
\
It seems to me that now is the time to make similar sacrifices on a universal scale, certainly in Vermont. After all, Vermonters pride themselves in being among the most ecologically sophisticated and committed of the American population. We may as well walk the walk in addition to talking the talk.
\
That is meant almost literally. Cars are contributing one third of the greenhouse gases that are polluting our air. Decreasing the amount of gasoline used by driving cars will lessen our contribution to global warming.
\
The two best methods of doing that are driving less and driving fewer gasoline-hogs. It seems to be almost impossible to get Americans to use less gasoline. Despite the ballooning gas prices every summer, gas consumption has grown steadily over the last 20 years. We are very forgiving when the oil companies rake in ever rising, obscene profits. We just drive more to make the profits a bit higher yet.
\
But, when it comes to increasing gasoline taxes or imposing gas-guzzler taxes, our politicians get the heebie-jeebies. Representative R. Westman recently made a brave attempt to do exactly that, in part to have the funds for beefing up the public transit system. The idea was quickly shot down by his colleagues and by the governor. They brought up the time-worn, spurious scare-tactic that Vermonters are already taxed too much.
\
That is interesting because our state gas tax is the lowest of all New England states and New York, and is below the national average. It did not matter to them that our public transit system is pitifully inadequate. There is no telling how much gasoline would be saved if more and more energy efficient buses would cover more routes more conveniently.
\
And then there are the SUV's. If the gasoline prices are really too high, then why did Vermonters nearly double the number of these behemoths on our roads in just seven years? After all, they drink almost twice as much gas as a normal car, which means that the buyers accepted a virtual doubling of the price at the pump.
\
So why wouldn't they accept higher gas taxes? Because they are being told that the gas prices are already too high for their pocket books. Well, if we look at it more closely, we find that the median household income in Vermont rose by enough over the last 30 years that even $3 for a gallon of gas will take a smaller percentage out of that income than at any time ever, including the 1979 oil crisis.
\
We certainly should look to Congress to muster the majority needed to force the car industry to make more energy efficient cars, but we should not expect them to have the courage. In the meanwhile we owe it to our progeny to make the minor sacrifice of driving less in smaller cars.

197,"MONTPELIER -- If Vermont wants to be a leader in either the use of renewable energy or the creation of it, it's going to have to get going, according to those in the industry who spoke to state legislators Thursday.\""Vermont's being left behind,"" said Lawrence Mott of UPC Wind.\New York, he said, has a goal of establishing 4,000 megawatts of wind power. UPC just completed a project in Maine, and Massachusetts and New Hampshire are stirring on the issue. ""Vermont needs to be much more able to look at the positive side,"" he said.\Thursday marked the last of three weeks of intensive testimony in the Legislature on global warming. Legislative committees will begin to focus on which policy changes they might consider.\Jeff Wolfe, chief executive officer of GroSolar, a solar energy firm based in White River Junction, said he's creating jobs in the state, but Vermont could attract thousands more if it offered tax credits for installation of solar power, training credits for employees and a utility rate structure that favored renewable energy.\The state would also see more jobs if there were a better market for renewable energy, he said. ""They want to put plants where the market is,"" he said.\Just as Mott said other states are ahead of Vermont in using wind power, Wolfe said the same is true of solar. ""Those states are where the jobs, expertise, industry and service companies will be based,"" Wolfe said. ""Vermont needs to lead, or be left, now.""\One thing the industry needs from states is certainty, Mott said. For example, a single statewide property tax rate for wind turbines establishes clear parameters for those planning wind projects, he said. ""Right now it's undefined.""\David Blittersdorf, founder of NRG Systems in Hinesburg, recommended that the state allow those constructing energy-efficient buildings to go to the front of the line for permitting. ""You're stimulating with carrots and sticks, a whole new way of doing things.""\Blittersdorf reeled off other state policies that could drive Vermonters toward using renewable energy. A 50-cent increase in the gas tax could be used to expand mass transit; incentives for building smaller homes and penalties for larger ones would encourage less energy use; setting a standard price for kilowatts produced by wind could stimulate use of the energy as it did in Germany, he said.\Scott Johnstone, executive director of the Chittenden County Metropolitan Planning Organization, recommended the state allow regional option taxes to pay for mass transit, so that the cost is not borne by the property tax. As gas prices climb, which he predicted they will, demand for public transportation will increase.\Higher gas prices also will change people's housing choices, he said. No longer will it be economically advantageous to live far from the city and commute. The price of transportation will become more of a burden than the price of housing, he said.\Walter Verhue, an environmental engineering professor at the University of Vermont, told legislators that Vermont is not blessed with an abundance of natural alternative energy resources. ""Our strength is we're committed to the environment and we have a relatively large number of technically trained individuals.""\Contact Terri Hallenbeck at thallenb@bfp.burlingtonfreepress.com\BOX: KEY IDEAS\Solar power works in Vermont, which has 30 percent more sun than Germany, one of the world leaders in solar power.\Vermont can attract jobs in the solar industry by offering tax credits for installation of solar power, training credits to employees and using solar in state buildings.\Other states are ahead of Vermont in using solar and wind power.\The wind power business is booming, as NRG Systems in Hinesburg will be hiring about 100 more people in the next three to four years.\Rising fuel prices will force Vermonters to live closer to their jobs and drive less in the coming years, creating opportunity for mass transit.\Vermont can encourage construction of energy-efficient housing through such tactics as offering incentives for smaller homes and penalties for larger ones."

\
Taxpayers filing their 1040s are likely wondering just where all their hard-earned tax dollars are going, anyway.
\
Washington will spend $31,406 per household in 2010 -- the highest level in American history (adjusted for inflation). It will collect $18,276 per household in taxes. The remaining $13,130 represents this year's staggering budget deficit per household, which, along with all prior government debt, will be dumped in the laps of our children.
\
Government spending has increased by $5,000 per household since 2008, and nearly $10,000 per household over the past decade. Yet there is no free lunch: If spending is not reined in, then eventually taxes must also rise by $10,000 per household.
\
Washington will spend this $31,406 per household as follows:
\
* Social Security and Medicare: $9,949.
\
The 15.3 percent payroll tax, split evenly between the employer and employee, covers most of these costs. This system can remain sustainable only if there are enough workers to support all retirees, which is why it risks collapsing under the weight of 77 million retiring baby boomers. Unless these programs are reformed, paying all promised benefits would eventually require doubling all income tax rates.
\
* Defense: $6,071. The defense budget covers everything from military paychecks to operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to the research, development and acquisition of new technologies and equipment. Lawmakers drastically reduced military spending after the collapse of communism in the early 1990s. The 9/11 attacks reversed this trend, and the inflation-adjusted $2,472 per household increase since 2000 has returned military spending closer to its historical levels (but still lower than during previous wars).
\
*Anti-Poverty Programs: $5,466. Nearly half of this spending subsidizes state Medicaid programs that provide health services to poor families. Other low-income spending includes: Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, food stamps, housing subsidies, child-care subsidies, Supplemental Security Income and low-income tax credits. President George W. Bush increased anti-poverty spending to record levels, and it has grown an additional 32 percent since the end of 2008 under President Barack Obama.
\
* Unemployment benefits: $1,640. Unemployment costs have surged by 411 percent during the recession.
\
* Interest on the Federal Debt: $1,585. The federal government is $13 trillion in debt. It owes $9 trillion to public bond owners, and the rest to other federal agencies (mostly to repay the Social Security trust fund, which lawmakers raided annually before the program went into deficit in 2010). Record-low interest rates have recently held down these costs. However, the national debt is set to double by 2020, which will combine with higher interest rates to raise annual interest costs to nearly $6,000 per household.
\
* Veterans' Benefits: $1,052. The federal government provides income and health benefits to war veterans. Spending is up 83 percent since 2000.
\
* Federal Employee Retirement Benefits: $1,018. This spending funds the retirement and disability benefits of federal employees, including the military.
\
* Education: $914. Education spending is primarily a state and local function; 9 percent of the total comes from Washington. The federal education budget has leaped 125 percent since 2000. Most federal dollars are spent on low-income school districts, special education and college student financial aid.
\
* Highways, Mass Transit: $613. Most highway and mass-transit spending is financed by the 18.4 cent per-gallon federal gas tax. Washington subtracts an administrative cost and sends this money back to the states with numerous strings attached.
\
* Health Research, Regulation: $550. This spending is up 50 percent since 2001, and much of this growth is concentrated in the National Institute of Health. The category also includes the Food and Drug Administration and dozens of grant programs for health providers.
\
* Mortgage Credit: $470. While most of the bank bailouts occurred last year, the bailouts of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the rest of the housing market continue.
\
The programs listed above cover $29,328 per household. The remaining $2,078 is allocated to all other federal programs, including justice, international affairs, natural resources, the environment, regional development, farm subsidies, social services, space exploration, air transportation and energy.
\
Taxpayers -- and the next generation that will be paying nearly half of the bill -- must decide for themselves if they're getting their money's worth.

Tuesday, October 28 BRATTLEBORO -- It's tough being an outsider in high school.
\
High schools are notorious for developing cliques and whether it is jocks and geeks, artists and business majors, or Red Sox and Yankee fans, it can be a challenge being a member of a group that is in the minority.
\
And during this election season, no other group at Brattleboro Union High School might be feeling that pressure as much as the young Republicans.
\
A few weeks ago, an anonymous letter came into the student council from a Republican high school student who claimed that his or her party's views were not being respected.
\
The student did not feel threatened, teachers and other students said, but the anonymous letter writer claimed that no one was listening to the right wing point of view and the writer thought there should be an objective platform that would allow students from both side of the political spectrum to explain the plans of Sens. John McCain and Barack Obama.
\
After the letter was brought to the student council by a vice principal, and the topic was considered, the council decided to hold the first ever BUHS Presidential Convention.
\
All day Monday, classes filled the multi-purpose room to hear students represent the two major party candidates.
\
Over the past few weeks, students in advanced social study classes researched the platforms and speeches of McCain and Obama.
\
Then, on Monday during the convention, they stood up and presented the plans and answered questions from the audience.
\
""We are trying to educate the student body so they can make decisions on actual policy,"" explained Ian Mabie, who called himself an Obama supporter but nonetheless worked for the McCain ticket during Monday's convention. ""We are trying to get students to move away from taking a side because that is what their parents think or that is what their friends think.""
\
The political convention was held one day before the school was scheduled to hold its mock election, which will give students the chance to cast a vote for their candidate.
\
The convention was held just before the election so students would be able to vote on what the candidates are promising and not only on what their friends are saying.
\
The convention was not set up as a debate, student council member Arielle Van Backer said, but rather as a forum to give each side a chance to outline the candidate's policies and then answer questions from the audience.
\
""It's difficult to be in the minority,"" Van Backer said about the request from Republicans in the school to create a way to lay out the real differences between the candidates without resorting to negative campaigning or distorted claims from the other side. ""We wanted to see if there was a way to discuss just the issues.""
\
At the convention, about a half-dozen students represented each side. They talked about health care, the economy, energy, the environment, social issues and education.
\
After stating the candidate's policies, the BUHS students took questions. They tried to base their answers on the research they did, but admitted when they did not have enough information to address the topics that were brought up from the audience.
\
After discussing McCain's economic policies, a student in the audience asked how the revenues lost on a gas tax holiday would be made up. Another student wanted to know how Obama was going to make sure drugs that are imported from foreign counties to cut costs could be tested for safety.
\
Caroline Heydinger, a self-proclaimed young Republican, admits that she usually does not discuss her politics with friends because she knows she is in the minority.
\
As she was preparing for the convention Monday, Heydinger said the all day event gave both sides the chance to steer clear of distorted claims and sound bites and instead focus on substantive issues that define the opposing campaigns.
\
""Both campaigns have taken nasty turns and I have been disappointed and surprised in how it turned out,"" Heydinger said as students filed into the room. ""I hope people will listen to the issues and not just to what their parents say.""
\
Student Council member Maya von Wodtke said too many of the political discussions prior to the convention were based on caricatures and she hoped the forum would give students more facts to base their votes on for Tuesday's mock election.
\
""We wanted to start a dialogue instead of just saying McCain is an old man or Sarah Palin is a hunter lady,"" said von Wodtke. ""We thought this would be good way to clarify the issues and have respectful dialogue.""
\
Justin Kenney said interest from both sides of the political spectrum is high, and while teenagers are aware of the importance of the presidential election, too often it is a challenge to separate the emotions from the facts.
\
Kenney said minds might not be changed during the high school's convention, but at least the day gave both sides the chances to present their own plans.
\
""I think talking about the actual facts will help a lot,"" Kenney said. ""Kids in the minority think that every time they say anything they will be chastised and this is going to help. I'm glad people can sit here and talk about the issues without the spin.""

State officials may be facing a construction work stoppage this fall if federal funds that pay for most of Vermont's transportation projects continue to dry up - which they will do if Congress fails to act by the end of the month.
\
While most members of Congress enjoyed a break this week, state leadership kept scrambling, as it's done since May, working to line up the temporary funding sources that will be needed in the event that Washington doesn't reauthorize the surface transportation bill and the funding dries up on the Highway Trust Fund.
\
Even from afar, Rep. Peter Welch, D-Vt., was hustling to gain support on a tactic that he hopes will put an end to the funding shortfalls that continue to plague the nation's transportation infrastructure needs.
\
""There's two concurrent pressures hitting us at the same time,"" said Sue Minter, secretary of the state's Agency of Transportation, also called VTrans.
\
If Congress fails to reauthorize the surface transportation bill, the ensuing shutdown of the Federal Highway Administration means reimbursements for any projects would disappear.
\
In addition, the Highway Trust Fund, which was supplied by the gas tax that's seen dwindling returns, has reached insolvency and no longer provides enough money to meet its obligations.
\
""In the middle of our construction season,"" Minter said. ""We are billing for all the projects that are out on the street ... we are billing at about $7 million dollars a week,"" which is reimbursed typically by the federal government.
\
""We have people working all over the state. Those bills need to be paid.""
\
In the ""very unlikely"" event of a shutdown, the state of Vermont could afford to use cash reserves for up to eight weeks, Minter said, but the work hours of state officials who should be doing other things is where real losses are being seen.
\
""It's very unlikely it will happen at all. But, we're working jointly just to deal with this,"" she explained during a phone call she made from the state treasurer's office, moments after a contingency planning meeting. ""It's the treasurer's office, it's VTrans, it's finance and management, and also the Joint Fiscal Office. We're all kind of convening to see if we can understand what our risks are and how we are going to address them if, in fact, Congress does not act.""
\
""It is frustrating to be spending so much of our time dealing with the dysfunction of Washington D.C. It's dealing with these constant fire drills,"" Minter said.
\
""We have healthy reserves, were very prudent in our cash management, so we're able to do this,"" said Treasurer Beth Pearce, on the call. But she added that there are many state governments that don't have such affordances.
\
""This is a very, very serious problem that's affecting our entire national economy,"" said Minter. ""Some states do not have the kind of credit rating and fiscal management that our state does. Other states have no cash flow. So they are pulling projects,"" already anticipating the shortfall, she said.
\
On June 24, a draft bill emerged from the Senate Environment and Public Works committee, fixing issues with the previous bill and providing a six-year, $278 billion plan providing for the nation's highway infrastructure. The draft bill, called DRIVE Act, for ""Developing a Reliable and Innovative Vision for the Economy"" is currently in the Senate Finance Committee.
\
Last Thursday, committee chair Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, opened the discussion by pointing to ways states could look at financing their own highway projects.
\
""Because of the large capital costs associated with infrastructure, financing alternatives can give states more flexibility in producing the capital they need to build projects faster,"" he noted in a statement. He also pointed to private-public partnerships as a potential future source of funds for state highways and cited the idea as having ""bipartisan support.""
\
Vermont relies on the feds for at least 60 percent of its highway construction funding. For interstate projects, like the bridge work at Waterbury on I-89, it sources about 90 percent of the funds, officials have said.
\
In an effort to spur activity on the Hill, Welch has proposed a fix that could garner attention, and possibly action.
\
In a June 17 letter to House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., he lists the numerous bills that have entered the House proposing funding for transportation. Naming H.R. 1846, H.R. 680 and H.R. 625, he notes that all of them have languished.
\
""We all agree that America urgently needs a sustainably funded, long term surface transportation bill. ... Yet the House has not been given the opportunity to vote on any of them,"" he writes.
\
He asks for a bill showdown, using a ""Queen of the Hill"" voting method that at one time was rarely used. (In March, the system was dusted off to help the GOP get through an impasse and pass a budget blueprint.)
\
Under the rule, all proposals are put forth for vote, and the one with the most votes is considered passed.
\
""We urge you to allow a vote on these proposals, and any alternatives that you choose,"" wrote Welch. ""This approach will ensure that the will of the House is adopted and predictability and certainty in our transportation program is restored.""
\
A spokesperson for Welch said the letter hadn't been formally responded to, but that his office expected something to happen next week when Congress reconvenes.
\
""We expect there to be more action and to get more feedback now that Congress is coming back in session next week, and because the Highway Trust Fund is running out of funds this month, "" said Kirsten Hartman, a spokeswoman for Welch. ""We expect more action and discussions,"" about the fund, she said.

201,"
BENNINGTON -- The names on the ballot may not be new, but plenty of other dynamics in the race for Bennington County's two senate seats are.
\
The race is between Republican Warren Roaf, and Democrats Brian Campion and Dick Sears. Roaf is a retired school principal, Campion a current House member in Bennington 2-1, and Sears a 21-year incumbent with a long political career. Two years ago, Roaf ran against Campion for his House seat and lost, but thinks the wider voting pool will help him this time. Campion and Sears, meanwhile, are running as a team, something neither has done before.
\
Warren Roaf
\
Tax reform is the central issue Roaf is running on, he told the Banner in an interview last week.
\
""I'm sort of the David in a Goliath-type race,"" he said. ""It's interesting, because I had announced my candidacy the day before Mr. Campion and Mr. Sears announced that they were going to run as a team. I understand that, it makes sense, saves them money on the campaign and so-on.""
\
Roaf was a social studies teacher for 22 years and spent 12 years as principal of Mount Anthony Union Middle School.
\
""I've always had a passion for government and civics, and civics education, and when I semi-retired from being principal I thought it was a perfect opportunity to put into action some of the things I always told people they should be doing.""
\
Tax reform has been espoused as a goal by many, including his opponents, but Roaf said he has seen little in the way of actual talk about getting it done. While other issues are important, having money to address them must come first.
\
""That's my focal point. David won that battle against Goliath because he hit the one area that was most vulnerable, and I think that how we tax is the most important function of government, because it determines the priorities we're going to set for health care, for education, for the environment, all those other things can only happen if money is put aside for them.""
\
He would like to see the state stop using property taxes to fund education.
\
""I'm not in favor of income taxes going up, but something like income is broad-based, and when there's an increase there it's spread out amongst more people,"" Roaf said. ""So, what I would propose is sitting down with my Democratic colleagues, and saying, okay, the middle class taxpayer in Vermont, their backs are broken, they can't take anymore, so lets restructure it. Let's try to find out if there are people who can afford an increase in their income tax, then lets look into the tax brackets. We can always make the bottom tax bracket higher than it is now.""
\
Roaf said he values health care for all, but has not been happy with what he describes as the state's blind way of moving ahead with it. For health care to be effective and affordable, both parties must reach a compromise that people can accept, and numbers have to be looked at.
\
""When I win, it will be a Republican and Democrat representing Bennington County, and I think that's a good thing,"" he said. ""I think that whoever the other gentleman is who wins and I should work very well together, because it's all about finding the answers, not about the party that we're members of.""
\
Brian Campion
\
Campion was elected to the House five years ago and has served on the House Education Committee and numerous economic development sub-committees.
\
""My family was always involved in politics, and there are certain issues for all of us that were important,"" he said, such as economic development.
\
Campion, who works in Bennington College's Development Office, said education and college loan debt are issues he intends to work on more.
\
""How do we here in a small state create opportunities for young people to come back here after college or come her from another state and find meaningful careers and contribute? I think that's a really exciting field,"" he said.
\
Just as the state has looked at health care and taxes, so must it approach education.
\
""One things we haven't done, and we've done it with health care and we've done it with taxes, is we don't really have a comprehensive education plan where we put everyone together, unions, teachers, parents, students, the legislature, and really ask ourselves how can we really make improvements?"" he said.
\
The state has taken some of the right steps in addressing the issue of student loans, which will be key to economic development.
\
""There's a lot of inequity out there right now, who can get a college education, and when you do get a college education what kind of debt do you graduate with? And the Vermont Strong Scholars program, which was part of a really good economic development field this year, kind of moved us in that direction, but is there more for the state to do? Is there more the state can do, I'm not sure right now in this economic climate, but how can we help our young people that want to get to college to have a college education do it so they don't graduate with debt that's absolutely debilitating,"" he said.

Dick Sears
\
Sears has been chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee for the past 16 years and has served as a member of the Appropriations Committee, and Finance Committee.
\
Education tax reform is something that needs to be addressed.
\
""It's a system that takes 30 minutes to explain and about 30 seconds to denigrate, and that's one of the difficulties in trying to deal with this problem,"" he said. ""But, let me say, I think that when you look at the various communities in this state, how they're hit, and the budgets going down, it tells me we've got to have some change and I'm supportive of change, but I don't have a particular silver bullet right now that I could pull out of my hat.""
\
There has never been a comprehensive look at the system or a concrete idea on how to change it, he said.
\
Sears said he has long supported making a local option tax available for all communities. This would allow towns to create a 1 percent sales tax, or a rooms and meals tax, money which could be used to lower municipal taxes. A portion would also go to the Payment in Lieu of Taxes program, which reimburses towns with government-owned land for what they lose off their grand lists.
\
""Right now it's only available to a certain number of communities, and I've tried to make it available to all,"" he said.
\
The budget gap the legislature will face this year will call for some hard choices, Sears said. He said while he and Campion may be criticized for some of their tax positions in the past, such as the state gas tax increase, sometimes there are no other options.

BRATTLEBORO -- Don't call it a ""gun bill,"" state Rep. Mike Mrowicki says.
\
Instead, the Putney Democrat refers to newly proposed firearms regulations as a ""public-safety bill"" designed to close gaps and address concerns in the wake of high-profile gun violence nationwide.
\
The House bill would ban high-capacity magazines and require instant background checks at gun shows, among other measures. But Mrowicki expects plenty of debate on the legislation in the coming months.
\
""We know it's a complex issue,"" he said. ""We don't pretend there's an easy fix.""
\
Mrowicki and state Rep. David Deen, a Westminster Democrat, were among the dozen House members who introduced the bill earlier in the week. Officials held a press conference on Friday to discuss the legislation.
\
In addition to the magazine ban and the gun-show checks, the bill imposes other restrictions and requirements including:
\
-- Bringing state law in line with federal law, which prohibits felons from possessing firearms.
\
-- Mandating a ""course on safe procedures for carrying a concealed firearm by any person who carries a concealed firearm.""
\
-- Requiring the state Department of Mental Health to report information to the national background-check system for gun buyers.
\
That would happen ""when a person is subject to a hospitalization order or nonhospitalization order as the result of a mental illness which causes the person to be a danger to him(self) or herself or others,"" the bill says.
\
It also would apply to those who have been ""found not guilty of a crime by reason of insanity or incompetent to stand trial due to a mental illness.""
\
Mrowicki called the legislation ""comprehensive"" and said it is based on public input.
\
""It's the result of talking to hunters' groups, police, prosecutors and citizens,"" he said.
\
Friday's announcement came seven weeks after a shooter took 26 lives -- including 20 children -- at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn.
\
Deen said he's hoping there is ""political will"" to make regulatory changes in light of recent gun violence.
\
""It seems like some basic steps,"" he said. ""It doesn't take away anybody's basic rights.""
\
Deen, who chairs the House Fish, Wildlife and Water Resources Committee, said the background-check changes are an obvious and needed improvement.
\
""It's a loosely woven basket of information about people who want guns,"" he said. ""And we're just making the weave tighter.""
\
Mrowicki and Deen also signed onto separate legislation that would ""establish a repository for the disposition of unlawful firearms."" The bill also would create ""a firearm-safety training center and an indoor firing range for law-enforcement officials.""
\
In other news this week from Windham County's lawmakers:
\
-- It may not be as controversial as gun regulation, but a new bill that seeks mandatory labeling of genetically engineered foods is expected to draw some attention.
\
The state legislature last year failed to pass a similar measure. No other state requires such labeling, and there are fears that there could be significant backlash from the food industry.
\
But that did not stop seven local lawmakers from signing onto the bill. Supporters include Carolyn Partridge of Windham, Mollie Burke of Brattleboro, Deen, Dick Marek of Newfane, Mrowicki, Valerie Stuart of Brattleboro and Tristan Toleno of Brattleboro.
\
Partridge is chairwoman of the House Agriculture Committee, to which the bill was referred. Also sitting on that committee is Toleno, who points out that the legislation does not ban genetically modified products.
\
However, ""if you sell a product in Vermont that contains genetically modified food, that's labeled,"" he said. ""It will allow consumers to make their own choices.""
\
The bill says the federal government has taken no steps to specifically regulate food produced from genetic engineering. It also cites ""public uncertainty"" and the lack of long-term studies of human consumption of such foods.
\
Nonetheless, the bill also asserts that ""genetically engineered foods have an effect on health, safety, agriculture and the environment.""
\
Burke said she believes shoppers ""have a right to know"" about the ingredients in their food.
\
-- While genetically modified food is a relatively new issue, equal pay for women is not. But state Rep. John Moran, a Wardsboro Democrat, said women still are not earning as much as their male counterparts.
\
""Fifty years after President Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act, women in Vermont make 84 percent of what men make in comparable jobs,"" said Moran, who is vice chairman of the General, Housing and Military Affairs Committee.
\
""The culture has changed over time,"" he added. ""But still, there's a perception that women aren't as valuable in the workforce as men.""
\
A bill introduced by legislators including Burke and Moran says any salary difference between a man and a woman doing the same job cannot be based on gender. There are allowances, however, for unequal pay due to ""legitimate business reasons"" such as seniority, merit and quantity or quality of production.
\
The bill also mandates that employers must meet with employees who request ""flexible working arrangements."" And it says employees can share salary information with each other.
\
Any contractor doing business with the state would be covered by the law, Moran said.
\
-- Environmental issues were a big topic in Montpelier throughout the week. On Wednesday, writer and activist Bill McKibben spoke to a joint legislative session to lobby for immediate action on climate change.
\
Mrowicki said McKibben ""reminded us that climate change is here and real, and the devastating storms of the past two years are the tip of the iceberg. He encouraged us to continue our work in this area, and show the nation and the world what is possible.""
\
McKibben also called for rejection of a proposed three-year moratorium on industrial wind power in Vermont.
\
But the following day, Windham Selectboard Chairwoman Mary Boyer traveled to Montpelier to speak in support of that same measure.
\
Windham's town plan bans industrial turbines, and town officials last year fought unsuccessfully against a plan to build meteorological-testing towers there. Those towers could be a precursor to Windham County's first commercial wind farm.
\
Boyer has questioned the efficacy of wind power, and she told the state Senate Natural Resources and Energy Committee that Vermont ""already leads the country in carbon-free electrical generation.""
\
Boyer said Vermonters should be far more concerned about carbon emissions from transportation and home heating.
\
""In view of these basic facts and the apparent inadequacy of our present regulations to lead to well-reasoned decisions, we badly need the time this moratorium would provide to make sure we are asking and answering the right questions about the future of energy in Vermont,"" Boyer told the committee.
\
Also in the legislature:
\
-- Mrowicki said his House Human Services Committee began consideration of two proposals from Gov. Peter Shumlin: Limiting how long families can receive public assistance and using an earned-income tax credit to pay for additional child-care subsidies.
\
-- Burke said there was no significant news on addressing a transportation-funding shortfall. Legislators are considering raising the gas tax, among other possible remedies.
\
Burke said the Transportation Committee, of which she is a member, has been ""going through the budget and trying to figure out what's what.""
\
-- Stuart said the Education Committee approved a bill that would expand Vermont's free school-lunch program to more than 6,000 additional kids who currently receive reduced-price lunches.
\
""I think it's going to have broad support on the (House) floor, so we're hopeful,"" she said.

Fluoridation and children
\
The mineral fluoride, when properly adjusted in our water supply will have a dramatic effect over time, in improving the health or all our citizens. Other communities have found that adjusting the level of fluoride in community water supply can reduce tooth decay by as much as 40 percent.
\
I am especially concerned about our children and the fact that our town has one of the highest incidences of dental decay in the state! Loss of teeth due to decay affects nutrition, general health, causes unnecessary pain and suffering and may even make it difficult to get a job later in life.
\
It's time to get Bennington on board with the majority of other cities and towns in our state and join the over two thirds population of our nation that have been fluoridated for the past 60 years without adverse outcomes. The Bennington citizens have been denied this benefit for years due to a small number of misinformed individuals.
\
Fluoride is the safe and natural occurring mineral in our water and when adjusted to proper levels, will improve our children's health. That's the bottom line for me and that is why I support the work of the Bennington Oral Health Coalition in its effort to fluoridate Bennington.
\
Richard E. Bower, BenningtonEncourage Legislature to make right choice
\
Attention all Vermonters and all the people who are sick of paying higher taxes: This is the time to let your senator and representative know they work for you and not themselves. There is a very important vote coming up shortly on who is going to be governor I believe we need a new governor.
\
To our elected officials in Montpelier who say they have to vote party lines: Remember one thing, it was the taxpayers who elected you and they pay your salary. They put their trust in you to do what they want.
\
Let's go back and look at some of the things that were discussed during the Primaries. First of all, Mr. Shumlin repeatedly said he had not raised taxes during his time in office. It took three debates before he finally admitted that he had raised ""some."" His definition of some? We don't know. We do know about fuel tax, gas tax, and property tax. Then there are the ones they call fees, surcharges, inspections, renewal of licenses, and we know there are more than that. The time has come to do something.
\
We also went through this health care discussion during the Primaries. Everybody except Mr. Shumlin said that this was not going to work. Millions of dollars were spent by this administration and what do we have to show for it now? Nothing. That money could have gone toward paying off the state debt. Why not wait until the federal government does something with health care? But he didn't wait. He got all these people all the care that they could get, then after elections and he got their votes, he backpedals. He says it's not going to work. He should have known and we should have known that it wasn't going to work to start with. Taxpayers' dollars gone.
\
There's more. There are fewer children in the State of Vermont being educated, but education costs are going out of sight; property taxes are going right out of sight and Shumlin has never done anything to address this problem.
\
Mr. Shumlin said he hadn't raised taxes, but if you are in charge and you spend more money than you take in, you go to the legislature and back to the Senate and say, ""I don't have enough money to run the State,"" then have them go out and find ways to raise taxes and they tax this and they tax that, this hurts the average working person's everyday income that you have to live on and have a little left over for yourself. When you have somebody else raise taxes in the budget and that budget comes to your desk and you sign it, the minute you put your signature on that, you have raised taxes.
\
Now they talk about Mr. Milne being quiet, laid back, and without plans; but, maybe he knows he can do something if backed by the Senate and Legislature. I believe I would like to see this man in because it sounds like he wants to do something.
\
What's going to happen when you raise everything else and you destroy another mountain top so we can bring in some more money? Because once they're gone, they're gone. How much of our environment that they claim they want to save are they going to let go for the almighty dollar, so they can sell these carbon credits to somebody else and the money goes where? It doesn't go to the ratepayer. It goes somewhere, but nobody seems to know where.
\
I do believe in Mr. Milne and I put my support behind him, that he probably should be our next governor. It's time for people to speak to their representatives and let them know in they don't vote the people's choice, there is another election coming up and they might be looking for another job.
\
Bernard Peters, 2014 Independent candidate for governor, IrasburgLocal representative has failed
\
So Mr. Wachstein is in high dudgeon over the chance that Rep. Morrissey might lose her seat on the health care panel. In a rambling, finger-pointing diatribe he, somehow, blames our president and Washington for Rep. Morrissey's re-assignment. Perhaps Mr. Wachstein would cite some of Morrissey's accomplishments in Burlington.
\
I for one would like to see bills that did something other than ""honoring,"" ""remembering,"" ""in memory of"" and ""congratulating"" people, places and organizations. I would like that, but I honestly cannot find any evidence of thoughtful, creative, beneficial non-partisan legislation on her part. In 2014 I could not find any positive legislation sponsored by this representative that addressed the needs of anything close to a majority of Vermonters. Asking ""the tough question"" is one thing, legislating for the state is another and Rep. Morrissey has failed in that effort.
\
Meanwhile Morrissey has voted against a ban on fracking in Vermont, has voted against same-sex marriage, has voted against reduced sentences for marijuana possession, has voted against medical marijuana, has voted against campaign finance limitations and has voted against GMO labeling. So, aside from attending every funeral in town and grandstanding at various town meetings, just what has she done for us lately? Or even historically?
\
Vermonters want someone who is looking out for the interests of Vermont, not someone who is guided by some national political committee's instructions. Vermonters want a legislator who will sponsor bills that benefit the populace of this state and Mary Morrissey is not that person. She should be thankful for her re-election because somehow she got back into the state house while doing little for her constituents.

Friday, August 17 Truck parking isn't a good idea on Putney Rd.
\
Editor of the Reformer:
\
In both Tuesday's and Wednesday's editions of the Reformer, there are articles related to the Planning Commission's proposed zoning for Putney Road District 7 with respect to allowing truck parking at refueling facilities. Neither article gave much of an explanation of the arguments against allowing truck parking in this district. Being the lone vote against the additional standard, I offer my rationale here.
\
One argument I've heard in support of allowing truck parking in this district is that a facility would consolidate/organize the trucks that currently pull over wherever they can to buy food, etc.
\
Being a frequent user of the services on Putney Road, I have never found tractor-trailers parked randomly about. I could imagine that at night, this may be an issue. But during the peak periods of use for Putney Road (mid-morning through evening), I believe a refueling facility that offers truck parking would likely attract many additional trucks to come south of the roundabout and not consolidate those already there. The roundabout currently sees 1,700 truck trips per day.
\
But the primary reason that I oppose allowing truck parking is the location of this district.
\
Loudon, Tenn., is currently fighting a ""travel center"" at an interstate interchange due to its location as a gateway roadway to their downtown and concerns they have with the travel center's impact on existing and proposed development in its immediate area. Although they are dealing with a proposal for a larger center, I believe that the concerns are the same.
\
In our case, this portion of Putney Road is one of the gateways to downtown, is the gateway to the School for International Training and will be the gateway to the other Putney Road districts envisioned in the master plan (mixed use, residential, recreational, waterfront, etc.). The 50-acre, mixed-use center is the centerpiece of the Putney Road master plan. Everyone acknowledges the challenges ahead for Brattleboro in encouraging this area to develop as envisioned.
\
When I compare how many, and to what extent, people will benefit or be hurt by allowing truck parking (although limited) on this portion of Putney Road, I came to the conclusion that the costs to the vast majority of the residents and business owners of Brattleboro were larger than the benefits to a very few.
\
The Putney Road master plan envisions nearly 1,100 housing units and 3.8 million square feet of commercial space for Putney Road between the West River and the roundabout. It envisions a ""vibrant destination for workers, residents, visitors, shoppers ... to transform the corridor into a new North End will require a diverse mixture of uses, additional roads and a logical pedestrian network. It needs an attractive public realm, a civic identity and a sense of place.""
\
I started out in support of allowing the limited truck parking. I have slowly come to the realization that although small, this is not the right place for it.

Congressional earmarks must stop
\
Editor of the Reformer:
\
Because of the collapsed Minnesota bridge, Vermonters learned that one-third of our bridges are structurally deficient. Some policymakers are advocating a gas tax to increase to improve our transportation infrastructure. I believe we need to spend well before we spend more.
\
Earmarks are controversial, personal, pet spending projects, (sometimes called pork,) that bypass the committee process in Congress. They are inserted secretly into different appropriation bills. These dollars are taken, for example, from the Highway Trust Fund instead of investing in road and bridge improvements.
\
The main problem with transportation earmarks is that they often supercede the more urgent repair and replacements needs in this state. Some are vanity projects and most require matching state money.
\
Our congressional delegation isn't immune from this practice and displaced at least $6 million of our federal road and bridge money for pet projects in 2006. Here's a partial list of what our delegation used transportation funds for:
\
* $450,000 for affordable housing in Townshend
\
* $250,000 for low income housing and to reconstruct downtown Enosburg
\
* $750,000 for high speed broadband deployment
\
* $750,000 for Preservation Trust of Vermont
\
* $250,000 for senior housing in South Burlington
\
* $1,000,000 for Bellows Falls multimodal facility
\
* $250,000 for Route 15 streetscape and pedestrian crossing in Colchester
\
* $250,000 to VNA to construct a low-income parent and child center in Burlington
\
* $200,000 to rehab and construct affordable rental units in Bradford
\
These projects will provide a ribbon cutting photo-op and perhaps be named for the politician who had them built. There's no glory or credit for pothole repairs or for placing a ""politician's name on the rivets used to repair an existing bridge.""
\
It's time our delegation realizes financial resources aren't infinite and, because of the staggering dollars required to fix our roads and bridges, they must discontinue this earmark practice. They should focus on infrastructure projects other than pet projects to win votes.

Guilford plans special Labor Day weekend
\
Editor of the Reformer:
\
I am pleased to have this opportunity to expand upon and slightly clarify on the brief comment which was quoted in the Aug. 10 article on Guilford Old Home Day.
\
I attended the meeting as a representative of Friends of Music at Guilford, whose signature annual event also takes place on Labor Day weekend. We are delighted with the plans for a one-day event on Labor Day, Monday, because it removes the conflict with our festival that was created a number of years ago when the Guilford Fair added Sunday to its schedule.
\
Not only does Old Home Day eliminate the sense of competition between our concerts and the happenings at the fairgrounds, but it opens up the possibility of collaboration between several traditional Guilford events, which are all clustered in Labor Day weekend.
\
In fact, our board has decided to have a Friends of Music booth at Old Home Day, our first-ever participation in an event at the fairground in the 42 years we have been presenting our festival.
\
At the Old Home Day meeting, the larger point I was attempting to make, is that we may promote the entire holiday weekend as a time when things are happening in Guilford. On Friday evening there's an end-of-summer Guilford Free Library event at Broad Brook Grange, co- sponsored with the Grange. On Saturday, Sept. 1, Friends of Music's 42nd festival opens with an evening concert in the Organ Barn, followed by the outdoor orchestral program there Sunday afternoon. All day Monday is Old Home Day at the fairgrounds. And in the planning stages a hoped-for family dance Monday night, closing the weekend, at the Grange, a return to a tradition from a half-century ago.
\
So, I hope many of your readers will ""come to Guilford for the weekend.""

Vote matters little in presidential race
\
Editor of the Reformer:
\
Reading the letters that have saturated this page recently about nudity, Tasers, a specific bear and protesters tells me what is utmost in many local people's minds.
\
Also, the TV stations are flooding the screens with both Democrat and Republican ""debates."" Yet, I sit in my home quite angry because the American citizens should be upset about the fact that when they go to the polls in November 2008 to vote for their choice to be president of these United States, their choice has no bearing on who will be the next president.
\
The people selected to be members of the Electoral College in each state are the ones whose vote counts in the selection of our next president, not the popular vote. See Article II Section 1 and Amendment Article XII of the United States Constitution.
\
Vermont has three appointed by the state who must vote by ballot for two persons, of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves.
\
The popular vote will not mean anything until the U.S. Congress amends Amendment Article XII utilizing the Right to Petition. Of course accomplishing this in today's environment has about as much success as impeaching President Bush, ending the Iraq Freedom conflict, or my getting $1 million before November 2008.

The Commissioners Decided
\
To the Editor:
\
The New Hampshire Fish and Game Commission has voted 5 to 4 in favor of bobcat hunting. It is important to understand that the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department and your elected legislative officials do not set policy for the Fish and Game Department. The policymakers are the New Hampshire Fish and Game Commission (their members are appointed by the governor and approved by the Executive Council). A commissioner is appointed for each county.

What to Believe Now?
\
To the Editor:
\
Do any of you believe? After many years of hearing half-truths from many of our politicians, and then seeing what they really do? After many years seeing and hearing about corporations taking advantage of their power, lying about the dire effects their products produce, and not coming clean about harming people and polluting our environment until legal action makes them fess up, but without anyone going to jail? And as we recover from the economic crash, when a few greedy individuals and corporations took advantage of their power, selling worthless investment products -- and no one goes to jail!
\
Do any of you believe that these politicians, corporations and greedy individuals have adversely affected our understanding of how we should behave in what we call a democratic country/free-market economy? That we have been bamboozled into believing that the way of these politicians, corporations and greedy individuals is the coin of the realm?
\
Will the 2016 presidential election be about what we all in our heart of hearts believe? That this nation cares more about people than just the accumulation of money and power for the few? Or will it be the same-old, same-old? That the people of America are too scared, too self-centered, too worn out, too in debt, believing that the best way to deal with corrupt power is to go along with the madness and just give up?
\
Do any of you believe that what we do unto the least of them we do unto ourselves; that heaven is spread upon the face of the Earth but they just can't see it; that with wealth and power comes an awesome responsibility to use it wisely without destroying the very fabric of human communities and ecosystems? Please believe, vote accordingly.

Simple Solution for N.H. Roads
\
To the Editor:
\
In response to Daniel Moore's Forum letter and Rep. Susan Almy's response, HB 1602 is a joke. Almy and other co-sponsors of this bill have wasted valuable time and effort trying to target a small group (those darn Prius owners who pay less gas tax) as politicians love to do.
\
As usual, government has made something that was simple into something overly complex. Having just registered our Honda CRV, the state's portion of the registration amounted to $45 dollars. Would it have broken the bank if that bill would have been $60 dollars? That $15 increase would have netted the DMV $13.5 million dollars. Would a $15-$25 dollar increase break any New Hampshire vehicle owner, especially if improved roads saved them unnecessary repairs? New Hampshire infrastructure is a mess and our lawmakers won't deal with the problem. Talk about fiddling while Rome burns!

Leahy Should Listen
\
To the Editor:
\
When asked about his super delegate support for Hillary Clinton, Sen. Patrick Leahy was quoted in the Burlington Free Press as follows: ""First and foremost, I always keep my word."" By this he implies he agreed to support her and must continue to do so.
\
I have two points to the contrary. First and foremost, Leahy was voted into office to represent the people of Vermont. He gave his word that he would represent us. While I believe he can cast his one vote in private for whomever he chooses, his vote as a super delegate must honor his word to represent the majority of the people of Vermont. By not doing so, he is letting us know that he values his word to Clinton over his word to fairly represent the people who elected him.
\
This brings me to my second point, which is that a good politician is willing to admit when he or she has made a mistake, even when it means going back on one's word. If, in the primary election, Leahy sees that a majority of the people want Bernie Sanders, I believe he has an obligation to honor his word to us over his word to one out-of-state individual.
\
I implore every Vermonter to demand that he keep his word to us, his electorate, and cast his super delegate vote for Sanders when he wins the state primary. I encourage those in other states to demand their elected representatives do the same.

Anti-Establishment, Pro-Sanders
\
To the Editor:
\
I feel that no one has discussed what establishment politics is all about. We have a GOP Senator and Congressman who have signed a contract with Grover Norquist, favoring the rich establishment instead of the voters who elect them. I doubt that even Daniel Webster would be able to help.
\
Then we have a Democratic governor and Senator who support an establishment candidate who tells the young and the poor they must continue to be preyed on by the banks and the insurance companies. This candidate also has supporters who feel that all women face eternal damnation if they don't support her.
\
The most profound statement made in the election was made by a young woman in an interview with C-SPAN, who stated she had the rest of her life to deal with feminist issues, but this was a once-in-a-lifetime revolution about her and her needs, and she had to be part of it.
\
I support Bernie Sanders, and if the establishment prevails, I will write his name in for president.

Supporting Steve Flanders
\
To the Editor:
\
I strongly support Steve Flanders as a candidate for the Norwich Selectboard. As a Selectboard member for the past five years, he has consistently demonstrated concern for all Norwich citizens. He is highly knowledgeable about the nuts and bolts of town operations, and he understands our town's financial needs, resources and choices. He has a keen awareness of legal and policy details and implications.
\
However, my strongest reasons for supporting Steve are his unswerving efforts to work with other people for the betterment of Norwich. He listens to others' concerns, he suggests ideas that incorporate what he hears in discussion and he reaches out to include other people in discussion and the process. I have space to list only a few of the many examples of his impact: He initiated and organized a town-wide survey in 2014. He came up with the ""smoothing"" process to reduce the tax burden if the 2015 bond issue had passed. He pushed for the Selectboard to engage in a multi-year effort of long-range planning that included a broad array of input, and he worked with Town Clerk Bonnie Munday to establish funding to preserve our town's oldest records, which were badly decaying.
\
Steve works extremely hard for Norwich; he is dedicated, smart and caring. I hope you will join me in voting for Steve Flanders for Selectboard.

Cornish Compromise Is Called For
\
To the Editor:
\
I understand about the recent Forum letter regarding the ""living Constitution,"" however our country was founded on the differences between Jeffersonian and Hamiltonian democracy, which is the difference between liberal and strict interpretation of our constitution. None of this is bad. A dialogue between two different perspectives is what this country is about and often creates a good outcome.
\
Our problem is a Congress only thinking about securing the next election and not thinking about compromise and what is best for the majority of our country.

207,"
West Lebanon -- There was good news out of Washington this week for Upper Valley officials seeking funding for a number of transportation projects, ranging from a major safety overhaul along Route 12 in Charlestown to the replacement or repair of aging bridges over Vermont rivers in towns such as Strafford and Chelsea.
\
After years of stymied efforts to address the nation's aging and congested highways and transit systems, Congress found the sweet spot for passage on Thursday -- a five-year, $305 billion bill laden with enough industry favors, parochial projects, safety improvements and union demands to gain overwhelming support.
\
The bill was approved, 359-65, in the House and 83-6 in the Senate Thursday night.
\
All seven members of the Vermont and New Hampshire delegations backed the bill, though U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, D-Vt., missed the vote because he was flying to New Hampshire that night for presidential campaign events on Friday.
\
""This five-year bill will provide funding for important transportation infrastructure projects in New Hampshire like the widening of Interstate 93, and provide states and contractors the certainty they need to plan projects and hire workers,"" U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., said in a statement. The measure also includes an amendment she backed to renew the Export-Import Bank.
\
U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said in a statement that the legislation ""ensures that Vermont will receive the funding it needs, more than $1.1 billion over the next five years, to allow Vermonters to move forward on infrastructure projects that have been waiting in the wings. In Vermont, the construction season is short and the need is great, and a series of stopgap measures to kick the can down the road was never the right answer. I am pleased there will finally be the stability needed for Vermont, and all states, to move forward to bolster our country's infrastructure.""
\
New Hampshire and Vermont transportation officials said passage will help their states proceed with a number of projects on the planning boards.
\
Among the major projects slated to be bid out in the next year are a $10.3 million proposal to relocate railroad tracks paralleling a narrow stretch of Route 12 next to the Connecticut River in Charlestown and Walpole, N.H., and a $736,000 project to make pedestrian and bicycle improvements along Route 120 in Lebanon.
\
In Vermont, pending projects in the next two years include the rehabilitation of a bridge along Route 110 in Chelsea over the First Branch of the White River; a replacement of a bridge in Strafford over the West Branch of the Ompompanoosuc River; replacement of the Route 106 bridge over Kedron Brook in Woodstock; and the design and construction of about 2,000 feet of sidewalks and bike lanes along Route 5 in Hartford.
\
Bill Boynton, the spokesman for the New Hampshire Department of Transportation, said this was the first long-term federal surface transportation bill to be passed in more than a decade, and that Congress had approved more than 30 short-term extensions since 2009.
\
""This is great news from the NHDOT's point of view because of the certainty in anticipated federal funding that the (legislation) offers,"" Boynton said via email. ""It allows for us to better plan and say when projects are happening, especially for multi-year projects.""
\
Boynton said it is too early to know details about specific projects, but he said after several years of flat funding from Washington, New Hampshire will see roughly $175 million a year over five years, roughly a $15 million annual increase.
\
Sanders, who serves on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said he helped win a 5 percent increase in funding for Vermont in the first year and a total increase of 15 percent over five years.
\
The bill now goes to the White House for President Obama's signature.
\
But the measure doesn't include as much money or last quite as long as many lawmakers and the Obama administration would have liked. Nor does it resolve how to pay for transportation programs in the long term.
\
Despite that, the 1,300-page bill was hailed by industry and public officials as a major accomplishment that will halt the cycle of last-minute short-term fixes that have kept the federal Highway Trust Fund teetering on the edge of insolvency for much of the past eight years.
\
Republicans leaders can point to the bill's passage as evidence of their ability to govern, and Obama can claim progress on addressing the nation's aging and congested infrastructure, a major goal since the early days of his administration. Lawmakers in both parties praised the bill as a model of bipartisan cooperation and an important step forward.
\
The bill ""proves to the American people that we can get big things done,"" said Rep. Bill Shuster, chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. The committee's senior Democrat, Rep. Peter DeFazio of Oregon, called the measure ""historic,"" but cautioned that ""it is a starting point, not the end.""
\
One hallmark of the bill is the creation of new programs to focus federal aid on eliminating bottlenecks and increasing the capacity of highways designated as major freight corridors. The Transportation Department estimates the volume of freight traffic will increase 45 percent over the next 30 years.
\
A big shortcoming in the bill, though, is how it's all financed. The main source of revenue for transportation is the trust fund, which comes mostly from the 18.4-cents-a-gallon gasoline tax. That tax hasn't been raised since 1993 even though transportation spending has increased. But raising the gas tax is viewed by many lawmakers as too politically risky.
\
To make up the shortfall, the bill uses about $70 billion in mostly budget gimmicks, including one that would move $53 billion from the Federal Reserve Bank's capital account to the general treasury. It's counted as new money on paper, but is actually just a transfer of funds from one government account to another, federal budget experts said.
\
Other items in the bill also don't include the means to pay for them, including more than $10 billion over five years for Amtrak and other rail programs, $12 billion for mass transit and $1 billion for vehicle safety programs. The money for those programs remains subject to annual spending decisions by Congress.
\
Among the bill's losers are large banks, which would receive lower dividends from the Federal Reserve, with the savings used for transportation programs. Banking officials complained that banks shouldn't be asked to foot the bill for highways and bridges.
\
The airline and cruise ship industries complained that their passengers are also being asked to pay for improvements unrelated to their travel. The bill ties customs fees to inflation and uses the increased revenue to offset the bill's cost. It also directs the sale of 66 millions of barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in order to raise $6.5 billion. The catch is the sales don't start until 2023 -- three years after the transportation bill it helps pay for has expired.
\
The bill also addresses several concerns raised by a deadly Amtrak derailment in Philadelphia in May. It provides $200 million to help passenger railroads install positive train control technology that accident investigators say could have prevent the derailment had it been in operation. It also raises the liability cap on total damages that can be awarded in such crashes from $200 million to $295 million. The derailment killed eight people and injured nearly 200 others.
\
The Amalgamated Transit Union, which represents city bus drivers, won a provision requiring the government to direct transit agencies to take steps to protect bus drivers from assault, a growing problem. The Federal Transit Administration is required to consider whether local transit agencies provide bathroom breaks and access to bathrooms for bus drivers when evaluating the safety of the agencies.
\
Another provision sought by the dairy industry and sponsored by upstate New York, Connecticut and Wisconsin allows trucks hauling milk to exceed federal weight limits for interstate highways in some cases.
\
Leahy's office said that the Vermont Democrat, a former chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, had helped scuttle several House amendments that would have weakened the Freedom of Information Act, but that the final legislation includes one new FOIA exemption designed to protect the identity of people who blow the whistle about motor vehicle safety issues, and two other exemptions ""designed to protect highly sensitive information related to the electric grid.""

"
209,"Governor sets stage for battles \By Tom Zolper and Nancy RemsenFree Press Staff Writers \Middle-income elderly and thousands of other Vermonters would see their health-care benefits slashed, and local schools would have their state funding frozen, under a state budget proposed by Gov. Howard Dean on Tuesday. \Dean also proposed $$@$!15 million less for the state Agency of Transportation, cuts that would limit local road and bridge repairs. \Legislators almost unanimously decried the proposed health-care cuts. Nearly as many lawmakers vowed to fight the flat education spending, which they said would force municipalities to increase taxes to pay for schools or reduce staff. \Dean's spending plan, unveiled to a joint meeting of the Legislature, is his opening gambit in what will be a fierce chess match between the governor and the Legislature. Almost certainly, the Legislature will change what Dean has proposed. Any cuts lawmakers eliminate might have to be made up with other cuts. Tax revenue is flat. \""It's a who-is-going-to blink-first strategy,"" said one lobbyist, Peter Youngbear of the Vermont Coalition for Disability Rights. \Dean's proposal puts pressure on lawmakers to increase the cigarette tax, the gas tax or other taxes if they want to avert budget cuts that would play political havoc in an election year. Dean favors some of those increases. \""Smoking is a public health emergency, and the lack of an adequate cigarette tax is an emergency for all Vermonters who depend on the state for health care,"" Dean said in his speech. \More tax revenue, however, might not be enough to avoid some austere budget measures. \Finance Commissioner Sean Campbell said the state's $$@$!650 million Medicaid program has become so expensive that Dean believes Vermonters who receive free or discounted health care through the program should have to pay more from their own pockets. Campbell acknowledged such cuts in funding could have a ""devastating effect"" on less affluent beneficiaries, but said the state simply can't afford the Medicaid bill. \Dean couched his bad news budget as an opportunity to keep the state's fiscal condition sound, and to support programs that will help Vermonters pull out of a recession. \In the proposed @$!1 million to help start a technical academy in Chittenden County, and $$@$!3.2 million more for state support of higher education. \Dean also proposed to increase spending @$!439,000 for new security measures at the Capitol, and $$@$!1.5 million to help relieve increasing caseloads at the Department of Developmental and Mental Health Services, among other programs. \The governor's proposal now goes to the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. House Speaker Walter Freed, R-Dorset, said he agreed with Dean's general aim of restraining the growth of state government during a recession, but differed with his priorities. \Freed said Republicans might be more inclined to eliminate programs like the Champlain Flyer, a 13-mile commuter train between Charlotte and Burlington that has cost more than expected and suffered low ridership. \The impact of Dean's proposal would be felt in at least three main areas: \Medicaid \The governor proposes to eliminate one Medicaid program, and to seek dramatically increased payments from beneficiaries of other programs. \Medicaid is a 36-year-old public health care program jointly funded by the federal government and individual states. Like other states, Vermont has expanded the program to provide services to about 128,000 Vermonters. \Dean would eliminate the VScript Expanded program, which pays half the cost of basic prescription drugs for elderly and disabled with incomes of up to about $$@$!19,000 per individual. About 3,000 Vermonters are in the program. \The governor's proposal also would require elderly, disabled and uninsured adults of all ages with incomes up to about @$!750 a year for medicines. They now pay only a few dollars for each bottle of pills. \""These pharmaceutical programs are among the most expensive and rapidly growing parts of the Human Services budget. If the Legislature does not raise revenues, we have no choice but to reduce the programs, "" Dean said. \Dean also would eliminate free adult dentures, chiropractic care, podiatry coverage and reduce state benefits for adult Medicaid dental programs. \In all at least 15,000 Vermonters would be impacted. The cuts would save the state $$@$!27 million. Campbell said the governor would have liked to spread the cuts over a broader number of Medicaid recipients but the federal government limits Vermont's options. \""Hopefully, this is not the end of the story. These cuts are just too deep,"" said Harriet Goodwin, director of the Community of Vermont Elders. ""Many Vermonters will have to choose between their health care and their heat."" \Legislators, both Democrat, Republican and Progressives, said they would fight the health care cuts. \010 . 0013.03""This is not going to happen,"" said Sen. Peter Shumlin, D-Windham, leader of the Senate and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. \Shumlin said House Republicans who oppose a cigarette tax increase will change their minds to ultimately prevent the Medicaid cuts. \Key Republicans stood firm. Rep. Tom Koch, R-Barre, chairman of the House Health and Welfare Committee, said he would prefer to dramatically reform Medicaid to provide a standard package of health care benefits on a sliding income scale. Wealthier people receiving help from the program would pay more. \Education \Dean had two different messages about education in his budget address. For kindergarten through grade 12, he said it was time to put the brakes on spending: ""For the first time in the history of Vermont, the state share of funding for K-through-12 education will exceed $$@$!1 billion."" \By contrast, he said the state should invest more in higher education. He proposed a 4.6 percent increase in state money for the University of Vermont, the state colleges and the Vermont Student Assistance Corp. ""I would like to do more, particularly to offset the under-funding of higher education in the early'90s,"" he said. \Robert Clarke, chancellor of the Vermont State Colleges, applauded the extra money for higher education. ""Governor Dean recognized the value of higher education and its importance to economic development."" \For the state college system, which served 10,380 students in the fall, Clarke said the extra money is critical. ""What it buys is that we don't have to cut educational services."" \Lawmakers are likely to agree with Dean on giving higher education some extra money, but many said Tuesday they don't like his cuts for public schools. \Dean proposed freezing the amount the state sends to schools at @$!5,566 per student next year. \""It's a bad idea,"" said Rep. Thomas Little, R-Shelburne. If the state provides schools with less money, Little said, school boards will turn to the local property tax to make up for the loss. \Rep. Gaye Symington, D-Jericho, objected to another facet of Dean's plan. He would provide $$@$!5 million less for education from sales, income and other taxes. She said that would also shift more of the burden of paying for schools to local property taxes. \Symington said that since the passage of the school funding law known as Act 60, every legislator has a stake in how much money the state sends to schools. ""Now that it matters to all of us,"" she said, ""I don't think (Dean's plan) will fly."" \""No way,"" agreed Rep. Richard Marron, R-Stowe. Marron heads the House Ways and Means Committee that will make some of the school funding decisions. \Lyman Amsden, superintendent of Burlington schools, hopes lawmakers reject Dean's plan because it would cost his school system $$@$!600,000. To raise the extra money would require another 3 cents on a tax rate already projected to rise 10 cents, Amsden said. The other option would be to cut deeply into school programs. \Based on existing law, Burlington and other school districts counted on receiving $$@$!5,566 per student when they wrote their budgets for next year. ""If we are going to have funding formulas,"" Amsden said, ""they need to be funded. This is not the time to bag a formula."" \Amsden said Dean warned school officials he planned to freeze student grants. Burlington and other school districts have gambled the Legislature would reject the plan. ""If I'm wrong,"" Amsden said, ""we will have to find the cuts."" \Security \Dean told lawmakers the state couldn't ignore the lessons of Sept. 11. He offered a package of changes to help the state prepare for emergencies. \He wants to offer police and firefighters more training. He wants five regional emergency coordinators. He included @$!400,000 contribution to an emergency fund. \Democratic House Leader John Tracy of Burlington agreed that the state should improve its preparations for emergencies. ""We can't pretend we live in a vacuum."" \Tracy wants the focus to be broad, though, not just on terrorism. ""A disaster is a disaster, whether it is manmade or natural."" \Rep. Robert Wood, R-Brandon, heads the committee that will review some of Dean's security proposals. ""There are some questions about how far do we go,"" he said. ""We will see what the needs are.""

Howard Dean presented his budget to run state government next year. Here are highlights: A HEALTH CARE: Wants to shrink state-subsidized health care programs by @$!8.6 million by holding state's grant per student at this year's rate of @$!5 million for education that comes from taxes other than the property tax. A HIGHER EDUCATION: Calls for @$!15.75 million from town highway programs, but urges Legislature to pass increases in motor vehicles fees to raise @$!2.8 million extra for the Agency of Natural Resources to make up for inadequate funding in past years. A SECURITY: Calls for new security measures because of the terrorist attacks. Would add five regional emergency coordinators, spend an extra @$!439,000 for more security at the Capitol Complex in Montpelier. Also, calls for Vermont Yankee nuclear plant to increase to $$@$!800,000 its contribution to a special emergency fund. \Web extra \A For the full text of Gov. Howard Dean's budget address, go to www.burlingtonfreepress.com A To look at the budget, visit www.state.vt.us/fin/ \Excerpts from Dean's speech \Excerpts from Gov. Howard Dean's 2002 budget address: \""Four times last January, last July, this past November and just last week the Emergency Board lowered Vermont's revenue projections. As we started deliberation on the budget last year, we expected General Fund revenues to be just over @$!866 million for 2002 $$@$!50 million less than we expected. \At that same time last year, we also established a forecast for 2003 of @$!893 million of General Funds to support the budget I present to you. \For a lot of Vermont families, this is not news. As more Vermonters struggle to find work, we too must struggle to maintain the financial discipline that will allow us to move through this recession and get people back to work. While we are sympathetic to the plight of those who will receive fewer state services, we must also do our best to help people who have lost their jobs get through these difficult times. \Because of Vermont's hard work and good fortune we meet this recession in much better shape than we did the last. We know how to weather this type of storm: Discipline must be maintained and hard choices must be made. \For the first time in the history of Vermont, the state share of funding for K-through-12 education will exceed $$@$!1 billion. While support for education is good news, the rate of growth is more than we can afford. \I am recommending in this budget that the basic student support grant the block grant be level funded in 2003. The block grant was raised by $$@$!6.5 million of one-time money last year, but we cannot afford to put that in the base. \Further, to help balance the Education Fund and to control costs, I will propose modifications to income sensitivity under Act 60 to save $$@$!4 million. \The Medicaid budget will present significant challenges this year. Every Vermonter deserves to have access to health care, and I will continue to fight for that principle. But we cannot afford to provide all the services that we currently offer. \In this budget I once again ask that you modify Medicaid to ensure the state-covered plan resembles insurance packages offered in the private sector. \In addition, pharmaceutical costs are eroding the budget of every state in the union. In 1998, Vermont's Medicaid program spent @$!100 million a 150 percent increase. \Last year I recommended an increase of 67 cents in the cigarette tax. The Legislature declined to raise this tax, leaving our rate at only 44 cents a pack. In Washington State, the tax is @$!1.50 per pack. ... \This budget does not include revenue increases such as the cigarette tax that the Legislature has previously opposed. Therefore, I regretfully recommend to you that we eliminate the expanded VSCRIPT program in its entirety, which is 100 percent funded through state dollars. \I also ask that we impose a 50 percent co-payment on pharmaceutical benefits through both the Vermont Health Access Plan and the remaining VSCRIPT program. These pharmaceutical programs are among the most expensive and rapidly growing parts of the Human Services budget. \If the Legislature does not raise revenues, we have no choice but to reduce the programs."" \NEWS; Pg. 01A"

Beginning this summer, however, businesses selling pre-written software on the Internet must begin collecting sales tax.\Executive branch fees (H.240): The state will collect an additional $2.2 million in fees as a result of adjustments made in several categories including professions such as barbers and nail technicians, corporate filings, licenses for weighing and measuring devices and licenses and permits for bottlers, caterers, festivals, wine tasting and educational sampling event permit.\Tax increment financing districts (S.37): Requires municipalities that were cited by the state Auditor's Office for owing money to the state Education Fund for their tax increment financing district to pay part of the money. Burlington, Milton, Winooski and Newport had been cited for owing a total of $6 million but all except Newport disputed the finding and the state had no mechanism for forcing them to pay. Burlington has to pay $200,000 to the Education Fund over five years, Milton $22,000 to the Education Fund over two years, $160,000 to the Catamount Husky Tax Increment Fund, $17,000 to the Catamount Husky Tax Increment Fund by Dec. 15, Winooski $1,300 to the Education Fund, $62,000 to the Tax Increment Financing Fund over five years. Clarifies rules for municipalities using tax increment financing districts to fund development projects and a process for auditing the districts and resolving disputes. The mayors applauded the legislation\OUTDOORS\Hunting, fishing, trapping (H.101): Allows mental health facilities to obtain one fishing license for any of their clients to fish as part of their therapy. Bans the importation of exotic boars. Allows hunters to carry sidearms in addition to hunting rifles and archery bows while training dogs.\PUBLIC SAFETY\Automated license reader (S.18): Limits to 18 months the amount of time police can retain records accumulated through automated license readers, effective July 1. Some 40 police agencies in Vermont are using the readers to take digital images of license plates, alerting them when a driver has a suspended license or other infraction. The devices have raised privacy concerns.\Driving (S.150): Increases fines for texting while driving, effective July 1. Prohibits idling of a vehicle for more than 5 minutes in a one-hour period with some exceptions, effective May 1, 2014. Outlines circumstances under which a Judicial Bureau hearing officer may waive points assessed for infractions on a driver license.\E911 and schools (H.533 and H.530): Having learned that many public schools and some college buildings fail to comply with a longstanding state requirement that accurate information comes up in the 911 system for each telephone line in school buildings, the Legislature directed that $75,000 of the funding allocated for the E-911 system next year go to help schools come into compliance by Jan. 15. Also, up to $20,000 is available from bond sales to help pay for one-time fees and equipment associated with bringing school phone systems into compliance.\Police investigation records (S.148): New standards will govern disclosure of police investigation records, replacing the blanket exemption from disclosure that had been in effect. Records would be public except if their release would interfere with enforcement, prevent a fair trial, cause unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, disclose confidential informants, disclose investigative techniques or endanger personal safety.\Search and rescue (H.182): Establishes a full-time state search and rescue coordinator position, effective July 1. Requires a database of available rescue crews and their expertise to be maintained. Clarifies that the state Public Safety Department has jurisdiction over search and rescue operations, in cooperation with local agencies and establishes protocol for such operations.\Vermont Yankee emergency planning (H.530): The state division of emergency management and homeland security may grant up to $250,000 to the American Red Cross to bolster its capacity to provide shelter in the event of an accident at the Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant in Vernon. The Red Cross is directed to plan to shelter up to 20 percent of the population in the ""emergency planning zone. This appropriation is viewed as the first of several appropriations to meet the shelter costs estimated to require $770,000. The emergency management division is also directed to negotiate with the owner of Vermont Yankee concerning the cost and level of sheltering capacity needed in excess of 20 percent, with Sept. 1 as the deadline for reaching an agreement. After that date, emergency management shall make the decision.\TRANSPORTATION\Amtrak subsidy (H.510): Appropriates an additional $3.1 million to maintain Amtrak passenger service on the Vermonter and Ethan Allen routes, a doubling of the subsidy the state paid in the current year. The state will negotiate fare changes with other states through which these passenger trains travel with the goal of decreasing the jump in the state's subsidy by at least 20 percent.\Gas tax (H.510): The tax on gasoline increased by a net of 5.9 cents on May 1 as a result of a .8-cent decrease in the tax per gallon and a new 2 percent assessment on the price. The tax per gallon of gasoline decreases 6.9 cents and the assessment increases by another 2 percent on July 1, 2014. The tax on diesel increase two cents on July 1 and another penny per gallon a year later.\HOLDOVERS\Any bill that was introduced in during the first year of the Legislature's two-year session will remain available for lawmakers to take up next winter. Lawmakers already began deliberations on the issues listed below, so decisions are likely when the Legislature reconvenes in January.\Campaign finance (S.82): The bill would have established new campaign contributions limits, new reporting requirements for candidates, political parties and political action committees, but the Senate and House disagreed over limiting how much people can give to PACs so the bill is stalled in conference committee.\Deputy state's attorneys (S.165): Legislation that would allow deputy state's attorney, victim's advocates and administrative staff in state's attorneys' offices to unionize reached the Senate floor before stalling.\Genetically modified organisms (H.112): The House passed but the Senate has not acted on a bill that would require foods containing genetically modified organisms to be labeled. Supporters hope to galvanize backing and get the bill through next year.\Newspaper carriers (H.169): The Department of Labor must hold off until July 1, 2014, on implementation of a rule requiring newspaper publishers to pay unemployment insurance for the people who deliver the papers. The delay allows legislative lawyers to research whether newspaper carriers are independent contractors or direct sellers and how unemployment compensations statutes should apply to them. A report is due Jan. 15.\Public records (H.54): The Legislature's legal staff will comb Vermont statutes and write proposed legislation that consolidates all the existing public record exemptions -- 239 at last count -- in a single place in the law books. The review and recommendations are due Nov. 1.\Public funding of pre-kindergarten (H.270): The House passed but the Senate failed to act on a bill that would require schools to offer at least 10 hours of publicly funded pre-kindergarten.\Public advocacy in utility matters (S.25): Legislation to require the Public Service Department to advocate for individuals and communities in cases before the Public Service Board and to require the board to take filings electronically failed in the final days of the session. Advocates plan to continue seeking changes to make it easier to navigate the expensive and difficult process.\Siting of electric generation (S.30): Directs the House and Senate Natural Resources & Energy committees to meet during the off-session to consider the recommendations of a special energy siting commission to see if any changes should be made to the way energy projects are sited.\Social networking privacy protection (S.7): Establishes a committee to study prohibiting employers from requiring employees or job applicants to provide access to personal social media accounts such as Facebook and report back to the Legislature by Jan 15.\Shoreland protection (H.526): A bill that would have protected shorelands from development did not pass after facing opposition from lakeshore property owners worried they wouldn't be able to develop their land. Lawmakers agreed to take the idea to the public for possible legislation next year and established a Lake Shoreland Protection Commission to report back to the Legislature Jan. 15.\Tenants and delinquent payments (S.41): Legislative negotiators failed to resolve their differences on a bill to provide a remedy to tenants when their landlords fail to pay water and sewer bills and the utilities cut off service. The negotiations remain alive as does a proposal to allow tenants to pay to continue service, not be responsible for landlord's debt and be able to subtract payments from their rent."

Wednesday, January 23 Mr. President, Madam Speaker, members of the General Assembly, my fellow Vermonters:
\
Five years ago - as I stood at this podium to deliver my first budget address - Vermont was mired near the bottom of a global economic slowdown. Our economy had stalled, our government had overpromised and Vermonters were demanding a change from business as usual.
\
Together, we took immediate action to spur job creation, focus on affordability, resist tax increases and restrain spending. We made hard decisions with compassion, protecting those at risk and helping others with a hand-up. We emerged from that slump a stronger state - with more Vermonters working than ever before, with poverty down, with health care for more families and with opportunities for our people more bountiful than ever.
\
Today, as I stand before you again, Vermonters are uneasy about the economic uncertainty rippling across our nation. There is a growing anxiety that high fuel prices, increasing dependence on foreign investment and deep swings in the stock market will impact our families and communities.
\
Although this current volatility is caused by national ailments far removed from the Green Mountains, we are not immune to its effects. But because of smart choices we made over the last five years, Vermont is better positioned than most states to weather this storm and break through stronger still.
\
* * *
\
Yet we cannot rest on past achievement. Indeed, we must act boldly this session to stay ahead of the developing national downturn. Government alone does not make or break the economy, but the steps it takes can be the difference between riding out a patch of choppy seas and taking on water.
\
Until we get around this period of economic uncertainty, we will be required to make some very difficult choices among many important priorities. Some programs will be put on hold, others will be reshaped, and everyone will be asked to share in the sacrifice. Expanding the size and scope of government would be a mistake, as would raising taxes on already struggling families.
\
Achieving real results in a tight budget requires us to rethink how we deploy taxpayer dollars - evaluate every program, every service and every investment - to ensure maximum effectiveness and efficiency. We must revitalize what works well and reform what can work better. We can achieve prosperity through affordability if we make the best use of our limited resources and invest every taxpayer dollar as if we earned it by our own labor.
\
* * *
\
In my first budget message, I laid out five principles. I remain dedicated to those values and they are at the core of the budget I present today.
\
First, government must live within its means because every dollar we spend beyond our capacity to pay is a dollar that must be repaid by our children.
\
Second, government will fulfill its commitment to the neediest Vermonters because a society is judged by how it treats the most vulnerable.
\
Third, we must not dip even further into the pockets of struggling taxpayers.
\
Fourth, sacrifice must be shared broadly so that no one is asked to carry an undue burden.
\
Finally, the most direct route to prosperity is to invest in Vermonters-in their education, skills and aspirations.
\
Today, I present to you a balanced fiscal year 2009 budget of $4.3 billion in state and federal funds. My budget meets these key criteria: it protects seniors, children and needy families; it invests in immediate job creation initiatives; it jumpstarts health care reform and upgrades to our telecommunications network; it provides access to affordable homes and much needed tax relief; and it positions Vermont to build a stronger, more innovative and more resilient economy for the long term.
\
There are six major increases in this budget totaling $64 million that consume virtually all available revenue growth. They include: more than $34 million to support Medicaid and Catamount Health; almost $11 million transferred to the Education Fund and over $6 million for homeowner rebates, both to help ease the property tax burden; nearly $7 million to the Department of Corrections for increasing pressures; and over $5 million to the Department for Children and Families for basic social services.
\
After these necessary expenditures are accounted for, there is almost no room for spending increases - underscoring the challenge ahead. The investments we make in other areas of state government are funded through choosing among competing priorities, strategically using federal resources and finding efficiencies in programs and administrative overhead.
\
***
\
Building a budget is more than making the rows and columns add up, it is crafting a statement of priorities. This statement carries a greater weight when resources are tight and we are faced with tough choices. As we make these decisions we will be judged not only by our progress in moving Vermont forward economically, but how we protect the neediest among us. They are the most at risk in challenging times and they must not be forgotten.
\
For them, and for every Vermonter, access to affordable health care is critical. I propose adding more than $27 million in state funds to bolster Vermont's Medicaid programs. This new money will prevent a Medicaid deficit and keep us from having to reduce the number of those enrolled in these important programs.
\
The largest components of this transfer include $14.5 million from the General Fund, $4.6 million of one-time funds from the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board and a little over $8 million from Tobacco Funds.
\
Medicaid is a good illustration of the hard, but necessary, decisions we face all across state government. We will protect the base appropriation for tobacco cessation programs and allow already approved housing and conservation projects to proceed - but we must use some of these precious state funds to save Medicaid for the most vulnerable. In these challenging times, this is a better investment of our limited resources.
\
To augment this large infusion of General and Tobacco Fund monies into Medicaid, I am asking participants to contribute a modest amount toward saving this program through targeted changes in premiums and co-pays. These added contributions are a trade-off: we want to keep the program available to every Vermonter who needs assistance, so we must ask everyone to do his or her part to keep it affordable.
\
***
\
Health care costs remain one of the greatest barriers to the prosperity of our families and every investment we make in prevention improves lives and reduces health care costs over the long term.
\
Although Vermont has been a national leader in health care, Washington has failed to follow. The federal government has refused to be our partner in covering those with incomes between 200 and 300 percent of the federal poverty level. But Vermont will not shrink from its responsibility. I ask this General Assembly to approve $7.5 million in state funds to help those Vermonters the federal system has left behind.
\
We must also continue our work to ensure every person with a chronic condition receives the right care at the right time through the Vermont Blueprint for Health. With no new additional funds, but building on the progress we have made, my Blueprint budget has been revitalized to support several new initiatives to improve health care quality and ultimately contain costs. It provides funding for small primary care practices to install electronic health information systems. My goal is to have every doctor in Vermont using one of these systems by the end of 2010 - a perfect complement to our e-State Initiative.
\
My budget also funds prevention specialists for each district health office to focus on obesity - a major contributor to disease and health care costs - as well as an additional $300,000 investment in community-based prevention programs.
\
***
\
The Agency of Human Services is our largest state agency, tasked with handling Vermont's most complex and sensitive issues. To ensure that our investments achieve the best outcomes, I have asked it to rethink how services are delivered. For example, Vermont spends close to $100 million on services for children with disabilities, spread out across five departments. By more completely integrating these efforts, we can provide more service for the same amount of money and, most importantly, improve outcomes for our children.
\
Our innovative approach to problem solving has allowed us to not only sustain valuable services, but also infuse additional dollars into key programs that protect the most vulnerable. We will continue to provide, for instance, the most generous low-income home heating assistance benefit in the nation. No Vermont family should be cold this winter.
\
I also recommend significant funding increases: for services to people with developmental disabilities; for seniors in my Choices for Care program that provides them the option of remaining home as they age; for adult and child mental health services; for people with traumatic brain injury; for providers of children's residential services; and to assist foster children transitioning to adulthood and successful participation in our economy.
\
Finally, I am encouraged that my Administration and the Legislature are in general agreement on the best way to replace the Vermont State Hospital. My budget includes funds for future facility planning and additional improvements to the existing hospital.
\
***
\
Our human services provide an important safety net when people need it most. The very best investment we can make, however, is the one that reduces demand for these services, grows our economy, creates good jobs and helps to make Vermont more affordable and families more prosperous. The expenditures I propose in these areas were challenging to find this year, but are indeed necessary to make Vermont more competitive and prosperous in the global marketplace.
\
In the 21st Century economy, access to a cutting edge telecommunications system is the difference between moving forward and falling behind, and our e-State Initiative has positioned us to succeed. To build on the quarter-million dollar investment in software and e-communities grants I have recommended, I propose $400,000 for the Vermont Telecommunications Authority to further our goal of universal cellular and wireless coverage in Vermont by the end of 2010.
\
Higher education must remain a centerpiece of our economy, helping to produce the next generation of innovative ideas and industries, as well as knowledgeable, motivated employees who inspire them. That is why my budget provides $8 million for Next Generation workforce training programs and college scholarships.
\
Of that, $3.4 million is invested in helping Vermont's workers move to better paying jobs, including $1.4 million for skills training for those who are unemployed or underemployed and $1 million to train and educate young, out-of-school Vermonters. I also propose $700,000 to help local businesses retrain employees and $300,000 for the University of Vermont to acquire patents and commercialize technology that will create jobs.
\
The remaining $4.6 million in Next Generation money should be used to put scholarships and grants directly into the hands of as many students as possible.
\
I recommend $500,000 for loan repayments for nurses and other health care professionals; $700,000 to the Vermont Student Assistance Corporation for grants to Vermonters taking part in post-secondary training programs; and $400,000 in scholarships for gifted high school students enrolled in courses at a state college.
\
I propose that the final $3 million be allocated for student scholarships and split evenly among the University of Vermont, Vermont State Colleges, and VSAC. In honor of the life and achievement of the member from Lyndon, I think it would be a perfect tribute if the $1 million in scholarship money for the Vermont State Colleges is dedicated as the Cola H. Hudson Memorial Scholarship.
\
In addition, even in these tight budget times, I am recommending a 2.5 percent increase for UVM, the State Colleges and VSAC. The capital bill includes an additional $1.6 million for both UVM and the State Colleges. And working with the State Treasurer, I propose the state extend an amount of its moral obligation pledge to future borrowings by UVM and the State Colleges on projects related to deferred maintenance. This could result in lower borrowing costs for both institutions.
\
To further recruit and retain skilled, working-age Vermonters - and to help reverse our population trends - we must reach out to those who love Vermont, but currently reside elsewhere, and encourage their return and participation in our economy and our communities. That is why I propose we invest in PursueVT, a program that reaches out to those who left Vermont and connects them with the opportunities they need - like a good job and an affordable home - to return to the state to work and raise a family.
\
To foster job creation and entrepreneurship in environmental technology, and to further efforts to address climate change, I propose we modify the Vermont Employment Growth Incentive program to make ""green economy"" companies eligible for significantly larger incentives to create jobs here. I also propose the State retirement boards designate a percentage of their funds for investment in the creation of green jobs, a move that could generate up to $10 million in additional capital for job creation.
\
***
\
These are all important steps, but putting homeownership within reach of our families and encouraging the immediate construction of new homes is one of the most substantial steps we can take this year to create jobs and stimulate economic growth.
\
My New Neighborhoods initiative spurs the construction of affordable homes and can help communities hold down property taxes. Land designated for ""New Neighborhoods"" would yield the same tax revenue it currently provides, but communities would get to keep 75 percent of the new incremental education tax from improvements on the land - that is, new homes - and the state Education Fund would accrue the remaining 25 percent. After three years, all the revenue generated - from both the land and the improvement - would flow to the Education Fund. This is a win for the communities as it promotes responsible, smart growth and a win for taxpayers as it helps hold down property taxes.
\
My Urban Homestead proposal is an innovative approach to converting upper floors in downtown buildings into housing. The program will draw homeowners into our village centers and revitalize main streets. Our research shows $280,000 of incentives can leverage as much as $5 million in private investment.
\
* * *
\
We must also reduce the tax burden that prevents many Vermonters from owning a home and threatens to force some out of homes they have owned for years. That is why I have proposed a responsible way to leverage our lottery that can make it more valuable, help us invest in school modernization and provide millions of dollars in relief to beleaguered property taxpayers.
\
As I outlined in my State of the State message, leasing the lottery will provide the state with a one-time $50 million payment, as well as a guaranteed annual payment of $23 million and a percentage of annual profits.
\
I recommend using the one-time $50 million payment on one-time expenditures. The first $25 million should be invested in school construction. This expenditure brings my total capital appropriation recommendation to more than $79 million, including support for the Health and Forensics Laboratories, the Bennington state office building, upgrades underway at the Vermont Veterans Home, and other necessary projects.
\
The remaining $25 million in lottery proceeds should be used to give Vermonters immediate property tax relief. This provides a one-time bridge between this year's rising property tax bills and next year when Act 82 - our ""think twice"" property tax containment plan - takes effect.
\
If the Legislature does nothing, residential property taxes will rise by over seven percent and non-residential taxes will increase by almost 10 percent in the coming year. In my view, doing nothing is not an option.
\
* * *
\
As the cost of home heating fuel continues to increase, ensuring homes are energy efficient plays a role in making them affordable.
\
To that end, I recommend $1.6 million for an Energy Efficiency Investment Program to establish an innovative public-private partnership that over the next four years can invest $20 million in energy efficiency efforts in homes and small businesses - without raising taxes. These resources would be combined with the approximately $8 million of weatherization grants I have once again funded.
\
Currently, a household with an annual income up to $42,829 is eligible for existing weatherization grants - and the program is producing results. One Vermonter recently wrote me to say, ""The work done through (the weatherization) program has really helped to keep my home comfortable and my energy costs down."" She continued, ""My monthly winter electricity bill is down around $60 or more. My fuel oil usage seems to be down by about 25% as well-possibly more.... This program has made a big difference to me and my family. I'm a single working Mom and this kind of help is extraordinary.""
\
Coupling the proven results of the weatherization program with energy audits and no or low interest loans for middle income households establishes a comprehensive, financially sustainable approach to helping working Vermonters reduce their fuel bills. The money saved in the first few years would easily repay the loans and all the savings after that is money back in the pocket of the home or small business owner.
\
* * *
\
Last year, we made substantial investments in our agricultural economy and worked together to help farmers overcome low milk prices, high energy costs and wet weather. This year, Mother Nature and milk markets have cooperated with local farmers - a welcome blessing. While we cannot control the weather, we must take steps now to help farmers prepare for the next downturn. My budget funds farm sustainability programs like Buy Local, Farm to School and the Vermont Seal of Quality and I have included $300,000 for additional renewable energy grants to help farmers become energy independent.
\
Another program important to both farmers and the environment is our Clean and Clear Action Plan, a partnership among the Agency of Natural Resources, the Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets and private stakeholders. Clean and Clear is providing strong on-going efforts to reduce non-point source phosphorus pollution in Vermont's waterways. The proposed funding for fiscal year 2009 includes over $9 million in state funds and capital investments to support this important work.
\
***
\
Last year, I presented my Road to Affordability plan to focus transportation priorities on the preservation and safety of existing roads, bridges and culverts. I am grateful that the Legislature supported this approach and we have already made progress on the pressing transportation needs of our state. Investment in maintenance pays dividends for years to come; a dollar we spend today on the repair or rehabilitation of a bridge or culvert can save as much as ten dollars for a full replacement. It is an approach that just makes sense.
\
This budget reflects my commitment to a limited number of major projects including the Bennington Bypass, Circumferential Highway, Morrisville Bypass and the Brandon-Pittsford Route 7 reconstruction. Setting realistic timetables for these and other large roadway projects will allow funding a 47 percent, $7.6 million increase for maintenance activities including culvert and bridge work, ditching, and ledge and slope repairs. This constitutes a 160 percent funding increase in these critical areas since fiscal year 2007.
\
I also propose to reduce the raid on the transportation fund by an additional $1.1 million. I am pleased to report that since I first came to office we have reduced by $8 million the diversion of transportation funding to non-transportation related programs, and I remain committed to further reductions in future budget years. My budget also includes the use of more than $4.6 million in bonding authority to help address transportation needs.
\
With gasoline over $3.00 per gallon, we cannot ask Vermonters to pay a higher gas tax for roads and bridges. Instead, we must ensure that we are spending the entire $424 million annual transportation budget as effectively as possible. VTrans is taking steps to deliver projects on time and on budget, cut administrative costs, and save millions by curtailing unnecessary project amenities. We will use the money saved by these efforts to reinvest in bridge, culvert and paving projects.
\
***
\
Keeping communities safe will continue to be a top priority and I propose we add $2.8 million to the public safety budget. I have asked that a portion of this money be used to sustain drug enforcement efforts required to reduce drug-related violent crime, and I propose to provide an additional $150,000 to programs to prevent domestic and sexual violence.
\
I also recommend increasing funding for the DETER program by $600,000. A quarter-million dollars of this appropriation will fund opiate treatment; another quarter-million will support three sites that integrate substance abuse and mental health services; $50,000 will fund our 10th recovery center; and $50,000 will allow us to open a new adolescent treatment site. Since launching DETER in 2003, we have invested nearly $28 million to combat substance abuse in our state.
\
***
\
The cost of running Vermont's corrections system has been growing at double digits over the past decade. In the last several years, we have taken steps to address increasing demands and reduce costs through a series of reforms, including the Incarcerated Women's Initiative, expansion of transitional housing and residential drug treatment, and piloted use of electronic monitoring. As a result, the fiscal year 2009 corrections budget increase will be less than in previous years.
\
Despite this progress, and the predicted slowing of Vermont's prison population growth rate, we must expand our efforts. If unaddressed, corrections spending will continue to place an unsustainable burden on our budgets and divert resources from other valuable programs.
\
Currently, all three branches of state government are rethinking policies and evaluating options to reduce these expenses in a way that protects community safety while freeing up resources for promising initiatives. I want to commend the Senior Senator from Bennington County and other legislators for offering thoughtful and innovative approaches to addressing the budget challenges in corrections. It is never easy being first out of the blocks with an idea, but their proposals are precisely the kind of new thinking Vermont needs as we strive to maximize state resources.
\
***
\
As we begin to shape a budget for the next fiscal year, the economic uncertainty facing our nation gives us little margin for error. There are no easy answers.
\
We are required to innovate government services, and make tough choices among a multitude of good programs. We must prioritize today's needs with compassion and pass initiatives that will strengthen Vermont's economy today and for future generations. This budget does just that.
\
Five years ago, because we acted quickly and worked together, Vermont not only weathered the economic slowdown, but also emerged from it stronger and more prosperous. Today, I offer a budget that sets a clear course through today's unrest. Many of the decisions we make will be difficult, but our state will emerge stronger than ever.
\
Crafting a budget that is compassionate and balanced requires a partnership among officials that puts progress first-we're all in this together. By keeping an eye on the future and the bottom line, our budget can protect the most vulnerable, invest in immediate economic growth and ensure the prosperity and peace of mind of future generations.
\
Thank you, and may God bless the great state of Vermont.

They include: more than $34 million to support Medicaid and Catamount Health; almost $11 million transferred to the Education Fund and over $6 million for homeowner rebates, both to help ease the property tax burden; nearly $7 million to the Department of Corrections for increasing pressures; and over $5 million to the Department for Children and Families for basic social services.
\
After these necessary expenditures are accounted for, there is almost no room for spending increases - underscoring the challenge ahead. The investments we make in other areas of state government are funded through choosing among competing priorities, strategically using federal resources and finding efficiencies in programs and administrative overhead.
\
***
\
Building a budget is more than making the rows and columns add up, it is crafting a statement of priorities. This statement carries a greater weight when resources are tight and we are faced with tough choices. As we make these decisions we will be judged not only by our progress in moving Vermont forward economically, but how we protect the neediest among us. They are the most at risk in challenging times and they must not be forgotten.
\
For them, and for every Vermonter, access to affordable health care is critical. I propose adding more than $27 million in state funds to bolster Vermont's Medicaid programs. This new money will prevent a Medicaid deficit and keep us from having to reduce the number of those enrolled in these important programs.
\
The largest components of this transfer include $14.5 million from the General Fund, $4.6 million of one-time funds from the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board and a little over $8 million from Tobacco Funds.
\
Medicaid is a good illustration of the hard, but necessary, decisions we face all across state government. We will protect the base appropriation for tobacco cessation programs and allow already approved housing and conservation projects to proceed - but we must use some of these precious state funds to save Medicaid for the most vulnerable. In these challenging times, this is a better investment of our limited resources.
\
To augment this large infusion of General and Tobacco Fund monies into Medicaid, I am asking participants to contribute a modest amount toward saving this program through targeted changes in premiums and co-pays. These added contributions are a trade-off: we want to keep the program available to every Vermonter who needs assistance, so we must ask everyone to do his or her part to keep it affordable.
\
***
\
Health care costs remain one of the greatest barriers to the prosperity of our families and every investment we make in prevention improves lives and reduces health care costs over the long term.
\
Although Vermont has been a national leader in health care, Washington has failed to follow. The federal government has refused to be our partner in covering those with incomes between 200 and 300 percent of the federal poverty level. But Vermont will not shrink from its responsibility. I ask this General Assembly to approve $7.5 million in state funds to help those Vermonters the federal system has left behind.
\
We must also continue our work to ensure every person with a chronic condition receives the right care at the right time through the Vermont Blueprint for Health. With no new additional funds, but building on the progress we have made, my Blueprint budget has been revitalized to support several new initiatives to improve health care quality and ultimately contain costs. It provides funding for small primary care practices to install electronic health information systems. My goal is to have every doctor in Vermont using one of these systems by the end of 2010 - a perfect complement to our e-State Initiative.
\
My budget also funds prevention specialists for each district health office to focus on obesity - a major contributor to disease and health care costs - as well as an additional $300,000 investment in community-based prevention programs.
\

\
The Agency of Human Services is our largest state agency, tasked with handling Vermont's most complex and sensitive issues. To ensure that our investments achieve the best outcomes, I have asked it to rethink how services are delivered. For example, Vermont spends close to $100 million on services for children with disabilities, spread out across five departments. By more completely integrating these efforts, we can provide more service for the same amount of money and, most importantly, improve outcomes for our children.
\
Our innovative approach to problem solving has allowed us to not only sustain valuable services, but also infuse additional dollars into key programs that protect the most vulnerable. We will continue to provide, for instance, the most generous low-income home heating assistance benefit in the nation. No Vermont family should be cold this winter.
\
I also recommend significant funding increases: for services to people with developmental disabilities; for seniors in my Choices for Care program that provides them the option of remaining home as they age; for adult and child mental health services; for people with traumatic brain injury; for providers of children's residential services; and to assist foster children transitioning to adulthood and successful participation in our economy.
\
Finally, I am encouraged that my Administration and the Legislature are in general agreement on the best way to replace the Vermont State Hospital. My budget includes funds for future facility planning and additional improvements to the existing hospital.
\
***
\
Our human services provide an important safety net when people need it most. The very best investment we can make, however, is the one that reduces demand for these services, grows our economy, creates good jobs and helps to make Vermont more affordable and families more prosperous. The expenditures I propose in these areas were challenging to find this year, but are indeed necessary to make Vermont more competitive and prosperous in the global marketplace.
\
In the 21st Century economy, access to a cutting edge telecommunications system is the difference between moving forward and falling behind, and our e-State Initiative has positioned us to succeed. To build on the quarter-million dollar investment in software and e-communities grants I have recommended, I propose $400,000 for the Vermont Telecommunications Authority to further our goal of universal cellular and wireless coverage in Vermont by the end of 2010.
\
Higher education must remain a centerpiece of our economy, helping to produce the next generation of innovative ideas and industries, as well as knowledgeable, motivated employees who inspire them. That is why my budget provides $8 million for Next Generation workforce training programs and college scholarships.
\
Of that, $3.4 million is invested in helping Vermont's workers move to better paying jobs, including $1.4 million for skills training for those who are unemployed or underemployed and $1 million to train and educate young, out-of-school Vermonters. I also propose $700,000 to help local businesses retrain employees and $300,000 for the University of Vermont to acquire patents and commercialize technology that will create jobs.
\
The remaining $4.6 million in Next Generation money should be used to put scholarships and grants directly into the hands of as many students as possible.
\
I recommend $500,000 for loan repayments for nurses and other health care professionals; $700,000 to the Vermont Student Assistance Corporation for grants to Vermonters taking part in post-secondary training programs; and $400,000 in scholarships for gifted high school students enrolled in courses at a state college.
\
I propose that the final $3 million be allocated for student scholarships and split evenly among the University of Vermont, Vermont State Colleges, and VSAC. In honor of the life and achievement of the member from Lyndon, I think it would be a perfect tribute if the $1 million in scholarship money for the Vermont State Colleges is dedicated as the Cola H. Hudson Memorial Scholarship.
\
In addition, even in these tight budget times, I am recommending a 2.5 percent increase for UVM, the State Colleges and VSAC. The capital bill includes an additional $1.6 million for both UVM and the State Colleges. And working with the State Treasurer, I propose the state extend an amount of its moral obligation pledge to future borrowings by UVM and the State Colleges on projects related to deferred maintenance. This could result in lower borrowing costs for both institutions.
\
To further recruit and retain skilled, working-age Vermonters - and to help reverse our population trends - we must reach out to those who love Vermont, but currently reside elsewhere, and encourage their return and participation in our economy and our communities. That is why I propose we invest in PursueVT, a program that reaches out to those who left Vermont and connects them with the opportunities they need - like a good job and an affordable home - to return to the state to work and raise a family.
\
To foster job creation and entrepreneurship in environmental technology, and to further efforts to address climate change, I propose we modify the Vermont Employment Growth Incentive program to make ""green economy"" companies eligible for significantly larger incentives to create jobs here. I also propose the State retirement boards designate a percentage of their funds for investment in the creation of green jobs, a move that could generate up to $10 million in additional capital for job creation.
\
***
\
These are all important steps, but putting homeownership within reach of our families and encouraging the immediate construction of new homes is one of the most substantial steps we can take this year to create jobs and stimulate economic growth.
\
My New Neighborhoods initiative spurs the construction of affordable homes and can help communities hold down property taxes. Land designated for ""New Neighborhoods"" would yield the same tax revenue it currently provides, but communities would get to keep 75 percent of the new incremental education tax from improvements on the land - that is, new homes - and the state Education Fund would accrue the remaining 25 percent. After three years, all the revenue generated - from both the land and the improvement - would flow to the Education Fund. This is a win for the communities as it promotes responsible, smart growth and a win for taxpayers as it helps hold down property taxes.
\
My Urban Homestead proposal is an innovative approach to converting upper floors in downtown buildings into housing. The program will draw homeowners into our village centers and revitalize main streets. Our research shows $280,000 of incentives can leverage as much as $5 million in private investment.
\
* * *
\
We must also reduce the tax burden that prevents many Vermonters from owning a home and threatens to force some out of homes they have owned for years. That is why I have proposed a responsible way to leverage our lottery that can make it more valuable, help us invest in school modernization and provide millions of dollars in relief to beleaguered property taxpayers.
\
As I outlined in my State of the State message, leasing the lottery will provide the state with a one-time $50 million payment, as well as a guaranteed annual payment of $23 million and a percentage of annual profits.
\
I recommend using the one-time $50 million payment on one-time expenditures. The first $25 million should be invested in school construction. This expenditure brings my total capital appropriation recommendation to more than $79 million, including support for the Health and Forensics Laboratories, the Bennington state office building, upgrades underway at the Vermont Veterans Home, and other necessary projects.
\
The remaining $25 million in lottery proceeds should be used to give Vermonters immediate property tax relief. This provides a one-time bridge between this year's rising property tax bills and next year when Act 82 - our ""think twice"" property tax containment plan - takes effect.
\
If the Legislature does nothing, residential property taxes will rise by over seven percent and non-residential taxes will increase by almost 10 percent in the coming year. In my view, doing nothing is not an option.
\
* * *
\
As the cost of home heating fuel continues to increase, ensuring homes are energy efficient plays a role in making them affordable.
\
To that end, I recommend $1.6 million for an Energy Efficiency Investment Program to establish an innovative public-private partnership that over the next four years can invest $20 million in energy efficiency efforts in homes and small businesses - without raising taxes. These resources would be combined with the approximately $8 million of weatherization grants I have once again funded.
\
Currently, a household with an annual income up to $42,829 is eligible for existing weatherization grants - and the program is producing results. One Vermonter recently wrote me to say, ""The work done through (the weatherization) program has really helped to keep my home comfortable and my energy costs down."" She continued, ""My monthly winter electricity bill is down around $60 or more. My fuel oil usage seems to be down by about 25% as well-possibly more.... This program has made a big difference to me and my family. I'm a single working Mom and this kind of help is extraordinary.""
\
Coupling the proven results of the weatherization program with energy audits and no or low interest loans for middle income households establishes a comprehensive, financially sustainable approach to helping working Vermonters reduce their fuel bills. The money saved in the first few years would easily repay the loans and all the savings after that is money back in the pocket of the home or small business owner.
\
* * *
\
Last year, we made substantial investments in our agricultural economy and worked together to help farmers overcome low milk prices, high energy costs and wet weather. This year, Mother Nature and milk markets have cooperated with local farmers - a welcome blessing. While we cannot control the weather, we must take steps now to help farmers prepare for the next downturn. My budget funds farm sustainability programs like Buy Local, Farm to School and the Vermont Seal of Quality and I have included $300,000 for additional renewable energy grants to help farmers become energy independent.
\
Another program important to both farmers and the environment is our Clean and Clear Action Plan, a partnership among the Agency of Natural Resources, the Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets and private stakeholders. Clean and Clear is providing strong on-going efforts to reduce non-point source phosphorus pollution in Vermont's waterways. The proposed funding for fiscal year 2009 includes over $9 million in state funds and capital investments to support this important work.
\
***
\
Last year, I presented my Road to Affordability plan to focus transportation priorities on the preservation and safety of existing roads, bridges and culverts. I am grateful that the Legislature supported this approach and we have already made progress on the pressing transportation needs of our state. Investment in maintenance pays dividends for years to come; a dollar we spend today on the repair or rehabilitation of a bridge or culvert can save as much as ten dollars for a full replacement. It is an approach that just makes sense.
\
This budget reflects my commitment to a limited number of major projects including the Bennington Bypass, Circumferential Highway, Morrisville Bypass and the Brandon-Pittsford Route 7 reconstruction. Setting realistic timetables for these and other large roadway projects will allow funding a 47 percent, $7.6 million increase for maintenance activities including culvert and bridge work, ditching, and ledge and slope repairs. This constitutes a 160 percent funding increase in these critical areas since fiscal year 2007.
\
I also propose to reduce the raid on the transportation fund by an additional $1.1 million. I am pleased to report that since I first came to office we have reduced by $8 million the diversion of transportation funding to non-transportation related programs, and I remain committed to further reductions in future budget years. My budget also includes the use of more than $4.6 million in bonding authority to help address transportation needs.
\
With gasoline over $3.00 per gallon, we cannot ask Vermonters to pay a higher gas tax for roads and bridges. Instead, we must ensure that we are spending the entire $424 million annual transportation budget as effectively as possible. VTrans is taking steps to deliver projects on time and on budget, cut administrative costs, and save millions by curtailing unnecessary project amenities. We will use the money saved by these efforts to reinvest in bridge, culvert and paving projects.
\
***
\
Keeping communities safe will continue to be a top priority and I propose we add $2.8 million to the public safety budget. I have asked that a portion of this money be used to sustain drug enforcement efforts required to reduce drug-related violent crime, and I propose to provide an additional $150,000 to programs to prevent domestic and sexual violence.
\
I also recommend increasing funding for the DETER program by $600,000. A quarter-million dollars of this appropriation will fund opiate treatment; another quarter-million will support three sites that integrate substance abuse and mental health services; $50,000 will fund our 10th recovery center; and $50,000 will allow us to open a new adolescent treatment site. Since launching DETER in 2003, we have invested nearly $28 million to combat substance abuse in our state.
\
***
\
The cost of running Vermont's corrections system has been growing at double digits over the past decade. In the last several years, we have taken steps to address increasing demands and reduce costs through a series of reforms, including the Incarcerated Women's Initiative, expansion of transitional housing and residential drug treatment, and piloted use of electronic monitoring. As a result, the fiscal year 2009 corrections budget increase will be less than in previous years.
\
Despite this progress, and the predicted slowing of Vermont's prison population growth rate, we must expand our efforts. If unaddressed, corrections spending will continue to place an unsustainable burden on our budgets and divert resources from other valuable programs.
\
Currently, all three branches of state government are rethinking policies and evaluating options to reduce these expenses in a way that protects community safety while freeing up resources for promising initiatives. I want to commend the Senior Senator from Bennington County and other legislators for offering thoughtful and innovative approaches to addressing the budget challenges in corrections. It is never easy being first out of the blocks with an idea, but their proposals are precisely the kind of new thinking Vermont needs as we strive to maximize state resources.
\
***
\
As we begin to shape a budget for the next fiscal year, the economic uncertainty facing our nation gives us little margin for error. There are no easy answers.
\
We are required to innovate government services, and make tough choices among a multitude of good programs. We must prioritize today's needs with compassion and pass initiatives that will strengthen Vermont's economy today and for future generations. This budget does just that.
\
Five years ago, because we acted quickly and worked together, Vermont not only weathered the economic slowdown, but also emerged from it stronger and more prosperous. Today, I offer a budget that sets a clear course through today's unrest. Many of the decisions we make will be difficult, but our state will emerge stronger than ever.
\
Crafting a budget that is compassionate and balanced requires a partnership among officials that puts progress first-we're all in this together. By keeping an eye on the future and the bottom line, our budget can protect the most vulnerable, invest in immediate economic growth and ensure the prosperity and peace of mind of future generations.
\
Thank you, and may God bless the great state of Vermont.

214,"VtDigger\Montpelier — The Public Service Board has finalized new rules that it says are meant in part to slow the pace of solar development under the popular electricity net metering program.\The changes could make the program less lucrative for small-scale producers and largely might prevent the use of undeveloped land for larger installations that employ the program, for which projects larger than 500 kilowatts aren’t eligible.\Regulators, environmental advocates and some solar developers greeted the changes with measured approval this week, citing several last-minute revisions the board made in response to public comments.\Net metering allows electricity customers to receive payment from utilities for renewable energy they generate in excess of what they use.\ \The program has paid a much higher rate than what wholesale electricity generators receive. That has led to tremendous success in putting new renewable generation on the ground in Vermont, the board said in its order making the revisions.\ \The new rules will pay significantly less to producers of new small-scale (up to 500 kilowatts) renewable energy projects than what’s earned by those built under current rules. And the program will be open largely to developers willing to build on landfills, rooftops, gravel pits and other previously disturbed locations rather than open land.\The PSB released its final draft of the revised rules about six months after a deadline set by legislators who hoped to review them during this year’s session, but repeated public vetting and revisions made in response pushed the board past its deadline. Officials at the Department of Public Service said it was worth the wait.\“I admire the board’s diligence on this project,” Deputy Commissioner Jon Copans said. “They had significant challenges in crafting this rule. In my mind this continues and builds upon what’s been an enormously successful net metering program and incorporates important and significant changes I think will serve Vermonters well.” \One major positive change, said Copans, involves the preference given to development in what is known as built environments such as landfills, rooftops, brownfields and unused gravel pits.\The rules allow projects of up to 500 kilowatts — the largest the program supports — in such preferred locations. Net metering will not, however, remain an option for developers who wish to build projects larger than 150 kilowatts outside preferred locations.\An acre of solar panels can produce roughly 150 kilowatts under normal conditions.\Developers, businesses and homeowners who build projects in preferred locations will receive higher rates than those who build on undisturbed land for the electricity they sell back to their utility. Copans said this appears to have already stoked interest among solar developers.\“People are out there now looking for old landfills and brownfields to do these projects,” Copans said.\Some solar developers say they’re pleased with the revisions, which will take effect Jan. 1.\“I think this new program strikes a really fair balance for customers across Vermont — whether they’re businesses or homeowners — who want to go solar,” said James Moore, co-founder and co-president of SunCommon.\The revised rules will let existing net-metering customers continue to pay monthly service fees with credit for their excess generation. New net-metering customers will be able to use the credits only to offset electricity use, not the capital or other expenses that utilities fund with monthly customer fees.\“They’ve honored the deal that Vermonters who’ve gone solar in the past were counting on,” Moore said. “It’s important that state policymakers don’t pull the rug out from Vermonters who have invested in our clean energy future.”\Because the program disallows larger (150-kW to 500-kW) projects outside preferred locations, Moore said, it could have a disproportional effect on solar development companies that specialize in that scale.\That provision might also limit the ability of schools or municipalities to build solar generators appropriate to their needs, he said.\The revised program “really prioritizes small solar,” which forms the backbone of his company’s business, Moore said.\The state’s biggest utility said it likes the revisions.\“We think it’s good,” said Kristin Carlson, spokeswoman for Green Mountain Power. “We’ve always been supportive of net metering and of empowering customers to generate and use their own electricity.”\Cheaper net metering could reduce the cost of energy, as it’s currently among the most costly energy sources available to Vermont utilities.\The program as described in the board’s order appears to encourage further net-metered development, Carlson said.\A representative of the Vermont Public Interest Research Group said the new rules incorporate important and recent changes made in response to comments from the public.\Ben Walsh, the group’s climate and energy program director, said those include the provision preserving current net-metering customers’ option to pay off their entire bill using credits.\A previous draft of the rules drew vociferous opposition.\“The board clearly heard the concerns of Vermont consumers and made the program substantially better than the last draft,” Walsh said.\Although he expressed concern that the changes may slow solar development somewhat and make it difficult for municipalities and other large consumers, he called the revised program “definitely a step in the right direction.”\“In looking at what the board did with the new draft, it clearly indicates they’re listening to what Vermonters are telling them about solar energy,” Walsh said.\The program was established by Act 99, passed in 2014, and that legislation called for the Public Service Board to complete its revisions in time for legislators to review them while still in session. This year’s session ended in May. Copans said he also hoped for faster rulemaking but that the board was right to take its time.\“Sometimes getting things done quickly comes at the expense of allowing full public engagement and vetting,” Copans said.\CREDIT: By Mike Polhamus"
215,"
Solar developers want to expand the state's net metering program this year to make larger solar arrays eligible for incentive rates utilities pay customers. The program is designed to encourage the construction of small-scale renewable energy projects.
\
The net metering program allows electric customers to own solar panels and sell power they don't use back to their utility at a fixed price. But the law limits the size of net-metered projects to 500 kilowatts and prohibits the grouping of these installations into so-called solar parks.
\
Developers pitched a plan to the Senate Finance Committee last week that would allow 500-kilowatt arrays to be grouped together. They say this would help large customers, like businesses and schools, generate their own electricity.
\
But the state's two largest utilities, Green Mountain Power and Vermont Electric Coop, say the policy proposal spearheaded by two solar developers may require utilities to pay more for solar power than they would under an existing competitive bidding program known as standard offer. They also say the incentive price under the net metering program is designed to encourage smaller renewable energy projects.
\
""For us, we're going to look at what is the most cost-effective project we can do for customers. And the way the law is now is to benefit individuals,"" said Kristin Carlson, a spokesperson for Green Mountain Power, the utility that serves North Springfield.
\
Winstanley Enterprises of North Springfield and Green Lantern Development of Waterbury want to build a 500-kilowatt solar array at an industrial site in North Springfield. They plan to build more projects at this site that add up to a 2.5-kilowatt solar park. But current net metering law forbids any additional projects in ""close proximity.""
\
Luke Shullenberger, a managing partner of Green Lantern Group, said the project concept is designed to serve larger customers like municipalities, universities, schools and hospitals who want to generate their own electricity.
\
""They want to participate in these kind[s] of programs and projects, but they need larger projects,"" Shullenberger said.
\
He is also looking at two to three other sites across the state with a similar concept in mind.
\
But utilities say they can purchase this amount of power at a lower cost through the state's standard offer program where developers compete to build projects at the lowest price. The latest bid for a solar project came in around 11 cents per kilowatt-hour. Utilities pay 19 to 20 cents for net-metered electricity.
\
Dave Hallquist, CEO for Vermont Electric Cooperative, said the proposal would increase the cost of solar for customers.
\
""It's a huge windfall they're making,"" Hallquist said. ""Let the free market determine the rate of those larger projects. You're creating an incentive to do things at the lower cost.""
\
But Shullenberger said the proposal would not affect overall electric rates. He said state law caps the amount of net-metered electricity utilities can purchase. The current cap is set at 15 percent of a utility's peak load.
\
""The simple math says whether the projects are sprinkled around Vermont or clustered together, the net impact to the ratepayers [is] the same. So why should there be a strong concern from the utilities about the impact to ratepayers?""
\
But Hallquist said this will prevent individuals from installing rooftop solar because the larger projects would fill up limits on how much net-metered electricity utilities can purchase.
\
""These larger projects take away from the ability for folks to do rooftop solar,"" he said.
\
Gabrielle Stebbins, executive director of Renewable Energy Vermont, based in Montpelier, said the program should not be confined by ""arbitrary bookends.""
\
""I actually think given the scope and the scale of how much energy we need, we need to be focused on more people,"" she said.
\
Darren Springer, deputy commissioner of the Department of Public Service, which represents ratepayers, said it remains unclear whether there would be any significant cost savings from the proposal. However, he supports the concept of grouping net-metered projects together in order to serve larger entities like businesses.
\
""The definition that prevents co-location doesn't seem to me to be necessary in that type of environment. But the key part for us is if we're going to have something of that scale, there ought to be a cost reduction associated with it for ratepayers,"" Springer said.
\
Springer said the department pitched a proposal to lawmakers to co-locate multiple net-metered projects in a solar park, and to reduce the credit utilities pay customers based on the savings generated from economies of scale. However, he said his proposal would kick in by 2017, when the state's proposed renewable energy program, RESET, and a new net metering program are scheduled to take effect.
\
But Shullenberger and others say they want to change the law so projects can be built before the uncertain reauthorization of the federal solar tax credit in 2017.
\
Rep. Tony Klein, D-East Montpelier, chair of the House Committee on Natural Resources and Energy, did not have a position on the proposal. But he said he has initial concerns about using the net metering program to build 2.5 megawatt projects, like the one in North Springfield.
\
""That's a lot, and I'm not sure that that's what the net metering program was about,"" Klein said. ""That's why we have a standard offer program.""
\
Grouping the arrays together in an industrial park will also address a concern over the visual impact of solar arrays, according to Shullenberger.

216,"To the Valley News\Communities across New Hampshire are working on creating energy efficiencies and developing renewable energy options in support of the state’s Climate Action Plan. Such initiatives reduce energy costs, create economic opportunity and protect the environment.\Net metering is one of the tools that enable municipalities to achieve these goals. \On Wednesday or Thursday, the Legislature will decide whether to override a number of bills vetoed by Gov. Chris Sununu. One of these is HB 365, the bill that received bipartisan support to increase the net metering cap to 5 megawatts, from 1 MW, for renewable power generators. A recent tour of a hydroelectric plant in Claremont and a discussion with a representative of a local business have given me new insight into how increasing the net metering cap will benefit communities.\Over 60 small hydroelectric plants, each capable of generating 5 MW or less of renewable energy, exist in more than 40 communities across New Hampshire. Three of these facilities are located in Claremont and, until recently, one of them had been offline since 2011. A couple of years ago, Bob King, one of the new owners of the plant, presented a proposal to the City Council to get the facility back online. Given the condition of the hydroelectric plant, it was a challenging prospect at best.\However, King and his two partners persevered and the Claremont community has benefited from their achievement. Not only has the city regained one of its assets along the Sugar River, but it has also acquired new revenue resulting from a negotiated 10-year, payments-in-lieu-of-taxes contract. \Because the plant is licensed to generate more than 1 MW, the net metering cap currently in place limits the benefit of the plant’s operating capacity. In addition, it also limits the financial return to the city as the pilot payments are based on a percentage of the annual gross revenue.\On the same tour, I had the opportunity to speak with a local businessman who spoke of his company’s effort to lower electricity costs. To achieve that objective, the company built a biomass facility and a solar array to provide some of the energy needed to run its sawmill. \In accordance with the current net metering cap, the company designed the solar array to generate no more than 1 MW, which was not sufficient for the sawmill. Had the cap been at 5 MW, the company could have built a larger array, capable of producing enough power for the mill and all of its stores. This would have generated more savings in overhead costs that could have been passed onto the customer or further invested in the company and its employees.\Fostering the development of net metered, renewable energy projects producing 5 MW or less aligns with both state and local goals. In Claremont, not only does it support the state’s Climate Action Plan, but it also supports the goals outlined in the energy chapter of our city’s Master Plan. We are working to promote local, sustainable energy production, develop energy efficiencies and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We have installed solar arrays to lower municipal energy costs and supported the redevelopment of a long-neglected hydroelectric plant. However, we need to do more if we are to be successful in achieving these goals.\Increasing the net metering cap is a valuable tool in this pursuit. Both the House and Senate recognized this when they voted in bipartisan fashion in favor of this bill. \In considering whether to sustain or override the governor’s veto of HB 365, I hope legislators consider the impact to communities at the local level.\Charlene Lovett is the mayor of the city of Claremont.\CREDIT: By CHARLENE LOVETT "
217,"To the Valley News\We have taken important strides in protecting our environment since the first Earth Day on April 22, 1970. But in order to protect the scenic views and beautiful natural resources that drive our economy and define us as a place and a people, we must take further action. And we must do it quickly.\Our state’s remarkable natural beauty and resources are already being affected by climate change. Last year, the National Climate Assessment report reinforced what has long been clear: Human activity is the driving force behind our changing climate — and as a result the United States is experiencing more extreme weather events, including dangerous heat, heavier rainfall and more flooding, and larger wildfires.\We’ve seen those effects directly in New Hampshire. This winter in particular we saw our state get pummeled with nor’easter after nor’easter. We are certainly not afraid of a little snow in the Granite State, but this was not normal.\Many people in New Hampshire are concerned about what these stronger and more frequent storms will mean for their families, their homes and their businesses — and are doing great work to be proactive and address these challenges head on. We must help each other adapt to these changes, focusing, for example, on efforts like coastal resiliency to help vulnerable communities prepare by improving our infrastructure, and also by developing resilience strategies to help plan ahead of storms and extreme weather events.\As your senator, I am focused on doing everything I can to protect our environment and curb the devastating impacts of climate change. I have fought to fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which ensures that we are safeguarding our natural resources and protecting them for future generations. I am also working to create a national study on net metering, which would highlight how net metering can be successful across our country by allowing our clean energy industry to grow and thrive. And I am standing firm against the consistent efforts of the Trump administration to roll back our environmental protections.\It is deeply concerning that President Trump has been focused on an anti-environment agenda that denies climate change and prioritizes Big Oil companies over the protection of our environment.\Last year, the president recklessly withdrew the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement, refusing to listen to the informed opinions of environmental and business leaders. As a result, our country is the only nation in the world that does not support this critical agreement.\Leading the dangerous charge for the Trump administration, of course, is EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt. Under Pruitt’s direction, the EPA has rolled back several clean air and clean water protections, and is working to dismantle the Clean Power Plan, which is critical to reducing our dependence on fossil fuels.\While Pruitt has pursued an anti-environment agenda, recent reports have also documented how he has grossly misused taxpayer dollars and has sought special treatment for himself. The American people deserve better, which is why I joined my colleagues in sponsoring a Senate resolution that formally calls for his resignation.\In addition to reversing environmental protections at the EPA, the administration is taking further steps that pose extreme risks to our environment. This includes the irresponsible plan to open up 90 percent of our nation’s coastal waters — including our Seacoast region — to the dangers of offshore drilling.\Granite Staters and people across the nation are calling for action to protect our environment. The actions that this Administration has taken to dismantle critical environmental protections, which exacerbate our climate and environmental challenges, ignore these calls. They are dangerous and irresponsible.\This Earth Day, we must all recommit to staying vigilant against efforts to roll back environmental protections, and to working each day to take proactive steps to protect our treasured earth, air, water, and forests.\We have a moral obligation to our children and grandchildren to leave behind a clean environment. I am going to continue working to preserve New Hampshire’s natural resources and ensure that future generations can thrive.\Maggie Hassan represents New Hampshire in the U.S. Senate.\CREDIT: Maggie Hassan "
218,"VtDigger\MONTPELIER — Vermont officials want to restructure the way solar power producers are reimbursed for their electricity, saying the existing system rewards the wealthy and burdens most ratepayers unfairly.\Net metering, a system that pays corporations and individuals more for their renewable power than the retail cost, has triggered a burst of solar installations in Vermont, from almost nothing in the early 2000s to more than 300 megawatts today — enough to power roughly 60,000 homes.\The number of new net metered solar installations has leveled off over the past two years, but Vermont has some of the highest numbers of small-scale power generation compared to electricity usage in the country.\Nationally, Vermont is ranked 25th for total amount of solar installed in-state.\Despite the drive to have more renewably sourced energy and reduce the use of fossil fuels, the state Department of Public Service thinks the payment Vermonters can now receive for installing residential solar should be cut almost in half, largely to prevent cost shifting to other ratepayers.\A system of ‘above-market rates’\The Vermont Public Utility Commission, the three-member quasi-judicial panel that regulates utilities, opened a formal review in March of the net metering rule, seeking to streamline its approval process and clarify previous rule changes.\Net metering — enshrined by the Legislature in 1998 — allows homeowners and businesses who install up to 500 kilowatts of renewable energy to offset the electricity they use with the power they produce and, if there is extra, get paid for power going back to the grid.\The vast majority of net metering projects in Vermont have been solar.\Proponents say net metering has promoted the construction of in-state solar generation, helping meet the state’s emissions reduction goals, reduce peak demand and support a thriving clean energy economy.\Vermont utilities are subject to a renewable energy standard, which requires utilities to procure 75% of their electric sales from renewable sources by 2032, with 10% of that coming from in-state, small-scale generation.\Lawmakers are considering bumping the renewable energy standard up to 100% while increasing the amount of in-state generation utilities must procure.\But critics of Vermont’s net metering system say it disproportionately burdens regular ratepayers while rewarding the wealthy and large corporations such as the Killington resort. The state’s largest ski area, owned by the Utah-based POWDR, generates solar energy on its rooftops and in fields in Addison County and sells it back to the electric utility at higher-than-market rates.\Vermonters for a Clean Environment, a small Danby, Vt.-based nonprofit run by activist Annette Smith, said in a PUC filing that large arrays that do not serve local customers benefit “wealthy investors with high passive income” seeking to take advantage of tax credits.\“This rarely disclosed practice is enriching the wealthy at the expense of ratepayers who are paying the above-market rates given to net-metered projects,” it wrote. \In 2011, Vermont passed a law setting net metering compensation at 19 to 20 cents per kWh depending on the size of the system. After a few subsequent reductions, net metering compensation for new systems dropped to around 14 cents to 18 cents this July.\Last year, the average cost for wholesale electricity purchased from grid operator ISO New England was between 4 and 5 cents per kWh.\The Department of Public Service thinks the significantly higher payment for net metering is no longer needed.\Cost shifting to ratepayers\Adjusting the system will be a long and complex task.\While the PUC initially focused its proposed changes on streamlining the approval process and clarifying what a “preferred site” means for solar developers, the commission decided this summer to also review how net metering is compensated. One of the goals of the net metering statute is that the program not “shift costs” to non-net metering customers.\In August, the PUC asked utilities, solar companies, state agencies and other interested parties to answer specific questions about costs and benefits of net metering and criteria for assessing preferred sites. Comments were filed this month by electric utilities, multiple solar companies, trade group Renewable Energy Vermont and nonprofit Vermonters for a Clean Environment.\Washington Electric Cooperative, which serves 11,460 customers in rural north-central Vermont, estimated that net metering cost non-participants $798,508 in 2019. The state’s largest electric utility, Green Mountain Power, estimated that the 263,515 MWh of net metering generation installed in its customer territory will lead to $33 million in cost shifting in 2020 — equivalent to 5% of its total annual cost of serving customers.\In testimony, the Vermont Electric Cooperative estimated that the existing compensation rate will cost it about $2.5 million more than the power is valued. That difference is expected to be $2.3 million in 2020.\However, Norwich Solar Technologies, a commercial and municipal solar developer, takes issue with utilities’ claims that net metering is costing customers, noting in a filing with the PUC that Green Mountain Power’s power supply costs have actually decreased by $33 million in the past six years, factoring in bill credits for net metering customers.\Both utilities and state officials say there’s now an unfair cost shift associated with net metering. By analyzing the number of residential net-metered solar arrays per household in towns around the state, the state determined that residents of higher-income towns are more likely to have solar panels than those in lower-income communities.\“This inequitable distribution of the benefits of net metering makes the cost shift to non-participating customers more problematic,” the department said in a Nov. 1 filing.\In that filing, the Public Service Department proposes allowing net metering customers to net out their consumption and generation on a monthly, not annual, basis. Excess generation fed onto the grid would be compensated through a bill credit at a 10-year price of $0.09 per kWh.\The department says that the “current compensation structure encourages significant over-generation” during the summer, when wholesale electricity in New England is relatively cheap and clean.\Solar growth levels off\Since 2012, Vermont’s solar generation has expanded dramatically, with much of the growth coming from net metering, according to installation data reported by utilities to grid operator ISO New England. \In 2010, Vermont had a total of 5.06 MW of net metered solar installed; in 2018, that figure had increased to 196.21 MW.\That expansion has created an industry of solar companies like SunCommon and Encore Renewable Energy, which have grown rapidly in recent years by installing solar arrays. The Waterbury, Vt.-based SunCommon, Vermont’s largest solar installer, has 160 employees and is expanding geographically, recently acquiring a business in Rhinebeck, N.Y.\State officials want to move carefully, mindful they could damage a fast-growing industry that employs an estimated 6,000 people in Vermont.\“We do have concerns about just changing the structure entirely and essentially putting thousands of people out of work,” McNamara said. “Those are good jobs, so the department is definitely concerned about a very abrupt change that would have pretty significant impacts.”\Starting in 2017, the amount of new metering solar capacity installed started to level off and 2018 saw the first decline in the history of the Vermont program.\SunCommon has seen its own Vermont business level off, though it’s still seeing growth at its outpost in New York state, said co-founder James Moore.\The PUC, at the direction of the Legislature, significantly overhauled net metering in 2017, in part to slow down solar development in the state. \One of the major changes was that systems larger than 150 kW must be built on “preferred sites” — such as landfills, gravel pits, quarries, brownfields and parking lot canopies.\That change and a slight decline in net metering compensation last year contributed to the recent decline in annual installed solar capacity, according to solar developers and the state. \Moore said SunCommon supports the reduction of the net metering benefit.\“I actually think that’s good and appropriate,” he said. \Reducing power costs for everyone, he said, will ultimately promote more environmentally sustainable choices. \Decline of community solar\One sector of net metering that has been particularly hard hit by rule changes in the past couple of years: community solar.\Around five years ago, some solar companies in Vermont started developing group net metering projects that allow Vermonters who rent apartments or have unsuitable properties for solar to pay into a remote solar array and receive credit on electric bills.\A 2018 report from Vermont Law School described community solar as an “important avenue for participation” in solar projects for low- and moderate-income Vermonters.\“Both the lower cost and the ability to buy fewer panels help make community solar more accessible to low-income individuals so they can reduce their electricity bills and reduce their carbon emissions,” the report said.\Moore, of SunCommon, said the company started offering community solar in 2014 and had around 700 participating households. But changes to the net metering rule and increased permitting costs have stopped SunCommon from pursuing new community solar projects in Vermont.\One major change disallowed solar arrays over 150 kW on farm fields unless the landowner was using more than half of the electricity generated. And last year, Dummerston, Vt.-based community solar firm Soveren Solar closed up shop.\“True residential community solar was kind of collateral damage when the PUC made changes to Vermont’s net metering program a couple years ago,” Moore said, whereas “really big arrays that had a single participant like a town or a big business could still move forward because they had a different economy of scale.”\Some Vermont solar companies are still developing larger net metered solar projects for businesses, municipalities and school districts. Last year, lawmakers passed a law, Act 81, that raised the cap of net metering projects for schools from 500 kW to one megawatt.\But virtual solar projects for businesses and other entities have taken a hit as well, developers say. \Gregg Beldock, CEO of Bullrock Corp., has developed over 30 MW of solar projects in Vermont, mostly for commercial clients. He used to employ hundreds of people in Vermont; now, due to declining reimbursements and other rule changes, he has moved almost all of his solar development over to New York.\“If you have high rates on day one … and then you change those rates and you don’t expand the size of the project you can build, you limit the size of the project, you’ve now created a reverse economy of scale,” he said, adding later, “Putting individual solar on everyone’s households, it’s a nice ethos … but it’s not an efficient way to become renewable.”\Beldock also thinks regulators erred in capping the total amount of net metered solar a single entity like a hospital or business could obtain.\Is net metering necessary?\While Vermont has a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, they have actually been rising in recent years. \Solar developers say net metering is crucial to curbing emissions.\Williston, Vt.-based AllEarth Renewables said in a PUC filing that a “truly electrified, renewable energy-powered economy will require a vast increase in electric demand and the generating facilities needed to meet that demand.”\But electricity only accounts for 10% of the state’s greenhouse gas emissions — far below the national average of 28%. \The bulk of the state’s emissions — almost 70% — comes from transportation and heating. In a rural state with long winters, lowering emissions from those sectors has proven difficult. Agriculture, meanwhile, contributes to 11% of the state’s emissions.\The Department of Public Service argues the higher cost of net metering actually holds Vermont back from meeting climate goals, which hinge on switching from fossil fuel-powered vehicles and heat to electric alternatives.\“Given that customers are much more likely to switch to electric technologies if the economics favor this decision, the cost of electricity will have a significant impact on the pace of electrification,” the department said in its Nov. 1 filing.\Yet Vermont does need more in-state renewable generation to meet requirements of the renewable energy standard — a lot of it.\As of the end of last year, Vermont had 306.30 MW of solar installed, according to grid operator ISO New England. If utilities were to meet their in-state renewable requirements, that would require 345 MW of additional in-state energy generation to be installed by 2032, according to state regulators.\There is no requirement what the mix of renewables must be to comply with the requirement. \“We fully expect that net metering would be a component going forward,” said McNamara, of Public Service Department.\Utilities have started to partner with developers to build their own solar projects, in part to meet the renewable energy standard. \While new net metering installations have declined in recent years, 2018 saw the largest amount of solar installed by utilities to date, according to a report from the Solar Energy Industries Association.\In the past few years, Green Mountain Power has built multi-megawatt solar arrays paired with battery storage in the Vermont communities of Essex, Ferrisburgh, Milton, Panton and Rutland, which it says saves customers money by allowing the utility to draw on stored energy during summer peaks. \And Vermont Public Power Supply Authority has been working with its member municipal utilities to build solar in their customers territories, said Ken Nolan, the authority’s general manager, in an interview this summer.\“They’re under great pressure to build these projects to avoid the future impact because the renewable energy standard standards, they start out fairly low … but it ramps up quickly,” he said.\What’s next?\State Rep. Sarah Copeland-Hanzas, D-Bradford, said in an interview in September that the Statehouse’s Climate Solutions Caucus will introduce a bill next session to require utilities to procure 100% of their electricity from renewable sources, with a greater share coming from in-state generation. As it stands, electric utilities meet a large portion of the renewable requirement through buying out-of-state renewable energy credits.\And while he supports continued reduction in compensation rates for distributed electricity generation, Moore, of SunCommon, said he hopes to see Gov. Phil Scott’s administration reduce the permitting hurdles that have been put in place for larger renewable systems.\CREDIT: By ELIZABETH GRIBKOFF; ANNE WALLACE ALLEN "
219,"
The solar industry in Massachusetts is bursting its caps, which are artificial restraints advocated by those with an interest in keeping the green power industry from thriving. Beacon Hill must act to allow solar to shine more brightly.
\
According to a report by the Environment Massachusetts Research and Policy Center, net metering is not only triggering greater use of solar energy but increases the effectiveness of the power grid as well. (Eagle, June 30). Net metering refers to the process by which solar power is sold to the grid at the retail rate, which is part of the financial formula to promote the growth of solar.
\
The amount of net-metered commercial solar power that can be produced is capped, however, to appease the fossil fuel industry and its advocates. As a result, the continued growth of the solar industry, so important to the Berkshires and the state as a whole, has been all but stopped. Solar energy advocates packed a House-Senate public hearing in Boston two weeks ago to testify to the injurious impact of the net metering caps.
\
The Research Policy Center report, which is based on analyses of the costs and benefits of solar power, and entitled ""Shining Rewards: The Value of Rooftop Solar Power for Consumers and Society,"" makes a strong case for easing or lifting the restraints on solar. Its conclusion that solar delivers greater benefits than it receives through net metering argues that caps should be lifted to reduce the cost of energy and the pollution caused by fossil fuels. The report also notes that increased solar power will lessen the need for power plants and power lines, whose considerable construction and installation costs are passed down to consumers by utilities.
\
There are complaints that the solar industry is too heavily subsidized, but clean energy programs are subsidized worldwide, given their benefits, to encourage their development, and it is not as if the fossil fuel industry doesn't get economic breaks from government. The solar industry, thriving in the Berkshires until stymied by caps is of critical economic and environmental importance, and it has to be allowed to keep moving forward with a lifting, or at least an easing, of net metering caps.

BRATTLEBORO -- The Vermont House passed a comprehensive energy bill earlier this week, calling for a greater reliance on clean energy and a larger role for net-metering.
\
In a 132 to 4 vote, House members approved House Bill No. 56 after the House Natural Resources and Energy Committee took up the annual energy measure in early February. Portions of the original legislation were eliminated, such as the establishment of a Renewable Energy Investment (REI-Vermont) program for plants in the state to be owned and operated by the retail electric utilities if they produce greater than 2.2 megawatts.
\
But the committee kept the section that doubles the net-metering system, a generation facility for electricity, capacity from 250 kilowatts to 500 kW. Furthermore, it alters language to ensure a net-metering group can receive fees broken into individual bills as opposed to one large customer tab.
\
The legislation also sets a statute for solar net-metering systems of 5 kW or less while lifting the cap on smaller renewable projects. Advocates said if passed, the Vermont Public Service Board could extend possible funding for existing facilities, such as hydroelectric or biomass plants.
\
Sarah Edwards, a Progressive/Democrat from Brattleboro and member of the energy committee, said the most important thing about the bill is that it helps keep up the momentum in developing renewable energy.
\
""It's going to expand the opportunities for small renewable energy projects by expanding net-metering. It's going to raise the cap, which has been stagnant for a number of years, from 2 percent to 4 percent of a utility's peak demand,"" she said.
\
Fellow energy committee member, Vernon Republican Michael Hebert, was one of the four lawmakers to oppose the legislation. He said there were good parts in the measure, but his concerns with cost-shifting and the lack of review on baseload sources prevented
\
him from supporting it.
\
""The part that I didn't like the most was the net-metering portion. I don't mind when people put in alternative energy sources or renewable energy sources to get a credit if they generate more power than they are using. My problem is when they get a credit and the other ratepayers have to pay for that credit,"" Hebert said. ""I just couldn't put more of that (cost) onto the ratepayers.""
\
More legislators would likely have joined Hebert in opposition if a controversial measure to enact a 55-cent charge on monthly electric bills was kept in the language.
\
The charge was initially set up to support the Clean Energy Development Fund (under which Entergy Vermont Yankee currently makes the sole payments on) and raise $2.4 million to support its continuing efforts. Amendments to alter the charge to exempt low-income Vermonters stalled on Tuesday, eventually leading to a tiff on the House floor.
\
Gov. Peter Shumlin removed the potential charge, but not before angering quite a few in Montpelier, including Burlington Republican Kurt Wright, who said Shumlin ""totally disrespected"" the work of the committees in the process.
\
Rep. Oliver Olsen, R-Jamaica, said it was unfortunate the governor chose to undermine the fragile compromise lawmakers reached on the measure.
\
""The governor has gutted the funding mechanism for the Clean Energy Development Fund, without offering any alternatives. His actions are irresponsible, and have endangered continued investment in Vermont's renewable energy future,"" Olsen said. ""The most unfortunate consequence is that, once again, Windham County will lose out on critical incentives for renewable energy. Last year, Windham County only received $9,300 worth of solar tax credits from an available pool of $7.5 million from the Clean Energy Development Fund.""
\
By removing the 55 cent charge, Edwards said they will have to find another potential funding source for the energy fund. ""There are so many jobs that came out of the past several years with that fund, it really jump-started the industry,"" she said. ""I think we're just going back to the drawing board on it. And we will have to come up with something ... we thought long and hard about this and I'm personally open to a different strategy. I look forward to hearing what the governor's plan is.""
\
Windham County Democrats hailed the legislation as a a critical step for enhancing Vermont's energy future.
\
""The Clean Energy bill of 2011 advances the work we have done for several years to increase the amount of greener, renewable energy produced in Vermont and promote Vermont's energy independence,"" said Rep. Carolyn Partridge, D-Windham.
\
Rep. David Deen, D-Westminster, said beyond the controversy surrounding the surcharge, it is important to remember the bill takes Vermont one step closer to energy independence. This legislation aids in relying on renewable and sustainable energy sources instead of using imported oil for our home heating and gasoline, Deen said.
\
""It also means that with less energy produced from oil, we will be generating less carbon discharges lessening our carbon footprint,"" he added. ""Clearly, a forward-thinking piece of legislation that we should all support. Now it is off to the Senate for their action.""
\
Brattleboro Democrat Valerie Stuart called the measure bold step in a positive direction to protect the environment while also creating jobs for Vermonters. The bill now heads to the Senate for consideration.

In the Committees

NEWFANE -- Four months can make a big difference.
\
Voters from Newfane and Brookline on Thursday night gave overwhelming approval for development of a solar array at NewBrook Elementary, and they also approved spending up to $330,000 on a sophisticated new ""air-to-air"" heating and cooling system at the school.
\
In June, residents had voted against the solar project and approved -- but then asked for reconsideration of -- the HVAC upgrade.
\
Officials say the differences this time included a modified solar proposal; more information in advance of the vote; and more participation from a crowd that packed the NewBrook gym to capacity. School board President Ken McFadden noted the number of parents he saw in the audience Thursday.
\
""That makes a big difference, because it impacts their families directly,"" McFadden said.
\
The NewBrook board and a volunteer Energy Committee, along with school administrators, had been pursuing the two projects as a way to cut energy costs, decrease reliance on fossil fuels and upgrade the building's inconsistent, unreliable HVAC system.
\
The first article asked voters for permission to ""enter into a solar net metering credit purchase agreement for up to 20 years with a qualified entity selected through a competitive bidding process that will finance, install, operate, maintain and assume liability for a photovoltaic system on school property that will guarantee annual energy savings while meeting the school's energy needs.""
\
The big change for Thursday's vote is that the proposed system required no financial commitment from the school. The developer would assume all construction and maintenance costs while also taking advantage of tax benefits associated with solar arrays.
\
Officials touted the fact that there would be financial benefits for NewBrook including reduced electricity costs -- generally a reduction of 10 to 15 percent for such arrangements -- as well as revenue from leasing land to a solar developer.
\
Also, ""a monetary benefit for any unused electricity generated will be included on our electric bill,"" officials wrote in an informational handout distributed Thursday. ""We will have up to one year to use that credit against actual consumption.""
\
There had been informational meetings last week and again on Thursday. So when the voting meeting began at 7 p.m., a majority of those in a standing-room-only crowd loudly and quickly put an end to debate.
\
A paper ballot ensued, and the voting alone took roughly 40 minutes due to the number of people at the meeting. When votes finally were tallied, the count was 195 in favor of the solar project and 96 against.
\
The total vote of 291 was nearly three times the number of ballots that had been cast for the solar article in June.
\
The meeting's second article asked for approval to ""install a new heating ventilation air conditioning air-to-air heat-exchanger system to replace the current obsolete system.""
\
While the school still would need boilers to serve as a backup on winter's coldest days, advocates said the electric-powered air-to-air system would slash costs by making NewBrook much less reliant on fossil fuels.
\
The original article -- which had to be warned in the exact same way Thursday because it was being reconsidered -- said the HVAC project would be financed via a $150,000 municipal loan repaid over five years. That number has been changed to $330,000 due to newer cost estimates.
\
""We may not need to borrow as much as $330,000,"" said Kim Friedman, who chairs the NewBrook Energy Committee. ""It could come in lower than that.""
\
Voters on Thursday night agreed to amend the cost to $330,000, and there also was debate about the repayment terms. Some in the crowd wanted a 20-year financing period, saying it would lessen the tax impact of the project.
\
Even with savings from the solar array factored in, paying for the new HVAC system will raise taxes. For a $200,000 home during the loan-repayment period, the annual tax hike in Brookline was estimated at $78.48 and in Newfane at $83.07 -- though actual taxes would be adjusted downward based on income.
\
""If we extend the length of the loan, it should be self-supporting,"" said Newfane resident Cris White, who backed a 20-year repayment period.
\
But Energy Committee members lobbied for the five-year repayment plan, saying anything longer would require a specially warned Australian Ballot vote. That would push back the project's schedule and could result in higher bids, Friedman said.
\
Furthermore, some officials and residents pointed out that a longer repayment period means more interest costs. Newfane resident Dan DeWalt spoke in favor of the five-year plan, saying he was ""interested in the total cost being as small as possible.""
\
The move to amend the repayment period to 20 years was voted down, and the crowd subsequently approved the HVAC system -- with the $330,000 loan and a five-year payment plan -- via voice vote.
\
Members of the school board and Energy Committee were enthusiastic about Thursday's votes.
\
""We will be the first school that we know of in the state to have a solar system and to be heated and cooled by heat pumps,"" Friedman said. ""We are on the forefront.""
\
McFadden said it's all about the NewBrook students.
\
""It means that the kids are going to have more efficient heating and air conditioning with no negative impact on the environment,"" he said.

BURLINGTON Vermont has the third-most solar industry jobs per resident of any state in the Union, according to a report published Monday by Washington, D.C.-based group The Solar Foundation.
\
Next year's solar job market is expected to continue expanding, the report states, with an anticipated 13 percent growth in 2016. Forecasts show the state's workforce as a whole growing only 0.4 percent, according to the report.
\
Industry representatives say the state has done a good job of exploiting a profitable business sector, that is likely to grow even more lucrative in coming years.
\
""It's exciting to see Vermont taking its share of this new, clean type of economy,"" said Andrew Savage, spokesman for solar parts manufacturer All Earth Renewables. ""These jobs are happening; either Vermont's going to get them, or they'll go elsewhere.""
\
The relatively high percentage of solar jobs in Vermont are from the manufacturing sector, Savage said. This industry sells products out of state and isn't dependent on sales associated with Vermont's local solar needs.
\
Two hundred seventy solar businesses in the state employed 1,367 workers in 2015. Of Vermont's solar jobs, around 800 are in installation, and about 250 are in manufacturing. Installers make an average of $23 per hour; figures for manufacturing wages are not available.
\
Installation and manufacturing represent about 60 and 18 percent of the solar job force, respectively. Sales and distribution jobs employ another 7 percent of Vermont's solar workers, and project development another 5 percent; 11 percent are classified as ""other.""
\
Savage said the actual number of Vermonters working in the solar energy may be much higher.
\
""I think there are a lot of professionals starting to work in the solar industry, but it's only 30 or 40 percent of the work they do,"" he said.
\
Most of the state's solar jobs -- just over 60 percent -- are residential installations, the Solar Foundation report found.
\
The share of jobs devoted to large, ""utility-scale"" installations is less than half the share of these jobs in all solar employment nationwide, with 8.4 percent in Vermont and 21.5 percent across the country.
\
In 2015 alone, the state put 34.4 megawatts of solar energy into use, bringing total installed solar capacity in Vermont to 104.4 megawatts.
\
Andrew Perchlik, director of Vermont's Clean Energy Development Fund, said solar companies will continue to employ more people in the near future because of an extension of a large federal tax break for new solar installations, and new net metering rules soon to be promulgated by the Vermont Public Service Board could also have an impact, Perchlik said.
\
""We thought 2016 was going to be a mad rush to get everything installed that you could before the tax credit was going to expire in December this year,"" Perchlik said. ""But the issue in Vermont became the net metering cap.""
\
Vermont's Public Service Board previously capped the amount of energy the state's utilities may purchase through net metered installations at 15 percent. That number could easily increase when the Board releases new net metering rules, which are due to take effect in the beginning of 2017.
\
The rules' first drafts are likely to released by the end of the month, Perchlik said.
\
The Public Service Department, of which Perchlik is a functionary, is seeking to eliminate the net metering cap altogether, he said.
\
The cap was intended to protect ratepayers from the relatively high rates utilities pay to purchase net metered energy; those rates are intended to incent solar development within the state, Perchlik said. Some ideal price would presumably accomplish both aims, he said.
\
The state is scheduled to release another report on the clean energy industry in April, Perchlik said, and that's likely to give additional details on some of the information the Solar Foundation report contains.

I'm writing in response to recent letters praising Rick Hube for hiseffectiveness in the legislature, particularly his getting Route 11paved seemingly single handedly. I had three responses to this news.Chittenden County has something in excess of 75 percent of its roadsrated as being in ""fair"" condition. The folks in Chittenden Countymust feel awful about having road pavement decisions being made byone legislator in the southern part of the state. No wonder theirroads are in awful shape. Incidentally until about a month ago theirroads were rated as being in ""poor"" condition, but the governordecided to address this problem. He did so by changing the name ofthe category from ""poor"" to ""fair"" so now Vermont has no roads inpoor condition.
\
My second thought was that the state really should handle road pavingthe way that all the towns do - decide what roads to pave in thecoming year by looking at road conditions, amount of traffic,closeness of one paving job to another and probable funds availablefor paving. This way they could go out to bid for the paving jobs andget the best contract/cost available long before the paving isactually done. This strikes me as a more orderly, less expensive wayof doing the job than having one legislator making these decisionsover coffee with one constituent.
\
My last thought on this subject was that it is a good thing Rick hasconstituents in Londonderry to talk to him about the condition ofRoute 11. I don't think Rick gets very familiar with that stretch ofroad except in September and October of each election year.In the meantime, I've checked with a few people about how much time,energy and effort Tom Buchanan has put in on his position on theWindham Regional Commission. He seems to be getting really good marksas an intelligent go-getter with great follow through.

Governor 'veto'
\
Editor of the Reformer:
\
A short ""Googling"" session brings to life a number of instances ofDouglas' use of the veto pen:
\
The Energy Efficiency and Affordability Bill. The bill would have: promoted solar energy by providing tax credits for homeowners; allowed ""group net-metering,"" which would have helped jumpstart larger hydro, wind and solar projects; established a statewide program under Efficiency Vermont that would have allowed Vermont residents who use fuel as a heating source to reap personal savings at their homes valued in the tens of millionsof dollars; reduced air pollution and Vermont's contribution to global warming;
\
A bill that would have required Vermont Yankee's owners to top off or guarantee future payments into the nuclear plant's decommissioning fund;
\
A bill to limit the influence of big money in politics;
\
The campaign finance bill the instant-runoff voting bill a bill that would have added Vermont to a coalition of states seeking to elect the president via popular vote the gender identity and expression bill;
\
The budget adjustment bill;
\
House Bill 865, An act relating to nondiscrimination;
\
House Bill 781, An act relating to insurance;
\
Senate Bill 114, An act relating to access to juvenile proceedings;
\
Douglas opposes the construction of wind turbines. He passed on buying the hydroelectric plants on the Connecticut River.
\
In addition, his failed plan to lease Vermont's lottery system to aprivate investment firm (Lehman Brothers - no longer in existence)revealed the same free-market ethos that decimated U.S. financialmarkets. Meanwhile, Governor Douglas returned home to Vermont lastJune claiming his Vermont Chamber of Commerce-sponsored trip to Chinawas a great success.
\
The governor's critics point out that the extraordinary amount oftime Douglas allocates to the supper and ribbon-cutting circuit markshim as a professional politician focused on political survival. ""JimDouglas has spent so much of his life fighting for re-election everytwo years that he is hard-wired to pursue short-term politicalvictories first,"" said Ian Carleton, chairman of the VermontDemocratic Party. Carleton continues: ""Long-term, meaningful changehas been an afterthought."" . ""He sabotages some of the best ideas putforward by the Legislature .""What Vermonters need to be asking iswhether Jim Douglas is making political decisions in the long-terminterest of the state.""
\
Vermonters must ask why the governor would kill such progressiveinitiatives and reject any meaningful compromise. Then they must askif the governor represents the public's best interests, or the vestedinterests of others.
\
With health care, alternative energy, education funding, jobs andbridge repairs, Jim Douglas has done nothing but drag his feet. Hispolicy of obstructing the Legislature without viable alternativesdemonstrates that he has no vision for Vermont. It is time for achange.

In support of Symington
\
A Windham County resident who has ANY doubts about Gaye Symington'spolicies and her performance as House Speaker should definitely referto the list in the flyer, which is enclosed with the Reformer, andphone or email his/her local representatives before voting. Votersmay be pleasantly surprised to learn that Gaye is the best HouseSpeaker Vermont has ever had, and that she has never hesitated toconduct the people's business in a nonpartisan way.
\
Gaye Symington is not the glad-handing wolf- in-sheep's clothing thatJim Douglas is, neither is she the coached, carefully guarded andwell-rehearsed actress that Sarah Palin is. Voters who think they'vecompleted their ""civic duty"" by watching the debates and then basetheir votes on debating skills only, probably don't know that Gayeagreed to run for governor only at the urging of her colleagues. Sheis not a ""political animal."" She represents more substance and less""show."" Patsy French, who has worked in the Legislature with Gayefor six years, noted, ""Gaye is extremely inclusive -- she appointed aRepublican to chair the House Transportation Committee, and aProgressive to chair the Agricultural Committee, because she was sureeach would do an excellent job (and she was right)."" Vermonters havebeen very fortunate to have her wise and even-handed oversight.
\
Because Gaye doesn't debate as well as either Jim Douglas or AnthonyPollina, politically educated, concerned Vermonters need to decidewhether another smooth-talking man with an ego-driven fire-in-thebelly, is a better choice than an honest, plain-spoken, very fair andexceedingly bright ""Policy Wonk."" Many of us who live in WindhamCounty are concerned about the Entergy Corp., its ongoing safety,and whether Vermonters will be left to fund the clean-up once theplant is decommissioned. And that's just for starters. As one whohas voted twice in the past for Ralph Nader and once for Ross Perot,I hardly consider myself and ""ideologue"" of either party; but I havemade it a point to confer with our local representatives; and fromthem I have learned about the typical Republican divisive politicsJim Douglas has practiced in our state; and given that the personswho have worked with Gaye have been the ones who have sung herpraises, I urge everyone to think and investigate before they vote.

The Vermont League of Conservation Voters (VLCV), who grades eachstate representative based on their voting record regardinglegislation that impacts the environment, has endorsed incumbentState Representative John Moran for Windham-Bennington 1 (coveringthe towns of Dover, Readsboro, Searsburg, Somerset, Stamford andWardsboro).
\
According to the VLCV's scorecard, John Moran received a 90 percent, whilehis opponent Phil Bartlett received a 15 percent. John received a highrating because he supports efficient and renewable energy, protectionof surface and groundwater supply, stricter lead exposure limits toprotect children, and holding Entergy VY accountable for the $500million decomissioning fund. On the other hand, Phil Bartlett, whowas State Representative in 2005-2006 and served on the NaturalResources Committee and Agriculture Committee, received a low ratingbecause he voted against renewable energy, against energy efficiencystandards, against groundwater protection, in support of geneticallyengineered seeds, and against greenhouse gas reduction goals.
\
John Moran has a proven track record of supporting the environment,while at the same promoting local economic development. Clearly, ifwe want our quality of life protected, re-elect John Moran for StateRepresentative.

I am very pleased that Tom Buchanan has decided to run a second timefor State Representative. He is a strong candidate, and will make anexceptional legislator. Tom is smart, focused, and always listens toothers. How do I know this? Tom is a personal friend. I have knownTom for more than six years and discussed literally thousands ofissues with him.
\
A little about Tom ... You have all heard the statement: ""If itis worth doing, it is worth doing well."" Tom lives by thisstatement. When he does something like learning a sport, he learnsit well enough to become a teacher of that sport. He doesn't justtake basic medical training like First Aid and CPR, he becomes anEMT. He doesn't just sky dive, he becomes a nationally certifiedCoach Course Director, training other jumpers to teach skydiving. Inhis political life, he takes an issue, researches the factors causingand the circumstances surrounding that issue. He develops a keen anddeep understanding of the issue and associated sides or opinions onthe issue. In other words, Tom cares enough to become an expert onthe issue. He can discuss the issue at length and present a logicaland level opinion on it. He exercises good judgment. He can standfirm when necessary, and is not afraid to compromise and craftsolutions that will help us all move forward. Therefore, I believehe will serve our community well.
\
Politics, have you had enough yet? If there is any fault that Tomhas, it is the fact that he does not like the negative aspects of thepolitical process. Tom is focused on the issues and not on pointingout the weak or negative points of his opponent. He doesn't throw alot of money at the campaign. Instead he walks from house to house,knocks on doors to introduce himself and discuss any of the campaignissues with you. You may have met him that way. Negativecampaigning is not a part of his program. He has tried to keep hiscampaign positive, which helps voters focus on the issues.
\
I know Tom well, and first and foremost, Tom is honest and ethical.In my opinion, this makes him the best candidate for StateRepresentative. Ask yourself what has really changed with thecurrent incumbent. I think there is a real need for a change inleadership and that we really need a leader who is learned, honest,ethical and cares deeply about the issues affecting all of us.

Rick Hube wants to be reelected to the Vermont House. He has spenthis vast campaign war chest to convince voters that he is an effectivemoderate who works well across the aisle to get things done. As it turns out,however, Hube's record tells the opposite story. In the House, Rick Hube goesout of his way to be critical and to belittle collaborating with Democratsand Progressives. Within his district he has taken credit for highwayprojects that have been almost entirely the work of others. And he was one ofonly four Republicans that voted against the State General Fund Budget,signed by the governor.
\
Every so often, and with considerable fanfare, Hube introduces a neweducation-funding scheme. This year's idea was called LEAF. Theseproposals are designed to appeal to the voters in his district buteach one carries a fatal flaw, a lack of detail and a funding source for themillions of dollars that go unmet. And therein lies the truth. They are notexamples of an effective legislator at work. They are examples ofpolitical posturing designed to gain popularity at the polls.
\
It is time the voters of Windham-Bennington-Windsor-1 Districtelected a real effective legislator. Someone who listens, learns from hisconstituents, and is prepared to do the hard work necessary to helpfind solutions to the problems we face together. That man is Tom Buchanan.Please vote to elect Tom Buchanan to the Vermont House.

It's time for straight talk
\
Editor of the Reformer:
\
I remember, from my college days in 1970 or so, listening to a talk by an officer from the Naval War College about U.S. strategic goalsin Central and South Asia. Even then the goal was to maintain alliesin the region in order to prevent Russia from gaining access towarm-water ports on the Indian Ocean and to protect the flow of oilfrom the region to our allies in western Europe and Japan. Historyshows that we acted on those policy goals by supporting decidedlynon-democratic leaders like Pahlavi in Iran and Hussein in Iraq andsupporting the Afghans in their fight against the Russians. I believeour current efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan are still based largelyon pursuit of that same policy. Going after Hussein and non-existentWMDs (Saddam had to keep up the appearance of such strength in orderto give the Iranians pause. We ought to have known that and probablydid.) and our fight against the Taliban in Afghanistan were ouropenings to use our military to further our geopolitical goals. Now,as in Vietnam, the extension of our military might against factionsin a foreign country threatens to undermine our own goals.
\
So far, neither the corporate news media or the American people havedemanded straight talk from either of the presidential candidates.What we have heard , as with most other issues, are a few selectedfacts while the truth remains camouflaged and elusive.
\
In regard to Afghanistan, I have heard little except that we need toemploy more troops in the fight. What have we learned from Vietnam ,the Russian war in Afghanistan, and Iraq? Can an occupying foreignpower in a country whose varied cultures and languages it doesn'tunderstand, ever, in the long run, win a guerrilla war waged againstit by factions of the indigenous population?
\
There are several questions we should be directing to those in powerand those who aspire to power here at home. What is the U.S. goal inAfghanistan? Can it be achieved militarily? What is the plan forachieving it? Do we have enough personnel and money to clear and holdan entire country? If so, for how long? How will that goal serve U.S.interests? What interests will it serve for Afghans? How much willthe Afghan people have to endure in order for us to meet our goal?What are the chances of actually winning hearts and minds when moretroops will result in even more civil disruption and loss of civilianlife? What measure will be used to determine that our goal has beenmet? Over whom will our victory be won? How will our concomitantincursions into Pakistan affect the balance of power in thatnuclear-armed emerging democracy? The answers to these questions willaffect the lives and deaths of Americans and Afghans alike.
\
The corporate news media will continue to concentrate on manufacturedephemeral celebrities. That means it's up to us to elicit straighttalk from McCain, Obama, Bernie, Pat, and Peter.

In support of Costello
\
Editor of the Reformer:
\
For the first time since 1977, Southern Vermont has the opportunityto be represented within the executive branch in Montpelier. In 2008this has special significance. One of the most important issuesfacing the state, and particularly important to Southern Vermont, iswhat to do with Vermont Yankee. It is important for us to havesomeone at the table who knows our community and has a record ofdealing with difficult issues in highly pressurized situations.
\
Tom Costello has sound judgment, and he knows that difficult issuescannot be handled with knee jerk reactions, and that solutions onlycome after all the facts are on the table and people have had aopportunity to think through the full array of options.
\
Tom did this as Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee when heworked to pass the highly publicized drunk driving legislation, andhe did this has Chairman of the Utilities Restructuring Committeethat kept Vermont utilities from being deregulated even in the faceof mounting pressure to do so.
\
In both of these situations the right decisions were made only afterTom ensured that full debate and discussion had occurred. This isexactly the type of leadership Southern Vermont needs now to dealwith Vermont Yankee, and Vermont needs to deal with the issues ofhealthcare, the economy and home heating costs.
\
Southern Vermont lets turn out and support Tom Costello for Lt.Governor to ensure that we have someone representing us again in theexecutive branch.

Opportunity for change
\
Editor of the Reformer:
\
We are finally presented with the choices we must make in November. Iam not arrogant enough to think my opinions should decide for others,but perhaps I might give some insight that would make it easier forthose others to arrive at a decision. To identify myself, I was bornwhen Calvin Coolidge was President. Of course, I was not able to makemuch of the elections of 1928 and 1932, but I was able to sense thatsomething important to my family was happening. My parents werestaunch democrats in those years - they were vociferously supportive of FDRand as the years passed they became more so. I thought I was making arational choice when I continued that support. Circumstances obligedme to think deeply of that mind-set.
\
When the 1939 war started I was able to consider for myself what theimplications were, and it became important to me that I share inreclaiming the world for decency and justice. My parents werestrongly opposed when I attempted to enlist at 17 - I needed their permissionto do so. They were not able to prevent my volunteering for immediateenrollment in the armed forces at 18, so I went.
\
That turned out to be for me the high point of idealism, although Iserved in an almost totally segregated army, and by that was able tounderstand more clearly what I had been thinking was nebulousidealism before. In later years I realized more and more how much ideals wereundercut by the overriding force of ""reality"". Thinking of thepromise of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution in relationto the reality of 20th century America was so discouraging.
\
I've lived through the Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon,Ford, Carter, Reagan, Bush, Clinton and Bush II years, and I'vefound much to disagree with in those years, But I have never before beenconcerned that the country I love, and was those years ago anxious toserve, has lost sight of its purpose and justification, and hasbecome no more than a vehicle for the satisfaction of greed and selfishness.We have lost sight of the overriding reality that we are indeed allresponsible for all of our fellows, and failing to understand thatsimple fact dooms us to the fate of the dinosaurs.
\
Not every generation has the opportunity to change the world, butmine has been given, with our children and grandchildren, that greatopportunity, and we must realize that we are privileged to do so. Weare presented with a choice that will determine the continuedexistence of the human race, and the choice to decide whether itscontinued existence is worthwhile. Please think of this as you listento the rhetoric and the claims that are so blatantly self-serving, andthink of your grandchildren.

Torture and the elections
\
Editor of the Reformer:
\
In July, the congregation of Christ's Church in Saxtons River votedto place a banner stating that ""Torture is a Moral Issue"" on thefront of our church. In addition to hanging a banner, we committed tostudying the use of torture (current and historical), policies andlaws regarding torture, and the guidance that our faith and the Biblegive on the topic.
\
In addition, the Anti-Torture Task Force of the church has alsoinvestigated the voting records of Representative Peter Welch andSenators Bernie Sanders and Patrick Leahy regarding the issue oftorture. We are pleased and grateful to note that all three have aconsistent record of voting against the use of torture and supportingtough legislation that would force our government to honor thehumanity of even our enemies by upholding the Geneva Convention andthe Army Field Manual.
\
With election day fast approaching, we urge all voters to considerthe records and statements of those seeking our votes, and to votefor people who are strong in their condemnation of the use oftorture. We must tell our representatives that we don't supporttorture. For more information, we encourage readers to visit theWeb site of the National Religious Campaign Against Torture(www.nrcat.org).

Dr. King said it best:
\
""Though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still havea dream , that one day every valley shall be exalted, every hill andmountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, andthe crooked places will be made straight, and the glory of the Lordshall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together...
\
""This will be the day when all of God's children will be able tosing with a new meaning, 'My country, 'tis of thee, sweet land ofliberty, of thee I sing. Land where my fathers died, land of thepilgrim's pride, from every mountainside, let freedom ring...'
\
""And when this happens, when we allow freedom to ring, when we letit ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state andevery city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God'schildren, black and white, Jew and Gentile, Protestant and Catholic,will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negrospiritual, ""Free at last! Free at last! Thank God Almighty we arefree at last.""
\
After six to eight years of despair and discomfort, this will be aday when we'll all have jobs. We'll be able to live in affordablehomes. We'll enjoy public health care and good schools. We'll usesustainable energy from our rivers, forests, air, and sunlight, andwe'll be safe and at peace with our world and with each other.
\
This will be a day when our leaders will have stopped rewarding theirfriends at the expense of the rest of us and of the world at large,when dishonesty and cynicism will have vanished from public affairs,and when competence will revisit public administration.
\
It will be a day when we'll be free of greedy businesses hoardingbailout funds and refusing essential regulation, thereby mockingcongressional efforts to fix the economy, our recession having provedthe market cannot do it all.
\
We'll be done with fraudulent negotiations to end our illegaladventure in the Middle East, and we shall have brought the troopsand the expensive ""Defense"" Department mercenary workers home forgood.
\
We'll be done with unsafe and undependable energy, capital gains taxloopholes, suppressed public debate, unfair campaign finance, profitsand jobs that leak away from our state, ""E-State"" promises that go nofurther than Burlington, partisan gridlock between the Governor andthe state legislature, the veto, and political advertising thatattacks make-believe personality issues rather than simple reality.
\
It all starts Nov. 5, and it continues in January 2009. Itbegins with Obama, and it continues in Vermont. Do you remember whenthe draft energy plan review sessions were held in Windham County?(They weren't.) Who will pay VY decommissioning costs? (We will.)Why has the public oversight commission been excluded from NRC/VYactivities? (It's called gubernatorial politics.) As one Marlborovoter told me last Saturday, ""I won't vote for Douglas. I'm a stateworker."" The Vermont NEA and AFL-CIO concur. Change is essential.In the words of UVM economist Art Wolfe, ""This recession is going tobe a real wake-up call.""
\
With Scott Ainslie of Brattleboro, Richard Davis (Guilford), LisaCarlson (Hinesburg), and countless others, I have a dream thatSpeaker Symington will ask her followers to support Anthony Pollinafor Governor because a majority of voters will have said they do notwant the incumbent to serve a fourth term and because Pollina hasgood ideas, because he will invest in us, and because he has thecharisma which Barack Obama will be bringing to the nation as a whole.

Vermonters are signing up for solar energy in record numbers. With current federal and state incentives, going solar has never been cheaper and is a great way to have a lesser impact on our warming planet. Unfortunately, more and more Vermonters who believe they are buying solar energy from local companies are actually supporting fossil-fueled energy and worsening their carbon footprint in the process. Let me explain.
\
Historically, one of the most convenient ways to reduce your impact on the planet was to contract with a local solar company to install solar panels at your home and interconnect them with your utility. As your solar system spun your electric meter backward, you would reduce your utility bill and your carbon footprint. This is called solar net metering. Your interaction with your solar installer was simple. The solar company installed your system, you paid the company upfront for the solar system, and you owned the solar system along with the rights to the renewable energy it produced.
\
Today, new financing and purchase options are increasing Vermonters' access to solar energy. These are positive developments, except that some solar companies take advantage of the complexity of these options with deceptive sales practices. While their Vermont customers believe they are getting solar energy, in fact, the company is instead selling their solar energy to a third party, often a utility outside the state. That's right, if you read the fine print of your solar contract, you too may find that you are not really purchasing solar energy.
\
Electricity follows the path of least resistance, and we'll say for simplicity's sake that it travels at the speed of light. The electric power industry has created an accounting system to track who produces and who consumes renewable energy. For every megawatt-hour of renewable electricity produced, a generator creates a corresponding certificate to account for its production and use. The certificates are called ""Renewable Energy Credits"" (RECs). These RECs can be sold to utilities to meet a state renewable energy requirement or sold to another customer who legally wants to consume renewable energy. Whoever buys the REC has paid the extra cost that is required to bring renewable energy to the grid, and has the only legal claim to that renewable energy.
\
Historically, these RECs remained bundled with a Vermont customer's net-metered solar energy. Today, many developers are contractually separating the RECs from the net-metered energy Vermonters purchase, and selling this solar energy out of state for an additional profit. Unfortunately, while the developer puts a lot more green bills in their bank account, the energy you are purchasing is much less green than you may believe. Without the RECs, the energy provided to the Vermont customers is not solar. In fact, by proper accounting, it is some of the dirtiest power on the New England grid.
\
This practice of stripping the RECs from net-metered solar products has become even more deceptive in what a number of companies are marketing to Vermonters as ""Community Solar."" While there are a number of excellent Vermont companies selling honest community solar products to Vermonters, there seem to be just as many who are deceiving Vermonters for additional profit. Recently, at the Montshire Museum in Norwich, I introduced a panel of six Vermont companies marketing community solar products. In my introductory remarks, I discussed what it means to strip the RECs from the net-metered solar and sell the solar RECs out of state. Following my introduction, three of the six companies present admitted that they were selling the RECs separately from the net-metered energy, while they were marketing their product to Vermonters as community solar.
\
We should be concerned about this practice for a number of reasons. First, many Vermonters are signing contracts believing they are purchasing clean, local solar energy when they are, unfortunately, being misled into doing the opposite. Second, by selling the Vermont solar energy out of state, companies using these deceptive practices gain added revenue, which allows them to lower their prices and increase their profits, undercutting honest Vermont solar companies. Finally, the environment is being harmed when Vermonters believe they are buying solar energy while in reality they purchase polluting fossil fueled energy in its place.
\
This deceptive practice is taking advantage of both individual Vermonters and honest solar companies trying to reduce their impact on a warming planet. From what I observed at the Montshire Museum, and elsewhere, this is a rapidly growing problem in Vermont. Where are the regulators and the multitude of state officials who are charged with protecting consumers and the environment?
\
Apparently, when it comes to solar energy and a warming planet, the cold hard facts of capitalism prevail for those interested in profit over real environmental improvement. Unfortunately, Vermont electric customers and ethical solar businesses are also being harmed. It is time for our state government to act to protect Vermont electric customers and our planet, and enforce our public service and consumer protection laws.

To the Editor:
\
I applaud Vermont's energy plan for setting a goal of having 90 percent of the state's energy supplied by renewables by 2050. I commend Renewable Energy Vermont for setting a goal of 20 percent renewables by 2020. I see the climate writing on the environment around this fragile globe of ours, and I want to do my part to help our communities live more sustainably.
\
I recognize that the fossil fuel industry is huge and lucrative, that we are very much addicted to its products, that it has ample lobbying money to influence, and that it has received subsidies, both obvious and less so, since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. So I very much appreciate the attempt to level the playing field for renewables by offering federal tax rebates for investors. Thanks to that and good state legislation, we continue to bring good, green jobs to Vermont, powering more of our energy from renewables.
\
But we have a long way to go. The 4 percent cap for net metering needs to be removed, and the naysayers need to recognize that distributed renewable generation is saving money for all taxpayers, through the cancellation, for example, of a $250 million distribution project by VELCO. GMP, for example, recognizes how solar energy lowers peak demand and, even without legislation, has offered incentives to customers who have invested in solar systems beyond the basic net metering. This does not shift the cost burden to those without; it recognizes cost savings.
\
I urge us not to be afraid of what might seem new (in fact, it is tried and true) and to welcome this nonpolluting, job-creating source of energy into our state and our communities at a rate sufficient to meet our good goals. And I applaud those towns and communities that are bravely seeking ways to embrace sustainability - keeping local dollars in state, making us all more resilient and thoughtful keepers of this beautiful place where we live.

232,"
BRATTLEBORO -- Local lawmakers are taking new steps to protect one of Vermont's most-precious resources -- the state's (reputedly) pristine streams, rivers, ponds and lakes.
\
In the state Senate, the Natural Resources Committee is working on a version of a bill designed to protect shorelines. And in the House, the Fish, Wildlife and Water Resources Committee took a step toward plugging an obvious hole in the state's environmental regulations.
\
""Right now, it is not illegal to throw trash into the waters of the state,"" said Rep. David Deen, a Westminster Democrat who chairs the House committee. ""(This is a) problematic oversight in our laws that we want to correct.""
\
Deen's committee has unanimously approved H. 356, a bill that makes littering in the state's waters a ""punishable infraction,"" he said.
\
""The provisions of the bill are directly tied to the existing provisions of our highway-littering law. The penalties are the same as for roadway littering,"" Deen said.
\
""So if the bill becomes law, littering from the shore or from a boat into the waters of the state will be punishable by a fine (and) possible court-assigned community service cleaning up the waterways of Vermont,"" he added. ""And if you do not pay your fine, you would face the suspension of your driver's license or boater's certification for a period of 10 days.""
\
The proposed fine, according to the most-recent version of the bill posted online, is a civil penalty up to $500.
\
Deen said committee members were told there had been 143 citations for littering issued last year. Such enforcement ""helps stop the problem,"" he said.
\
""We hope that, when this becomes law, we will reduce the amount of trash in the Connecticut River and its tributaries that the Connecticut River Watershed Council and our co-volunteer groups pull out of the watershed every year,"" Deen said.
\
Deen also has been instrumental in trying to pass a lake-shoreland protection bill. Windham County Sen. Peter Galbraith, a Townshend-based Democrat, said his Natural Resources and Energy Committee has finished work on the Senate's version of that measure.
\
""Most Vermonters will be surprised to know that our green state has the poorest water quality of any New England state, and not just in Lake Champlain,"" Galbraith said. ""Unlike the other New England states, we have no legislation regulating construction and clearing close to a lake. Vermont's lakes are public resource, but their ecological values are diminished by runoff from poor construction and too much cleared land along the lake shore.""
\
That would change if the bill, which was introduced last year, is approved by both legislative bodies and signed by the governor.
\
""The lake-shore protection bill (H. 526) creates a protected shoreline area of 250 feet from the mean water line. Construction may take place in this protected shoreline area, but property owners may clear no more than 40 percent of their land, and buildings may occupy no more than 20 (percent) of the lot,"" Galbraith said.
\
Also, he said, new construction is prohibited within 100 feet of the shore, and property owners ""must maintain a well-distributed stand of trees"" as a buffer.
\
""There are exceptions that allow people with small lots close to the lake to build closer to the shore. And existing structures, driveways and clearing are grandfathered,"" Galbraith said. ""The Senate committee bill strengthens the protections as compared to the House-passed version.""
\
In other legislative business with Windham County connections:
\
-- Environmental matters also were on the mind of Rep. Mike Hebert, R-Vernon. Hebert said his House Natural Resources and Energy Committee has unanimously approved an expansion of the state's net-metering law.
\
The law allows small, renewable energy projects to send power to the grid while receiving credit on their utility bills for that power.
\
At this point, net metering is capped at 4 percent of a utility's peak capacity, and most of the state's utilities have reached that limit. The bill proposes raising that cap to 15 percent.
\
""It carries us to 2017, when the current net metering program will sunset,"" Hebert said.
\
The bill includes a mechanism for monitoring and regulating the possible ""cost shift"" of net metering onto a utility's customers, Hebert said.
\
Hebert said debate also has begun on a bill (H. 557) that would transform the state's ""goals"" for limiting greenhouse-gas emissions into mandates.
\
The idea is to force reductions in such emissions, but the bill also ""changes the playing field significantly,"" Hebert said.
\
""I want to hear from the business community: What does this bill do to you and for you?"" he said, adding that, ""it's going to be really interesting.""
\
-- Rep. John Moran, D-Wardsboro, has predicted an interesting debate on a proposal that would mandate paid sick leave for all employees in Vermont.
\
The bills, marked as H. 208 in the House and S. 255 in the Senate, propose that employees earn sick time at a rate of one hour for every 30 hours worked up to a maximum of 56 hours annually.
\
""As a public-health concern, we do not want sick employees going to work or sending their sick children to school because they can not afford to take the day off from work,"" said Moran, vice chairman of the House General, Housing and Military Affairs Committee.
\
Moran added that, ""if employers already provide (sick) time off, conditions of the bill are generally met.""
\
Next week, Moran's committee will take testimony on the bill and will hold a public hearing.
\
""We're certainly looking to move forward with this expeditiously,"" he said.
\
-- Rep. Valerie Stuart, D-Brattleboro, said the House and Senate Education Committees held a joint hearing on bullying and harassment in schools. Lawmakers received a briefing from an advisory council that has examined the issue.
\
""During its initial meeting in August of 2012, the council generated a list of 15 key issues,"" Stuart said. ""Three of them rose to the top and were the basis for the formation of work groups that focused on data collection; student leadership; and pre-service and in-service staff development.""
\
Accomplishments so far include ""listening tours,"" Stuart said, wherein officials ""gathered information and feedback from students from around the state about subjects ranging from what is happening in schools to what is working and what is not working in terms of current strategies targeted to address this issue.""
\
Bullying and harassment, she added, ""makes it difficult for every child in our state to receive an equal education in a safe environment.""
\
-- Opiate abuse, including rampant heroin addiction, has been a hot topic recently among Gov. Peter Shumlin and other state officials.
\
Rep. Mike Mrowicki, D-Putney and a member of the House Human Services Committee, said he agrees with Shumlin's assessment that ""we can't arrest our way out of the drug problem Vermont is facing.""
\
""House Human Services, with the (Shumlin) administration and several other committees, is pulling together a comprehensive plan to address the current opioid crisis that includes prevention; pre-trial interventions (offering treatment as an option rather than trial and possible jail time); as well as more treatment options to include inpatient residential, outpatient treatment and ongoing recovery programs,"" Mrowicki said.
\
""House Human Services also heard from witnesses that included Mark Ames of the Vermont Recovery Network,"" Mrowicki said. ""He shared how the best outcomes are not just giving addicts other drugs to substitute for the drugs that got them in trouble. Ongoing recovery help -- such as, locally, through Turning Point Recovery Center -- is essential to success and keeping people clean, sober and (on a path toward) being productive citizens again.""
\
Rep. Tim Goodwin, a Weston Independent whose district includes Jamaica, Londonderry and Stratton, said he recently joined other lawmakers in watching ""The Hungry Heart,"" a documentary about treating addiction in Vermont.
\
""It is a production that I think every Vermonter could benefit from watching,"" Goodwin said. ""The movie was a moving experience with direct ties to the work of the House Judiciary Committee, on which I sit.""
\
-- The issues of substance abuse and mental health often are intertwined.
\
Windham County Sen. Jeanette White, a Putney Democrat and a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, expanded on Mrowicki's theme by saying senators are ""looking at a system that would try to divert people with substance-abuse and mental-health issues from jails and into treatment by using pre-trial risk assessments and needs screening.""
\
Lawmakers also are ""looking at how to avoid long waiting times for people in mental-health crisis from getting necessary treatment,"" White said. ""It is often referred to as the 'forced-medication bill,' but it isn't. Its main purpose is to get timely access to judicial review.""
\
White added that ""folks need to remember that bills almost always change after testimony, and we are receiving a lot of testimony that is causing us all to think in different ways. I don't know where we will end up.""
\
-- No one can yet say where the government's spending on winter road maintenance will end up. Rep. Mollie Burke, a Brattleboro Progressive Democrat, said her House Transportation Committee has been scrutinizing the VTrans budget.
\
""This week, we heard testimony from the Operations Division, which includes all the maintenance for state roads,"" Burke said. ""Not surprisingly, given the Christmas ice storm in the northern part of the state and other ice storms, the sand and salt budget is way up this year. More than half of the appropriation has been spent already. Fortunately, in the adjustment to the (current year's) budget, we were able to find a bit of extra money to put into this fund.""
\
Burke also gave a nod to Vermont's busy plow-truck drivers.
\
""As an aside, we also heard testimony from a number of state plow drivers who are perhaps some of the most dedicated state workers,"" she said. ""They are often reluctant to leave their shifts, so intent are they on creating safe conditions for the traveling public on the interstate and on state roads.""
\
-- The Senate Government Operations Committee, which White chairs, is giving a nod toward the dental profession by debating creation of a new job class.
\
A ""dental practitioner"" would be ""a step between dentist and hygienist (and) would hopefully ease some of the dental-coverage shortages,"" White said.
\
Also, in the 2014 session's second full week, local House members signed onto a wide variety of new legislation, including:
\
* H. 637: Regulating precious metal dealers (Goodwin; Rep. Dick Marek, D-Newfane).
\
* H. 647: Requiring the removal of snow and ice from vehicles operated on public highways (Burke; Hebert).
\
* H. 648: Setbacks, screening and siting of solar-generation plants (Deen).
\
* H. 649: Isolation distances for potable water supplies and wastewater systems (Deen).
\
* H. 650: Establishing the Ecosystem Restoration and Water Quality Improvement Special Fund (Deen).

233,"MONTPELIER -- The 2011 legislative session started in Jan. 5 and ended May 6. Here's a look at some of the legislation that passed in those 17 weeks. Bill numbers follow each item in parentheses. To read bills, visit the Legislature's website at www.leg.state.vt.us.\Agriculture\* Agricultural fairs: Grandfathers all structures built before Jan. 1 at Vermont's agricultural fair and field day premises and all events held before that date at those locations are exempt from enforcement under Act 250. New construction and non-agriculture events may be subject to Act 250 permit requirements. (H. 411)\* Poultry products: Alters a 2006 law to allow voluntary meat inspection of quail, pheasant and partridge for companies selling them in states that require it but not putting them under the same rules as poultry because federal regulators do not. (H. 52)\* Raw milk: Clarifies the state's law governing purchase of raw, unpasteurized milk, allowing buyers to use the milk to make food products such as yogurt and cheese for personal consumption but not for sale. This will allow groups to go ahead with raw milk workshops that the state had ordered them to stop. (S. 105)\Business\* Florists: Classifies as deceptive advertising the practice of redirecting Internet users from a florist shop the user was seeking to another. (H. 287)\* Jobs: Extends the life of the Vermont Economic Growth Incentives, provides $1.3 million for work force training programs, creates a local food coordinator position and encourages the state to buy local agriculture products. (H. 287)\* Telecommunications: Reduces the level of permitting review by the state Public Service Board for telecommunications projects that make minor changes with the goal of having high-speed Internet and cell phone coverage reach all parts of the state by 2013; bars telecommunications infrastructure from having an undue impact on the state's established scenic highways; calls for appointment of new members to the Vermont Telecommunications Authority; calls for mapping the state's cell and Internet coverage. (S. 78)\Consumers\* Prescription drugs: Allows the public to turn over unused prescriptions drugs to personnel authorized to dispose of the medications. (H. 11)\* Propane: Bars propane dealers from requiring customers to buy a minimum amount or from charging fees for minimum use of propane; increases penalties for dealers who do not issue timely refunds for unused propane when customers switch dealers; eliminates fees for terminating service that's been in place at least a year. (H. 56)\* Motor vehicles: Establishes a restricted driver's license in anticipation of the state's increased use of interlock ignition devices for drunken-driving offenders; allows those with suspended driver's licenses to continue using the license for identification; allows the state to replace defective license plates free; creates a veterans license plate for motorcycles; allows those serving in the military outside the state more time to buy a car after selling one to qualify for a reduction in tax. (S. 94)\Education\* Military children: Allows Vermont to join an interstate compact that meets annually to discuss and address problems children whose parents are in the military face in school. Caps Vermont's dues to compact at $100 a year. (H. 38)\* Pre-kindergarten: Removes limits on the number of pre-kindergarten students who may be included in a school district's calculation of average daily membership for the purposes of figuring per-pupil spending, a move that is expected to reduce the homestead tax rate in 14 towns that had run up against the cap. (S. 53)\* Employee references: Allows qualified immunity to schools and others whose employees oversee vulnerable populations for information provided in a job reference. The move seeks to fix legislation passed last year in response to the case of a Morristown man accused of sexual assault against two male students whose suspected background was unknown when he was hired by another school. (H. 264)\Energy\* State buildings: Directs state government to reduce fuel for travel by 5 percent and increase its use of renewable energy in state buildings. Orders a report by January describing potential investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy. (H. 446)\* Incentives: Expands the use of net metering to allow more businesses and homeowners to generate electricity on-site; puts Clean Energy Development Fund money toward supporting such projects; offers those with solar tax credits through the Clean Energy Development Fund to receive half the amount upfront in cash instead; requires Vermont utilities to buy power from the Ryegate biomass plant at a price to be set by the Public Service Board; alters the state's new Property Assessed Clean Energy program to allow homeowners to borrow money from districts established by towns to pay for home energy efficiency with a loan repaid over 20 years through an assessment on the property's taxes. (H. 56)\* Vermont Yankee: Allows the state to bill Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant owner Entergy Corp. back for expenses the state incurs related to Entergy's lawsuit against the state over continued operation of the plant. The lawsuit came after lawmakers took no action on allowing the Public Service Board to consider Entergy's request for a 20-year operating extension beyond 2012. (H. 56)\Environment\* Fertilizer: Bans the residential use of phosphorus-containing fertilizers beginning Jan. 1, unless homeowners are seeding new lawns or tests show phosphorus is needed. Bans nitrogen fertilizers unless they are slow release. Requires retailers that sell fertilizer containing phosphorus to post signs stating phosphorus is a threat to water quality and most lawns don't need it. (H. 26).\* Mercury recycling: Requires manufacturers to participate in a recycling program for lamps containing mercury by July 2012. (S. 34)\* Prescription drug disposal: Fosters a system for allowing disposal of medicine that is designed to keep them from being flushed down toilets and finding their way into waterways. (H. 11)\* Well testing: Requires newly constructed wells tested for arsenic and other toxics and for buyers of property with existing wells to be notified that testing is available by 2013. (S. 77)\Government\* Birth certificate: Requires the state to issue a new birth certificate to someone who has undergone a sex change and seals the original birth certificate and other legal documents associated with sex change from public view. Anyone with a birth certificate marked amended because of a sex change may replace it with a new birth certificate. (S. 15)\* Burlington: Affirms the city voters' decision to remove the chief administrative officer from a voting position on the board of finance and adds a city council member to the board. (H. 444)\* Juvenile crime: Clarifies state law to say that a person who committed a crime while under age 18 may still be prosecuted after turning 18, closing a loophole that left such cases without jurisdiction in either juvenile or adult court. (S. 58)\* National vote: Allows Vermont to become seventh state to adopt agreement that U.S. presidents should be elected by national popular vote. The election process will change only if enough states agree. The trigger is 270 electoral votes. Vermont added three to the current tally of 71. (S. 31)\* Pay cuts: Continues 5 percent pay reductions for salaried state workers, legislators, judges, sheriffs and state's attorneys. Agreement with state employee union means 3 percent pay reduction continues for a second year. (H. 441)\* Prisons: Authorizes relocation of inmates at several prisons to better utilize space and reduce the number of inmates sent out of state. Women move from St. Albans to South Burlington, with men returning to the larger St. Albans facility. Authorizes funding to create 50-bed work camp and 50-bed prison at the Windsor prison. (H. 446)\* Public records: Requires judges to award attorney fees to those who prevail in court after being wrongly denied access to public documents, unless municipal officials reverse their decision within 20 days. Supporters argue the change will give the state's public records law teeth and compel municipal officials to follow the law. (H. 73)\* Respectful language: Requires the Agency of Human Services to look at state statute references to people with disabilities and recommend changes toward respectful language by Nov. 1. (S. 90).\* St. George/Shelburne: Affirms an agreement between the two towns over their boundary.

(H. 446)\* Young voters: Puts into statute the constitutional change in voter eligibility approved in the November election. A Vermont resident who turns 18 by the date for a general election may vote in the primary election immediately preceding it. (H. 420)\Health\* Health care cost containment: Establishes a five-member Green Mountain Care Board charged with controlling the growth of health care spending. The board will work initially on revamping the way doctors and hospitals get paid, moving them away from a fee-for-service model with its incentives to do more procedures. The board's oversight role includes reviewing a health information technology plan, a health care workforce development plan and a resource allocation plan. It also is authorized to review insurance rate requests, hospital budgets and capital project requiring certificates of need. (H. 202)\* Health care reform: Establishes a publicly financed health insurance program that would cover all Vermonters -- beginning in 2017 or earlier with federal permission -- if certain conditions are met. Those include legislative approval of a budget and a way to pay for the program. The Green Mountain Care Board will have to approve a benefit package, too. Medical coverage will be at least as good as the benefit package offered under Catamount Health, an existing program for the uninsured. Green Mountain Care would replace all the insurance plans offered in the health benefit exchange -- if the federal government agreed. (H. 202)\* Health insurance exchanges: Allows the state to set up a health benefit exchange or health insurance marketplace where individuals and small businesses could shop for medical coverage. The exchange, mandated by the federal health reform law, would begin operating in 2014. By authorizing the exchange, the state should be able to tap federal funding for its planning and system development. Having an exchange would also give Vermonters and businesses access to federal tax credits to help them afford health insurance. (H. 202)\* Health care workers: Makes it a felony to assault a health care worker. (S. 30)\* Home births: Requires private insurance companies to provide coverage when licensed midwives deliver babies in homes. (S. 15)\* Hospital tax: Raises that tax that hospitals, nursing homes and home health agencies pay to raise $7.79 million to help close the revenue gap in the budget. (H. 436)\* Insurance claims tax: Places a new tax on medical and dental insurance claims to raise $11.82 million to help close the revenue gap in the budget. (H. 436)\* Medical marijuana dispensaries: Allows up to four nonprofit dispensaries to grow and sell marijuana to those on the state's medical marijuana registry. It could take a year for the state Public Safety Department to establish (S. 17).\* Nurses: Puts into law the scope of practice for advanced practice registered nurses that has been in rule for 30 years, but eliminates the previously required collaboration agreement with a physician. The change would allow advanced practice registered nurses to have solo practices after two years working with a physician. (H. 420)\* Palliative care: Broadens access to palliative and hospice care by directing state officials to seek a federal waiver redefining terminal illness as having a 12-month life expectancy instead of the six months. Also requires doctors to receive continuing education about hospice, palliative care and pain management so they will refer more patients for these services. (H. 201)\Money\* 'Amazon' tax: Establishes that if 15 states pass laws requiring in-state affiliates of online retailers to collect sales tax that Vermont will do so as well. Five states have such a law. Amazon.com is challenging the constitutionality of New York's law. (H. 436)\* Capital budget: Authorizes two years' worth of capital project expenditures as a way to accelerate construction on big projects, such as a $28 million health laboratory in Colchester. Lawmakers would decide whether to continue two-year approach to capital project planning. (H. 446)\* Cigarette tax: Raises tax on a pack of cigarettes by 38 cents to $2.62 beginning July 1. (H. 436)\* Fees: Revises license fees for accountants, funeral directors and psychologists, and changes regulations for milk handlers and dairy technicians. (H. 138)\* Property tax rates: Sets base rates for the education property tax at 87 cents per $100 of assessed value for residential properties and $1.36 for commercial and vacation properties. (H. 436)\* Road repairs: Allows the Transportation secretary to spend up to $2 million on emergency road repairs to address damage from recent weather. Use of the money could force delays in other projects. (H. 443)\* Veterans tax credit: Offers a $2,000 tax credit to businesses that hire an unemployed, recently returned military veteran. Veterans starting their own businesses may also be eligible for the tax credit. (H. 275)\Outdoors\* Big game: Raises fines for illegal possession of wild meat and fish beginning July 1, 2012. For example, the fine for illegal big game meat goes from $1,000 to $2,000 for each animal. (H. 66)\* Pete the Moose: Reverses legislation passed last year by affirming that wildlife is in the public trust, not private ownership; gives the owner of a Northeast Kingdom game reserve three years to depopulate deer and moose within the reserve. Pete the Moose, the adopted wild animal that started the stir, will be spared, according to the state Fish and Wildlife Department. Also allows the taking of up to four deer with permission if they damage forest regeneration. (H. 91)\Public safety\* Child custody: Brings Vermont into a national compact that sets standards for jurisdiction in child custody cases. (H. 88)\* Datamaster: Moves from the Health Department to the Public Safety Department operation of the state's testing for blood alcohol after the program came under question for accuracy in recent media reports.\* Drunken driving: Creates mandatory minimum sentences for repeat drunken-driving offenders; makes it a crime to loan a vehicle to a drunk driver with increased penalties if the person kills or seriously injures someone; lowers the blood alcohol count for a future drunken-driving charge to 0.02 for those caught with a 0.16 BAC who have a previous drunken-driving conviction; directs the Corrections Department to look at housing repeat drunken-driving offenders together at the Windsor prison; directs state officials to study comprehensive treatment and punishment program for repeat drunken drivers by Jan. 15. (H. 264)\* Recidivism: Seeks to save $1.6 million in the Corrections budget by making offenders of some 600 nonviolent crimes eligible to serve their prison sentences on furlough at the discretion of the Corrections commissioner with approval from a judge. (S. 108)\* Eluding police: Makes it a felony to elude a police officer and raises the penalties, particularly when injury or death occur. (S. 73)\* Human trafficking: Creates a crime of trafficking human beings, making Vermont among the last states to do so. Supporters say the problem is under-reported and particularly affects immigrants who are forced into labor. (H. 153)\* Liquor officers: Clarifies that liquor control officers have the same authority as other law enforcement officers. (H. 6)\* Vulnerable adults: Adds sex abuse of vulnerable adults to the list of felonies that may be prosecuted up to six years after the crime was committed. The time limit had been three years. (H. 236)\Transportation\* Airports: Directs the secretary of transportation to develop a business plan to reduce or eliminate operating deficits at state airports that don't provide daily commercial service. Report due in January. Deficit reduction target is June 30, 2015. (H. 443)\* Bicycle parking: Directs state officials to make bicycle parking part of the design of future state projects. Asks buildings commissioner to report by Sept. 30 on existing bike parking options. (H. 446)\* Boylan airport: Repeals authority Legislature granted state officials last year to sell the state-owned airport in Brighton to the Vermont Renewable Energy Co. The company had planned to use the airport land to debark, chip and store logs for a pellet-manufacturing operation, but the pellet plant plans are on hold. The state could accommodate a future request from the company to use a section of the airport property. (H. 172)\* Complete streets: Requires the state and municipalities to consider the needs and safety of all users of roads -- motorists, bicyclists, pedestrians and users of public transportation. Requirement applies to projects not yet engineered. (H. 198)\* Rest areas: Requires the Legislature's fiscal experts to report by Nov. 1 on how the cost of rest areas should be apportioned between transportation and tourism. (H. 443)\* Signs: Allows more messages on signs along state roads, such as condolences or birthday greetings, but requires Travel Information Council to review and recommend revisions to sign rules by July 1, 2012. Directs council to consider the timing of flashing signs. (H. 443)"
234," \\Brattleboro – In some Vermont towns, old landfills have become hot commodities.\Spurred in part by the state’s new net-metering rules, solar developers are scrambling to build photovoltaic arrays on closed, capped landfills that previously had been considered useless for development.\The trend encompasses big arrays – such as a 5-megawatt project slated for Brattleboro’s former landfill – as well as smaller arrays that can fit on more compact municipal dumps.\While there are engineering hurdles to overcome, developers say it’s well worth the effort.\“Up until recently, there hasn’t been that much solar on landfills in Vermont,” said Ralph Meima, project development director for Waterbury-based Green Lantern Group. “It’s an area that was neglected.”\As Vermont officials have pushed to expand renewable energy generation, the proper siting of such projects has emerged as a major issue.\Wind turbines may be the most contentious example, but solar siting also is up for debate — particularly for those who want to conserve prime agricultural land. So state policies have begun pushing arrays toward land that’s already been developed.\For example, Act 174 from 2016 set up “preferred locations” for renewable energy projects including gravel pits, quarries and landfills. The state’s preference for developing solar arrays was further reinforced by new net-metering regulations.\The state Public Utility Commission’s net-metering rule, numbered 5.100 and adopted in June of this year, sets up financial incentives for small-scale solar projects sited on preferred sites including a “sanitary landfill … provided that the secretary of Natural Resources certifies that the land constitutes such a landfill and is suitable for the development of the plant.”\“Nobody looked at the smaller landfills, as far as I know, until rule 5.100 changed,” Meima said.\Green Lantern now is looking to develop solar arrays on former landfills in Cambridge and Newfane and on a landfill shared by Bethel and Royalton. Each are 150 kilowatt projects.\In an advance notice of the Newfane project filed with the state, Meima summed up the project’s attributes this way: The array “will generate local and state tax revenue; will generate lease revenue for the town of Newfane; will maximize the economic use of this parcel; and will further the state’s renewable energy goals.”\“Maximizing use” is one key argument for landfill solar: There’s not much else municipal officials can do with a closed and capped dump.\“I just think it’s a win-win situation for the homeowners and residents of Newfane,” said Carol Hatcher, Newfane Selectboard chairwoman. “It’s a perfect place. It’s a perfect use of that land.”\The same argument may apply in Wilmington, where Green Lantern is proposing an array on a town-owned parcel next to a closed landfill.\While Wilmington’s dump is too steep to build on, the adjoining land – which has been used as a temporary storage area — is a prime spot for a 150 kilowatt solar project and still will qualify as a “preferred site” by state standards, Meima said.\“It’s sitting there, available for a better use,” he said.\In pitching the Newfane array, Meima also assured local officials that “there will be no undue adverse impacts from construction or operation of the facility.”\Poor aesthetics are one potential adverse impact of a solar array. But given that landfills tend to be located away from the public eye, some see such sites as ideal hosts for large numbers of solar panels.\The state Public Utility Commission noted that benefit earlier this year when approving a 5 megawatt solar array at Windham Solid Waste Management District in Brattleboro.\“Normally a solar facility of this size would have some adverse aesthetic impacts on the surrounding environment just by virtue of its scale and visibility,” commission members wrote. “However, in this case, the project will be sited on a closed landfill in an heavily developed industrial area.”\Burlington-based Encore Renewable Energy, along with Hong Kong-based Sky Solar, is developing the Brattleboro landfill project, which is net-metered despite its size due to a special statutory exemption. A number of towns and schools are signed up as off-takers and are expecting big utility bill reductions as a result.\Encore also is in the midst of commissioning a 2.1 megawatt, net-metered solar project on South Burlington’s landfill.\“The site was identified as opportune for solar because it is proximal to existing infrastructure … with minimal aesthetic or environmental impacts,” said Derek Moretz, Encore’s chief development officer.\No matter the size of the array, landfill solar presents some logistical difficulties.\Bob Spencer, Windham Solid Waste’s executive director, noted that getting the district’s 5 megawatt project off the ground was “very time consuming” and expensive: The district incurred a total expense of about $50,000, and a previous developer connected to the project reimbursed half of that.\Given the highly technical nature of the array, Windham Solid Waste needed to hire an expert just to develop a request for proposals at the start of the project. Now, after years of work, construction is scheduled to begin in mid-November and crews “will work throughout winter when weather permits,” Spencer said.\Moretz said building arrays on landfills presents “inherent challenges.”\“Extensive geotechnical and structural engineering is required, along with additional permitting to ensure the landfill cap is not compromised,” he said.\Moretz added that “specialized equipment is required during construction to move about the site,” and foundations require concrete ballast blocks that are more costly than typical solar installations.\Nevertheless, Meima noted that, as long as a landfill is “geotechnically stable, there’s an economic incentive to put a solar array there.”\That’s not to say, however, that the current landfill solar boom will last: Meima said it could be over within a few years after easily developable sites are snapped up.\Moretz believes the state’s new net-metering program, with its emphasis on preferred sites, actually is “a step backwards from the old program” because it limits development.\“There are only a select few landfills in Vermont which can be utilized for solar, in that most are too steep or too small to achieve the scale (needed to) overcome the fixed costs of development,” he said.\CREDIT: By Mike Faher"

Here are some of the higher-profile bills that didn't pass this year.\* Campaign finance: After the U.S. Supreme Court threw out Vermont's 1997 campaign finance law, Vermont has been operating under previous law for campaign finance limits, although it is unclear whether that would withstand legal challenge. A bill establishing new limits became stuck in the Senate amid a dispute over whether to ban corporate contributions.\* Day care workers: A bill to allow day care workers union bargaining rights with the state passed the House, but faces opposition in the Senate.\* Education chief: A bill that would elevate the state education commissioner to a secretary and shift oversight of the position from the state Education Board to the governor passed neither chamber.\* Election ballots: A bill requiring towns with at least 1,000 voters to use machine tabulators in the general elections and for all towns to use standard-sized ballots passed the House and is pending in the Senate.\* Environmental participation: Legislation passed the House and is pending in the Senate that would allow affected parties input on penalties enacted on those with environmental violations. Environmentalists support the change; business groups oppose it.\* Income tax adjustment: House Speaker Shap Smith said his biggest disappointment of the session was not acting on recommendations of last year's Blue Ribbon Tax Commission, which he said ran into complications. Smith said he hopes to shift Vermont's income tax to parallel that of neighboring states, basing it on adjusted gross income rather than gross income. He said there is less support for a proposal to levy sales tax on services.\* Marijuana decriminalization: Gov. Peter Shumlin was a particular supporter of decriminalizing possession of small amounts of marijuana, but Smith opposed the bill. Supporters will try again next year.\* Open meetings: A bill clarifying the state's open meetings law and creating penalties for municipal officials who violate. It passed the House and Senate, but they failed to reach agreement on differences and expect to resume discussions next year.\* Physician-assisted suicide: Supporters believe they had the votes in the House but not the Senate to pass an Oregon-style law that would allow those near the end of terminal illness to legally take a lethal dose of prescribed medication, but Smith declined to allow the House to take up the emotionally draining issue is it wasn't going to pass both chambers. Supporters plan to try again next year.\* Vital records: A bill revamping the state's vital records-keeping system, and restricting who could obtain a certified copy of a birth certificate, passed the House and is pending in the Senate."

West Lebanon - Improved technology, expanded manufacturing and skilled installation are making solar power more affordable for home use, and government incentives are bringing the amortized monthly payments of units to about the same as electric bills.
\
Even in the often-cloudy Upper Valley, more efficient solar panels allow contractors to size units so they can provide all or most of the annual electricity needs of a home, and the investment in residential solar now is estimated to be repaid in about seven years, rather than the 20 it took a few years ago.
\
Behind the lower prices, which some experts say are about one-third of what they were in 2008, is not only more efficient equipment, but also the drop in the cost of key materials as well as better manufacturing and installation methods.
\
""One of the most dramatic things that has happened is the drop in the price of silicon, which is used in solar panels,"" said Charles R. Sullivan, an associate professor of engineering at the Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth, who specializes renewable energy.
\
""And the industry has gotten more mature. There have been vast improvements in the production process, and the technology is helping maximize the efficiency,"" Sullivan said.
\
Improved technology is helping systems be more efficient in the Northeast and elsewhere, but even the older solar panels work pretty well here, Sullivan said, noting that Thayer researchers were surprised by the results of a study tracking the performance of a system that was installed at the school in 1996.
\
""It put out more than the predictions,"" about two-thirds of what a similar system would have done in sunnier parts of the country.
\
Residential and commercial solar use is growing more rapidly in the darker Northeast than in more sunny areas because of the high cost of electricity in this part country, said James Resor, chief executive officer of GroSolar, a national company with headquarters in Wilder.
\
""We're seeing tremendous growth in Vermont and on the East Coast,"" Resor said. ""It's much more feasible in the Northeast than in the South, for example, where they use cheap coal, dirty to generate electricity.""
\
Most of the systems installed in New Hampshire and Vermont are connected to the grid with a net metering system that gives customers credits that can be applied to utility bills for up to 12 months. In the Northeast, the credits built up during the sunny summer months reduce bills during the darker winter when the panels are at their lowest production.
\
Solar collectors not connected to the grid provide free power when the sun is out, but they require batteries for electricity storage - not used with net metering - and in many cases back-up generators to cover the darker months. And homeowners living off the grid also must manage their usage carefully to keep the lights on, and often are required to give up some non-essential appliances.
\
""It's a little like living on a sailboat, I would think,"" said Rebecca Bailey, who has lived off the grid for more than 20 years with her husband Jim Schley and family in Strafford.
\
""We don't have a dishwasher. We do have computers, but I'd kill for a toaster. I really miss that,"" Bailey said.
\
In many cases, the most expensive part of a solar installation is the labor, which can run half as much as the hardware, and users can reduce those costs dramatically by doing the work themselves, Sullivan said, adding that not everyone has the skills necessary for the job or wants to put up with the inconvenience.
\
There are, however, online and video courses that provide detailed instructions for installing manufactured panels and for building solar panels using materials that can be purchased at hardware stores along with readily available solar cells and hardware.
\
Electric utility bills in Vermont and New Hampshire range between $700 to $900 per year. An installed solar photovoltaic, roof-mounted system costing about $7,100 after rebates, incentives and tax credits can provide a utility bill savings of $923 a year, said Nathan Kleinschmidt, sales manager for Home Comfort Warehouse, a White River Junction company that installs solar units.
\
In both states, there is financing available that covers 100 percent of the cost of solar units. A loan on units that produce enough electricity for a $1,000 annual savings would have monthly payments of about $55, or $660 per year.
\
All-Earth Renewables, a national developer and manufacturer of solar panels based in Williston, Vt., has started a new leasing program pegging the rent of its units to its estimated production.
\
For example, a homeowner with an electric bill of $100 per month would lease panels that would produce enough power to meet the household need over a year, reducing the electric bills to zero and the rent for the units would be a fixed at $100 a month, said Andrew Savage, company director of communication and public affairs.
\
Included in the rent is the complete installation and maintenance of the units, which feature the company's pole-mounted, dual-axis system that uses a GPS to follow the sun. The tracking units have been proven to be as much as 45 percent more efficient than fixed, roof-mounted systems, Savage said.
\
""The customers benefit from the utility savings and knowing that they are doing something that's good for the environment at no extra cost. They are locked into a fixed rent and won't have to pay higher prices when the utility bills go up. And after seven years, they can buy the system, which will last another 20 or more years at a reduced cost,"" he said.
\
Although he had used solar hot water for almost two decades, Bob Walker just put in a photovoltaic system at his Thetford home a little more than a year ago when the prices came down.
\
""Before we put it in, our bills were running $40 to $50 a month. Since then, we've had bills of $20, but I think we're going be pretty close to zero for the year. We're very happy, and I think we may even add more panels.
\
In the future, solar photovoltaic systems probably will become even cheaper because of new materials that will replace silicon, said Thayer Assistant Professor of Engineering Jifend Liu, who is working on thin-film solar cells using nano particles that has the promise of cutting costs in half.
\
""We're looking at very thin coatings that will transfer heat at high temperatures and will be much efficient,"" he said.
\
The market is growing rapidly and the research is expanding, Liu said. ""We're making technical advances in engineering and improving battery storage is making progress. I think the future is bright.""

Woodstock - Some of the energy contained in the sunlight shining down on the grass of a pasture off Route 4 in Taftsville might soon be converted to 500 kilowatts of electricity, enough to power about 90 homes, says a developer who has proposed building a solar farm on the site.
\
Tom Garden, owner of the Massachusetts-based firm Triland Partners, plans to apply to the state Public Service Board for permission to erect a series of solar panels that would cover about 3 acres of the 15-acre site, which sits above the Taftsville Cemetery, about a quarter mile west of the Taftsville Covered Bridge on Route 4.
\
To Garden, the Woodstock site seems to have been custom-tailored for solar energy.
\
The sunny field would require no clearing of trees, is set well back from the road, and already has power lines running along the western and southern boundaries, which he said already gives it the feel of a utility zone. And it's also within a quarter mile of a Green Mountain Power substation, which means it can connect to the grid with minimal hassle.
\
Woodstock Town Planner Michael Brands said the town is likely to support or oppose the project based on how well two specific concerns are addressed.
\
One concern, Brands said, is the visual impact of the panels, which would be facing away from Route 4.
\
""The back side is not as beautiful as the front side,"" Brands said.
\
Brands said any possible glare caused by sun glinting off the 10-foot-tall metal posts could be eliminated by planting vegetation around the border. Garden said he does plan to plant screening to hide the panels from a neighboring cemetery on the project's eastern border, but he doesn't think the visual impact from Route 4 will be significant.
\
""I just don't want to promise something that I think, at the end of the day, is not necessary,"" he said. Garden said he planned to commission a visual aid that will give people a better idea of what it will look like from the road. He said the mock-up will allay those concerns.
\
""If you're driving the speed limit on Route 4, you will barely notice it if you're traveling west,"" he said. ""And I doubt you'll be able to see it at all when you're traveling east.""
\
The town's other possible concern has to do with the land itself.
\
Brands said that about 25 years ago, another development plan on the site was eventually scuttled because part of the property lies on Class III wetlands.
\
Under Vermont state law, Class I and Class II wetlands appear on the Vermont significant wetlands maps, or have been identified by state officials as having a certain amount of environmental value.
\
Class III wetlands, of the type on the proposed solar farm site, meet the definition of a wetland, but have not been identified for protection.
\
Brands said that the Public Service Board is only required to consider Class I and Class II wetlands when issuing a permit.
\
Garden acknowledged the concern, and said he was working with an environmental consultant to find the edges of the wetland.
\
""We want to stay out of the wetland and avoid the buffer as well,"" he said.
\
Garden said the wetlands division of the Agency of Natural Resources also is a part of the state permitting process.
\
Solar Market Heating Up
\
Garden, a graduate of Dartmouth College, has been a developer for 30 years. But it wasn't until 2008, when he was in Burlington visiting his son, then a University of Vermont student, that he began to think seriously about developing land in the state for solar energy.
\
His first project, a 2-megawatt facility in Williamstown, Vt., was completed in 2012. At any given time, he said, there are about a half-dozen sites where he's doing additional due diligence. Currently, he's exploring sites in Royalton, Hartford and Thetford, as well as an additional site in Williamstown, among others.
\
Garden said that, given the chance, he would develop nothing but solar.
\
""It's somewhat more rewarding because, rather than dealing with neighbors to discuss traffic and noise and lights and trash, I was talking about a solar farm that generates no traffic, generates no noise, is good for the environment, and adds no burden on the sewer system,"" Garden said. ""It feels good. It very much feels good.""
\
Garden isn't the only developer to sit up and take notice of the new fiscal realities surrounding solar power.
\
While the number of solar farms in Vermont remains small, the one-two punch of federal tax credits for investors and state credits for customers have set the stage for a solar energy explosion, Garden said.
\
""I think it's going to continue to grow faster and faster every year,"" he said. ""There's just a greater appreciation today for the need to improve the environment.""
\
Numbers from the U.S. Energy Information Administration show that Vermont had no measurable solar electric power industry generation before 2011. In that year, 18 megawatts of capacity came online; in 2012, that increased to 50 megawatts.
\
More recent data from the Solar Energies Industry Association suggests that solar is ramping up rapidly in the state, driven by more than 70 companies that manufacture, develop, engineer, finance or install solar apparatus.
\
The association says that as of 2014, 73 megawatts of energy were being produced in Vermont, including 38 megawatts installed in 2014 alone.
\
While the amount of electricity produced by solar panels in the state is dwarfed by other renewable energy sources, including wind turbines and hydroelectric plants, the blistering pace of solar growth is expected to continue - federal projections are that national consumption of solar power will nearly double between 2013 and 2016.
\
Vermont's Solar System
\
In 2005, Vermont began actively tinkering with the state's electricity market with the creation of the Sustainably Priced Energy Development program, commonly referred to as SPEED. The program was created to transition to 75 percent renewable sources for energy produced in the state by 2032.
\
The law has been beefed up in 2009, 2012 and 2013, each time to modify the basic ""standard offer program,"" which gives long term, fixed price contracts to renewable energy facilities like solar farms. Triland would make the electricity produced on its site available to customers through a net metering program.
\
The state guarantees Triland a value of 19 cents per kilowatt produced; Triland would sell those credits to its customers at a cost of about 17 cents per kilowatt.
\
One of the more controversial aspects of state law has to do with local control.
\
Brands and Woodstock Town Manager Phil Swanson both pointed out that the town has a limited role in the proceedings.
\
""Because it's an energy facility, the laws do not allow the town to regulate it by issuing it or deny it a zoning permit. The town has no say,"" Swanson said.
\
The Public Service Board does review the Town Plan as part of their deliberations and asks the town for input, but the town doesn't have a seat at the table where the decision gets made.
\
Garden said that power should remain with the state.
\
""The process is controlled by the Public Service Board, as it should be for any energy project. That's the right way for the process to happen,"" Garden said. ""But there are some communities that say they want more of a say in the process. They have a say now. They just want more say.""
\
Garden said he's met with town officials, several abutters and Sustainable Woodstock in an effort to garner support from the community.
\
""I don't want this to be something forced on people,"" he said. ""I want them to have input into the process.""
\
Neighbors Weigh In
\
Two neighbors to the project offered differing points of view; both said their opinions were more heavily influenced by the larger political context surrounding solar power than by personal gain or loss.
\
Horst Dresler, owner of an abutting print shop, said he wouldn't support other types of development on the land, but the solar farm receives his stamp of approval because of the environmental benefits.
\
""Let's face it,"" Dresler said. ""Renewable energy is a positive step.""
\
Victoria Brooks, who owns the Historic Taftsville Country Store right up the road from the site, said she, too, is a big supporter of alternative energy sources like solar power.
\
""The concept, the philosophy, the mission, I am absolutely on board with,"" she said.
\
Still, she was reserving judgment on the proposed solar farm because she is bothered by the idea that government subsidies are structured in such a way as to insert layers of middlemen between the consumer and the solar power.
\
""If only big corporations are able to harness the sun, it undermines the spirit of the whole idea,"" she said.
\
Brooks said she expected to form a more solid opinion as she learns more about the proposal.
\
""I want to weigh the benefits against what we have to give up, in terms of how many people there are between us and the sun,"" she said.

NORTH POWNAL -- Chef and restaurant owner Bill Scully has a winning recipe for restoring dormant Vermont hydropower facilities.
\
Work began in August on the North Bennington resident's $4 million project to overhaul a long-idle generation plant at a former factory site in North Pownal. By March, Scully expects his company, Hoosic River Hydro LLC, will have new generating equipment installed with a capacity of up to 500 kilowatts.
\
The project is the second hydropower project restoration Scully has undertaken in the past eight years. His first plant is operating in the village of North Bennington. There, in 2015, he brought the former Vermont Tissue Paper mill dam facility on the Walloomsac River back online.
\
To weigh that accomplishment, you have to understand that most of the hundreds of aging hydropower facilities in the state had shut down with the rise of natural gas- and oil-powered generation plants. Scully's Tissue Mill facility was only the second -- by six months -- to be licensed in Vermont over a 28-year period.
\
Then, consider that he also operates Pangaea restaurant in North Bennington and says he wades through most of the hydropower permitting paperwork during the winter when restaurant business slows.
\
The new venture, Hoosic River Hydro, is focused on the site of a former textile mill and later tannery on the Hoosic River off Route 346, and it utilizes the existing 153-foot wide, 18-foot high concrete dam.
\
With the complex permitting hurdles finally overcome, Scully said the turbine and generator system should be installed and ready for testing in March 2017. The power plant could go online a month later.
\
""I am pretty excited about the benefits these projects bring,"" he said. ""This is something to feel good about.""
\
The former mill's hydropower component dates to the 1860s, and the electricity generation equipment was installed in the 1930s and produced what Scully estimates was in the range of 250 kilowatts at peak level. Hoosic River Hydro will replace the old equipment with a 500-kilowatt Wasserkraft Kaplan turbine and new generator.
\
The current dam was constructed during the 1950s, replacing less durable structures dating back to the mill's early history.
\
Licensing and permitting were somewhat streamlined in this case, Scully said, because he only had to apply for an amended license, not a new one, reflecting the modern equipment's increased output. But it was a lengthy slough just the same, he said. It involved mounds of paperwork and dealing with the federal Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources, the state's brownfields redevelopment program and other entities, as well as the utility that will purchase the electricity generated -- Green Mountain Power.
\
State Rep. Bill Botzow, D-Pownal-Woodford, lauded the effort, saying that Scully has become ""a master"" at bringing back defunct hydropower plants because of his experience at the two Bennington County sites.
\
""Bill has done a really remarkable job,"" Botzow said. The state representative said that several other developers looked at the North Pownal site, but could not overcome the environmental and licensing issues -- including pollution in sediment behind the dam.
\
""We are fortunate to have him living in our area,"" Botzow said.
\
The hydropower facility was shut down in the 1980s when the factory business, then called the Pownal Tanning Co., declared bankruptcy and closed. The rambling brick mill, which began life as a textile factory in the mid-1800s, was converted into a hide-tanning facility in 1935.
\
Pollution resulting from that operation, in and around the mill and in ""lagoon"" areas nearby where tanning wastes were stored, led to the mill parcels being declared a federal Superfund site in 1999.
\
The federal government subsequently funded demolition of the mill and oversaw a multimillion-dollar cleanup of the Superfund sites, which today include a town park alongside a bridge crossing the Hoosic. That work was completed in the early 2000s, and the town has since entertained several expressions of interest in restoring the hydropower operation.
\
Complicating matters were the polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) that flowed down the river -- likely from mills in nearby Massachusetts -- and settled behind the concrete dam.
\
This week, crews with Bankcroft Contracting Corp., of Maine, the general contractor specializing in hydropower facility work, were setting up a temporary cofferdam behind the concrete dam to allow the approximately 1,500 cubic yards of contaminated soil to be first de-watered and then removed for trucking to a hazardous waste disposal site.
\
Scully said the experience of dealing with similar deposits of PCBs and dioxin behind the Vermont Tissue Paper dam made it easier to obtain an accurate assessment of the extent of the contaminated sediment through test borings and a map of the surface of the impoundment area bed.
\
Green Mountain Power crews also have been busy recently, running transmission lines to the site from the state highway -- some of that installed underground where they crossed the town's riverside park.
\
The electricity generated at the North Pownal site -- estimated at 3.5 million kilowatts per year -- will be distributed as net-metering credits to Southern Vermont College and Southwestern Vermont Medical Center, both in Bennington, and to the town of Pownal.
\
In an announcement, SVC President David Evans said, ""This hydropower project not only helps to change the energy landscape in Vermont away from non-renewable resources, it also creates new jobs, helps to bring back fish passages that have not existed for years, and substantially remediates streambed pollution from earlier industrial uses. While the college will not be directly powered by the hydro plant, we can offset most or all of our electricity use through our participation in the net-metering group.""
\
Pownal Select Board Chairman Ronald Bisson noted that in addition to a lower electricity rate for town buildings, the development will bring in new tax revenue.
\
""I'm all for hydro,"" he said. ""And this is good for the environment and runs constantly, not like solar or wind [generation facilities].""
\
Scully said he was inspired about eight years ago to enter the labyrinth of state and federal regulations and requirements involved in hydropower facilities, which had slowly withered to be replaced by oil and gas facilities.
\
""The irony,"" he said, ""is that Vermont was built on hydro.""
\
Scully said his primary motivation was environmental, because of the potential to reduce carbon emissions and global warming through a renewable resource that he noted is capable of generating power up to 24 hours a day, unlike solar facilities requiring sunlight to operate.
\
""When I got into this eight years ago,"" Scully said, ""I asked, 'Why aren't people doing this?'""
\
Settling first on the North Bennington mill, he and partners in that venture invested about $2.25 million -- with financing help through the Vermont Economic Development Authority -- to restore a facility that opened in 2015 and generates up to 360 kilowatts of power. That electricity is distributed to local businesses and the town of Bennington in the form of net-metering credits through Green Mountain Power.
\
While the facility will be fully automated, it will be closely monitored through cameras and equipment sensors and will be checked on a daily basis.
\
Scully and Armin Moehrle, his partner in Hoosic River Hydro LLC, approached the Pownal Select Board about leasing the dam in 2012. The town obtained control of the facility from the former Massachusetts-based factory owners following the Superfund cleanup.
\
VEDA financing ""played a vital role"" in making both projects possible, Scully stressed, as did the state's brownfields program. In fact, despite the challenging task of completing forms and developing technical plans for the various agencies involved, Scully said public officials in all aspects of the process ""have been immensely helpful.""
\
Acknowledging those who advocate removing old mill dams to improve river ecosystems for aquatic life, Scully praised Vermont ""for making the huge leap in making environmental policies that are compatible with hydro, but not a compromise [in preserving river systems].""
\
There are more than 1,200 aging dams in the state, he said, with roughly 200 to 400 potentially good sites for hydropower. While there are impacts on the rivers when they are dammed, ""global warming also harms the rivers,"" he said, adding that hydropower ""needs to be considered in this conversation, and that is staring to happen now.""
\
""Hydro makes a lot of sense,"" Botzow said, in that it involves working with infrastructure ""we already have,"" and often cleans up pollution in sediment, resulting in a cleaner river.

NORTH POWNAL -- Chef and restaurant owner Bill Scully has a winning recipe for restoring dormant Vermont hydropower facilities.
\
Work began in August on the North Bennington resident's $4 million project to overhaul a long-idle generation plant at a former factory site in North Pownal. By March, Scully expects his company, Hoosic River Hydro LLC, will have new generating equipment installed with a capacity of up to 500 kilowatts.
\
The project is the second hydropower project restoration Scully has undertaken in the past eight years. His first plant is operating in the village of North Bennington. There, in 2015, he brought the former Vermont Tissue Paper mill dam facility on the Walloomsac River back online.
\
To weigh that accomplishment, you have to understand that most of the hundreds of aging hydropower facilities in the state had shut down with the rise of natural gas- and oil-powered generation plants. Scully's Tissue Mill facility was only the second -- by six months -- to be licensed in Vermont over a 28-year period.
\
Then, consider that he also operates Pangaea restaurant in North Bennington and says he wades through most of the hydropower permitting paperwork during the winter when restaurant business slows.
\
The new venture, Hoosic River Hydro, is focused on the site of a former textile mill and later tannery on the Hoosic River off Route 346, and it utilizes the existing 153-foot wide, 18-foot high concrete dam.
\
With the complex permitting hurdles finally overcome, Scully said the turbine and generator system should be installed and ready for testing in March 2017. The power plant could go online a month later.
\
""I am pretty excited about the benefits these projects bring,"" he said. ""This is something to feel good about.""
\
The former mill's hydropower component dates to the 1860s, and the electricity generation equipment was installed in the 1930s and produced what Scully estimates was in the range of 250 kilowatts at peak level. Hoosic River Hydro will replace the old equipment with a 500-kilowatt Wasserkraft Kaplan turbine and new generator.
\
The current dam was constructed during the 1950s, replacing less durable structures dating back to the mill's early history.
\
Licensing and permitting were somewhat streamlined in this case, Scully said, because he only had to apply for an amended license, not a new one, reflecting the modern equipment's increased output. But it was a lengthy slough just the same, he said. It involved mounds of paperwork and dealing with the federal Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources, the state's brownfields redevelopment program and other entities, as well as the utility that will purchase the electricity generated -- Green Mountain Power.
\
State Rep. Bill Botzow, D-Pownal-Woodford, lauded the effort, saying that Scully has become ""a master"" at bringing back defunct hydropower plants because of his experience at the two Bennington County sites.
\
""Bill has done a really remarkable job,"" Botzow said. The state representative said that several other developers looked at the North Pownal site, but could not overcome the environmental and licensing issues -- including pollution in sediment behind the dam.
\
""We are fortunate to have him living in our area,"" Botzow said.
\
The hydropower facility was shut down in the 1980s when the factory business, then called the Pownal Tanning Co., declared bankruptcy and closed. The rambling brick mill, which began life as a textile factory in the mid-1800s, was converted into a hide-tanning facility in 1935.
\
Pollution resulting from that operation, in and around the mill and in ""lagoon"" areas nearby where tanning wastes were stored, led to the mill parcels being declared a federal Superfund site in 1999.
\
The federal government subsequently funded demolition of the mill and oversaw a multimillion-dollar cleanup of the Superfund sites, which today include a town park alongside a bridge crossing the Hoosic. That work was completed in the early 2000s, and the town has since entertained several expressions of interest in restoring the hydropower operation.
\
Complicating matters were the polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) that flowed down the river -- likely from mills in nearby Massachusetts -- and settled behind the concrete dam.
\
This week, crews with Bankcroft Contracting Corp., of Maine, the general contractor specializing in hydropower facility work, were setting up a temporary cofferdam behind the concrete dam to allow the approximately 1,500 cubic yards of contaminated soil to be first de-watered and then removed for trucking to a hazardous waste disposal site.
\
Scully said the experience of dealing with similar deposits of PCBs and dioxin behind the Vermont Tissue Paper dam made it easier to obtain an accurate assessment of the extent of the contaminated sediment through test borings and a map of the surface of the impoundment area bed.
\
Green Mountain Power crews also have been busy recently, running transmission lines to the site from the state highway -- some of that installed underground where they crossed the town's riverside park.
\
The electricity generated at the North Pownal site -- estimated at 3.5 million kilowatts per year -- will be distributed as net-metering credits to Southern Vermont College and Southwestern Vermont Medical Center, both in Bennington, and to the town of Pownal.
\
In an announcement, SVC President David Evans said, ""This hydropower project not only helps to change the energy landscape in Vermont away from non-renewable resources, it also creates new jobs, helps to bring back fish passages that have not existed for years, and substantially remediates streambed pollution from earlier industrial uses. While the college will not be directly powered by the hydro plant, we can offset most or all of our electricity use through our participation in the net-metering group.""
\
Pownal Select Board Chairman Ronald Bisson noted that in addition to a lower electricity rate for town buildings, the development will bring in new tax revenue.
\
""I'm all for hydro,"" he said. ""And this is good for the environment and runs constantly, not like solar or wind [generation facilities].""
\
Scully said he was inspired about eight years ago to enter the labyrinth of state and federal regulations and requirements involved in hydropower facilities, which had slowly withered to be replaced by oil and gas facilities.
\
""The irony,"" he said, ""is that Vermont was built on hydro.""
\
Scully said his primary motivation was environmental, because of the potential to reduce carbon emissions and global warming through a renewable resource that he noted is capable of generating power up to 24 hours a day, unlike solar facilities requiring sunlight to operate.
\
""When I got into this eight years ago,"" Scully said, ""I asked, 'Why aren't people doing this?'""
\
Settling first on the North Bennington mill, he and partners in that venture invested about $2.25 million -- with financing help through the Vermont Economic Development Authority -- to restore a facility that opened in 2015 and generates up to 360 kilowatts of power. That electricity is distributed to local businesses and the town of Bennington in the form of net-metering credits through Green Mountain Power.
\
While the facility will be fully automated, it will be closely monitored through cameras and equipment sensors and will be checked on a daily basis.
\
Scully and Armin Moehrle, his partner in Hoosic River Hydro LLC, approached the Pownal Select Board about leasing the dam in 2012. The town obtained control of the facility from the former Massachusetts-based factory owners following the Superfund cleanup.
\
VEDA financing ""played a vital role"" in making both projects possible, Scully stressed, as did the state's brownfields program. In fact, despite the challenging task of completing forms and developing technical plans for the various agencies involved, Scully said public officials in all aspects of the process ""have been immensely helpful.""
\
Acknowledging those who advocate removing old mill dams to improve river ecosystems for aquatic life, Scully praised Vermont ""for making the huge leap in making environmental policies that are compatible with hydro, but not a compromise [in preserving river systems].""
\
There are more than 1,200 aging dams in the state, he said, with roughly 200 to 400 potentially good sites for hydropower. While there are impacts on the rivers when they are dammed, ""global warming also harms the rivers,"" he said, adding that hydropower ""needs to be considered in this conversation, and that is staring to happen now.""
\
""Hydro makes a lot of sense,"" Botzow said, in that it involves working with infrastructure ""we already have,"" and often cleans up pollution in sediment, resulting in a cleaner river.

240,"Vermonters for a Clean Environment was pleased with the net-metering legislation, which enables increased photovoltaic net metering.\However, on energy policy, the Legislature failed to address and revise the process for siting energy projects, including wind, solar, biomass, pipelines and transmission lines.\State agencies are short-staffed, and neighbors and towns are overwhelmed by the Public Service Board's overly legalistic process -- which could not be better designed to discourage input that might move us forward in building appropriately sited renewable energy, and treat Vermonters with respect as they are confronted with multibillion-dollar energy sprawl proposals.\Whose renewables?\The Legislature failed once again to fix the problem created by the sale of Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) to out-of-state by utilities.\The result: Vermont's mountains and fields are being used to produce renewable energy to meet the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) of Massachusetts, and not create real renewable energy for Vermonters. This flawed policy simultaneously allows RECs to be used to meet both Vermont's renewable energy goals and another state's RPS.\Connecticut has passed legislation disallowing Vermont's RECs to be used to meet that state's RPS, if those RECs are already being used to meet Vermont's Sustainably Priced Energy Development (SPEED) goals. The house of cards the Legislature put in place in 2005 to avoid creating an RPS seems to be falling apart.\Citing siting\Vermont's next Legislature would do well to focus on creating a more collaborative process for building real renewable energy and establishing siting standards that discourage the destruction of our high-elevation mountaintop environments and the degradation of water resources and prime agricultural soils.\Neighbors and towns dealing with pipelines and transmission lines also need assistance. A public advocate similar to New Hampshire's system (which designates an attorney from the Attorney General's Office to make legal filings on behalf of parties not represented by legal counsel) is one model the Vermont Legislature could adopt.\Land-use planning\The Growth Center bill was problematic in that it proposed to create a new process for the Natural Resources Board. We were pleased when that provision was dropped in favor of utilizing existing and effective District Commission procedures and staff to implement the growth center improvements.\On the other issues, VCE does not see much progress in improving water quality protections. In fact what we see instead is the Agency of Natural Resources issuing approvals for siting solar projects on Class II wetlands, and we see the Agency of Agriculture pulling out completely from providing input to the Public Service Board on solar projects proposed for prime agricultural soils.\In the recent legislative session we worked to help defeat a proposal to expand ANR's powers to degrade water resources without public involvement or oversight.\Close call\VCE partnered with town officials and the Vermont League of Cities and Towns to successfully press for revisions to the permitting process for cell towers in the coming years.\As the build-out of the state's cell and wireless coverage has continued, more and more communities have faced bullying developers who have used the expedited ""Section 248a"" permitting process to brush aside requests for alterations to their tower siting proposals.\Faced with strong testimony from town leaders, the House Commerce Committee agreed to make modest changes to the permitting process to allow towns to more easily participate in the permit review process.\The committee also gave the Department of Public Service a larger role in the process, and allowed them more leeway to hire experts at the developer's expense.\The committee, skeptical of the department's willingness to vigorously advocate for towns, requires the DPS to report back on their actions in this area. That will provide another forum for towns and citizens to press for further revisions, if needed.\Annette Smith is the executive director\of Danby-based nonprofit Vermonters\for a Clean Environment: www.VCE.org"
241,"Annette Smith, executive director of Danby-based nonprofit Vermonters for a Clean Environment: I expect he will talk about resiliency, because that is the buzzword of the day regarding climate change adaptation. That comment will probably be preceded by some statement about the urgency of addressing climate change. Those comments are likely to refer to rivers and streams in valleys, not on mountain tops which is where the headwaters begin and are the most pure water in the world.\Chris Kilian, director of the Montpelier-based nonprofit Conservation Law Foundation in Vermont: Gov. Shumlin is likely to emphasize the orderly and effective closure and cleanup of the Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant, and transition to clean energy and economic development in Windham County. This is a critically important effort that flows from the Governor's concerted effort to press for closure of this old, leaky facility.\The governor will highlight Vermont's agreement with Entergy to clean up and restore the site as soon as possible in order to avoid being saddled with a mothballed facility -- that would present a long-term risk to health, safety and redevelopment.\Kathryn Blume, board chairwoman for nonprofit 350VT: The governor said Wednesday that ""all Vermonters deserve to live in a state ... where we have a clean environment, with a bright, renewable energy future."" Based on that statement, we can probably assume he'll be addressing water quality, because Lake Champlain still has enormous problems with excess phosphorous.\We also imagine he'll be talking about the thermal efficiency of our buildings, an issue of which Vermonters will be acutely conscious, following our recent brush with some intensely Arctic temperatures.\He might talk about the Comprehensive Energy Plan, and Vermont's goal of 90 percent renewable energy by 2050. But then again, he might not, given the fact that funding a program that ambitious might require him to spend more political capital than he's willing to part with. But he certainly should talk about it, because serious as opiate addiction is (and it is), climate change trumps everything.\Keith Brunner, organizer, Rising Tide Vermont: I think it's likely that he'll emphasize the fracked gas pipeline, which is critical infrastructure for the kind of big business-led economic development he'd like to see in Addison and Rutland counties. The fact that his position on the pipeline directly contradicts his support for community-led renewable energy or Vermont's historic ban on fracking doesn't seem to faze him.\When you take a step back though, it's not surprising. The governor is an expert in championing selective environmental causes -- like shutting down Vermont Yankee, or banning fracking -- but his real allegiance lies with the biggest businesses and utilities which operate in the state -- like Gaz Metro, for example. Despite the progressive rhetoric, his actions often place him fundamentally at odds with folks organizing for basic human rights and dignity in Vermont.\Gabrielle Stebbins, executive director of Montpelier-based nonprofit and trade group Renewable Energy Vermont: We look forward to the governor addressing net-metering -- not only for the economic impact that this has for Vermonters generating their own power and for the many Vermont renewable businesses that build renewable energy systems for their customers, but also for the environmental impact that net-metering has in promoting more clean energy that, ultimately, mitigates climate change.\An area that the governor has already addressed -- on December 23rd -- was funding through the Vermont Yankee settlement for the Clean Energy Development Fund (CEDF). This fund yields roughly $5 to $6 of investment for every $1 of incentive -- and has made it possible for countless Vermonters to go renewable, while keeping Vermont jobs going. Finding funds for the CEDF is greatly appreciated -- though we still have to figure out a plan to fund this program beyond one year.\Rob Roper, president of Concord-based nonprofit Ethan Allen Institute: He'll emphasize the expansion of renewable energy. Because many of his major donors will profit immensely from the subsidies for such projects, and it is an issue that has a national fundraising base for his next campaign. Shumlin for Senate '16!\Lori Fisher, executive director of nonprofit Lake Champlain Committee: Gov. Shumlin needs to talk about how we are going to clean up and protect Lake Champlain, our major natural resource asset. State agencies recently released a draft plan outlining a suite of actions to further reduce phosphorus loading to the lake. ... The state acknowledges that the ""biggest reason"" the lake has been slow to recover ""is that we have not done enough."" ...\The cleanup plan will require changes to local ordinances, tightening agricultural programs, updating stormwater and forest management practices, ensuring river channel stability, and creating new permit programs for roadways in order to remove phosphorus before it gets into waterways.\In outlining his budget priorities the governor needs to take the opportunity to present the plan, consequences of inaction, and technical and financial resources necessary to accomplish the task."

Former auditor Brock to run for state Senate
\
SWANTON (AP) -- Former State Auditor Randy Brock is running for office again this fall, but he's not going to try to get his old job back.
\
Brock, a Republican, says he's going to run for the state Senate from Franklin County.
\
He will be running against two Democrats.
\
Two years ago Brock lost the auditor's office to Tom Salmon after a recount by 102 votes out of 111,770 votes cast.
\
Salmon is serving with the Naval Reserve and is headed to Afghanistan and so will not be able to campaign actively for re-election.
\
Franklin County's two Democratic Sens. Don Collins and Sara Kittell say they both plan to seek re-election.

State panel approves GMP solar push
\
COLCHESTER (AP) -- The state Public Service Board has approved a plan by Vermont's second-largest power company to encourage the installation of solar power by homeowners and businesses.
\
The SolarGMP program will work in conjunction with existing net metering programs in which Vermonters using solar power feed energy back into the grid when it is not needed in the home or business.
\
Under the new solar rates program, customers will now be paid by Green Mountain Power for all solar energy generated at a rate of six cents per kilowatthour above and beyond the 12 to 13 cents per kilowatthour net metering benefit.
\
Solar generates the bulk of its power during hot summer days when electric system use is at its highest. GMP officials say the new solar power will replace the expensive power that Green Mountain Power otherwise would have to by from the New England power grid during peak demand.

A judge issued the order after Sharon Francis missed a court-ordered appointment with a defense attorney for Bryant Garrow and then didn't try to reschedule the meeting.
\
Court officials say Francis called to say she was out of state at a funeral, but Garrow's attorney Matthew Hartnett says she knew about the funeral in advance.
\
The 21-year-old Garrow of Proctor is charged with leaving the scene of a fatal crash for that killed 52-year-old Stewart Dickson in Rutland in April of last year.

Man pleads not guilty for hunting shooting
\
WHITE RIVER JUNCTION (AP) -- A 44-year-old Hartland hunter is pleading innocent to charges that he mistook a pair of camouflaged men for a turkey and shot them with birdshot.
\
The two victims were treated for their wounds, but recovered.
\
Ralph M. Townsend entered the pleas Tuesday to two counts of simple assault with a weapon. Court records say Townsend was hunting with his son on May 7 when he fired at what he believed was a turkey. Instead his target turned out to be two men wearing camouflage.
\
An investigation estimated Townsend fired his shotgun from about 200 feet away. If convicted, Townsend could be sentenced to a year in jail on each charge and $2,000 in fines. He's free on bail.

\
BELLOWS FALLS -- At its Tuesday night meeting, the Board of Trustees heard from a representative of a solar photovoltaic company who explained how the village could benefit from solar power.
\
Peter Thurrell of Soveren Solar was invited by Trustee Deborah Wright to explain how the village can pay less for its electricity and help the environment at the same time.
\
He said net-metering legislation passed by the state and a rapid fall in the price of solar panels have made it possible for Soveren Solar to built a photovoltaic system on village land or land that the village could lease. A photovoltaic system is one that uses solar panels to convert sunlight into electricity.
\
Net metering allows multiple households to use solar electricity generated by solar panels located elsewhere. It has been compared to community supported agriculture.
\
Thurrell said there would be no cost to the village, which would receive a credit on its electric bill. The village, he said, would get to keep a small portion of that credit and pay the rest to Soveren Solar, which would own the installed system.
\
""So basically, your electric bill will be reduced by about 5 percent. As you go forward over the next seven years, you pay less for electricity and you have the benefit that that electricity is all being generated by a renewable resource,"" he told the trustees. ""Then, after seven years, you have option where you could buy the system at its fair-market value, which will be less than half of the original cost of the system, or you could just keep on using it, getting your 5-percent-a-month savings on your electricity and after 20 years the system simply transfers ownership to the village.""
\
He said it costs $4 wholesale to buy a solar panel three years ago and now costs less than $1.
\
""What we're offering is to come in and build the system, run it and maintain it at no cost to the town, you get to save money as you go forward,"" Thurrell said.
\
When Trustee Stefan Golec expressed some confusion over how the village's relationship with Green Mountain Power -- its electricity provider -- would change, Thurrell said it wouldn't at all.
\
""Basically, we're offering to build a solar installation. Third-party owners will provide all the money to built the solar installation,"" he explained. ""Third-party owners receive the tax benefits of that installation that aren't of any use to the village because you're not a taxable entity.""
\
Municipal Manager Tim Cullenen said he likes the idea but felt blind-sided at the meeting because neither he nor Rockingham Development Director Francis ""Dutch"" Walsh had heard of the proposal beforehand. He said the whole process likely isn't as easy as ""getting this and getting that.""
\
Walsh said the only people who will make money are the third-party investors.
\
Thurrell said there will be no payback for the village because the village will not pay anything.
\
All trustees seemed to be open to the concept but wanted more research conducted. Cullenen said he, Walsh and other town officials will be looking for more information about the subject matter. He said four or five other companies have given similar pitches.
\
""The devil's in the details,"" he told the Reformer after the meeting.
\
-- During the public comment portion of the meeting, Jeremy Haskins of J & H Hardware had some concerns about how Saturday's scheduled holiday concert at the Bellows Falls Opera House will affect businesses in The Square.
\
Sponsored by the Bellows Falls Downtown Development Alliance, the one-hour concert is scheduled to begin a 1 p.m. and feature the choir, concert band and jazz ensemble of Bellows Falls Union High School.
\
Haskins said the weeks leading up to Christmas are the busiest of the year for downtown merchants.
\
Village President Roger Riccio asked Cullenen if anything could be done and the municipal manager said the trustees can choose to enforce the village's two-hour parking limit but there would be overtime costs associated with that.
\
He said enforcement would be difficult. He said the BFPD has one or two officers on duty at any one time and said enforcement should probably come from BFDDA volunteers.
\
A special meeting is scheduled for 10 a.m. today in the Rockingham Town Hall Lower Theatre to discuss the issue of parking.
\
In other business:
\
-- Cullenen filled in for Rockingham Finance Officer Chip Stearns and gave the trustees a year-to-date budget status report.
\
""Broadly speaking, we're where we would anticipate to be on the budget, in terms of our expenditures,"" he said.
\
-- During his manager's report, Cullenen said the drug dropbox, made possible by a donation from the Greater Falls Prevention Coalition, is now in place in the lobby of the Bellows Falls Police Department. Police Chief Ron Lake has previously said the dropbox is for anyone who wishes to anonymously discard of unused/expired prescription drugs with no questions asked. Flushing drugs down the toilet can have a negative effect on the environment and should be avoided, he said.
\
Cullenen also said the BFPD was awarded a $15,000 grant from the Vermont Department of Public Safety Homeland Security for a mobile data terminal unit, which allows laptops to be utilized in a police cruiser.
\
-- Heather Gleim of the Bellows Falls Community Improvement Committee gave the trustees an update on Tuesday.
\
She said three months ago she made contact with Josh Hanford of the Vermont Department of Community Development about neighborhood stabilization grant money. She said the committee plans to meet with Nathan Cleveland -- one of the department's employees -- on Dec. 20.
\
-- Wright passed out a rental impact fee outline. Resident and landlord Les White, who was in attendance, called the document ""a bombshell"" and opposes it because it would be a burden to landlords in the village when the economy is already making life difficult.
\
Wright and Riccio said the outline is very preliminary and that the process simply need to start somewhere. They both said absolutely nothing is cast in stone and vote will not be taken any time soon.

MONTPELIER -- Vermont saw the nation's largest per capita gains last year for the number of solar-related jobs, leading the country in solar employment for 2013, according to an industry research group.
\
The Solar Foundation released an annual report Monday that ranked the Vermont No. 1 in the nation for solar jobs per capita. The state added nearly 1,000 solar jobs in 2013, totaling about 1,300, according to the foundation's website.
\
The report predicts solar employment will grow by 15 percent next year across the country, building on a 50 percent increase since 2010.
\
Installation costs for solar have decreased by 50 percent since 2010.
\
""Though these price reductions continue to impact certain industry sectors in different and sometimes disruptive ways, they continue to be widely and consistently cited as the leading driver of solar capacity growth,"" the report states.
\
Gov. Peter Shumlin issued a statement Tuesday on the report.
\
""This is a testament to the success of our renewable energy businesses, our forward-thinking utilities, and our innovative state policies,"" Shumlin said. ""When we build solar projects in Vermont, we not only create local clean energy for the grid, we create jobs and economic benefits for our communities.""
\
Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who serves on Senate energy and environment committees, said the solar industry is central to Vermont's ""bold vision"" to move away from fossil fuels.
\
""A dramatic expansion of solar power is a clean and economical way to help break our dependence on foreign oil, reduce greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming, and create good-paying manufacturing and installation jobs in Vermont and across the United States,"" Sanders said in a statement on the report.
\
Renewable Energy Vermont, a trade association representing the renewable energy industry, said the achievement demonstrates the strength, vitality and importance of the solar industry in the state.
\
""This success would not be possible without the Renewable Energy Vermont (REV) member companies creating new jobs; Vermont's policy makers commitment to strong renewable energy regulations; and the thousands of Vermonters who are 'going solar,'"" the statement reads.
\
The Vermont Public Interest Research Group is urging lawmakers maintain its commitment to renewable energy.
\
""With this new evidence of how much solar is bringing to the Vermont economy, we hope the Vermont Senate will move quickly to join the House in voting to build on our most successful solar program, net metering,"" said Ben Walsh, clean energy advocate with VPIRG.
\
Net metering is a program for customers to generate their own electricity and receive a credit from their utility for the power they produce.
\
The state offers a ""SPEED"" program, which guarantees renewable energy producers a fixed price for their power on projects larger than 500 kilowatts in size.

MONTPELIER -- A pending international trade deal will affect businesses in Vermont and there's little the state can do about it, lawmakers said Friday.
\
A new transatlantic trade agreement being secretly negotiated between the U.S. and European Union could challenge state laws and policies ranging from tobacco regulation to GMO labeling to procurement practices and more.
\
""People don't know enough about it to be upset,"" Sen. Ginny Lyons, D-Chittenden, said Friday. ""And the reason they don't know enough is because there's no transparency to the process.""
\
Lyons was one of several lawmakers from Vermont, Maine and New Hampshire attending an International Trade & the Environment forum on Friday and Saturday in Montpelier. The event was presented by the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators. The goal of some speakers Friday was to raise awareness of how international trade agreements can affect state and local laws.
\
Brent Raymond, Vermont's international trade director, is privy to only very limited information about the trade agreements and other negotiations made through the World Trade Organization.
\
He said in an interview Friday that he's conflicted about the prospects of the agreement. He believes global trade can be done well, Raymond said, but he's got serious concerns about this negotiating process.
\
""I have concerns about big tobacco's influence on TPP (Trans-Pacific Partnership) and WTO,"" Raymond said. Tobacco companies in the past have sued countries with strict cigarette marketing regulations, claiming the rules have hurt their business.
\
In addition to tobacco's influence, he's not seeing small businesses in the mix, in spite of the fact that small businesses -- from import/export companies to six person machine shops -- are increasingly competing in the global marketplace.
\
""I just don't feel like they're adequately represented by the representatives of the U.S. to these discussions,"" Raymond said. ""The larger multinationals weigh in a lot and have a heavy amount of influence.""
\
International trade representatives will hold their fifth round of meetings May 19-23 in Arlington, Va. They'll also take questions and solicit input from stakeholders on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) between the U.S. and EU. A different international agreement, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) also is pending. Both are compared to the North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement, but on a much larger scale.
\
Both negotiations take place in secret.
\
Maine state Rep. Sharon Treat said she's virtually the only member of the U.S. Trade Representative's Intergovernmental Policy Advisory Committee who continually speaks up about the potential impact of the trade agreements on states.
\
Treat can comment on trade documents in advance of negotiations, but is not allowed to share them or even seek counsel from subject-matter experts. And the committee is not updated after the negotiating process, so she never knows what's actually being discussed, she said.
\
This concerns her because international trade agreements have the potential to trump state and local laws. The agreements don't nullify state laws outright, but they open a door for international corporations to challenge state laws as being anti-competitive.
\
Raymond said, for example, that Vermont's net-metering program could be considered a ""subsidy.""
\
A foreign energy company that wants to enter the Vermont market may conclude that net metering constitutes an unfair market restraint. They could sue -- or threaten to sue -- and challenge the state not in U.S. court but in a closed-door international arbitration tribunal.
\
""So states' rights on a lot of different fronts are potentially at risk,"" Raymond said. ""The problem is we don't know what's being negotiated.""

The Conservation Law Foundation has filed public records requests to obtain more information about Vermont's energy plan.
\
The regional energy plan does not detail the impacts the proposal might have on ratepayers and the environment in Vermont. The plan includes a sweeping build-out of natural gas and electric transmission infrastructure, according to Sandra Levine, a senior attorney at the Conservation Law Foundation (CLF).
\
Vermont has agreed to work with other states to bring large amounts of Canadian hydroelectric power to the region to meet growing energy needs. Environmentalists say that prospect could harm ratepayers and the environment.
\
Vermont joined with five other New England states and Canada last year to share the cost of the transmission infrastructure needed to carry hydroelectric power from Canada. The additional power would help states meet their renewable energy goals and fill in for other power stations soon to go offline, such as Vermont Yankee.
\
CLF filed a public records request to the state for all documents related to transmission build-outs, natural gas pipeline capacity and hydropower imports from Canada. The requests were sent to the other states as well.
\
The Department of Public Service said new transmission projects to bring hydropower to the region would drive down the cost of electricity by competing with natural gas - which is used in other states as a source of electricity during peak demand periods.
\
""Under no circumstances would we support a project where the benefits did not outweigh the costs,"" Commissioner Chris Recchia said Friday.
\
The law foundation filed its request to find out the details of the energy plan - including which private-sector developers are involved.
\
""The Governors' regional energy plan appears to be the product of backroom deal-making rather than sound public policy informed by open dialogue,"" said Seth Kaplan, vice president of policy and climate advocacy at CLF, in a statement.
\
Vermont has made progress on building out a distributed electricity portfolio - largely through its net metering program, which allows residents and business to generate their own electricity. Sourcing new power from Canada is not designed to replace the state's growing small-scale energy industry, Recchia said.
\
An estimated $5.4 billion will be invested in the region's transmission infrastructure over the next four years, according to a recent ISO New England report.
\
Through the partnership, Vermont will be able to share its distributed generation model - which has saved the state $400 million in the past several years - with other states, reducing the need for some new transmission projects in the long term, according to the department.
\
""To the extent that we can get the states to reduce those transmission projects, we save a lot of money,"" Recchia said.
\
Nonetheless, developers have their eyes on transmission corridors to bring hydroelectric power to the region - one proposal would carry a high voltage power cable under Lake Champlain and beyond; another would pass across Maine; and the controversial Northern Pass would clear a path through New Hampshire's northern forests to bring power to Massachusetts.
\
One developer, Transmission Developers Inc., or TDI New England, has plans to run a 150-mile cable from Canada to southern Vermont. The New England Clean Power Link, as it's called, needs state and federal approval.
\
Electric Vehicles
\
The regional leaders also looked at expanding electric vehicle infrastructure, including the 138-mile Vermont-Quebec Electric Vehicle Charging Corridor, a news release stated last year.
\
The governors have agreed to put 3.3 million zero-emissions vehicles on the road by 2025. The chairwoman of Vermont's Climate Cabinet has made electric vehicles - and the infrastructure demands that come with them - a top priority in the years ahead.
\
""Almost half of our emissions in Vermont come from transportation,"" Secretary of the Agency of Natural Resources Deb Markowitz said Thursday. ""So it's a top priority in my agency as to how do we help create the right environment to make electric vehicles the right choice for Vermont families.""
\
She is working on building out a ""green corridor"" that would first connect Burlington to Montreal (and later down to Boston, Mass., and as far as New York City). Critical to this plan is setting up universal signage and adequate electric vehicle charging stations at homes, businesses, and along the corridor, she said.
\
Already, about 50 percent of Vermont communities have at least one electric vehicle, she said.

GMP Starts Solar Program
\
Green Mountain Power's groundbreaking new approach to accelerate the adoption of solar energy by Vermont homes and businesses has been approved by the Vermont Public Service Board. The program will work in conjunction with existing ""net metering"" programs, in which Vermonters using solar power feed energy back into the grid when it is not needed in the home or business. Under the new solar rates program, customers will now be paid by Green Mountain Power for all solar energy generated at a rate of six cents per kilowatthour above and beyond the 12 to 13 cents per kilowatthour net metering benefit.
\
Customers must go through appropriate net meter permitting, meter installation and inspection to begin SolarGMP. Additional information is available at www.greenmountainpower.biz.

248,"""When you save water, you also save energy -- because something like a fifth of all the energy we spend in California is spent transporting water.""\David Hochschild, California Energy Commissioner\A Californian comes to New England's west coast. It's mid-fall, and it's not all about the foliage.\Wind, sunshine and woodsmoke will figure into California Energy Commissioner David Hochschild's visit to Burlington on Thursday.\Hochschild is the keynote speaker at Renewable Energy Vermont's annual, two-day show-and-tell of trends, debates and innovations at the Sheraton Hotel and Conference Center in South Burlington.\The Californian will encounter a familiar conundrum at the core of REV's convergence: How can we make the best of things while we lean less on fossil fuels?\In a late-September interview with the Burlington Free Press, Hochschild said he had yet to finalize his remarks for the conference, but he was happy to shoot the breeze. Excerpts:\Burlington Free Press: What might Vermonters learn from Californians, in the field of renewable energy.\David Hochschild: I think Californians have a lot to learn from Vermont. You don't have to be a big state to make a big difference.\Vermont has been a pioneer in a number of important issues: health care, certainly; civil rights and marriage equality; and other issues.\BFP: How does being a pioneer make a difference?\DH: You can create models that can spread. That's certainly what we're trying to do in California. We're pushing very hard forward on a clean-energy agenda.\BFP: What are some of recent highlights of that agenda?\DH: The first major piece of legislation Gov. (Jerry) Brown signed when he came into office in 2010 was the 33-percent RPS Bill (creating a Renewable Portfolio Standard, which increases the share of non-fossil-fuel energy use).\We're on track to get one third of our energy from renewable sources by 2020.\We now have among the largest wind and solar projects in the world. Tesla employs 5,000 people. We're just seeing very rapid growth in job creation in the clean-energy field in California.\BFP: How did your career in renewable energy begin?\DH: I got into solar energy originally in South Africa in 1997, working for President Nelson Mandela in one of the townships on the eastern cape.\One of the first things the South African government did when they came into power is that they provided mail service to townships that hadn't had it before.\They did it by having these solar powered, remote post offices. They weren't connected to electricity, but they could generate their own power. At night they were lit up and people would come and get their mail, and it became a little hub in the community.\That's when I first got the twinkle in my eye about solar.\BFP: And on a larger scale?\DH: I went back to San Francisco, where I'm from, and worked as a special assistant to Mayor Willie Brown. In 2001 we put an initiative on the ballot to install solar solar panels and energy efficiency improvements on public buildings throughout the city. It was a $100 million initiative.\BFP: Did the voters go for it?\DH: It passed. There are now solar panels on the convention center, on the airport, on city hall, at reservoirs, and so on. And a lot of energy efficiency measures, as well.\BFP: And you've worked in the private sector, too, right?\DH: I co-founded a group called Vote Solar, which worked in about 15 states on solar energy policiy -- essentially ""barrier-busting"" to remove unnecessary costs and obstacles to the growth of solar energy.\That includes policies such as net metering, rate design, interconnection standards, RPS and other policies.\Then I went into the private sector and worked in Silicon Valley for 5 years, working with Solaria, a solar company.\A year and a half ago I was appointed by Governor Brown to fill a seat (one of five) on the Energy Commission, where I'm the lead commissioner for renewable energy issues.\BFP: What are some of major obstacles facing California -- or any state -- in leading the country into a transition away from fossil fuels?\DH: Overall, federal policies that support the subsides received by the fossil fuel industry have been around for a long, long time.\We've been subsidizing oil for a century. We've been subsidizing nuclear power for 60 years.\Those subsidies are much more generous than those for renewables.\Furthermore, the subsidies for fossil fuels and nuclear power are permanent, in general -- and the subsidies for renewables are temporary.\So you have things like the Price-Anderson Act (enacted in 1957), which ensures that if you have a melt-down at a nuclear power plant, that the operator of that plant is not liable.\The liability rests with the taxpayers. That's a massive subsidy. And in fact, without that subsidy, you would not have a nuclear industry because the liability would be too great.\That subsidy does not expire; it exists in perpetuity.\BFP: And with oil?\DH: You have the federal oil-depletion allowance (a tax break tied to declining reserves).\The oil industry is the most profitable industry in the world. They actually don't need that depletion allowance to survive as an industry, but it's in place, and it saves them money -- and in consequence, it endures.\BFP: What kind of subsidies do renewables get?\DH: If you look at what we're doing right now in this country for solar at the federal level, we have a 30 percent tax credit. And it expires in 2016.\Similarly, our program here in California that encourage solar is a temporary program that will end in a few years.\There's not a level playing field I would say, in how the treatment of these different technologies has played out.\BFP: With that kind of disadvantage, how can the renewable power industry hope to grow?\DH: It makes cost-reduction for renewables even more important.\And the good news is, it's happening, both in wind and solar -- most notably in solar, where there's been a 98-percent reduction since 1980 in the cost of solar panels.\BFP: Here's a problem that blessedly hasn't affected Vermont in living memory: the lack of water. Given that a lot of Californians are enduring a drought -- is anyone there making connections between energy and water use?\DH: Broadly, I don't think the awareness of the connection between the two is there yet in the public mind.\But it is certainly it is the case: that when you save water, you also save energy -- because something like a fifth of all the energy we spend in California is spent transporting water -- it's a significant portion of energy use.\BFP: Voluntary restrictions on water use seem to be having only limited effect. What's the state doing to help?\DH: One of the the key things what the energy commission does is, we establish standards for both appliances and new buildings. They're quite strict, and include mandatory installation of water-using devices: shower heads, toilets, washing machines, dishwashers, etc.. We've been gradually ratcheting those standards up.\BFP: California and Vermont share a transportation-energy challenge. Is the electric car the answer?\DH: The threshold issue in a rural state like Vermont is range. How far can you drive? For the top-of-the-line Tesla, that's a 300-mile range, but that's also a $100,000 car.\BFP: I just drove one a couple of weeks ago ...\DH: It's a beautiful car. It's the iPhone of cars.\By the way, they're the single largest recipient of a grant from the California Energy Commission in the history of our agency. We gave them $10 million. They're scaling up. They're making on the order of 800 cars a week now.\The goal of the company, and it's a goal that I believe they will hit, is by 2016, a car that sells for $35,000 and goes 200 miles on a charge.\They're going to get there by scaling up.\And Tesla's proven they know how to do that. I'm actually quite bullish about the future of electric vehicles, because I believe in where we can get the cost and the range.\BFP: But what about congestion? Little ol' Burlington has a rush hour that drives people crazy. To out-of-towners it might seem like a mere inconvenience, but could it be symptomatic of a bigger issue: What happens to single-occupancy vehicles when they converge from the suburbs?\To what extent is California addressing sprawl as an energy issue?\DH: It's a significant priority for the state. There was a major bill passed by the state senate a few years ago that really kicked off a planning effort to make the design of our communities as environmentally sound as possible, including access to mass transit -- to get out ahead of this issue.\BFP: As with Vermont, California is stuck with a lot of infrastructure that is predicated on cheap gas and plenty of highways.\DH: This is a state that has L.A. -- and we know something about traffic. That's a big concern.\I grew up in the Bay Area, and traffic is worse than it's ever been. You can never have enough mass transit, as far as I'm concerned.\BFP: Changing gears: Wind energy has made some inroads here in Vermont. It has also encountered persistent opposition -- based on the way it looks, or how it disrupts ridge-line habitats. Some people have health concerns, based on light-flicker and low-frequency vibrations.\Have those issues slowed down California's wind-energy development?\DH: Some of the same issues have come here. But the truth is, there are impacts caused by any form of energy generation, and that includes solar.\In California, we've met some of the objections to wind through significant improvements in technology and in the planning processes.\We had the earliest large-scale wind project in the U.S., in the Altamont Pass, which is a very hilly, windy area east of the Bay Area. Unfortunately, that was in an area where there were a lot of avian raptors.\The early installation of those projects was flawed in a couple of areas.\One was the design of the towers. They had a lattice structure, which was actually a nesting and perching opportunity for birds. You kind of attracted birds to land on the lattice, and they'd get hit by the turbine blades.\Also, that iteration of the turbine design had much much higher speeds, so those blades were moving at 45-50 rpm (revolutions per minute).\The new turbines have a solid steel column, and turn more on the order of 12-14 rpm. And because the turbines are so much bigger, the developer needs fewer of them.\There's a success story of a re-towering project that was done here recently: They had 432 old-style turbines which they decommissioned and replaced them with 34 new turbines.\They cut avian mortality by 70 percent, and they increased electric generation by three times. That's the way technology is going.\So, there are some technological solutions, some siting solutions. But even the new turbines will kill some birds.\That said, the number of bird deaths from cars and buildings is in the hundreds of millions.\BFP: House cats figure in there somewhere, too, I hear.\DH: Just to keep it in perspective: Wind turbines represent a small fraction of bird deaths in the U.S.\BFP: But how about aesthetics? Or health? Are Californians pushing back on the way turbines look, or sound? Or are those phenomena unique to Vermont?\DH: I haven't heard much about low-frequency vibrations. But there are some concerns about aesthetic impacts.\I personally find wind turbines to be quite beautiful. I've always felt that way.\I drive by one every day at the Budweiser plant on my commute to work, and they have two really large wind turbines, and I think it's quite a beautiful landmark.\So -- I guess beauty is in the eye of the beholder. I understand that some people don't want to see any change at all to the landscape, and I understand that.\My view is -- talking about changes to the landscape -- climate change is going to radically affect every part of the environment.\And so to combat that and get ahead of it, we all have to make some accommodation to enable a transition to a clean-energy future. That's just a reality.\Within that picture, there's flexibility on how you do that.\BFP: What kind of discussions are you having about where to site turbines?\DH: We've been working on a plan to identify zones within the state that are best suited for large-scale renewables, and within those zones, to accelerate the permit process -- and outside those zones, to protect that landscape.\BFP: One more question: What do you suspect you might learn from your upcoming visit to Vermont?\DH: I already have learned from Vermont. I love the state. It's a pioneer.\BFP: How about in the field of renewable energy?\DH: The challenge Vermont has is just getting to scale -- because the size of the state.\When we create a policy here like net-metering, with 300,000 rooftop solar systems, you attract an industry that can scale up and bring down costs.\It's tougher to do that in a small state.\BFP: Where are our pioneers?\DH: I've been very impressed by the energy efficiency utility that Vermont has (Efficiency Vermont). It focuses just on doing that one thing very well.\It's a very credible model, and I look forward to learning more about it.\Contact Joel Banner Baird at 660-1843 or joelbaird@FreePressMedia.com.

MONTPELIER -- Vermont has agreed to work with other states to bring large amounts of Canadian hydroelectric power to the region to meet growing energy needs. Environmentalists say that prospect could harm ratepayers and the environment.

This is the text of Gov. Peter Shumlin inaugural address Thursday in which he laid out Part I of his third-term agenda, focusing on initiatives critical to working families, economic growth and Vermont's quality of life in the areas of energy and the environment.
\
Harnessing the clean energy economy to create jobs
\
""No one knows better than Vermonters how to turn a challenging adversity like climate change into opportunity,"" Gov. Shumlin said in his Inaugural Address. ""Just look at our burgeoning green energy industry. Through Vermont innovation and collaboration, partnered with creative public policy and regulation, we are pioneering the development and deployment of locally generated, low carbon energy, creating jobs and putting money in Vermonter's pockets while we do it.""
\
Comparing the economic potential of today's emerging clean energy industry to the promise held by Vermont's ski industry in the 20th century, the Governor commented, ""We can see a new wave of innovation and job creation in those who are now powering Vermont forward in the renewable energy industry.""
\
As an example, he pointed to Vermonters like Dayton Brown and Graham Fisk, who work at SunCommon in Waterbury. Brown, a Vermont Tech graduate who served in Afghanistan as a member of the Vermont Air National Guard, now works as a solar system designer. Fisk, a Middlebury College graduate, returned to Vermont from New York to work as a solar home advisor. Both are members of a growing clean energy workforce that consists of over 15,000 Vermonters.
\
And it's not just jobs; the clean energy sector is saving Vermonters money. At a time when neighboring states have seen double digit increases in electricity rates, Vermont's largest utility, Green Mountain Power, was able to reduce rates by 2.46 percent last year.
\
For all these reasons, Vermont can and must do more to harness the economic potential of the clean energy economy. To do that, the Governor is proposing the Energy Innovation Program (EIP) to replace the SPEED program, which is set to expire in 2017. If implemented, the EIP is projected to:
\
Create over 1,000 new jobs;
\
Save Vermonters hundreds of millions of dollars on their energy bills; and
\
Cut greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 15 million metric tons, nearly a quarter of the reduction needed for Vermont to be on track to meet its 2050 climate goal.
\
The EIP would accomplish this by setting new renewable electricity requirements for Vermont while:
\
Prioritizing community-scale renewable projects to add hundreds of megawatts of new local energy generation to Vermont's electric portfolio over the course of the program, including new projects that qualify for net metering or the Standard Offer program;
\
Setting incentives for utilities to help customers save money and cut fossil fuel use through energy innovation projects. These would include projects where utilities provide leasing or on-bill financing options to help customers do deeper efficiency improvements, or install cold-climate heat pumps, solar water heating and geothermal or biomass heating, for example. These projects will help Vermonters reduce their total energy costs and impact a sector of energy use, heating, that right now contributes significantly to our climate change problem.
\
To highlight that last point, the Governor invited Mark and Sara Borkowski of Rutland to join him for the speech. They received financing assistance to help retrofit their home in Rutland, in partnership with their utility, Green Mountain Power. As a result, they were able to weatherize their home and install solar panels, cold-climate heat pumps, and efficient lighting and appliances. The Borkowskis have virtually eliminated their home heating oil use and cut their electric consumption by half. Under the Governor's EIP proposal, thousands of additional Vermonters would have the same opportunity to significantly cut their energy use.
\
""If we work together to enact this legislation, it will mark our single biggest step so far toward reaching our climate and renewable energy goals,"" the Governor said. ""Jobs, energy savings, and emissions reductions make this program a true win for our economy and our environment.""
\
Cleaning up Lake Champlain and other Vermont waterways
\
""We know what makes Vermont the best place in America. Without our mountains, hills, and valleys; our farms, streams, lakes, and forests - remote, quiet, and rooted in rugged marble, slate, and granite - Vermont would be just another place to live,"" Gov. Shumlin said in his Inaugural Address. ""Our natural habitat binds Vermonters tightly to our state, and it inspires others to put roots down here.""
\
Noting that Lake Champlain alone brings in hundreds of millions of dollars in economic activity for the state each year, the Governor called eroding water quality there heartbreaking and ""the greatest threat to our local environment. Protection of this lake is critical to protecting our economy.""
\
The Governor praised the efforts of those working tirelessly to clean up the lake, including Vermont's congressional delegation, community groups like the Friends of Northern Lake Champlain and the Lewis Creek Association, local leaders like Denise Smith, business owners like the Tylers of Tyler Place and Bob Beach of the Basin Harbor Club, organizations like the Lake Champlain Regional Chamber of Commerce, and farmers like Tim Magnant in Franklin and Brian Kemp in Salisbury, who are showing that it is possible to use innovative, practical, and cost-effective solutions to the problem of pollution on our farms.
\
The Governor pledged to be a partner in these efforts and marshal the resources of the state to build on the good work being done. The Administration will work to implement the Lake Champlain restoration plan submitted to the EPA last spring, the most comprehensive and strategic effort yet undertaken by Vermont to protect and restore the state's waters. The plan focuses on areas of greatest pollution where Vermont can make the most impact with the resources it has.
\
To help implement that plan, the Governor laid out a four-point agenda he will work with the Legislature to accomplish:
\
Assist towns in meeting their obligation to maintain roads to prevent runoff leading to erosion, which will keep nutrients and sediment out of Vermont's water, by helping them implement modern storm water management systems that capture and treat the polluted runoff from roads, streets and parking lots.
\
Direct significant new resources to help farmers and loggers reduce water pollution from their operations, keep livestock out of Vermont's streams, and seek more careful management of tilling practices and manure application.
\
Redouble efforts - working with Attorney General Bill Sorrell - to enforce water quality regulations in the Lake Champlain Basin and around Vermont.
\
Add teeth to hold the relatively few farmers not already doing the right thing more accountable by denying the tax benefit of current use if they do not come into compliance and follow the practices that prevent pollution, like the state does for loggers.
\
To pay for that agenda, the Governor will use increased federal dollars, as well as money from the capital budget, Vermont Housing and Conservation Board (VHCB) and a new dedicated state Clean Water Fund.
\
The capital budget will include $6.75 million for technical assistance and direct investment in water quality projects in the Lake Champlain Basin and around the state. This includes $1.6 million in state matching funds which will leverage $8.2 million in federal EPA grants for a total of $9.8 million for low-interest loans to municipalities through the clean water state revolving fund. The capital budget also increases to $3.75 million funding for innovative storm water management projects, and $1.4 million in funding for the Agency of Agriculture's cost sharing program for livestock fencing and other measures. The Transportation bill also includes $3.2 million for storm water retrofits and other projects to reduce polluted runoff from our back roads.
\
The Governor urged that funding for VHCB be maintained, even in this difficult budget year, to conserve working forests, farmland, and important natural areas to support water quality and that conservation projects funded by VHCB support farms and forestry operations that protect and improve water quality.
\
Finally, the Governor announced the establishment of the Clean Water Fund and proposed funding sources to raise approximately $5 million this year to strengthen water quality efforts significantly through two mechanisms:
\
A fee on agricultural fertilizers that will raise approximately $1 million to address farm practices;
\
And an impact fee to be paid only by owners of commercial and industrial parcels within the Lake Champlain watershed. The annual fee will be modest, amounting to $100-$200 for a typical large parcel, recognizing that many of those businesses already contribute for their storm water management practices. This is expected to raise $4-6 million.
\
The Clean Water Fund will be structured so that it can serve as a repository for additional federal and private funding sources, including a generous donation announced today from Keurig Green Mountain. Keurig will provide up to $5 million over the next five years for work by scientists at UVM and Limnotech to benefit water quality in the state that launched Keurig's success. He thanked Keurig CEO Brian Kelly and his team for their vision and commitment that will pay dividends for Vermont and Lake Champlain for years to come.
\
""I hope Keurig's generosity and focus on the importance of water quality will inspire others to aid our efforts,"" he said.
\
""Vermonters have lost patience with finger pointing about who is to blame for poor water quality. We are now working together across the divides that can exist among advocates, businesses, farmers, neighbors and government to get the job done,"" the Governor said. ""I need your support to ensure that the State of Vermont does its part, and I look forward to working with you this session to launch a new era of clean water in Vermont. This effort will be part of our legacy. The time to act is now.""
\
Playing to Vermont's strengths
\
Concluding his speech, the Governor said that Vermont has a bright future but must leverage its strengths to grow the state's economy.
\
""It is a competitive world out there - other states are offering millions of dollars in tax breaks to lure companies - but there are things the great little state of Vermont has that cannot easily be created elsewhere - our natural beauty, our clean air, our rural nature, and our resilient, innovative, and entrepreneurial people. These represent our competitive strengths and are treasured parts of our economic engine that we must protect, nurture and grow. I hope you will agree that the proposals I've outlined today will help us do that.""
\
The Governor will outline Part II of his Agenda for Progress in his annual Budget Address on Jan. 15.

251,"JERICHO Like open sugarhouse weekend in the spring and open art studio weekend in the fall, the inaugural Celebrate Solar Tours gave Vermonters the opportunity to get an up-close view of solar systems to learn about how it works and the story behind controlling our energy future with the sun.\In Jericho, solar and yoga enthusiasts gathered together to celebrate the sun by enjoying sun salutations alongside a SunCommon Community Solar Array hosted by landowner Evergreen Erb.\""Having lived in my community for 37 years, I have become more and more interested in the connections and closeness the word 'community' evokes. Being part of the Community Solar Array is a way of celebrating and giving back to our neighbors and Vermont,"" said Evergreen Erb on her motivation for hosting a Community Solar Array at her home in Jericho. Erb, an avid harpist, played her music as community members practiced yoga alongside the array.\Coinciding with the Summer Solstice, Celebrate Solar Tours kicked off the firs tCelebrate Solar Day on June 20, 2015 having received an official proclamation by Gov. Peter Shumlin. The governor notes that ""solar energy represented 99% of new electrical capacity in the state in 2014 and more than 5,000 Vermont customers have installed solar"" through Vermont's net metering program.\""When we started, there were 1,500 total solar systems built in Vermont over the prior decade. In a little more than 3 years, SunCommon has added 1,400 residential systems and served over 300 Community Solar members,"" said SunCommon Solar Community Organizer Carson Casey, ""We're really excited to make a difference, and we do the work community by community. In Chittenden County alone, we've helped over 400 households go solar through residential systems and over 100 households have joined our Community Solar Arrays.""\""We teamed with SunCommon because both yoga and solar energy have a focus on sustainability. Whether in our bodies or for the planet - joining these groups together sparks creative ideas, expanded horizons and furthers awareness for a healthier life and lifestyle,"" said Caitlin Pascucci of Sangha Studio. ""Practicing and sharing yoga outdoors in a sustainable, mindful environment with other like minded businesses - those are the conversations we love to have and want to be a part of.""\As a Vermont Benefit Corporation, SunCommon believes that everyone has the right to a healthy environment and a safer world - and clean energy is where it starts. Energy from the sun can power our lives, heat our homes and fuel our cars. Our mission is to tear down the barriers to renewable energy. We do that by making it easy and affordable for all Vermonters to go solar."

Friday July 26, 2013
\
When Winstanley Enterprises came to the Brattleboro Selectboard with a proposal to build a two-megawatt solar farm along Interstate 91, just north of the West River, we were excited about the idea of a renewable energy project that could generate enough power to provide electricity to about 400 homes, while also offsetting more than 123 million pounds of carbon dioxide emissions over the next 20 years.
\
That enthusiasm was tempered, however, with concern that the public would weigh in against the project because of the potential impact the solar farm would have on the viewshed for traffic on I-91. Fortunately, most of the feedback the board received on the project was positive, and it reaffirmed our faith in fellow Vermonters as forward-looking people who are genuinely concerned about both the local and the global community.
\
Of course, the public reaction to the solar farm shouldn't have surprised us. Over the past few years homeowners, businesses, schools and municipalities across the region have all decided to make an investment in solar power. We have long known that Vermont is one of the more progressive states when it comes to seeking out alternative energy sources, all the way up to the state Legislature, which set an ambitious goal of getting 20 percent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2017.
\
It's no surprise, then, that a new report shows Vermont ranks ninth in the nation for per capita solar installations.
\
This makes Vermont one of a dozen states that have led the nation in solar energy with supportive policies and a commitment to continued expansion, according to Lighting the Way: What We Can Learn from America's Top 12 Solar States. The report comes from the Environment America Research & Policy Center in partnership locally with the Vermont Public Interest Research Group.
\
""More and more, homes and businesses are turning to solar as a pollution-free energy source with no fuel costs,"" Ben Walsh, clean energy advocate with VPIRG, said in a statement. ""With the increasing threat of global warming, we must maintain momentum and resist the temptation to sit back and coast. States like Vermont can show the way.""
\
There are some naysayers who argue that we can never replace all of our fossil fuel needs with alterative energy sources, but that will only be true if we all throw our hands up in defeat without even trying. The fact is solar is on the rise across the country. According to the Solar Energy Industries Association and GTM Research, America had more than three times as much solar capacity as it did in 2010, and more than 10 times as much as it did in 2007. To boot, SEIA also found that the price to install a solar system fell by 26 percent in 2012.
\
""The sky's the limit on solar energy,"" said Rob Sargent, energy program director for Environment America. ""Vermont's progress should make us confident that we can do much more. To create a clean energy future Vermonters need to continue building on the policies that are working.""
\
At the same time, we have to be realistic. Those naysayers do have a point when they say we have a long way to go before we can eliminate our dependence on fossil fuels.
\
In its report, VPIRG highlighted several policy changes that would make going solar even easier and more affordable for Vermonters. For starters, under current law, once a utility has enough solar capacity to hit 4 percent of its peak electric demand, it can deny customers the right to go solar. That must change. The state also should streamline permitting to make it easier to build community-scale systems above 150 kW in size, and allow larger community-scale systems to be built under the net metering law, which currently limits systems to 500 kW.
\
""Today we celebrate the solar success of our state, but we also recognize that we cannot lose the momentum we have,"" concluded VPIRG's Walsh. ""Solar is growing fast, and by building on our success and ensuring that all Vermonters continue to have the right to go renewable, we can make certain solar is a cornerstone in Vermont's efforts to combat climate change.""
\
Fortunately, the alternative energy movement in Vermont has the support of Gov. Peter Shumlin, who joined VPIRG in praising the state's progress while also calling for more work to be done.
\
""Vermont is putting solar power to work and is leading the way to a clean energy future that tackles the threat of climate change while growing jobs and the economy,"" Shumlin said in a statement. ""We have more than doubled our solar energy in the last two and a half years, but we know our work is not done. We plan to keep Vermont at the forefront of this energy revolution.""
\
With the support of everyone from individual residents and businesses to schools and municipalities, all the way up to the state government, the future of solar power in Vermont looks very bright indeed.
"
253,"By Candace Page\Key lawmakers and Gov.-elect Peter Shumlin are ready to reverse a 2010 law drafted in secret and passed at the 11th hour that gave an Northeast Kingdom farmer ownership of wild deer and moose on his property, an action that provoked an outcry among hunters.\A bill already in draft form restates the longstanding principle that wild animals belong to all people of Vermont. It requires the wild deer and moose trapped inside Doug Nelson's elk hunting park to be removed, probably through hunting. It also allows for protection of young Pete the Moose, an orphaned resident of the park.\""There is no presumption that Pete is going to be killed, which got us into this mess in the first place,"" said House Fish and Wildlife Chairman David Deen, D-Westminster.\With a new administration about to take office and facing serious budget woes, undoing this year's so-called ""Pete the Moose"" law is one of the few environmental issues that has taken form as the Jan. 5 opening of the legislature approaches.\The newly elected Democratic governor outlined his general priorities in an interview last week, but said he does not yet have specific proposals. That must wait until he has assembled his team of environmental appointees and given them time to propose the most effective approaches to his goals, Shumlin said.\He repeated his campaign promises to increase Vermont's investment in energy efficiency, to encourage renewable energy development and to assess and improve programs to clean up Lake Champlain.\Other priorities include drafting a state energy plan and ""dusting off"" the recommendations of Gov. Jim Douglas' 2007 Commission on Climate Change, he said.\Leaders of environmental committees in the House and Senate offered similar, general goals -- to increase renewable energy, see creation of a long-term energy plan, review Lake Champlain programs. They, too, said they are not sure what specific legislation they will propose.\""My top priority is to listen to the new administration and the new secretary (of Natural Resources) about where we are with the laws we have now,"" said Senate Natural Resources Chairman Ginny Lyons, D-Chittenden.\One perennial environmental issue that may end up on the legislature's back-burner: an overhaul of the state's environmental permitting process, the subject of frequent complaints from both developers and environmentalists.\""Let's rebuild the Natural Resources Agency before we drag them through yet another reform effort,"" Shumlin said.\House Natural Resources and Energy Chairman Tony Klein, D-East Montpelier, echoed, ""I don't think it would be very prudent or cooperative to do a major look at the permit process when we have a new administration.""\Facebook page\Lawmakers' last-minute action on the elk hunting park in May was triggered by new Fish and Wildlife Board rules aimed at making sure exotic game parks do not spread disease to Vermont's wild whitetail deer and moose.\For that reason, the rules required the immediate removal -- the killing -- of the several hundred whitetail deer and unknown number of moose trapped inside the seven miles of fencing that enclose Big Rack Ridge, the private elk hunting park owned by Doug Nelson in Irasburg.\The requirement interfered with Nelson's plan to sell whitetail deer hunts on the property. But it also provoked an outcry among animal lovers who feared the new Fish and Wildlife rules would mean the killing of Pete the Moose.\Pete was orphaned early in life, rescued by a local man and later given safe haven at Big Rack Ridge. By late last winter, Pete had a Facebook page, a website and ""Save Pete"" rallies.\Working behind closed doors, Sen. Robert Starr, D-Essex-Orleans drafted legislation to strip the Fish and Wildlife Department of authority over Big Rack Ridge. Gov. Jim Douglas' office knew of Starr's plans but deliberately kept Fish and Wildlife officials in the dark, gubernatorial assistant Elizabeth McLain later acknowledged.\With the help of Senate Appropriations Chairman Susan Bartlett, D-Lamoille, who wanted to respond to animal lovers, Starr had his amendment attached to the must-pass state budget on the session's final day.\Most House members -- including Deen, the Fish and Wildlife chairman -- did not know the measure had been slipped into the budget bill when they voted on it.\Down a slippery slope?\As word of the action spread in the next few weeks, widespread criticism grew of the amendment's substance and the backroom way it had been handled. The measure gave oversight of Big Rack Ridge to the Agriculture Agency. It left open the door for Nelson to charge people money to hunt whitetail deer and moose.\Hunters and Fish and Wildlife biologists continued to fear that the mixing of wild deer with imported elk and exotic deer could spread disease. Hunters objected to what they saw as the state giving Nelson private ownership of wild animals.\""We said this is a bad precedent, it is a slippery slope,"" said Eric Nuse of Johnson, executive director of Orion/The Hunters Institute, a national ethical hunting group.\Nuse convened a group of hunters, biologists and lawmakers to talk about what could be done. Deen and a member of his committee, Rep. Kate Webb, D-Shelburne, agreed to sponsor a bill returning oversight of Big Rack Ridge to the Fish and Wildlife Department.\""That would be a major mistake,"" Starr, sponsor of the original measure, said last week. ""Things are going well down there (at the elk park) with Pete the Moose.""\He said hunters should be more worried about the posting of land against hunting in Vermont than about the single case of Big Rack Ridge. And he blamed the Fish and Wildlife Department for failing to come up with rules acceptable to Doug Nelson.\Nelson did not return a call seeking comment last week. A deer biologist who works for him has written that there is little or no chance that Big Rack Ridge would be a source of chronic wasting disease or other contagious diseases that afflict deer.\In the meantime, the Agriculture Agency is considering Nelson's management plan for the elk park. If it is approved, the new legislation says the Fish and Wildlife Department must accept it.\'Let him go'\As drafted, the new bill attempts to solve the Pete the Moose problem. It says all the whitetail deer and moose must be removed from Nelson's property, but does not set a deadline. It says Nelson may allow hunting of the whitetails and moose as one way to remove them but he can not charge for the privilege.\Shumlin -- and Bartlett, now a special assistant to the governor-elect -- said they support reversing last session's action. ""As a hunter and someone who feels strongly about that issue, I think we blew it,"" Shumlin said.\And what should happen to Pete?\Some supporters of Deen's bill said the moose should be moved to a zoo or animal refuge. Webb said it would be up to the Fish and Wildlife Department to find a solution. Sherb Lang, president of the Hunters, Anglers Trappers sporting group had another idea:\""I say test him out the wazoo for disease, tranquilize him, take him off the property and let him go.""\Contact Candace Page at 660-1865 or cpage@bfp.burlingtonfreepress.com\2011 agenda: Energy, environment\Here's a look at the issue areas Gov.-elect Peter Shumlin, legislative leaders and interest groups say will be the focus of their attention on energy and the environment:\RENEWABLE ENERGY AND EFFICIENCY:\""I really think Vermont can lead the nation in solar, wind, small biomass, small hydro and geothermal, and the jobs they will create. -- Shumlin\* Shumlin: Expand the Efficiency Vermont model and provide financial assistance or incentives not just to low-income families but to the middle-class and business.

(Net-metering refers to small renewable energy projects installed by a consumer for home or business use. When the installation generates excess electricity it is fed to the power grid and reduces the customer's electric bill.) Total net-metered projects are capped at 2 percent of the state's electric load. ""We are bumping against that 2 percent and we need to look at the feasibility of removing the cap so we can get more projects on line,""\* Klein, Paul Burns of VPIRG: Expand the ""standard offer"" program that provides incentives for larger renewable energy installations by setting a desirable price that utilities must pay for the power.

Torti: Need make it simpler to develop in a growth center. Courtney: Make sure that growth centers are properly designated and don't include too large a geographic area.\OTHER NATURAL RESOURCE ISSUES:\Other issues raised by those who were interviewed:\* Lake Champlain: Continue attempts to reduce pollution but reinvigorate scrutiny of what anti-pollution programs produce the best results for dollars invested.\* Consider legislation adopted in other states that reduces the unnecessary lawn-and-garden use of phosphorus fertilizer by requiring a soil test that shows it is needed.\* Consider whether legislation is needed to increase the rate of recycling in Vermont.\* Act on recommendations made by a state Climate Change Commission in 2007."

But it also provoked an outcry among animal lovers who feared the new Fish and Wildlife rules would mean the killing of Pete the Moose.\Pete was orphaned early in life, rescued by a local man and later given safe haven at Big Rack Ridge.

258,"Two thirds of Vermont's power is generated at the Vermont Yankee nuclear plant and Hydro Quebec, both sources facing an uncertain future in this state.\That makes it imperative that Vermont develop a broad portfolio of future energy options to ensure we have affordable power. Lawmakers, the Douglas administration, the Public Service Board, the environmental community and other groups must involve the public in crafting a thoughtful power mix that includes:\+ Increased conservation and efficiency. Every penny spent on efficiency is returned twice over in savings. Holding down energy usage is critical.\+ Natural gas. It's clean, but subject to price volatility. There are limits on how much gas can come into Vermont because of pipeline constraints. Nevertheless, gas belongs in the mix, particularly for northwestern Vermont.\+ Fossil fuel plants. These plants, particularly coal, create pollution although cleaner technology is evolving but will be a small part of Vermont's energy mix given their reliability and relative affordability.\+ Dams. Hydro power is clean and relatively affordable. Water power can also provide cheaper power when other sources (including wind) become more expensive.\+ Net-metering. These are small, local projects like individual wind towers and solar panels. While these won't necessarily provide signficant energy, they do relieve some of the burden on the grid.\+ Wood. Vermont's two wood-burning plants, Ryegate and McNeil in Burlington, are examples of how the environmental concerns of wood can be offset by sound forestry management. This is an affordable alternative for Vermont, but must be structured to safeguard the environment.\+ Wind. Vermont is at a crossroads on this issue. Wind is an affordable, clean source of power but environmental caution is imperative. Wind turbines on mountain tops have the potential of damaging viewsheds, roadless areas and pristine ridgelines. Vermont must move slowly as it contemplates projects beyond Searsburg. The Governor's Commission on Wind Energy Regulatory Policy will be holding public meetings next month. The public must become involved.\+ Methane gas. Commonly called 'cow-power,"" this is a growing industry that would benefit Vermont. It's clean, helps the agriculture industry, and potentially keeps phosphorous out of the waterways.\Some of these options might be deemed undesirable for any host of reasons. Regardless, Vermont must begin debating future power options so we don't ever find ourselves in the dark."

To the Editor:
\
A Vermont company adopting a New Hampshire company's billing structure would be a hard pill to swallow, but this pill would remedy what ails the small Vermont electric suppliers. The Aug. 19 article, ""Vt. Utilities Try to Slow Solar Boom,"" indicated that these small electric companies cannot recover the costs of maintaining poles, wires and other related costs when net-metered bills go to zero due to power fed back from personal solar or other alternative sources.
\
As a member of the New Hampshire Electric Cooperative, I used to begrudge paying the monthly ""fixed member service charge"" until I realized that segregating the costs of having the infrastructure to deliver that power was a pretty good idea. In that same thought process, net-metered customers require delivered power at times due to weather or conditions negative to solar or other sources. Even if not using that power year round, the infrastructure has to be there when power from the electric companies is needed.
\
The reality is that recovering fixed costs by incorporating them into one electric rate for everything but taxes does not work in a world that is trying to relieve stress on our environment and customers trying to relieve some of the stress on their wallets. The promise of the benefits of solar and other clean alternative power sources makes net-metering necessary but also makes recovering fixed costs and reasonable profit for electric companies a necessity through an alternate billing structure. This will allow them to survive and make a profit while waiting for those times when alternate energy sources don't work for some customers.
\
Whatever is hindering this type of billing in Vermont, be it political or common sense, needs to be addressed. Those who are net-metered and others who use power only certain months of the year must realize that the comfort of having their electric company in an on-demand relationship comes with a cost. Not sharing that cost is an unfair burden on your neighbors. But if you are adamant, then disconnect from the grid.

MANCHESTER -- A new labor union has been formed.
\
At Manchester Elementary Middle School board meeting Tuesday night, Bennington Rutland Supervisory Union superintendent Dan French informed the board that the paraprofessionals, office administrative staff, custodians, facilities/transportation director, bus drivers and food service employees decided to form the labor union -- which will be called the Manchester Education Association -- by a 15 to 10 vote recently. French said he and the BRSU will begin contract negotiations with the association soon.
\
A portion of Tuesday's meeting though was spent discussing the upcoming budget. French asked the board what their ""wish list"" was regarding the budget before he presents them with a first draft at their next meeting in November.
\
Brian Vogel, school board member, asked for $950 to be put in the budget for an expansion of Meal Time, the software used for school lunch, to bring payments online. The board discussed this possibility earlier in the meeting.
\
Katy McNabb, chairwoman of the school board, wants to see a more inclusive summer program.
\
""I'd be interested in looking at a really robust summer program that is maybe open to everyone,"" she said. ""That's maybe a little academics, a little fun to try to stem the slide [losing some academic gains over summer].""
\
MEMS principal Sarah Merrill said that looking at preliminary testing, teachers at MEMS have noticed that ""summer slide."" She said as a part of her wish list, a summer program, as well as extended after school programs, would be helpful for students.
\
Along with programs like these, Merrill said she would like to see some more experiential learning as well, like field trips to places like the Southern Vermont Arts Center or the Equinox Pond.
\
Some students have more than just the summer working against them. Merrill said she would like to see some sort of orientation for students new to MEMS as a way for them to get more comfortable with their new environment before the start of the school year.
\
""Ease some of the anxiety around being here,"" she said. ""[To help them] ease into academics a little quicker.""
\
Along with the discussion around the budget, the school board decided not to continue with the talks surrounding the possibility of adding a solar field to the energy source for the school. At the end of August, Dynamic Organics presented a plan, that if the BRSU wanted, they could partner with Dynamic Organics and Kearsarge to develop a solar field to help provide up to 500kw of power to the BRSU through net metering.
\
French said while he thinks there is some benefit through green energy, the long term contract makes him worried.
\
McNabb said while she is a supporter of solar, the idea of this partnership made her a little uneasy.
\
""I have some ethical queasiness with using a public school as an instrument in a private equity investment plan,"" she said.
\
The board decided that they would not be opposed to revisiting this plan or another green energy plan in the future, but decided to postpone any discussion for now.

Lawmakers are considering a plan to tax the state's natural gas pipelines to fund renewable energy projects.
\
The new taxing scheme could raise millions for renewables as Vermont Gas Systems charts a southern pipeline expansion through Addison County on the western side of the state.
\
The proposal, which was introduced to the Senate Finance Committee on Wednesday, would divert pipeline tax revenue into the Clean Energy Development Fund from the state's Education Fund, where the revenue goes under current tax policy.
\
Sen. Christopher Bray, D-Addison, lead sponsor of bill S.238, said the proposal is designed to help move the state off of carbon-emitting fossil fuels. ""If we don't have a healthy environment, the level of funding for schools, at some point, is going to become secondary,"" said Bray, who is a member of the Finance Committee.
\
Statewide property taxes for education are expected to jump about 7 cents. This is largely due to rising school budgets, declining enrollment and the slow growth of grand lists. Property values have grown little following the 2007 recession.
\
Steve Wark, communications director for Vermont Gas, said there could be unintended consequences with any new tax policy. He said it is too early to say whether the proposal would raise customers' natural gas rates.
\
""We want to make sure our customers are not unduly penalized for picking something that is more clean,"" he said, referencing the cleaner emissions from natural gas over other heating fuels.
\
The bill would set a floor for a pipeline's taxable value at 30 percent of the total construction cost. This means the pipelines will continue to offer tax revenue even after their appraised value depreciates to zero under the proposal.
\
""The lowest you can go is to 30 percent so that it is always generating revenue as long as it's operating,"" Bray said.
\
Bray said the state must funnel resources to the Clean Energy Development Fund to meet the goals set by the state's Comprehensive Energy Plan, which call for Vermont to be 90 percent renewable energy by 2050. This bill supports that mission by providing continued funding, he said. The fund has no stable source of revenue at this point.
\
""A commitment without money is no commitment at all,"" said the bill's lead sponsor, who is making this his top priority this session.
\
Sen. Ginny Lyons, D-Chittenden, who is a member of the Finance Committee and a sponsor of the bill, said the revenues from pipeline taxes could be used for a variety of renewable energy projects.
\
""I can see the development of any number of clean energy projects. It can be anything from woodchip burning stoves and plants to solar plants to farm net metering systems, methane digesters. I think it's the whole broad spectrum,"" Lyons said.

Thursday, March 20 MONTPELIER -- Gov. Jim Douglas on Wednesday signed into law a bill aimed at promoting renewable energy like solar and wind power, as well as new efficiency measures devoted to reducing Vermonters' use of oil and other heating fuels.
\
'Help Vermonters save money'
\
The bill, dubbed the ""energy efficiency and affordability act,"" will ""help Vermonters better manage their heating resources, protect our environment and save money,"" Douglas told scores of lawmakers, administration officials, energy advocates and others who filled his Statehouse office for the bill-signing ceremony.
\
The signing came 10 months after Douglas vetoed legislation with similar goals in part because he didn't like that its efficiency programs would have been paid for with a new tax on the Vermont Yankee nuclear plant.
\
Douglas, who also objected to how last year's bill would have structured the efficiency programs, called agreement on the new version ""perhaps the best example so far this year of the progress we can make when everyone's point of view is respected and receives reasonable consideration.""
\
The bill calls for the Department of Public Service to hold a series of ""stakeholder workshops"" beginning this spring to come up with a request for proposals, basically a work order for a contractor or contractors who would administer the new efficiency programs.
\
By next year, those programs should be up and running, providing Vermonters with grants and other financing to add new insulation, tighter windows and the like to their homes -- measures the bill's supporters say could cut heating bills by 20 to 40 percent and reduce greenhouse gas emissions tied to global warming.
\
In addition, the bill allows for new tax credits designed to promote renewable energy, which advocates said would be timely given the uncertainty over whether federal tax credits designed to promote installations of solar power will be renewed this year.
\
And among a broad range of other measures, it allows an expansion of ""net metering,"" in which people who make their own power can ship any extra onto their utility grid, lowering their electric bills in the process.
\
In contrast to the vitriol that surrounded the governor's veto of energy legislation last year, Wednesday's bill-signing was a cause for praise from the governor for lawmakers and members of his staff who worked on the bill.
\
David O'Brien, commissioner of the Department of Public Service, singled out his deputy, Richard Smith, and Rep. Robert Dostis, D-Waterbury and chairman of the House Natural Resources and Energy Committee, as playing key roles in this year's compromise.
\
Much of the compromise centered on how much money would be spent on efficiency efforts, where the money would come from, and who would implement the efficiency programs.
\
Douglas promised $1.6 million toward the efficiency programs in his budget; an additional $2.4 million -- bringing the total to $4 million -- is expected to come from a new multistate system designed to allow states with low carbon-dioxide emissions, like Vermont, to sell off allowances to other states struggling to reach carbon reduction targets.
\
In addition, Efficiency Vermont, the statewide electric conservation program, is being allowed to expand into heating efficiency. It will use money from payments it is to get for its electrical efficiency efforts from the regional dispatch agency ISO-New England to expand into heating efficiency.

266,"IT'S MY TURN \John McConnell \Vermont renewable energy bill makes sense \There is a common-sense renewable energy bill in the Vermont House that needs the support of Vermonters inside and outside the Capital. \Just two weeks ago, in a resounding show of bipartisan support, this renewable energy bill, S.264, passed the Senate by a vote of 27-1. Now it is in the House Commerce Committee. \The goal of S.264 is to help meet the state's increased energy needs during the next decade using renewable energy resources and conservation. After being presented last year with President Bush's short-term ""solutions"" to our future energy needs, Vermonters can enjoy a breath of fresh and clean air knowing that our state is working on a common-sense solution. \Instead of a short-sighted, too-little too-late approach, this bill takes a positive, long-term view of what Vermonters need for energy over the next 10 years. Fossil fuels aren't the answer; big hydro contracts aren't the answer. Clean, sustainable, renewable energy created in Vermont is the answer. \S.264 offers a variety of strategies to meet Vermont's future energy needs. One strategy is called a Renewable Portfolio Standard, or RPS. Used in a dozen other states, this empowers the Public Service Board to require utilities to buy a certain amount of electricity from renewable energy sources. \This could either be sources they build themselves or from other entities. The impact the RPS will have on Vermont utility bills will be insignificant. In the long-term, though, national studies show that by using an RPS, states will likely see reductions in their utility bills along with more predictable energy prices. \Another strategy of S.264 is group net metering. This is a big hit with farmers. It allows individuals to ""group"" their electricity consumption together onto one power meter, and then use renewable energy to supply that group with power. Farmers are enthusiastic about this aspect of S.264 because it allows them to group all the buildings on their farm onto one meter, and then process methane from manure to use as a renewable energy source for all the power for their whole farm. This makes sense: Allow farms to use what they have a lot of, manure, to create something they need, energy. Farmers would have the possibility of becoming energy independent while saving a barn-full of cash. \Other aspects of the bill include using $$@$!750,000 from the Petroleum Overcharge Fund to help support renewable energy projects within the state. This is a good investment. It will support a blossoming renewable energy business community, give Vermonters incentives to buy their own renewable energy products, and create jobs in the process. S.264 also establishes ""renewable energy pricing,"" allowing individuals to choose to pay a premium to their electricity suppliers so that part or all of their electricity use would come from renewable sources. \S.264 takes a common sense, long-term approach to solving problems that, if not dealt with immediately, will have far-reaching, toxic and expensive consequences. Global warming, fluctuating energy prices and security risks related to reliance on toxic energy sources are all issues we must resolve for the sake of our environment and for the sake of our economy. We cannot drill our way to energy independence and energy security. S.264 charts reasonable steps we can take right now. \S.264 proposes investing in clean, renewable energy today, for tomorrow's energy needs. This bill will create increased in-state renewable energy sources, stabilized energy costs, and generate high paying jobs building and maintaining these facilities. Vermonters want an energy policy that will keep our air clean, keep our dollars in state and fulfill our responsibility to reduce our global warming impact. S.264 will do all of these things. The Vermont House must enact this common-sense, long-term strategy for our state's energy security. \John McConnell is a Web designer and an activist on climate change issues.

DOVER -- The Public Service Board gave the go-ahead for an approximately 500 kilowatt group net-metered solar electric generation facility that will sit behind an elementary school.
\
According to the certificate of public good issued to the applicant Jacob Laskin of NextSun Energy, the meters will be associated with the town of Dover. Dover School will be credited for the power produced by the project and it will be a part of the net metering group served by the project.
\
""We should start seeing some site development in July,"" said Bill Anton, principal at Dover School. ""Good stuff.""
\
According to the certificate, the project will be constructed on a 30-acre field behind the school with approximately 2,268 individual 310-watt solar panels attached to a fixed ground-mounted system. A pad-mounted transformed owned and provided by Green Mountain Power will be located within a 7-foot tall fence at the site.
\
""(NextSun) proposes to remove approximately 4.9 acres of trees on the project site to prevent shading of the array,"" the PSB wrote. ""Approximately 3.7 acres of this clearing will be grubbed. The stumps will be left in the ground on the remainder.""
\
The site is visible from the school, and a vegetative buffer will be installed between the school and the site unless a school official files a comment saying that's not necessary.
\
Adjacent property owner Kevin Carney worried the project would have a ""material negative impact"" on the value of his property and requested party status but the board denied his request.
\
The Department of Public Service voiced some concern over the project, saying it constitutes a commercial use in a residential area, which is contrary to Dover's Town Plan.
\
""The department represents that it attempted to ascertain the town of Dover's position with respect to the project but did not receive any feedback,"" the PSB wrote. ""The department concludes that 'given the lack of response from the Dover Planning Commission and based on the information in the record on this matter, the department does not conclude that the project will unduly interfere with the orderly development of the region.""
\
The department also recommended the board approve the project upon submission of results from a Green Mountain Power Corporation study. NextSun filed the results which said the project can be safely interconnected provided certain distribution upgrades occur, according to the PSB.
\
""Because the applicant has agreed to pay for all necessary upgrades to the distribution system, we conclude that the applicant has demonstrated that the project will not adversely affect system stability and reliability,"" the PSB wrote. ""The project will not have an undue adverse impact on aesthetics, historic sites, air and water purity or the natural environment. The project will not cause undue soil erosion or reduce the capacity of the land to hold water so that a dangerous or unhealthy condition results.""
\
To prevent contamination, the board said equipment should be located away from the groundwater source and the transformer is designed with a secondary oil-containment system.
\
According to the certificate, a new access road will be used that connects the site to Woodsman Road. A 150-foot long and 12-foot wide gravel drive will be installed using 2,650 square-feet of gravel. Traffic is not expected to be adversely affected.
\
Construction activities will be limited to the hours of 7 a.m. and 7 p.m., Monday through Friday, then between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. on Saturdays. No construction is allowed on Sundays or state or federal holidays.
\
The Agency of Natural Resource requested the board attach three conditions related to stormwater, endangered species and invasive species. The agency said it wanted ""to alert (NextSun) that the landowner may need to obtain an amendment to its wastewater system and potable water supply permit"" as it was leasing the land where the project will be located.
\
The PSB said the applicant will be required to obtain a general permit for stormwater runoff from a construction site and conduct ""a rare, threatened and endangered plant inventory during the appropriate field season."" If any are discovered, the applicant will be required to flag the plants prior to construction so they can be avoided. And all construction equipment needs to be cleaned before entering and exiting the site, which is believed to minimize the spread of invasive species.
\
ANR had also proposed monitoring and reporting requirements but the board rejected it.

268,"Energy policies form the core challenges in the take-home test composed by incumbent Gov. Peter Shumlin: a natural gas pipeline; ridge-top wind development; incentives for renewable power. What would Scott Milne do?\Read on:\Peter Shumlin: Do you support the natural gas pipeline expansion that will bring natural gas to the western side of Vermont, including Rutland?\Scott Milne: Yes. Natural gas is a decent, affordable, bridge energy source. We need to make sure Vermont ratepayers are not stuck paying more than our fair share, and that property owners are treated fairly.\My team and I do not trust the current administration to do this. Vermont has some of the highest energy rates in the nation. Vermonters need a more business friendly environment to grow and prosper and Vermont employers need relief.\Not only will the pipeline bring relatively clean natural gas, as opposed to dirty fuel oil, to the western side of the state, but Rutland Regional Medical Center, for example, has announced that the pipeline would save $350,000 per year. That's just one employer. A smaller carbon footprint and less expensive energy is a good thing.\Shumlin: You've said you want to dial back investments in renewable energy. What specific programs would you cut and by how much would you cut them?\Milne: I am strongly considering a moratorium on any new ridgeline wind projects. At the very least, I think the Northeast Kingdom has done its part, I will not consider new projects there.\Any new project would need to have the support of local residents, the people that have to live with the impact of the project.\Furthermore, competitive electric rates are key to the economic health of our employers and families. Forcing utilities to buy expensive energy from solar, wind, and small producers that use hydro isn't a solution to our crisis of affordability.\Shumlin: You've promised a funding plan for cleaning up Lake Champlain before the election. What is the plan?\Milne: We have stated several times that we have a specific plan that will be released before the election. I believe Peter has told Vermonters his plan will come out after the election. Our plan will be public, before November 4, 2014, just like we promised.\The first step towards being a good governor is getting elected, and that's what my team and I are working on. Our plan is simple. We will provide a share of the necessary funds without raising taxes.\Shumlin: Do you support expanding Vermont's net metering law and standard offer program that encourage renewable development?\Milne: We need to ensure that the standard offer program is not disproportionately affecting struggling families or employers that keep our economy afloat.\Shumlin: Do you support Vermont's goal of reaching 90 percent renewable energy by 2050?\Milne: This goal, as of today, seems incredibly optimistic. I will monitor this closely as governor and make the necessary adjustments.\We need to make decisions based on what is practical, not political, not personal. I do not have any personal interest in the renewable energy industry.\We need energy policies that do not trap Vermonters in the cycle of poverty. When the U.S. Energy Information Administration studied states' carbon dioxide emissions in 2010, it found Vermont released 6 million metric tons of carbon dioxide.\According to the Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. released 6,821 million metric tons of carbon dioxide that year. Given our relative impact, there is no need to be eating up struggling families' and employers' income with exorbitant energy bills.\Scott Milne of Pomfret is the Republican gubernatorial candidate"
269,"
Monday, March 3 Terrified by the supposed horrors of global warming, Vermont's Green legions are geared up to make 2008 the year of the state's Extreme Green Makeover.
\
That momentous event was to have been set in motion last year, but it suddenly expired with Gov. Jim Douglas' veto of Sen. Peter Shumlin's bill to lay a $25 million tax bill on the state's leading generator of clean electricity to fund a new state entity to go about persuading Vermonters to stop wasting money on heating fuels.
\
In July, the Democratic-controlled House sustained the veto by 13 votes. That caused the ambitious Senator from VPIRG to declare that he would be back in the 2008 session with an even stronger bill. Now it's 2008, and he's back as promised.
\
Earlier this month the House Natural Resources and Energy Committee, ably chaired by the greenish but realistic Rep. Robert Dostis, brought out its version of an earlier Senate-passed energy conservation bill (S.209). The bill recites the Senate's global disaster mantra that ""global climate change is threatening our environment and perhaps ultimately our existence."" It then sets forth 47 sections of policy changes, including the creation of a non-monopoly energy efficiency program to meet the goals of the vetoed bill.
\
The bill expands the carbon cap and trade system under the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. This is a multistate program where electric ratepayers of the other states will send money to Vermont to reward us for having such a green electrical energy system.
\
The bill also sets in motion the process for increasing the gross receipts tax on heating fuels, and creating a state public power authority. But all in all, the House version was restrained enough to pass that body on a 136-2 vote.
\
Now the Senate will act, most likely by grafting a large number of amendments onto the House bill. The Shumlin amendments are contained in his 49-page S.350. Modestly titled the ""energy independence and economic prosperity"" act, the bill incorporates the entire radical agenda put forth by VPIRG.
\
The central feature of the Shumlin-VPIRG wish list is the creation of what can only be described as an energy super-government, the ""climate collaborative,"" to ""coordinate statewide activities on climate change and all related energy activities.""
\
This unprecedented public corporate body would be controlled by nine ""stakeholders"" jointly chosen by governor and Legislature. It would consist of one public official, two higher education representatives, two ""business"" representatives (presumably from the Vermont Businesses for Social Responsibility lobby), one from ""conservation interests"" (presumably VPIRG), one from low-income interests, one from ""sustainable rural development"" (presumably Rural Vermont), and one from Efficiency Vermont. Notably not included: taxpayers.
\
This super government would supervise a bewildering array of task forces and working groups to produce a host of reports advocating new regulations, controls, mandates, plans, rules, standards, taxes and subsidies. The bill envisions or imposes strict ""smart growth"" land use control strategies, greenhouse gas emission inventories, aggressive implementation of Act 200's planning mandates, new Act 250 rules to impose ""carbon neutrality"" on developments, mandates for the protection of ""dead and dying wildlife trees,"" doubling (heavily subsidized) passenger rail traffic by 2028, getting all single-occupancy vehicles off the highways, steeply increased vehicle sales and use taxes and registration fees on low-mpg vehicles, energy efficiency standards that must be met before homeowners could sell their houses, and biofueled bus tours to visit biofuel producing farms.
\
The collaborative would develop a ""public education and engagement framework to encourage behavior change,"" through ""social marketing strategies with broad ethical goals."" An example: ""in-depth, science-based in-school programs on energy efficiency and climate change at all levels.""
\
This proposal emerged from a lobby group (VPIRG) that strenuously insists that all scientific questions about climate change have been settled, no dissent can be deemed credible, the planet is racing toward Al Gore's heat death and only desperate wide-ranging big-government ""solutions"" will be considered!
\
And how will all this be paid for? In addition to the various taxes levied, the collaborative would create a working group to come up with ways for funding greenhouse gas reduction efforts. The collaborative itself, a veritable Manhattan Project of Green Social Engineering, would apparently be funded through the inexhaustible General Fund.
\
The far more reasonable House-passed bill contains numerous useful provisions, such as expansion of net metering, passthrough of federal tax incentives, and relaxation of some government-created barriers to energy enterprises. It also has some questionable inclusions, but it has strong bipartisan support, including that of Gov. Douglas.
\
If Sen. Shumlin and his VPIRG allies try to load up the House-passed bill with selections from their sweeping Senate bill -- especially the unaccountable global warming super government -- it may well stimulate a backlash among a lot of average Vermonters. It certainly should.

Saturday, August 12 The recent rejection of the East Haven Wind project in the Northeast Kingdom by the Vermont Public Service Board and the more recent negative preliminary finding by the Vermont Department of Public Service regarding the proposed 20-turbine wind farm in Sheffield are the latest in a series of setbacks for the wind power sector in Vermont that has put the breaks on most large-scale proposals in the state. This might be a good time for the renewable energy community in general (and the wind power sector in particular) to step back and consider another option.
\
This other option, which falls in between the large-scale commercial wind farm and the small-scale backyard wind turbine, has been described as ""the Third Way."" This middle strategy, also referred to as community-supported wind, relies on somewhat smaller scale projects that are developed, sited and owned by members of the local community rather than out-of-state corporate entities. Community-supported wind could fill a huge gap in Vermont's present wind power sector. And this approach is not limited to wind power, but can be applied to virtually any type of local renewable energy project such as solar panels, biogas digesters, a variety of biofuels, and small-scale hydro.
\
When applied to a wide variety of renewable energy technologies, this strategy is known as community-supported energy. CSE projects are somewhat similar to community-supported agriculture. The main difference, however, is that instead of investing in potatoes, carrots, or cucumbers, with CSE, local residents invest in energy projects that provide greater energy security and a wide variety of other benefits.
\
A co-operative or community-owned energy project offers many advantages. It stimulates the local economy by creating new jobs and new business opportunities for the community while simultaneously expanding the tax base and generating new income for local residents. A locally owned energy project also generates support from the community by getting people directly involved.
\
Another advantage of community energy projects is that they can be owned co-operatively or collectively through a variety of legal mechanisms. Ownership strategies can include limited liability corporations, co-operatives, school districts, municipal utilities or combinations of these models. Sometimes a partnership with an existing utility can be mutually beneficial. The appropriate model varies from project to project and from state to state, depending on a wide range of variables. What these strategies all have in common, however, is some form of community ownership and group benefit.
\
The main point is to identify the project as belonging to the community, which may avoid (or at least minimize) the usual conflicts between local residents and developers, whose large-scale, commercial proposals are often viewed as primarily benefiting absentee owners. Local ownership is the key ingredient that transforms what would otherwise be just another corporate energy project into an engine for local economic development and greater energy security.
\
Community-supported energy projects offer yet another advantage; they retain a greater amount of income in the local area and increase the economic benefits substantially over projects owned by out-of-area developers, according to a study conducted by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. The study found local ownership yields an average of $4 million in local income annually, over three times more than the $1.3 million produced with out-of-area control, while job creation was more than twice as large in the local model.
\
One of the best regulatory models in North America is the new standard offer contracts in Ontario, Canada. Announced earlier this year, these contracts are an historic step towards a sustainable energy future. Standard offer contracts allow homeowners, landowners, farmers, co-operatives, schools, First Nations, municipalities and others to install renewable energy projects up to 10 megawatts in size and to sell the power to the grid for a fixed price for 20 years. The Ontario standard offer contracts provide a powerful model that other provinces and states (especially Vermont) should consider when developing their own renewable energy laws and regulations.
\
Vermonters currently spend more than $1 billion to heat and light their homes and businesses. If just 5 percent more of the state's energy needs could be met at the community level, it would keep $50 million circulating in the local economy, rather than flowing mainly out of state as it presently does.
\
In Addison County, a new community based-group, the Addison County Relocalization Network (ACoRN) is actively engaged in developing or supporting a number of CSE projects. Several other community groups in other parts of the state are considering similar projects as well. But in order for these initiatives to succeed, the regulatory environment needs to be streamlined for smaller projects, group net-metering needs to be expanded further, and some changes to the state's co-operative laws also need to be made by the Legislature. In addition, a comprehensive set of financial, contracting and permitting incentives directed towards community projects need to be developed and implemented by the state.
\
Community-supported energy is an idea whose time has definitely arrived, and I am convinced that if this strategy were to be adopted across the state that it could fundamentally alter the entire debate about most renewable energy proposals. Almost every city and town in Vermont has the potential for one or more community-supported energy projects. Perhaps you can get one started in your community.
\
Greg Pahl is a Weybridge writer and a founding member of the Addison County Relocalization Network (www.acornvt.org). His next book: ""The Energy Survival Plan: Personal and Community Solutions for a Post-Oil World,"" will be published in January. Its main focus is on community-supported energy.

In 2009, when I was serving as Lt. Governor, I was invited to the Bolton Valley Ski Area resort to take part in the commissioning of a 100 kw wind turbine manufactured by Vermont workers in Barre. Its blade height was a very modest 120 feet, and the tower was on a scale to fit in with the ski resort profile. Bolton became only the second ski resort in the country to be powered in part by renewable wind electricity.
\
In the same year I was asked to assist a proposed project on Georgia Mountain which I did. This was before Lowell and Sheffield were built. In the same year I was invited to visit the little mountain town of Ira, in Rutland County. Citizens there were very concerned about the proposed wind power development on their ridges. Unlike the 120 foot tower at Bolton, the proposed Ira project had towers that would overshadow the homes of local residents. As the towers grew ever larger, to catch more wind, my attitude toward wind towers began to change.
\
The current generation of wind turbines has ground-to-tip heights of five hundred feet. Under certain wind conditions they can be very noisy, especially if you live downwind from the turbine. The trend is more turbines per site, so the effect is multiplied, especially when there is turbulence along the row of turbines.
\
After these industrial wind projects were built in places like Sheffield, Lowell, and Georgia, I have listened first hand to Vermonters whose lives have been affected by having to live in the shadow of blades that now reach as high as five times the height of the typical Vermont forest canopy. We are talking ""War of the Worlds"" huge.
\
Many people report health related issues that they attribute to the industrial sized turbines that were built near their homes. Some say they cannot sleep at night in their homes because of the noise these huge turbines produce. I have talked to people who have been forced to move out of their bedrooms into other rooms or out of their homes altogether due to noise from the turbines.
\
Our laws have recognized, for centuries, that property owners have the right to make peaceful use of their land - so long as such use does not cause spillover effects that harm their neighbors. In my view, no one should have to move out of his or her home because a neighboring landowner chooses to build an industrial wind project.
\
There is more to the wind tower issue than esthetics or harmful spillover effects on nearby residents. These towers bring harmful environmental effects as well.
\
An industrial size turbine requires as much as three acres of impervious pads, like paved parking lots. They require interstate-sized roads to the ridge lines to transport these industrial-sized machines onto our mountain tops. The roads and pads on mountain tops will cause serious erosion and will degrade water quality in our rivers and lakes. There will also be harmful effects on wildlife.
\
It is also upsetting to local people when an industrial wind project developer with big profit expectations rolls into a town. Such developers have big money, bring a large bagful of Federal subsidies, and enjoy a state mandate requiring the utilities to purchase their power at above the market price. They hire lawyers, experts, and PR consultants who know the Public Service Board process and can run over a town or a community.
\
Last May a bipartisan group of senators tried to amend the RESET (Renewable Energy Standard) bill (now Act 56) to require the Public Service Board to give ""substantial deference"" to local land use plans relating to large scale wind project applications before the Board. The Senate voted 10-19 to reject this amendment. As a result, towns can give input to the Public Service Board, but the decision making power lies with three unelected people appointed by the Governor. There is no local control for industrial wind or energy project siting.
\
For all of these reasons, I have become firmly committed to sharply increasing the power of local municipalities to regulate - or even prohibit - industrial wind projects when the town determines that the negative impact of industrial wind turbines far outweigh the supposed benefits.
\
Renewable energy, for the most part, is a good thing. I support net metering for home-scaled wind and solar, fish friendly small scale hydro, and mining landfills and bio digesters for methane. But at some point the rush into large scale (and subsidized) renewable energy becomes too costly, and too destructive of human and environmental values, to merit continued support. We have reached that point with Big Wind, and it's time to slow this rush to ""renewable energy of all kinds at whatever cost.""
\
I ask our legislators to support a moratorium on new wind projects until they can answer how well our existing projects have lived up to their developers' promises, how have they impacted the environment, and how they have affected their neighbors and communities. A hiatus in development would also give us a chance to develop real siting standards, find meaningful ways for our cities and towns to participate, and study the regulatory processes of governments (like Denmark's) that do a better job than we do in Vermont.

Not Voting Is Not an Answer
\
To the Editor:
\
In response to the letter from Connie Kroner on the Lebanon school budget and voter turnout (""Lebanon Voters Are Worn Down,"" March 25), I just want to say, I am sorry you feel that way. If you are unhappy with the budget proposed by the School Board or by anything happening in the city, the only way you can make a difference is to vote. Saying that you don't vote because you care too much but don't believe it makes a difference is not a solution.
\
Low voter turnout is a serious problem in Lebanon. You are correct that 10 percent turnout is abysmal and the decisions of our city should not be in the hands of so few citizens. But please come out and vote! I believe that lack of voter turnout is plain apathy and not being informed. And by not voting, people lose the right to complain about the outcomes.
\
I personally support the School Board and was thrilled when the wonderful new middle school was finally built. I made sure I voted every time the issue came up.

The N.H. Tax Squeeze
\
To the Editor:
\
Recently I listened to a panel composed of three of Hanover's representatives to the Legislature explain to residents in the retirement community where I live their frustrations with the minority party's inability to move forward on progressive legislation dealing with serious fiscal issues confronting the state. What these well-educated, relatively affluent, educationally privileged representatives fail to understand is why their colleagues in the majority party refuse to vote for any legislation that carries the tag of broad-based taxes. It is not out of meanness of disposition. It has to do with demographics.
\
The small towns in New Hampshire are populated by individuals generally far less affluent, and often less educationally privileged, who are confronted with increasingly large local property taxes that make them fearful of losing their homes if they can't find the money to pay. Thus, the thought of shouldering additional broad-based income and sales taxes is abhorrent and threatening. These small-town citizens are not less intelligent, but they do, collectively, have common sense.
\
These mid-level middle class members understand that they just don't have the money to pay for the upkeep of their town's basic governmental services in addition to state-mandated taxes.
\
The answer to this reality, obviously, is tax reform. But the representatives I heard didn't address that issue. They just wrung their hands about the majority party's intransigent behavior without understanding that the citizens in small towns can't afford to pay for expenses that could, and should, be paid for by revenue from progressive statewide taxation laws involving the ""upper one percent,"" affluent businesses, professionals and well-off retirees.
\
Forty-six years of living in Coos County and 15 serving on a regional school board before moving back to Hanover taught me these hard lessons.

Own Your Own Energy Source
\
To the Editor:
\
I applaud the possibility of Hartford putting a 750 Kw PV system on top of old landfill space. We need every addition we can get to renewable non-carbon energy sources. That said, if I were a Hartford taxpayer, I would have serious questions. Why isn't the town looking at available low- or no-interest capital funding so that after the energy and savings pays off the cost of this infrastructure, it would net almost free electricity to meet needs and lower local taxes? Contracting for the provision of ongoing operations and maintenance creates good local jobs that also keep money and savings circulating within the local community.
\
We are on the threshold of major changes in the way renewable energy works to save money and leave a livable planet for coming generations. We need only look to Germany to see better business models that have produced widespread and speedy deployment of renewable energy while building stronger local communities. In my view, it's time to leave behind business models based on continuing profits for corporations - It's time to adopt models that produce decentralized clean energy owned by the end users.

Learn About Solar Power
\
To the Editor:
\
I want to let folks know about two exciting community solar forums. But first, sincere thanks to five 4th-graders from Norwich's Marion Cross Elementary School who have raised almost $500 to support SERG to help prevent climate change. Along the way, they are educating their classmates about renewable power with a soccer ball and jump rope that charge flashlights.
\
There are two upcoming forums about community group-net-metered solar, which enables homeowners to get power from a remotely located solar project and save money.
\
The first will take place Tuesday in the Martha Rich Theater at Thetford Academy. Doors open at 6 p.m. for refreshments and discussion with eight contractors developing community solar projects. At 6:30, the Thetford Energy Committee will explain how community solar works, followed by a brief conversation with the eight solar developers. For more information, contact 802-785-4126 or bwalker@SERG-info.org.
\
The second forum is Wednesday, April 8, from 6:30-8:30 p.m. at the Montshire Museum of Science in Norwich. Kevin Jones, deputy director and professor from the Institute for Energy and the Environment at Vermont Law School, will give an overview of group net metering and community solar, followed by discussions with five solar developers. This forum is sponsored by Hartford Energy Commission, Montshire Museum, Norwich Energy Committee, Sustainable Energy Resource Group, Sustainable Woodstock and Upper Valley Sierra Club. For more information contact Alan Johnson, alan@datdec.com, 603-252-8451.
\
Both forums are free and open to anyone who might be interested in learning more about community solar power.

This legislative session has created greater economic security, more opportunity, and a better quality of life for all Vermonters. We came together to make progress for those who elected us to serve. And together we made this biennium one of the most productive and successful in recent memory.
\
All over Vermont we are seeing the results of the work we've done together.
\
Vermont now has the second lowest unemployment rate in America, and we've created nearly 11,000 jobs since 2011.
\
Vermont is now home to one of the top ten most promising tech hubs in America, and our focus on making Vermont a leader in charting a cleaner, greener energy future is paying off. We lead the nation in per capita solar job creation. In 2013 alone, nearly 1,000 solar jobs were created, and in the past three years we have added four times the amount of solar onto the grid.
\
We've rebuilt for the future after Irene, ensuring Vermont is better prepared to withstand the storms that are headed our way. And we have invested in many of our downtowns, strengthening jobs, housing, and community all over the state. From Kaman Composites in Bennington to WCW in Manchester to GE in Rutland to Mylan in St. Albans, companies in Vermont are thriving, adding jobs, and making Vermonters proud.
\
But while all of this is good news we know that the job is not done. There are too many Vermonters working harder than ever in this economic recovery, but still struggling to make ends meet and get ahead.
\
These are the Vermonters who will benefit from the work we have done together these past two years.
\
JOBS AND ECONMICOPPORTUNITY
\
This biennium we continued our focus on creating jobs and expanding economic opportunity for Vermonters. We created the Vermont Enterprise Incentive Fund so that we can act quickly to attract and retain jobs and compete with other states. We boosted VEDA's Vermont Entrepreneurial Lending Program and doubled the capacity of the Small Business Offering Exemption to support small business investment. We doubled the Downtown Tax Credit Program to continue the growth and revitalization of Vermont's downtowns and villages.
\
Building on the success we've had growing jobs through investments in renewable energy, we expanded net metering to allow more Vermont homeowners and businesses to cut their energy bills, reduce reliance on dirty fuels and create green jobs for Vermonters.
\
In addition, we made the biggest investment in state history in Vermont's roads and bridges, growing jobs by repairing a record 100 bridges and over 370 miles of roads.
\
EDUCATION
\
As I said two years ago at the start of my second term, Vermont's future prosperity will be bright if we can take the great education system we have in Vermont and make it the best. During this legislative biennium we have improved education from the earliest years through professional training.
\
This year we expanded access to universal pre-kindergarten education to all three and four year-olds so every child in Vermont will have an opportunity to arrive at kindergarten ready to learn. Combined with a $37 million federal grant to support early childhood education programs, Vermonters born today will have a brighter future ahead than at any time in the history of our state.
\
We also expanded opportunities for Vermont students to prepare for the higher skill, higher wage jobs that 21st century employers offer, by providing personalized learning plans, internships and workforce training.
\
To ensure more working families are able to send their children to college, we've done something truly extraordinary that few states can match: Thanks to expanded dual enrollment, early college programs and the Vermont Strong Scholars Program you passed this session, Vermont students who go to college in Vermont and agree to work in the state after they graduate can now receive up to two years of free college education. As students and parents nationwide struggle with ever-rising student loan debt, we in Vermont are figuring out innovative ways to make college more affordable for middle class families.
\
We all know that kids cannot learn when they are hungry. I am proud to say that last year Vermont became the first state in the nation to provide free lunch for all low-income students.
\
HELPING VERMONTERS
\
The combination of the worst economic recession since the Great Depression and misguided federal cuts to important programs has dealt a blow to Vermont's middle class. This biennium, we took a number of steps to turn the tide and help get working Vermonters back on their feet.
\
Recognizing that everyone who puts in a full day's work deserves to make a wage that will give them and their family a fighting chance, we're raising the minimum wage higher in each of the next four years, joining a growing number of states nationwide that are moving on their own in the face of congressional inaction.
\
And we're taking steps to help the most vulnerable Vermonters by increasing the Vermont Rental Subsidy Program and Family Supportive Housing for families who need assistance to stay in permanent housing, by investing $300,000 to help support Vermont emergency shelters and increase seasonal capacity, and by increasing support for child care.
\
TACKLING OPIATEADDICTION IN VERMONT
\
In my State of the State speech at the beginning of this legislative session, I said we can no longer afford to avert our eyes to the rising tide of heroin and other opiate addiction here in Vermont. We know this is a crisis every state faces, though few have wanted to talk about it openly. I know the conversation here has been difficult but important, and I am so proud of the progress we have made. Thanks to the legislature's hard work this session, Vermont is now leading the nation by finding innovative ways to address the addiction crisis.
\
Right now, we are eliminating waiting lists at drug treatment centers, primarily in Chittenden County, the Northeast Kingdom and central Vermont, ensuring treatment services are immediately available to every Vermonter in need.
\
We're implementing statewide evidence-based assessments and pre-trial services to move addicted Vermonters who have committed certain crimes to support their habits into treatment when appropriate. Judges will now also have the option of tougher sentencing of individuals transporting drugs into Vermont and for those who use dangerous weapons to break into homes and steal property to support a drug habit.
\
These changes, along with others that enable us to treat drug addiction as a health care issue, rather than strictly a criminal issue, are critical in preserving the high quality of life that Vermonters enjoy, visitors seek, and companies prize when making decisions about where to grow.
\
I was also proud that the Legislature worked with me to add protections for Vermonters who are victims of domestic abuse, ensuring weapons relinquished by those subject to a relief from abuse order are stored safely and effectively. In addition, we updated the law to prohibit rapists from obtaining visitation or custody rights to children conceived as a result of sexual assault.
\
We took on tough issues, passing legislation allowing those with painful terminal illness to end their suffering on their own terms and making Vermont the first state in the nation to require the labeling of food produced from genetic engineering.
\
With the leadership of House Speaker Shap Smith and Senate President Pro Tem John Campbell, we pulled together on behalf of working Vermonters, employers, women, children, the environment, and strong communities. When we disagreed, we found compromise and set Vermont on a path for continued success.
\
This session we proved that democracy is alive and well in Vermont. There is still work to be done, and the road ahead will bring with it a new set of challenges. But thanks to our tradition of working together and focusing on the people who elected us to serve, we'll meet those challenges head on.

Saturday February 5, 2011
\
BRATTLEBORO -- The House Natural Resources and Energy Committee is reviewing the annual energy bill, the language of which has potentially serious consequences for Vermont ratepayers.
\
The legislation, House Bill No. 56 sponsored by Democrats Tony Klein of East Montpelier and Margaret Cheney of Norwich, proposes to enact various statutes relating to energy and the use of renewable electricity generation to meet the state's growing needs.
\
The measure, as it was introduced last month, establishes a Renewable Energy Investment (REI-Vermont) program for plants in the state to be owned and operated by the retail electric utilities if they produce greater than 2.2 megawatts.
\
The plants would serve to provide electricity directly to Vermonters while creating a customer optional charge on energy bills to cover the capital costs of renewable plants up front.
\
It also proposes a revision and expansion of the Sustainably Priced Energy Enterprise Development (SPEED) program to have one-third of the state's power come from renewable sources within Vermont. Among other provisions, the bill would move the home weatherization assistance program from the office of economic opportunity to the entity appointed to deliver electric energy efficiency and heating and process fuel efficiency programs.
\
But discussions on the energy bill remain in the preliminary stages at the Statehouse. Lawmakers described the bill as a moving target that will no doubt undergo changes through testimony in the following weeks.
\
""This is still very early in the process, we have to keep that in mind,"" said Rep. Sarah Edwards, P/D-Brattleboro and member of the energy committee.
\
Regarding the SPEED program, representatives have already modified discussions to add thermal energy in the form of biomass to the baseload renewable item.
\
Rep. Michael Hebert, R-Vernon, said expanding SPEED requires the state to generate 33 percent of renewable energy, as it is currently written in the legislation.
\
""This mandate would force our utilities to purchase power from in-state generators even when out-of-state power could be purchased at significantly lower rates,"" said Hebert, a member of the Natural Resources and Energy Committee in his first-term in the Statehouse. ""The resulting increased costs for achieving this goal will be passed on to the ratepayers.""
\
The new program that would come out of the bill, REI-Vermont, would also add millions to energy costs, said Hebert.
\
""REI-Vermont would be paid for by the ratepayers of Vermont by utilizing a 3 cents per kW hour default charge. The nuance of this charge is that it has an opt-out option which would allow a ratepayer to choose to pay up to 5 cents per kW hour to subsidize renewable energy generators,"" he said.
\
Edwards said REI-Vermont does not have much traction in Montpelier and the committee has not heard appropriate solutions for the program so far.
\
Hebert also worries about the continuation of the Clean Energy Development Fund (CEDF) without the Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant.
\
Presently, Yankee pays the entire cost ($6 million) for the subsidy and in its present form, the energy bill would transfer that amount to ratepayers, he said. Having the plant close as scheduled in March 2012 would increase electric rates by 30 percent, Hebert added.
\
""This is an unfair and devastating burden being placed on already financially stressed Vermonters,"" he said. ""Add in the additional fees and/or surcharges established by H.B. 56 and you would see an increase in your annual energy costs of over $400. We Vermonters cannot afford this.""
\
But Edwards said there are always associated adjustments when an employer leaves the area and Vermonters must think of the long-term safety concerns with the nuclear facility.
\
""The historical truth is, that no plant in the world, including the United States, has ever operated for more than 47 years,"" she said.
\
Instead, the state should continue to take steps forward for greater generation within Vermont, according to Edwards.
\
""Utilities have already been making the transition to other sources,"" she said. ""Rates are going up and a way to counteract that is to keep our usage flat, and that is what Vermonters have accomplished over the past several years with our investments in efficiency and weatherization.""
\
Other Windham County lawmakers have also expressed their support for the measure.
\
""The energy bill is a work in progress. The committee is looking for ways to increase in-state renewable energy, increase net-metering and find funding for the Lean Energy Development Fund,"" said Rep. Carolyn Partridge, D-Windham. ""All of these are laudable goals.""
\
Wardsboro Democrat John Moran said it is positive legislation for renewable generation to meet the state's energy needs while supporting the economy and a healthy environment.
\
The Natural Resources and Energy Committee will continue to hear testimony on the energy bill next week.
\
In the Committees
\
-- Rep. David Deen, D-Putney, said the House Committee on Fish, Wildlife & Water Resources said they met with the commissioner of the Department of Public Service, state nuclear engineers and geologists regarding Vermont Yankee.
\
Earlier this week, Gov. Peter Shumlin instructed the DPS to appoint a new reliability oversight committee following the most recent discovery of tritium leaks at the plant. Deen said the committee was updated about the ongoing tritium spikes in the on-site wells and spoke with DPS about the function of the new oversight committee.
\
Deen, chairman of the committee, said that new expertise within the oversight group will be able to assist the Legislature for future Yankee-related topics.
\
""We will be able to call them to address us,"" he said. ""Having access to this expertise is going to help us.""
\
-- Brattleboro Democrat Valerie Stuart said the House Education Committee reviewed the adoption of a slightly revised Senate Resolution requesting a suspension of penalties from the federal No Child Left Behind (NCLB) policy until elementary and secondary education acts are reauthorized.
\
""The House revision of the resolution will be voted on this coming Wednesday. Notably, the resolution directs the Secretary of State to send a copy of the resolution to the Vermont congressional delegation,"" she said.
\
The committee also met with Vermont superintendents and asked them to develop a list of aspects of NCLB they would like Gov. Peter Shumlin to bring to federal education officials.
\
""Last week, the committee made the same request of the Vermont Principals Association,"" Stuart said.
\
Happenings in the Statehouse
\
-- Edwards led a new House Resolution urging immediate action on climate change-related policies within the state.
\
Legislators say the resolution recognizes the threat of climate change, which requires a renewed effort throughout state government. The measure also acknowledges the steps taken within Vermont to curb the effects of climate change, such as improving thermal efficiency in 25 percent of the state's older housing stock and increasing in-state renewable energy sources.
\
""What the resolution was intended to do was refocus the Legislature on the importance of climate change,"" said Edwards. ""And the reading of the resolution coincided with many people coming to the Statehouse on climate action day.""
\
Deen said the resolution passed on a voice vote and serves as a statement of concern on the part of the body as a whole.
\
The resolution received massive support from the majority party, including nearly all of Windham County's House Democrats.
\
""I felt strongly for a long time that global climate change has to be a priority,"" said Stuart. ""The research is in, and the public is really on-board with this ... Vermont can turn this really tough situation into a positive.""
\
Rep. Matt Trieber, D-Rockingham, said it was exciting to watch the House overwhelmingly pass the resolution.
\
""The passage occurred in the presence of representatives of 350.org and other activists from around the state,"" said Trieber, a co-sponsor of the measure. ""It's encouraging to see the commitment of the Vermont House of Representatives to address what is one of the most pressing issues of our time.""
\
-- A bill sponsored by Rep. Oliver Olsen, R-Jamaica, is nearly through the Senate one week after it passed the House.
\
Residents of Jamaica approved a charter change last November to allow certain town positions to be appointed rather than elected. Since charters require legislative approval, Olsen introduced such a bill at the beginning of the session.
\
-- The state is updating its Public Transit Policy Plan and is asking for public input for the revised version.
\
The plan, last updated in 2007, consists of policies, goals and strategies for meeting the needs of transit user in areas of fixed routes, ride sharing and others.
\
One of the public forums is scheduled for Rockingham beginning at 7 p.m. on Wednesday.
\
-- The House and Senate Appropriations Committees will hold a public hearing on Feb. 14 from 4 to 6 p.m. on all Vermont Interactive Television sites.
\

Second Congregational Church joins the solar energy community
\
BENNINGTON >> Installation work has been completed on the 72 panel solar array installed on the roof of the Second Congregational Church UCC on Hillside St. The solar panel array will produce approximately 20,000 kW-hr of energy during the course of a year and result in a 70 - 75% reduction of the annual electrical energy costs for the church. Solar production began May 19th and has progressed according to expectations. Solar Pro of Arlington, VT was the contractor and the project was funded by the congregation and a $20,000 grant from Green Mountain Power.
\
This project evolved from a detailed review of energy use by a committee of church members. The first priority was the replacement of an old boiler. Once this was accomplished the next area of opportunity was addressing the electric costs of the church facilities. In November 2014 Green Mountain Power announced the availability of competitive grants for solar projects for non-profit organizations. Prior to this, grants had been available only for business and private homeowners. After meeting with several solar contractors, the Second Congregational Church selected Solar Pro to assist with the grant preparation and to handle the project if the grant award was successful. In early December the church was notified by Green Mountain Power it would receive one of the maximum $20,000 grants from the total of nine grants awarded.
\
Work began immediately with Solar Pro to apply for the Vermont certificate of public good and other required applications from local and state authorities. These activities proceeded on schedule so that in April 2015 equipment began arriving at the church and construction began. By May 19th all the required local and state inspections had been completed and solar power production began.
\
The solar array is mounted on the south facing roof of the church and consists of 72 solar panels manufactured by Canadian Solar rated at 260 watts each. Each panel utilizes an Enphase micro-inverter to convert the power produced by the solar panel from DC (direct current) to AC (alternating current) so it can be returned to the power grid. The existing electric meter continues to measure power used by the church facilities. A new meter was installed to measure the power generated by the solar array. This allows ""net metering"" to occur with Green Mountain Power. During the course of a year the resulting costs to the church for electric power are expected to be reduced by 70%. Completion of this project with the assistance and support of Solar Pro and Green Mountain Power will continue to allow the Second Congregational Church to make its facilities available for the many organizations which utilize the church.

"
276,"In two weeks, Chittenden County voters -- excluding Huntington and Colchester -- will winnow the field of Democratic Senate candidates from eight to the six whose names will appear on the November ballot.\The field is a mix of men and women, incumbents and hopeful challengers, city dwellers and suburbanites, longtime party members and candidates who have worn other party labels, baby boomers and members of Generation X.\The candidates have marched in some parades, been introduced at private gatherings, attended a forum or two, set out a few signs at busy intersections and sat for interviews on Channel 17.\The challenge that voters face is discerning sufficient differences among the candidates to be able to choose who continues to the next round of the election process and who gets voted off the ballot.\Based on responses to three questions and their comments at a South Burlington forum, here's what the eight candidates say sets them apart, proves they would be an asset in the Senate for their Chittenden constituents and demonstrates what they would do if elected.\Tim Ashe\""I am not a go-with-the-flow kind of legislator,"" Ashe wrote, noting that with Democrats controlling the governor's office and the Legislature, it is vital that there are lawmakers willing to ""poke, prod and challenge"" the information and legislation offered by the administration, legislative leaders and interests groups. He said he has a record of poking and prodding.\He also cites his age. ""I think the generational lens through which I see the state of Vermont is a special value to the Senate. It is my age group that struggles to find affordable homes, to pay student debt years after graduating, to land decent-paying jobs.""\Ashe, who has served two terms and runs as both a Democrat and Progressive, said he has a record of responsiveness to constituents and adherence to values such as environmental protection, renewable energy, fair taxation, health care reform, protection of civil, women's and workers' rights.\""I think I am most proud of my role on the health care reform bill. I am a strong supporter of reforming our broken, costly system. That said, we need to sweat the details,"" he said. ""I insisted on not voting on the bill until I understood all the moving parts.""\Ashe predicts tax reform will be a focus for the Legislature in 2013. ""While much of the media attention will be on recent hot-button issues like the so-called cloud tax, I will work to make sure we are looking at the entire tax picture of who pays, how much and if it is fair.""\Philip Baruth\Baruth, who has served one term in the Senate, said his focus was and would continue to be ""not just on individual issues but on the larger process, how it works and -- all too often -- how it doesn't work.""\""I am not afraid to challenge the deeper system itself,"" he said. ""The truth is that too many decisions in Montpelier are made behind closed doors, by too few people."" He cited a campaign finance bill, which he supported, that would have ""largely moved unregulated corporate money out of Vermont's election process."" It caused a ""stir,"" ended up misplaced for a year and then reappeared too late in the session for action.\Baruth listed a law he worked on that expands access to preschool as ""the single strongest step we can take to make sure our kids compete globally and enter kindergarten ready to learn."" He also noted legislation he co-sponsored that expanded insurance coverage for children with autism and other development delay conditions -- ""lifting a huge burden from those families.""\In the coming session, Baruth promises to take on an agricultural giant -- Monsanto -- by introducing a bill on Day One that would require labeling of genetically modified foods and allow farmers to save and plant seeds from the crops they grow, ""a right Monsanto now requires them to sign away.""\Despite the risk Monsanto will sue, Baruth argues, ""Vermonters have a basic human right to know the composition and quality of the food they eat.""\Sally Fox\With years of experience in the Statehouse, both as a legislator and as an advocate, Fox said, she knows how to get things done.\""Candidates running for office often promise that they will fight for legislation, but the reality is that getting a bill passed into law requires skills that I have honed over my career to navigate this complicated process,"" she said. ""I can say that the majority of issues that I have advocated for have become law.""\As a member of the Senate Finance and Health and Welfare committees, Fox helped write the health legislation in the recent biennium that sets the state on a course toward a government-financed, universal coverage system. And she was active in developing the mental health law that responded to the crisis caused when Tropical Storm Irene forced the closure of the state psychiatric hospital.\Fox also cited a measure she sponsored that was included in a larger health reform law ""as an accomplishment that will help Vermonters with high prescription drug costs. The new law caps the out-of-pocket spending for people with high deductibles on non-generic drugs.""\Critical decisions in the next steps of health reform come up next winter and Fox said, ""I hope to maintain my role as a key player in the process."" She explained, ""We will need to sort out the balance of taxes, federal funds and premium payments that will be necessary.""\Fox also wants to participate in public education about health reform. ""It is imperative that people are comfortable with this huge change to the current system.""\Peter Hunt\""Probably one of the most important qualities one can bring to the Statehouse is the ability to work with others to get things done,"" Hunt said, noting that he has a record of success both in politics and in his profession.\He cited service on the House Appropriations Committee where, a legislative staff member noted, his ""evenness, unfailing courtesy and good spirits"" made him as asset to the legislative process. Hunt served three terms in the House.\He said combining leadership with a ""get-along"" style also contributed to his success as president of the village of Essex Junction and as a school principal.\Hunt spotlighted two laws he initiated and pushed to passage while in the House. One added veterans outreach counselors to the budget. Another was a ""ground-breaking"" anti-bullying law.\In the next session, Hunt says lawmakers face two critical decisions about the government-financed health care system that's in the works -- choosing the kind of care that will be offered and determining how it will be financed.\""I will work diligently to understand the full ramifications of these proposals, work to education my Senate members and constituents on the pros and cons of such decisions and then work to reach consensus about what we feel we can achieve.""\Debbie Ingram\Ingram is one of two candidates in the field of eight who has never served in the Vermont Legislature, but she suggests she would bring a unique new voice to the Senate.\""I have the most business experience of any of the candidates,"" she said, adding she would also bring a breadth of knowledge of regional issues because of her involvement in local government and county-wide planning. She also noted she would be a voice for a minority -- the lesbian and gay community.\Ingram cited success in resolving challenging police personnel issues as a member of the Williston selectboard as evidence of her ability to find solutions and consensus.\In her role as director of the Vermont Interfaith Action she helped bring public shuttle bus service to the medical offices on Tilley Drive, and sponsored four forums in support of the health reform law, worked to secure policy changes affecting the homeless and joined other advocates in winning approval for a tax increment financing district in Burlington.\If elected, Ingram sees pending decisions on the next phase of health care reform as the Legislature's priority. The questions that must be answered include how to pay for the plan, what coverage will be offered, what rates of pay will doctors receive, how will costs be cut, how will small businesses survive the change and how will the state mesh its plan with that of the federal government.\""Vermont has the opportunity to lead the nation on this vital issue,"" she said, ""and we must get this plan right.""\Ginny Lyons\Having served seven terms in the Senate, Lyons argues she offers voters a significant record of accomplishment and leadership. She has been chairwoman of the Senate Natural Resources Committee since 2003 and served as vice chairwoman of a slew of other committees over the years.\""I look forward to returning to the Legislature with my understanding of current environmental issues, management, health and welfare finance, systems of care, water quality, housing, workforce development, energy development and regulation, land-use planning and other issues important to our district,"" she wrote.\Lyons had a hand in numerous energy related bills over the past two years, including a provision authorizing a pilot community supported biomass project in Chittenden County. She also listed as accomplishments the ban on hydraulic fracturing that passed, revisions to net metering, expansion of autism insurance coverage and a resolution condemning the U.S. Supreme Court decision in the Citizens United case that allows corporations and unions to make unlimited independent expenditures in elections.\In addition to the big issues such as health care that all lawmakers will have to deal with next year, Lyons noted a special issue she wants to pursue in 2013 to ""improve the affordability of living in Chittenden County."" She calls it thermal efficiency and describes it as a way to compare the energy efficiency of homes and give value to investments that homeowners make.\Loyal Ploof\Ploof describes himself as a long-time local activist who works hard on issues on which he is passionate -- and that's lots of issues from ending fluoridation of drinking water to repealing instant runoff voting in Burlington.\Ploof said that as someone who once spent a year on the street, struggled to find affordable housing and now rents, he understands low-income issues like none of the other candidates.\He proposes ending property taxes as a way to make Vermont more affordable and help keep young people from leaving the state.\Ploof said he opposes the ""smart meters"" that electric utilities are installing because ""of privacy issues."" The smart meters share information about customer power usage with the utilities.\He criticized the Legislature for failing to enact a death with dignity law that would allow individuals to carry out end-of-life decisions. ""That should have already been passed.""\He also noted the Legislature's failure to sufficiently protect animals from abuse, which is a personal priority because of his work with dogs.\As an opponent of chemical additives in drinking water, he said he would push for tougher state restrictions.\David Zuckerman\As a successful organic vegetable and meat farmer and a former seven-term House member, Zuckerman said he has a record of accomplishments. He noted, too, that having lived in Burlington and now in Hinesburg, he understands both the urban and rural issues in Chittenden County.\One of two ""fusion candidates"" on the ballot, Zuckerman has previously run for elective office as a Progressive. During his years in the House, Democrats twice picked him to chair the House Agriculture Committee.\His six years on the House Natural Resources Committee earned him recognition among environment advocates.\Zuckerman explained his style. ""I am clear on where I stand and I am willing to go against the grain in a respectful way.""\Zuckerman said he was a leader in securing passage of the civil union law and later the marriage equality law allowing same-sex couples to marry. He said he was raising concerns about genetically modified seeds at the Statehouse long before other lawmakers recognized the problem.\If elected, Zuckerman said he would push to continue the momentum toward a government-financed health care system covering all Vermonters, press to require labeling of genetically modified food, support end-of-life choices, be active to win organizing rights for childcare workers and look for ways to expand support for sustainable agriculture.\Contact Nancy Remsen at 578-5685 or nremsen@burlingtonfreepress.com.

277,"By Tim Johnson\MIDDLEBURY -- They're almost finished building their solar-powered house. When they're done, by early August, they'll have only a couple of weeks to admire it before they have to start taking it apart.\Then they'll load it on a couple of flatbed trucks bound for Washington, D.C., where they'll reassemble it on the National Mall as an entry in Solar Decathlon, a high-visibility international competition that draws thousands of visitors and plenty of critical scrutiny from professional builders.\They are several dozen students at Middlebury College. What's noteworthy about their undertaking is not just that they've acquired the knowledge and skills to design and build a model house -- a fully equipped two-bedroom structure that someone actually could live in, mind you -- or that they've raised hundreds of thousands of dollars to cover the materials, labor and other expenses of this two-year project. What's just as remarkable is that they decided to enter the competition to begin with. They're going up against teams from major research universities that turn out engineers and architects in profusion.\Middlebury is a liberal arts college, for crying out loud. What do English majors know about building solar houses, anyway?\A lot more than they knew two years ago, it turns out. They're almost ready to put their creation to the test -- alongside houses designed and built by crack engineering students from the likes of Caltech of Pasadena, and Tongji University of Shanghai. Their house will be judged, among other things, on how well it accommodates daily living needs, such as laundry and dishwashing.\Each of the competing teams will have to hold a dinner party, using the kitchen. Team Middlebury has planned the menu but is keeping it secret -- except to say the ingredients will come from Vermont farms.\The project won't end with the competition on the Mall. When Solar Decathlon's week ends, the Middlebury students will take the house apart, have it trucked back to Vermont, and install it on their campus, where it will become ... a mini-dormitory.\Liberal-arts students building a solar-powered residence hall? Whose idea was this, anyway?\Winning over a skeptical president\One person who got the ball rolling, back in 2009, was Addison Godine. Now a senior, he's an architectural-studies major and green-building enthusiast. He heard about Solar Decathlon from his mother, who teaches art in Boston and introduced him to a student member of the Boston team that was fielding an entry in that year's competition.\""I wondered if Middlebury had ever done this,"" Godine recalled the other day while working at the construction site, just south of campus. Godine emailed Andrea Murray, a practicing architect and visiting instructor who replied that no, Middlebury had never entered, but this might be the year to give it a try. Godine thought the project would be appropriate for the college, given its focus on student engagement and environmental sustainability, and he started talking up the idea.\Meanwhile, a well-placed campus figure was reading up on the nexus of food, energy and the environment -- a topic that Steven Chu, secretary of energy and a Nobel laureate, was saying some interesting things about. Jessica Liebowitz, wife of college president Ron Liebowitz, was exploring Chu's website when she saw a reference to the Solar Decathlon, a biennial collegiate competition staged by the Department of Energy.\""She asked me if we had a team entering the 2011 Solar Decathlon, since an intent to apply was due in the fall of 2009,"" Ron Liebowitz wrote in an email. ""I said I didn't know what the Solar Decathlon was, and so she explained it and then directed me to the information on the web.""\Liebowitz said he looked at the lists of competing schools.\""I thought Jessica's idea was borderline absurd,"" he continued. ""I reminded her we had no graduate students, no engineering school, and only a small, liberal arts pre-architecture program ... She responded by saying, 'This is right up our students' alley. It is a perfect combination of academic rigor, innovative approaches to environmental and global issues ...'""\Liebowitz said he remained dubious, but his skepticism diminished after he and his wife held two luncheons with faculty and students to discuss the idea. There was enough enthusiasm all around to start working on an application -- a major undertaking in itself, because it meant coming up with a practical, plausible design.\A Middlebury contingent traveled to Washington to see the 2009 competition on the Mall and came away persuaded their college could pull it off.\The plan for the house evolved out of an intensive design class, held during the January 2010 intersession, in which students worked collaboratively and critiqued each other's work. A proposal was submitted to the Department of Energy in February. In April, the students learned they had made it past the first cut.\Of 45 applying schools, they were among the 20 finalists chosen.\To a higher standard\Construction began in March, but a wide range of preparatory work led up to that -- researching materials and technologies, lining up professional consultants, scheduling and budgeting, designing a website, managing communications and, of course, fundraising.\Altogether, 85 students with 25 majors -- from anthropology and history to molecular biology and mathematics -- have participated in this project.\""The biology students study what to grow in the greenhouse,"" said Murray, the lead faculty adviser on the project. ""The economics majors study costs and benefits. The chemistry majors look at the composition and life span of the materials.""\No engineers, no matter. Murray sees the paucity of technical training as a plus.\""Their lack of knowledge is their greatest asset,"" she said, ""because they're questioning everything.""\The overall budget amounts to about $600,000, well beyond the cost of the labor and materials. Other expenses include transportation -- of the disassembled house and the 40 students who will staff the site in Washington during the competition -- and professional consulting. Then there's the geothermal well that will be sunk for the house after it's installed on campus.\Kris Williams, an environmental-studies major, has helped lead the fundraising campaign, which rounded up in-kind donations, sponsorships and cash donations totaling about $450,000 -- mostly from alumni.\""We're going to raise another $50,000 to $70,000 to establish the house back in Middlebury,"" Williams said recently, taking a break from work he was doing on the house. He was preparing to drill a 3-inch hole in the floor, and he was more interested in talking about the cellulose insulation that would be blown through that hole than about the money they still had to raise.\In terms of environmental responsibility, cellulose beats foam insulation hands down, Williams said. It's locally sourced (mostly shredded newspaper), it's nontoxic and biodegradable, and it takes much less energy to make.\""Cellulose requires 750 BTUs per pound to produce,"" Williams said brightly, echoing figures that can be found on the project's website. ""Spray foam requires 40,000 BTUs per pound.""\The choice of cellulose won't necessarily be rewarded by the Solar Decathlon's scoring system, which puts a premium on low cost and gives no bonus points for the use of local materials. The Middlebury students have made the use of local materials a priority anyway -- Vermont slate for the kitchen floor, maple wood harvested from college property, Vermont-produced floor stain.\They're also aiming for durability -- long-lasting materials -- even though that isn't rewarded in the scoring system, either. They decided to go with a metal roof because of its longer lifespan, although it's more expensive than asphalt shingles.\""In some ways, we're going beyond the contest criteria,"" Godine said. ""Our curriculum is meant to encourage thinking across disciplines. We thought perhaps we could address sustainability in a broader way than just energy.""\Murray said many of the 2009 entries on the Mall had a ""machine-like, streamlined"" quality.\By contrast, she said, the Middlebury students aim ""to bring a human element back this competition.""\The little schools that could\Middlebury isn't the only little school to test these waters. An even more unlikely contestant emerged in 2002 and 2005: Crowder College, of Neosho, Mo. Crowder is a community college that offers career training in fields ranging from truck driving to construction, drafting and design technology. In 2002, the first year the Solar Decathlon was held, Crowder finished sixth, ahead of Carnegie Mellon and Texas A&M, among other universities.\This year, Middlebury is the odd one out, and its presence lends a David-vs.-Goliath flavor to the event.\The vinyl-coated California entry (presented by the Southern California Institute of Architecture and California Institute of Technology) has a futuristic shape that overhangs a car park. The design of Team Canada (University of Calgary), which pays homage in its publicity materials to native peoples of Southern Alberta, was inspired by a tipi. Team China (Tongji University) has fashioned a Y-shaped structure from six recycled shipping containers.\The Middlebury entry, dubbed Self-Reliance, is billed in publicity materials as a 21st century New England farmhouse. It measures 995 square feet, with three big windows on the south side, 30 solar panels on the roof, a wrap-around deck. The window panes are not local. After a good deal of research, the students settled reluctantly for an Austrian brand because it optimized energy gain.\Students put the cost of the house at about $267,000, above the $250,000 threshold that earns full credit in the ""Affordability"" contest. They point out, however, that the cost was inflated by the structural steel required by the modular design they used to facilitate disassembly and transport to D.C. The same house could be built less expensively without modules, they said.\After Self-Reliance is installed permanently back on campus, four students a semester will get to live there -- by application only. They'll probably have to put up with occasional tours if the house becomes, as expected, a showpiece.\The house is designed to produce as much energy as it consumes over the course of a year, said Melissa Segil, a student on the communications team.\""When there is not enough sunlight to completely power the home, energy will be pulled from the grid (we are not 'off the grid'),"" she wrote in an email. ""But during the summer months, the solar panels will generate more energy than the house will demand, and excess energy will be sent back to the grid.""\On a recent Thursday, Phil Gordon -- the proverbial English major -- was installing cedar siding. He graduated in May, but he has stuck around to see the project through. He said he'd done some construction in high school, building decks and porches, but he'd learned a good deal more ""on the fly"" working on Self-Reliance.\""It's not too hard,"" he said.\The construction has been done mostly by the students themselves, Murray said.\""They're using professionals as mentors and guides,"" she said. ""We want the students to do as much as they can."" Tiling and drywall were done mostly by skilled tradesmen.\Murray has mostly overseen the design work, while a fellow architect and teacher, Ashar Nelson, has monitored the construction.\Astrid Schanz-Garbassi, a senior majoring in physics, has been working mostly on the communications side (she'll be writing scripts for four videos due by mid-August), but as construction got under way, she attended a safety-training session.\""I had no knowledge of construction,"" she said. ""In that one morning I learned about more saws than I knew existed.\""We learned to cut to the right length,"" she added. ""By the end of the morning, I had a few boards up in the living room, which is my favorite part of the house.""\The competition\The Solar Decathlon is a biennial competition sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy that challenges 20 collegiate teams to build solar-powered houses that are affordable, practical, appealing and energy-efficient. This year's entries will be on public display Sept. 23-Oct. 2 in the National Mall's West Potomac Park, in Washington, D.C.\The winner gets a trophy and bragging rights. The competition comprises 10 contests, most of them juried and each worth 100 points, so the maximum score is 1,000 points:\Architecture: Designs are judged for scale, proportion, environmental compatibility and inspiration, among other factors.\Market appeal: Houses are judged on their livability, marketability and ""buildability"" -- that the extent to which their materials and equipment can be immediately used by private builders.\Engineering: The functionality of heating, ventillation and air-conditioning systems, the efficiency and reliability of those systems over the course of a year.\Communications: The quality and originality of web content, video and audio presentations, messages to engage audiences, on-site graphics, displays and signage.\Affordability: Teams earn 100 points for a construction cost of $250,000 or less. Higher costs are scored on a sliding scale, up to $600,000, zero points.\Comfort zone: Uniform and comfortable ranges of temperature and humidity are rewarded. Optimal scores go to houses that maintain temperature between 71 and 76 degrees Fahrenheit and relative humidity below 60 percent.\Hot water: Houses have to be able to deliver sufficient hot water for bathing and washing. Teams are expected to provide 15 gallons of hot water within 10 minutes or less several times a day.\Appliances: This contest mimics average amounts of household appliance use. Refrigerator and freezer temperature have to be kept within specified ranges; two loads of laundry must be washed and dried every few days during the contest; and the dishwasher, run through a complete cycle, must reach 120 degrees Fahrenheit.\Home entertainment: Teams have to hold a movie night for neighbors and two dinner parties, and they are judged on the quality of the meals and the ambiance. Lights, TV and computer have to be kept on for specified periods. Cooking is simulated by boiling away 5 pounds of water within a specified time.\Energy balance: Each house is outfitted with a meter that measures the net energy produced and consumed. Full points go to the house that produces at least as much energy as the house needs during the contest week.\History: Solar Decathlons have been held in 2002, 2003, 2005, 2007 and 2009.

Editor's Note: This is the second in a two-part news analysis on wind power in Vermont. Read the first part, here.
\
The appetite for building wind projects in Vermont has tapered off in recent years.
\
A combination of factors -- the end of federal stimulus money, uncertain reauthorization of federal incentives, difficulties in connecting to the grid, competition with solar and local opposition -- have shelved at least two projects and left three others lying dormant.
\

\
Policy changes make renewables more attractive
\
Rep. Tony Klein, D-East Montpelier, who has long legislated for more renewable energy development, said lawmakers may consider new policies next session that will press utilities to find more renewable power.
\
A major policy change would be a tax on carbon, which proponents say is the most cost-effective way to curb greenhouse gas emissions.
\
But Klein warns that the policy must be crafted right the first time. Australia recently repealed laws requiring companies to pay for carbon emissions for economic reasons. That is why advocacy groups dedicated to enacting such policies in the U.S. say more of these programs must direct revenue back to residents to increase public support.
\
But another policy already discussed in the Legislature -- and enacted in 29 states and Washington, D.C. -- is a renewable portfolio standard (RPS). Already adopted in New Hampshire, New York and Massachusetts, an RPS would require utilities to purchase mandated amounts of renewable power.
\
""I think it's time to move to an RPS,"" said Klein, who is chairman of the House Natural Resources and Energy Committee. Under such a policy, Klein said, utilities would likely be looking for more renewable power to add to their portfolio. And ""the quickest and easiest way to get it is through wind,"" he said.
\
The Department of Public Service will begin studying the economic and environmental effects of moving to an RPS by December. How the RPS affects utilities would depend on how it was structured -- how much renewable power utilities would have to purchase and how these power supplies would count toward the mandate.
\
State power suppliers currently are encouraged to purchase 20 percent of their power from in-state renewables by 2017 under Vermont's SPEED program. The program was launched in 2005 to encourage the development of renewable power generation and will expire in 2017. Utilities have about 18 percent of their power coming from projects that count toward the goal, according to DPS.
\
Critics say the program allows utilities to sell renewable energy certificates for power generated in-state. When utilities sell these RECs, the power they sell to customers is not renewable but is instead market power that comes from a bucket that includes fossil fuels.
\
Proponents of the SPEED program say it encourages renewable generation to be built. And now, since the price point for renewable infrastructure is lower, utilities can consider building more renewable generation without needing to sell the RECs to subsidize the power costs.
\
At the federal level, some developers are waiting for the reauthorization of the production tax credit.
\
Harley Lee is founder and president of Endless Energy Corp., a Maine-based developer proposing up to eight 3-megawatt turbines on Little Equinox Mountain as part of the Manchester Community Wind Farm, which is currently ""on hold.""
\
""When the Federal Production tax credit expires -- as it has done something like nine times -- the wind industry sees a precipitous drop in activity. This drop is often on the order of 90 percent. Personally, I'd like to see all energy subsidies removed, but, absent that, wind should be given a subsidy that helps level the playing field,"" he said.
\
The federal tax credit for wind expired in 2013, but the U.S. Senate Finance Committee this year passed its renewal. The credit currently offers 2.3 cents per kilowatt hour for 10 years for wind projects built before 2015. It is designed to encourage investors to fund these high-capital generation projects
\
Is wind -- big or small -- right for Vermont?
\
Harnessing wind in Vermont is like ""growing bananas"" in the state, according to Mark Whitworth, executive director of Energize Vermont, a group opposing large-scale wind. It just does not make sense, he said.
\
Compared to other locations in the Northeast and the rest of the country, Vermont does not have as much wind to capture. The total capacity for wind in Vermont is about 3 gigawatts, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. In Texas, the capacity is as high as 1,900 gigawatts. In the Northeast, New York has the greatest capacity at 26 gigawatts.
\
Ben Luce is a Lyndon State College professor of physics and natural science who is critical of Vermont's renewable energy program.
\
He said even by developing all available locations for wind in the Northeast - ridgelines, hills and shorelines - wind could only provide a ""trivial amount"" of power for the region.
\
And because wind generates the most electricity in mild and cold temperature seasons in Vermont, Luce said this power does not save electric customers money in the summer when electricity prices are highest because expensive fossil fuels are burned to meet high electricity demand to power air conditioning units.
\
But other say wind power is another source of energy that is available when others are not, like solar in the evening. Having a diverse fuel mix, proponents of wind say, is necessary if the state wants to achieve it renewable energy goals.
\
Others say wind is vital to achieving Vermont renewable energy goals because
\
David Hallquist is CEO of Vermont Electric Cooperative, which is a winter-peaking utility. He said solar does not generate enough electricity in the winter months, which is when wind blows the strongest.
\
""In the winter peak, you've got to have wind,"" he said.
\
Wind opponents point to alternatives -- like solar and energy efficiency -- that would impact Vermont's environment less.
\
Billy Coster is a senior planner and policy analyst for the Agency of Natural Resources. The agency reviews the environmental impacts of energy projects.
\
""All large-scale development impacts the environment one way or another,"" he said. High elevation ridgelines often connect wildlife habitat in large continuous blocks of forests. Fragmenting this habitat (by erecting turbines) can disrupt migration patterns for wildlife, he said.
\
And with many of the projects built in the past several years, he said more time is needed to truly understand what the impacts these project have on the environment.
\
There are also technical issues for advancing renewable energy development like wind. Before more wind comes to Vermont, the region must find a backup power source for when the wind is not blowing.
\
The region's grid operator, ISO New England, says if the Northeast builds more wind, it must also find more natural gas - on which the region is currently dependent - or other reliable sources of power.
\
Renewable energy advocates are undaunted.
\
As demand management becomes more advanced, grid operators and electricity consumers can time their energy consumption when it's needed and available. This includes using a smartphone to start your dishwasher when the sun is shining and the wind is blowing.
\
And renewable energy storage options are improving, said Gabrielle Stebbins, executive director of Renewable Energy Vermont. She cited electric cars as one example.
\
Finding the right fit
\
Wind opponents say they are not against renewable energy generation. Instead, they are opposed to the commercialized climate change solutions that cloud other viable alternatives.
\
Annette Smith, executive director for Vermonters for a Clean Environment, says her group is trying to help communities adapt to the pressures of climate change in a ""way that's going to help people not hurt them.""
\
""For us to be vilified as being anti-renewable or anything is just ludicrous,"" she said. Instead, when it comes to renewable energy generation, she said ""let's do it right.""
\
There is one solution that all environmentalists agree on: to combat climate change -- using less energy.
\
The state's efficiency utility, Efficiency Vermont, has been recognized by the Obama administration as a model for confronting climate change by offering incentives to residents and businesses to install energy efficient home appliances and seal up their homes so they waste less heat.
\
But even so, the group has been lobbying in support of electric automobiles and heat pumps - both of which require more electricity. The state's thermal and transportation sectors are the leading source of Vermont's greenhouse gas emissions and proponents of the switch say moving away from gasoline and No. 2 heating oil would quickly reduce the state's carbon footprint.
\
Other solutions include putting solar panels on already disturbed areas - such as roofs and parking lots - or finding a way to store renewable energy for those times when nature is not providing.
\
For now, solar is dominating the renewable energy landscape in Vermont. And unlike solar -- which can ride on a federal tax credit for residential projects until 2017 -- similar incentives for large-scale wind remain intermittent and uncertain.
\
And until developers gain stronger support in new host communities, development of new wind projects in Vermont is likely to continue to crawl along.

280,"
The appetite for building wind projects in Vermont has tapered off in recent years.
\
A combination of factors - the end of federal stimulus money, uncertain reauthorization of federal incentives, difficulties in connecting to the grid, competition with solar and local opposition - have shelved at least two projects and left three others lying dormant.
\
But the industry might be poised to catch its second wind. Supporters and opponents agree that despite the recent timeout, wind power will likely remain a part of the region's renewable energy mix.
\
Wind opponents say Vermont's ridgelines - where all the state's utility-scale projects are located - are ecologically sensitive areas threatened by such development. Critics also cite the health and aesthetic impacts of windmills. And a few towns have taken positions against the building of commercial energy generation projects within their borders.
\
But Gov. Peter Shumlin has made it clear that his administration wants to fight climate change by harnessing all the available resources Vermont has to offer, including the wind. And public surveys indicate that, overall, Vermonters support building these projects in-state.
\
The public good of taking action on climate change, wind proponents say, outweighs the immediate costs to the environment, aesthetics and health.
\
Despite the apparent political will for these projects, the tension between local opposition and state support is sending a mixed message to developers considering projects in Vermont.
\
Steve Terry is a retired employee and consultant for Green Mountain Power, the state's dominant electric utility that developed Vermont's largest wind farm in Lowell.
\
He said to move future projects forward, developers must spend more time working with local communities.
\
""And if you can't accept that, you had better find another place to do business,"" Terry said. ""You just have to be ready to understand that that is one of the prices that you have to pay to do business in Vermont. You've got to be willing to explain to a lot of smart and sophisticated Vermonters why the project is in the general public good.""
\
Projects inch forward
\
Developers are still scouting sites, testing for wind potential, and securing permits to build Vermont's next wind farm.
\
Spanish wind giant Iberdrola Renewables is proposing two projects in southern Vermont. The company has received a certificate of public good for its 30 megawatt Deerfield Wind project located on ridge between Searsburg and Readsboro, where it is proposing 15 turbines measuring about 400 feet tall, twice the size of Green Mountain Power's existing Searsburg project.
\
The company defended its project in federal court in July after wind opponents appealed its special use permit to build in the Green Mountain National Forest. The court had not made a decision by the time this story was published.
\
The anti-wind group Vermonters for a Clean Environment says the project will set a national precedent that will open up national forest land for commercial projects. VCE claims the U.S. Forest Service violated environmental law by inadequately studying the project and its alternatives. The group also says the project will damage nearby wilderness areas due to noise and visual impact.
\
Even with this case pending, the company says it would not begin construction until it finds a buyer for the power. Iberdrola's state permit requires it to sell most of its power to state utilities at a reasonable price.
\
The company is also measuring wind at a site in Windham County, but says it will need another year or more to analyze wind data before deciding whether to move forward. The town of Windham drafted an energy plan opposing commercial wind projects.
\
Green Mountain Power hasn't ruled out more projects in Vermont. Asked whether the company plans to develop another wind project, Dottie Schnure, a company spokeswoman, said GMP is considering all options.
\
""I wouldn't say no. We are constantly looking at different options,"" she said.
\
The company is experimenting with a smaller, 100 kilowatt installation that measures up to about 200 feet. The 3-megawatt Danish VESTA turbines on Lowell Mountain stand about 459-feet tall. On average, utility-scale towers are about 420 feet high, according to Annette Smith, an anti-wind activist.
\
Renewable energy entrepreneur David Blittersdorf said there is a potential for new, mid-sized wind sites west of the Green Mountains on the ""bumps"" in the Champlain Valley, or in southern Vermont where projects are currently proposed.
\
""I'm playing a sort of waiting game,"" said Blittersdorf, president and CEO of AllEarth Renewables. ""In 10 years, I'm sure I'm going to have some more community wind projects.""
\
Blittersdorf developed the 10 megawatt Georgia Mountain Community Wind project completed in 2012.
\
Local reaction to wind
\
Jeff Wagner is president of Volkswind USA. The international wind development company has completed two projects in the U.S - and dozens internationally - and has six in the development phase in the U.S.
\
The company considered developing a wind project on Glebe Mountain in Londonderry and Windham in 2010. However, despite state policy supporting projects like his, Wagner said opposition led by the anti-wind groups made permitting the project too difficult.
\
""What we see in New England is a tension between overarching federal and state policies with local townships who sometimes get under the influence of well-funded opposition,"" he said.
\
That could change.
\
""If the community and municipal authorities in that area seem to be showing renewed interest in the idea of wind development on Glebe Mountain, then we would again be interested,"" Wagner said.
\
Since the first wave of development in the state, wind opponents have been focusing on the local level. Some town plans - such as in Windham, where Iberdrola is proposing an up to 30-turbine project - have codified a prohibition on commercial wind projects.
\
The town of Waitsfield, which has two proposed locations for wind on Northfield Ridge and the Green Mountain Range, in 2012 adopted an 18-page energy plan that prohibits any development above 1,700 feet above sea level.
\
The town's plan came after Massachusetts-based developer Citizens Energy showed an interest in the sites. Another developer out of Boston that developed the Sheffield Wind project, First Wind, has been asking landowners about possible sites near Moretown, according to the town energy committee.
\
First Wind spokesperson John LaMontagne said the company has no projects on the ""front burner"" in Vermont. However, he said developers often consider many sites before deciding to move forward on a project.
\
Karen Horn, a member of the Moretown energy committee, said the town is concerned about large-scale wind and is in the process of writing a plan related to commercial wind development.
\
Horn is also director of public policy for the Vermont League of Cities and Towns. She said many towns are just now developing these plans in response to the recent wind developments.
\
""We're kind of playing catch-up,"" she said.
\
While some towns, like Newark and Hardwick, have less stringent plans related to wind, others, like Hyde Park, do not permit ""large-scale commercial wind generation.""
\
Nonetheless, Horn said towns have little say in how the projects are sited.
\
""The towns have been pretty much ignored in the Public Service Board process,"" she said about the Section 248 siting process for energy generation projects.
\
Lawmakers have attempted to change Vermont law so state regulators would have to consider town plans when deciding whether to approve such projects. But those attempts failed and might not return to the table as the two leading proponents - Sens. Bob Hartwell, D-Bennington, and Peter Galbraith, D-Windham - are not seeking re-election.
\
The Shumlin administration and renewable energy advocates opposed giving towns more say in the siting process.
\
Shumlin has repeatedly warned that in order to confront climate change, the state must harness all its resources - forests, rivers, the sun and the wind - citing natural disasters like Tropical Storm Irene as the reason why Vermont should take action to cut its carbon footprint.
\
He acknowledges that there will be resistance to in-state generation, and set up the Energy Generation Siting Policy Commission in 2012 to find a solution, which some lawmakers and wind critics say was a toothless endeavor. None of the recommendations from the commission have become state policy.
\
Shumlin's steady push for renewable development is a significant change from the previous administration's position on wind. Former Gov. Jim Douglas was more sympathetic to community concerns, according to Eric Davis, professor emeritus of political science at Middlebury College.
\
""The statewide interest in renewable energy from wind outweighs the concerns from residents and local governments in the towns where the wind turbines will be placed,"" he said of Shumlin's view of energy projects.
\
Dean Corren, the Progressive candidate for lieutenant governor, agrees with the administration that the state needs to build more renewable power in state. But he said all energy systems have positive and negative impacts.
\
""We need utility-scale wind, but the state ought to be clear on the areas that will be off-limits to wind development,"" he said.
\
Some of those who once supported wind have since changed their position, including anti-big-wind groups like Vermonters for a Clean Environment and Energize Vermont. They point to noise as one of their chief concerns.
\
There is no consensus from communities on the noise impacts of wind turbines. Some residents say the noise does not bother them or they cannot hear the turbines. Others say it keeps them up at night and causes illness. Wind opponents point to noise variability based on location, weather conditions and wind speed.
\
After receiving complaints about noise emitted from turbines, the Vermont Public Service Board in 2013 opened up an investigation to study the adequacy of its noise standard.
\
Policy changes make renewables more attractive
\
Rep. Tony Klein, D-East Montpelier, who has long legislated for more renewable energy development, said lawmakers may consider new policies next session that will press utilities to find more renewable power.
\
A major policy change would be a tax on carbon, which proponents say is the most cost-effective way to curb greenhouse gas emissions.
\
But Klein warns that the policy must be crafted right the first time. Australia recently repealed laws requiring companies to pay for carbon emissions for economic reasons. That is why advocacy groups dedicated to enacting such policies in the U.S. say more of these programs must direct revenue back to residents to increase public support.
\
But another policy already discussed in the Legislature - and enacted in 16 states - is a renewable portfolio standard (RPS). Already adopted in New Hampshire, New York and Massachusetts, an RPS would require utilities to purchase mandated amounts of renewable power.
\
""I think it's time to move to an RPS,"" said Klein, who is chairman of the House Natural Resources and Energy Committee. Under such a policy, utilities would likely be looking for more renewable power to add to their portfolio, he said, and ""the quickest and easiest way to get it is through wind.""
\
The Department of Public Service will begin studying the economic and environmental effects of moving to a renewable portfolio standard by December. How the RPS affects utilities would depend on how it was structured - how much renewable power utilities would have to purchase and how these power supplies would count toward the mandate.
\
State power suppliers currently are encouraged to purchase 20 percent of their power from in-state renewables by 2017 under Vermont's SPEED program. The program was launched in 2005 to encourage the development of renewable power generation and will expire in 2017. About 18 percent of power used by utilities comes from projects that count toward the goal, according to DPS.
\
Critics say the program allows utilities to sell renewable energy certificates for power generated in-state. When utilities sell the certificates, the power they distribute to customers is not renewable but is instead market power that goes into a bucket that includes fossil fuels.
\
Proponents of the SPEED program say it encourages the buildout of renewable generation. And now, since the price point for renewable infrastructure is lower, utilities can consider building more renewable generation without needing to sell the RECs to subsidize the power costs.
\
At the federal level, some developers are waiting for the reauthorization of the production tax credit.
\
Harley Lee is founder and president of Endless Energy Corp., a Maine-based developer proposing a 3 megawatt Manchester Community Wind Farm on Little Equinox Mountain that is currently ""on hold.""
\
""When the Federal Production tax credit expires - as it has done something like nine times - the wind industry sees a precipitous drop in activity. This drop is often on the order of 90 percent. Personally, I'd like to see all energy subsidies removed, but, absent that, wind should be given a subsidy that helps level the playing field,"" he said.
\
The federal tax credit for wind expired in 2013, but the state Senate Finance Committee renewed the credit in Vermont. The credit is worth 2.3 cents per kilowatt hour for 10 years for wind projects built before 2015. It is designed to encourage investors to fund capital intensive generation projects.Is wind - big or small - right for Vermont?
\
Harnessing wind in Vermont is like ""growing bananas"" in the state, according to Mark Whitworth, executive director of Energize Vermont, a group opposing large-scale wind. It just does not make sense, he said.
\
Compared to other locations in the Northeast and the rest of the country, Vermont does not have as much wind to capture. The total capacity for wind in Vermont is about 3 gigawatts, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. In Texas, the capacity is as high as 1,901 gigawatts. In the Northeast, New York has the greatest capacity at 26 gigawatts.
\
Ben Luce is a Lyndon State College professor of physics and natural science who is critical of Vermont's renewable energy program.
\
He said even by developing all available locations for wind in the Northeast - ridgelines, hills and shorelines - wind could only provide less than 3 percent of peak demand, ja ""trivial amount"" of power for the region, in his view.
\
And because wind generates the most electricity in mild and cold temperature seasons in Vermont, Luce said wind power does not save electric customers money during the summer when electricity prices are the highest because expensive fossil fuels are burned to meet high demand for air conditioning units.
\
Others say wind is vital to achieving Vermont's renewable energy goals.
\
David Hallquist is CEO of Vermont Electric Cooperative, which is a winter-peaking utility. He said solar does not generate enough electricity in the winter months, which is when wind blows the strongest.
\
""In the winter peak, you've got to have wind,"" he said. And if the state wants meet its renewable energy goals, wind must be included, he said.
\
Wind opponents point to alternatives - like solar and energy efficiency - that would impact Vermont's environment less.
\
Billy Coster is a senior planner and policy analyst for the Agency of Natural Resources. The agency reviews the environmental impacts of energy projects.
\
""All large-scale development impacts the environment one way or another,"" he said. High elevation ridgelines often connect wildlife habitat in large continuous blocks of forests. Fragmenting this habitat (by erecting turbines) can disrupt migration patterns for wildlife, he said.
\
""Generally, when permits are issued, it's a permit to have an impact on the environment. That permit sets the amount of impact that project is allowed to have,"" he said.
\
And with many of the projects built in the past several years, he said more time is needed to truly understand what the impacts these project have on the environment.
\
There are also technical issues for advancing renewable energy development like wind. Before more wind comes to Vermont, the region must find a backup power source for when the wind is not blowing.
\
The region's grid operator, ISO New England, says if the Northeast builds more wind, it must also find more natural gas - on which the region is currently dependent - or other reliable sources of power.
\
Renewable energy advocates are undaunted.
\
As demand management becomes more advanced, grid operators and electricity consumers can time their energy consumption when it's needed and available. Consumers can use a smartphone to start a dishwasher when the sun is shining and the wind is blowing.
\
And renewable energy storage options are improving, said Gabrielle Stebbins, executive director of Renewable Energy Vermont. She cited electric cars as one example.
\
Finding the right fit
\
Wind opponents say they are not against renewable energy generation. Instead, they are opposed to the commercialized climate change solutions that cloud other viable alternatives.
\
There is one solution to climate change that all environmentalists agree on: using less energy.
\
The state's efficiency utility, Efficiency Vermont, has been recognized by the Obama administration as a model for cutting carbon emissions. The nonprofit group offers incentives to residents and businesses to install energy efficient home appliances and seal up their homes so they waste less heat.
\
But even so, the group has been lobbying in support of electric automobiles and heat pumps - both of which require more electricity. The state's thermal and transportation sectors are the leading source of Vermont's greenhouse gas emissions and proponents of the switch say moving away from gasoline and No. 2 heating oil would quickly reduce the state's carbon footprint.
\
Other solutions include putting solar panels on already disturbed areas - such as roofs and parking lots - or finding a way to store renewable energy.
\
But until the political, personal and economic winds shift, development of new wind projects in Vermont is likely to continue to crawl along.

"
281,"
The appetite for building wind projects in Vermont has tapered off in recent years.
\
A combination of factors - the end of federal stimulus money, uncertain reauthorization of federal incentives, difficulties in connecting to the grid, competition with solar and local opposition - have shelved at least two projects and left three others lying dormant.
\
But the industry might be poised to catch its second wind. Supporters and opponents agree that despite the recent timeout, wind power will likely remain a part of the region's renewable energy mix.
\
Wind opponents say Vermont's ridgelines - where all the state's utility-scale projects are located - are ecologically sensitive areas threatened by such development. Critics also cite the health and aesthetic impacts of windmills. And a few towns have taken positions against the building of commercial energy generation projects within their borders.
\
But Gov. Peter Shumlin has made it clear that his administration wants to fight climate change by harnessing all the available resources Vermont has to offer, including the wind. And public surveys indicate that, overall, Vermonters support building these projects in-state.
\
The public good of taking action on climate change, wind proponents say, outweighs the immediate costs to the environment, aesthetics and health.
\
Despite the apparent political will for these projects, the tension between local opposition and state support is sending a mixed message to developers considering projects in Vermont.
\
Steve Terry is a retired employee and consultant for Green Mountain Power, the state's dominant electric utility that developed Vermont's largest wind farm in Lowell.
\
He said to move future projects forward, developers must spend more time working with local communities.
\
""And if you can't accept that, you had better find another place to do business,"" Terry said. ""You just have to be ready to understand that that is one of the prices that you have to pay to do business in Vermont. You've got to be willing to explain to a lot of smart and sophisticated Vermonters why the project is in the general public good.""
\
Projects inch forward
\
Developers are still scouting sites, testing for wind potential, and securing permits to build Vermont's next wind farm.
\
Spanish wind giant Iberdrola Renewables is proposing two projects in southern Vermont. The company has received a certificate of public good for its 30 megawatt Deerfield Wind project located on ridge between Searsburg and Readsboro, where it is proposing 15 turbines measuring about 400 feet tall, twice the size of Green Mountain Power's existing Searsburg project.
\
The company defended its project in federal court in July after wind opponents appealed its special use permit to build in the Green Mountain National Forest. The court had not made a decision by the time this story was published.

(Jerry) Brown signed when he came into office in 2010 was the 33-percent RPS Bill (creating a Renewable Portfolio Standard, which increases the share of non-fossil-fuel energy use).\We're on track to get one third of our energy from renewable sources by 2020.\We now have among the largest wind and solar projects in the world. Tesla employs 5,000 people. We're just seeing very rapid growth in job creation in the clean-energy field in California.\BFP: How did your career in renewable energy begin?\DH: I got into solar energy originally in South Africa in 1997, working for President Nelson Mandela in one of the townships on the eastern cape.\One of the first things the South African government did when they came into power is that they provided mail service to townships that hadn't had it before.\They did it by having these solar powered, remote post offices. They weren't connected to electricity, but they could generate their own power. At night they were lit up and people would come and get their mail, and it became a little hub in the community.\That's when I first got the twinkle in my eye about solar.\BFP: And on a larger scale?\DH: I went back to San Francisco, where I'm from, and worked as a special assistant to Mayor Willie Brown. In 2001 we put an initiative on the ballot to install solar solar panels and energy efficiency improvements on public buildings throughout the city. It was a $100 million initiative.\BFP: Did the voters go for it?\DH: It passed. There are now solar panels on the convention center, on the airport, on city hall, at reservoirs, and so on. And a lot of energy efficiency measures, as well.\BFP: And you've worked in the private sector, too, right?\DH: I co-founded a group called Vote Solar, which worked in about 15 states on solar energy policiy -- essentially ""barrier-busting"" to remove unnecessary costs and obstacles to the growth of solar energy.\That includes policies such as net metering, rate design, interconnection standards, RPS and other policies.\Then I went into the private sector and worked in Silicon Valley for 5 years, working with Solaria, a solar company.\A year and a half ago I was appointed by Governor Brown to fill a seat (one of five) on the Energy Commission, where I'm the lead commissioner for renewable energy issues.\BFP: What are some of major obstacles facing California -- or any state -- in leading the country into a transition away from fossil fuels?\DH: Overall, federal policies that support the subsides received by the fossil fuel industry have been around for a long, long time.\We've been subsidizing oil for a century. We've been subsidizing nuclear power for 60 years.\Those subsidies are much more generous than those for renewables.\Furthermore, the subsidies for fossil fuels and nuclear power are permanent, in general -- and the subsidies for renewables are temporary.\So you have things like the Price-Anderson Act (enacted in 1957), which ensures that if you have a melt-down at a nuclear power plant, that the operator of that plant is not liable.\The liability rests with the taxpayers. That's a massive subsidy. And in fact, without that subsidy, you would not have a nuclear industry because the liability would be too great.\That subsidy does not expire; it exists in perpetuity.\BFP: And with oil?\DH: You have the federal oil-depletion allowance (a tax break tied to declining reserves).\The oil industry is the most profitable industry in the world. They actually don't need that depletion allowance to survive as an industry, but it's in place, and it saves them money -- and in consequence, it endures.\BFP: What kind of subsidies do renewables get?\DH: If you look at what we're doing right now in this country for solar at the federal level, we have a 30 percent tax credit. And it expires in 2016.\Similarly, our program here in California that encourage solar is a temporary program that will end in a few years.\There's not a level playing field I would say, in how the treatment of these different technologies has played out.\BFP: With that kind of disadvantage, how can the renewable power industry hope to grow?\DH: It makes cost-reduction for renewables even more important.\And the good news is, it's happening, both in wind and solar -- most notably in solar, where there's been a 98-percent reduction since 1980 in the cost of solar panels.\BFP: Here's a problem that blessedly hasn't affected Vermont in living memory: the lack of water. Given that a lot of Californians are enduring a drought -- is anyone there making connections between energy and water use?\DH: Broadly, I don't think the awareness of the connection between the two is there yet in the public mind.\But it is certainly it is the case: that when you save water, you also save energy -- because something like a fifth of all the energy we spend in California is spent transporting water -- it's a significant portion of energy use.\BFP: Voluntary restrictions on water use seem to be having only limited effect. What's the state doing to help?\DH: One of the the key things what the energy commission does is, we establish standards for both appliances and new buildings. They're quite strict, and include mandatory installation of water-using devices: shower heads, toilets, washing machines, dishwashers, etc.. We've been gradually ratcheting those standards up.\BFP: California and Vermont share a transportation-energy challenge. Is the electric car the answer?\DH: The threshold issue in a rural state like Vermont is range. How far can you drive? For the top-of-the-line Tesla, that's a 300-mile range, but that's also a $100,000 car.\BFP: I just drove one a couple of weeks ago ...\DH: It's a beautiful car. It's the iPhone of cars.\By the way, they're the single largest recipient of a grant from the California Energy Commission in the history of our agency. We gave them $10 million. They're scaling up. They're making on the order of 800 cars a week now.\The goal of the company, and it's a goal that I believe they will hit, is by 2016, a car that sells for $35,000 and goes 200 miles on a charge.\They're going to get there by scaling up.\And Tesla's proven they know how to do that. I'm actually quite bullish about the future of electric vehicles, because I believe in where we can get the cost and the range.\BFP: But what about congestion? Little ol' Burlington has a rush hour that drives people crazy. To out-of-towners it might seem like a mere inconvenience, but could it be symptomatic of a bigger issue: What happens to single-occupancy vehicles when they converge from the suburbs?\To what extent is California addressing sprawl as an energy issue?\DH: It's a significant priority for the state. There was a major bill passed by the state senate a few years ago that really kicked off a planning effort to make the design of our communities as environmentally sound as possible, including access to mass transit -- to get out ahead of this issue.\BFP: As with Vermont, California is stuck with a lot of infrastructure that is predicated on cheap gas and plenty of highways.\DH: This is a state that has L.A. -- and we know something about traffic. That's a big concern.\I grew up in the Bay Area, and traffic is worse than it's ever been. You can never have enough mass transit, as far as I'm concerned.\BFP: Changing gears: Wind energy has made some inroads here in Vermont. It has also encountered persistent opposition -- based on the way it looks, or how it disrupts ridge-line habitats. Some people have health concerns, based on light-flicker and low-frequency vibrations.\Have those issues slowed down California's wind-energy development?\DH: Some of the same issues have come here. But the truth is, there are impacts caused by any form of energy generation, and that includes solar.\In California, we've met some of the objections to wind through significant improvements in technology and in the planning processes.\We had the earliest large-scale wind project in the U.S., in the Altamont Pass, which is a very hilly, windy area east of the Bay Area. Unfortunately, that was in an area where there were a lot of avian raptors.\The early installation of those projects was flawed in a couple of areas.\One was the design of the towers. They had a lattice structure, which was actually a nesting and perching opportunity for birds. You kind of attracted birds to land on the lattice, and they'd get hit by the turbine blades.\Also, that iteration of the turbine design had much much higher speeds, so those blades were moving at 45-50 rpm (revolutions per minute).\The new turbines have a solid steel column, and turn more on the order of 12-14 rpm. And because the turbines are so much bigger, the developer needs fewer of them.\There's a success story of a re-towering project that was done here recently: They had 432 old-style turbines which they decommissioned and replaced them with 34 new turbines.\They cut avian mortality by 70 percent, and they increased electric generation by three times. That's the way technology is going.\So, there are some technological solutions, some siting solutions. But even the new turbines will kill some birds.\That said, the number of bird deaths from cars and buildings is in the hundreds of millions.\BFP: House cats figure in there somewhere, too, I hear.\DH: Just to keep it in perspective: Wind turbines represent a small fraction of bird deaths in the U.S.\BFP: But how about aesthetics? Or health? Are Californians pushing back on the way turbines look, or sound? Or are those phenomena unique to Vermont?\DH: I haven't heard much about low-frequency vibrations. But there are some concerns about aesthetic impacts.\I personally find wind turbines to be quite beautiful. I've always felt that way.\I drive by one every day at the Budweiser plant on my commute to work, and they have two really large wind turbines, and I think it's quite a beautiful landmark.\So -- I guess beauty is in the eye of the beholder. I understand that some people don't want to see any change at all to the landscape, and I understand that.\My view is -- talking about changes to the landscape -- climate change is going to radically affect every part of the environment.\And so to combat that and get ahead of it, we all have to make some accommodation to enable a transition to a clean-energy future. That's just a reality.\Within that picture, there's flexibility on how you do that.\BFP: What kind of discussions are you having about where to site turbines?\DH: We've been working on a plan to identify zones within the state that are best suited for large-scale renewables, and within those zones, to accelerate the permit process -- and outside those zones, to protect that landscape.\BFP: One more question: What do you suspect you might learn from your upcoming visit to Vermont?\DH: I already have learned from Vermont. I love the state. It's a pioneer.\BFP: How about in the field of renewable energy?\DH: The challenge Vermont has is just getting to scale -- because the size of the state.\When we create a policy here like net-metering, with 300,000 rooftop solar systems, you attract an industry that can scale up and bring down costs.\It's tougher to do that in a small state.\BFP: Where are our pioneers?\DH: I've been very impressed by the energy efficiency utility that Vermont has (Efficiency Vermont). It focuses just on doing that one thing very well.\It's a very credible model, and I look forward to learning more about it.\Contact Joel Banner Baird at 660-1843 or joelbaird@FreePressMedia.com.

283,"Vermonters for a Clean Environment was pleased with the net-metering legislation, which enables increased photovoltaic net metering.\However, on energy policy, the Legislature failed to address and revise the process for siting energy projects, including wind, solar, biomass, pipelines and transmission lines.\State agencies are short-staffed, and neighbors and towns are overwhelmed by the Public Service Board's overly legalistic process -- which could not be better designed to discourage input that might move us forward in building appropriately sited renewable energy, and treat Vermonters with respect as they are confronted with multibillion-dollar energy sprawl proposals.\Whose renewables?\The Legislature failed once again to fix the problem created by the sale of Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) to out-of-state by utilities.\The result: Vermont's mountains and fields are being used to produce renewable energy to meet the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) of Massachusetts, and not create real renewable energy for Vermonters. This flawed policy simultaneously allows RECs to be used to meet both Vermont's renewable energy goals and another state's RPS.\Connecticut has passed legislation disallowing Vermont's RECs to be used to meet that state's RPS, if those RECs are already being used to meet Vermont's Sustainably Priced Energy Development (SPEED) goals. The house of cards the Legislature put in place in 2005 to avoid creating an RPS seems to be falling apart.\Citing siting\Vermont's next Legislature would do well to focus on creating a more collaborative process for building real renewable energy and establishing siting standards that discourage the destruction of our high-elevation mountaintop environments and the degradation of water resources and prime agricultural soils.\Neighbors and towns dealing with pipelines and transmission lines also need assistance. A public advocate similar to New Hampshire's system (which designates an attorney from the Attorney General's Office to make legal filings on behalf of parties not represented by legal counsel) is one model the Vermont Legislature could adopt.\Land-use planning\The Growth Center bill was problematic in that it proposed to create a new process for the Natural Resources Board. We were pleased when that provision was dropped in favor of utilizing existing and effective District Commission procedures and staff to implement the growth center improvements.\On the other issues, VCE does not see much progress in improving water quality protections. In fact what we see instead is the Agency of Natural Resources issuing approvals for siting solar projects on Class II wetlands, and we see the Agency of Agriculture pulling out completely from providing input to the Public Service Board on solar projects proposed for prime agricultural soils.\In the recent legislative session we worked to help defeat a proposal to expand ANR's powers to degrade water resources without public involvement or oversight.\Close call\VCE partnered with town officials and the Vermont League of Cities and Towns to successfully press for revisions to the permitting process for cell towers in the coming years.\As the build-out of the state's cell and wireless coverage has continued, more and more communities have faced bullying developers who have used the expedited ""Section 248a"" permitting process to brush aside requests for alterations to their tower siting proposals.\Faced with strong testimony from town leaders, the House Commerce Committee agreed to make modest changes to the permitting process to allow towns to more easily participate in the permit review process.\The committee also gave the Department of Public Service a larger role in the process, and allowed them more leeway to hire experts at the developer's expense.\The committee, skeptical of the department's willingness to vigorously advocate for towns, requires the DPS to report back on their actions in this area. That will provide another forum for towns and citizens to press for further revisions, if needed.\Annette Smith is the executive director\of Danby-based nonprofit Vermonters\for a Clean Environment: www.VCE.org"
284,"IT'S MY TURN \John McConnell \Vermont renewable energy bill makes sense \There is a common-sense renewable energy bill in the Vermont House that needs the support of Vermonters inside and outside the Capital. \Just two weeks ago, in a resounding show of bipartisan support, this renewable energy bill, S.264, passed the Senate by a vote of 27-1. Now it is in the House Commerce Committee. \The goal of S.264 is to help meet the state's increased energy needs during the next decade using renewable energy resources and conservation. After being presented last year with President Bush's short-term ""solutions"" to our future energy needs, Vermonters can enjoy a breath of fresh and clean air knowing that our state is working on a common-sense solution. \Instead of a short-sighted, too-little too-late approach, this bill takes a positive, long-term view of what Vermonters need for energy over the next 10 years. Fossil fuels aren't the answer; big hydro contracts aren't the answer. Clean, sustainable, renewable energy created in Vermont is the answer. \S.264 offers a variety of strategies to meet Vermont's future energy needs. One strategy is called a Renewable Portfolio Standard, or RPS. Used in a dozen other states, this empowers the Public Service Board to require utilities to buy a certain amount of electricity from renewable energy sources. \This could either be sources they build themselves or from other entities. The impact the RPS will have on Vermont utility bills will be insignificant. In the long-term, though, national studies show that by using an RPS, states will likely see reductions in their utility bills along with more predictable energy prices. \Another strategy of S.264 is group net metering. This is a big hit with farmers. It allows individuals to ""group"" their electricity consumption together onto one power meter, and then use renewable energy to supply that group with power. Farmers are enthusiastic about this aspect of S.264 because it allows them to group all the buildings on their farm onto one meter, and then process methane from manure to use as a renewable energy source for all the power for their whole farm. This makes sense: Allow farms to use what they have a lot of, manure, to create something they need, energy. Farmers would have the possibility of becoming energy independent while saving a barn-full of cash. \Other aspects of the bill include using $$@$!750,000 from the Petroleum Overcharge Fund to help support renewable energy projects within the state. This is a good investment. It will support a blossoming renewable energy business community, give Vermonters incentives to buy their own renewable energy products, and create jobs in the process. S.264 also establishes ""renewable energy pricing,"" allowing individuals to choose to pay a premium to their electricity suppliers so that part or all of their electricity use would come from renewable sources. \S.264 takes a common sense, long-term approach to solving problems that, if not dealt with immediately, will have far-reaching, toxic and expensive consequences. Global warming, fluctuating energy prices and security risks related to reliance on toxic energy sources are all issues we must resolve for the sake of our environment and for the sake of our economy. We cannot drill our way to energy independence and energy security. S.264 charts reasonable steps we can take right now. \S.264 proposes investing in clean, renewable energy today, for tomorrow's energy needs. This bill will create increased in-state renewable energy sources, stabilized energy costs, and generate high paying jobs building and maintaining these facilities. Vermonters want an energy policy that will keep our air clean, keep our dollars in state and fulfill our responsibility to reduce our global warming impact. S.264 will do all of these things. The Vermont House must enact this common-sense, long-term strategy for our state's energy security. \John McConnell is a Web designer and an activist on climate change issues.

285,"As the 2015 legislative session begins, the Burlington Free Press is publishing position statements from political leaders and advocates reflecting their goals and expectations.\Each was asked to answer:\What do you expect to be the biggest issue overall, or the biggest issue related to your topic area, during the upcoming session, and how will you approach it?\What other bills or issues can voters expect to see debated this winter?\Upcoming topics address the state's challenges with health care, transportation, natural resources and criminal justice/judiciary.\Today's topic is taxes.\Tom Torti: End endless debate\Today, the governor and the Vermont legislature will begin the work of the new biennial session. Like so many other years, education, state spending, taxes, health care, the environment and work force issues will take center stage.\Overwhelming feedback received by the Lake Champlain Chamber is that the endless annual debate, without action on these key issues, will continue to damage Vermont's fragile economic climate. These issues have been studied and debated long enough. It is time for leadership and action.\The education issue is not ""how"" we pay for schools. Simply put, we spend far too much for the number of students we educate. Administrative overhead and per-pupil ratios are out of synch with student populations. We must adjust the ""spend"" to come in line with best practice standards.\State spending has eclipsed the ability of Vermonters to pay for the host of current state programs. Funding must be allocated to programs that serve our most critical needs and that produce measurable results.\Vermont cannot tax its way out of the problem. Our current tax rates already act as an impediment to an expanding economy. Since the ""single payer"" debate has been sidelined, our health care focus can now be on quality improvement and cost control. Funding the Medicaid cost shift, investing in the Blue Print for Health, transitioning to an outcome based payment model and investing in a uniform records, billing and scheduling system are investments worth making.\On the environmental front, there is near universal agreement that our impaired waterways need help. Current rhetoric that labels segments of Vermonters as the ""problem"" and solutions that look for taxpayers to dig even deeper to bear the burden of clean water are themselves impaired. If policy makers believe that clean water is a priority, the state should find within its $1.5 billion dollar general fund budget the $15 million annually required to fund the clean up process.\Finally, our workforce is aging and many of those remaining need skills training in critical areas. Local education, job training, and technical center programs must be funded and directed to focus on advanced manufacturing and skills for science, technology, engineering and math. Without a commitment to workforce retention and training, Vermont will be unable to compete for jobs and talent in the 21st century.\None of this is a simple as this letter makes it sound, but it isn't that complex either. These are pragmatic decisions that need to be made within a political context. However, leadership requires moving from inertia towards action. Vermont needs our leaders to act this session.\Tom Torti, president and CEO of the Lake Champlain Regional Chamber of Commerce, resides in Essex.\Jane Kitchel: Not a battleground\Vermont's education funding system is complex, difficult to explain and understand. While it does provide equity, I believe experience has shown that it does not adequately address the growing costs of Vermont's K-12 system.\Presently, school budgets and spending are determined locally by the voters of each town or school district. The Legislature then sets a statewide property tax rate at the level necessary to raise the revenues needed to support the aggregate level of spending approved by all local votes.\In my opinion there is not a sufficient connection between spending decisions made locally and the statewide property tax rate that will ultimately be required. For example, under the existing system an individual town or district could vote a school budget that is level-funded or even decreases and yet the property owners in that town could still experience a property tax increase because of higher spending decisions made by other towns and/or possible changes to the town's Common Level of Appraisal (CLA) or the value of the statewide grand list or student characteristics. This is very difficult to explain and means that those voters experience no direct benefit from making difficult budgetary decisions.\For fiscal year 2015, Vermont's K-12 system will cost approximately $1.5 billion. Although property taxes are the largest revenue component of the Education Fund, many Vermonters are not aware that about 25 percent of all the state's nontransportation revenues also go into the fund. Specifically, 35 percent of all sales tax revenues, 33 percent of the purchase and use tax revenues on vehicles, all Lottery profits and a General Fund transfer of $296 million are dedicated to the Education Fund.\In addition, the state budget separately funds about $80 million for teachers' retirement and retired teachers' health care. To avoid future property tax increases would require one, or a combination, of the following actions -- reduce the growth in school spending, reduce the funds currently being used to support the functions of state government and transfer more revenues to the Education Fund, or increase other taxes. Since nearly 70 percent of all Vermont homeowners currently pay property taxes based on income, I would suspect most Vermonters would not want to simply replace higher property taxes with higher income taxes or other taxes.\As a legislator, I am committed to working in partnership with the secretary of the Agency of Education, educators and local school boards to identify the cost drivers within the system and to connect better spending decisions with tax impacts. We must develop policies and legislation that will effectively address the growing cost of Vermont's public education system. We cannot let our schools become a battleground, and we all should have a mutual goal of achieving a fiscally sustainable system.\Sen. Jane Kitchel is a Democrat who resides in Danville.\John McClaughry: Choice wins\Gov. Peter Shumlin's abandonment of his single-payer health plan -- at least for now -- affords Vermonters a reprieve from truly enormous increases in payroll and income taxes. However, tax issues will continue to be prominent in 2015.\The major pressure is to diminish the burden of the homestead school property tax. There are four options.\First, increase the General Fund transfer to the Education Fund and reduce the property tax rate. But with what? The General Fund already faces a $100 million deficit.\Second is the Democrats' intention to add an income tax surcharge to replace part of the homestead tax revenues. That will spur fierce resistance not only from upper income taxpayers, but from those who view with alarm the effect of high income tax rates on the state's economy. (Governors Dean, Douglas and Shumlin all shared this concern.)\Third is reorganizing the public school system and mandating ""savings."" Getting real ""savings"" would require a state takeover of public schools and enforcement of spending caps and mandates -- something like Lt. Gov. Phil Scott's Green Mountain Care Board for education. Even Democrats and Progs are leery of the politics of ""One Big School System.""\Fourth is the really innovative solution. Let public schools, charter schools, independent schools, and other providers compete for the parents' tuition dollars. (Example: the vibrant charter school competition in Houston, San Jose and Washington, D.C.) A lot of parents will choose alternatives that cost far less than overgrown and complacent monopoly public schools.\An environmentalist coalition is pushing hard for a carbon tax, to make Vermonters reduce spending on gasoline, diesel fuel, propane, natural gas and heating oil. This, they say, will make Vermont a leader in the battle against ""climate change."" As proposed, it will also allow the renewable industrial complex to skim off ten percent of the take to subsidize their interests. This is likely to be a nonstarter.\But there's a related measure that would subsidize renewable electricity in a way that won't be obvious to ratepayers: the Renewable Portfolio Standard. The RPS will require Vermont utilities to get specified percentages of their power from renewables like wind and solar. Since those two energy sources are as much as four times as costly as grid power, ratepayers will be hit with another tax, hidden in their utility bills.\My recommendation for the legislature: parental choice in education, and no tax increases, visible or hidden.\Former Senator John McClaughry is vice president of the Ethan Allen Institute. He resides in Kirby Mountain.\Patti Komline: Affordability\Vermont is in the midst of an affordability crisis. You know it. I know it. Unfortunately, Gov. Peter Shumlin's administration either hasn't realized the seriousness of the problem or lacks the skills and fortitude to truly address this challenge. It was reassuring to see the public register their frustration on Election Day. And, it would appear that the powers-that-be are paying attention, at least for a while.\Gov. Shumlin recently announced, what so many people knew to be inevitable, his health care plan is unworkable. The speaker of the House has stated that, finally, education and property tax reform will be a priority. Two big announcements signifying that change might be in the air. It is my hope that this change is approached on a macro, not micro level.\We need big picture solutions to our challenges. One only needs to look at our own budgets to know where the crux of problem lies. Expenses, especially in the unsustainable growth in property taxes and health care costs, are outpacing incomes. This is the very problem the state is facing, a budget deficit of $100 million due to the declining income tax revenue that can't keep up with budget increases.\Lt. Gov. Phil Scott has pledged to make affordability his priority. If legislators all get behind his efforts, working together with a laser-like focus on improving our economy, supporting businesses that provide career growth jobs and creating an environment that will encourage entrepreneurs to move to Vermont, we will begin to reverse this downward trend. We have been heading in the wrong direction for too long.\Providing better paying opportunities for more Vermonters addresses so many of the challenges that are dragging us down. A prosperous economy results in greater income tax revenue to the state to fund programs for the less fortunate and more money for our infrastructure needs. It results in less crime, less drug abuse and a healthier public. It would even bring in needed revenue to fund the cleanup of Lake Champlain, which will be another state priority this year.\It is my intention to work with the lieutenant governor and many other key legislators to make sure that the major issues that we tackle are those that will turn around our economy, enriching the lives of all Vermonters.\Rep.

MONTPELIER -- One of the nation's top renewable power suppliers said it will no longer trade Vermont's renewable energy credits, which are also counted toward the state's clean electricity goals.
\
NextEra Energy announced last week that it will no longer take double-counted power in a letter to New England renewable energy credit brokers. The $15 billion North American company purchases and sells renewable energy credits (RECs).
\
""It is a fundamental principle of all renewable energy market sales that the environmental characteristics associated with the electric energy generated cannot be counted or claimed twice,"" NextEra Energy officials wrote.
\
Renewable power producers can sell RECs to other companies to meet state renewable energy standards. Vermont utilities often sell credits for renewable power generated in the state to out-of-state power suppliers. Under Vermont's clean energy development incentive program, this renewable power also counts toward the state's clean energy target.
\
On Jan. 1, Connecticut banned the purchase of Vermont credits that are also used to meet the state's renewable energy target. As a result, NextEra, which provides electricity in Connecticut, will no longer trade Vermont RECs in Connecticut.
\
Critics of Vermont's program say the state is claiming renewable energy credits that are sold to other states.
\
""The Connecticut Legislature did this because they knew that Vermont was trying to create the perception of being green without paying the full price of being green,"" said Kevin Jones, deputy director of the Institute for Energy and the Environment at Vermont Law School.
\
He said Vermont is selling its renewable energy to other states while importing fossil fuel-generated electricity. By claiming those credits to meet Vermont's renewable energy targets, Jones said, companies could be liable to pay penalties for purchasing fraudulent credits.
\
Darren Springer, deputy commissioner of the Vermont Department of Public Service, said NextEra's announcement will not slow renewable energy development in the state.
\
""There's going to be a value to the renewable energy credit regardless,"" Springer said. ""It doesn't necessarily signal a broader market issue at this point.""
\
RECs currently sell on the market for about 6 cents per kilowatt-hour. Springer said the sale of RECs reduces rates by about 5 percent.
\
The state's largest utility, Green Mountain Power, has sold $22 million in RECs to date, a company spokesperson said. The state also counts this renewable power generation toward the statewide renewable energy targets.
\
""This basically seems like blatant fraud to me,"" said Ben Luce, a Lyndon State College professor who last year unsuccessfully lobbied lawmakers to revise the program.
\
""The net effect of this is it gives Vermonters a false impression of how much renewable power costs,"" he said.
\
Luce is an outspoken opponent of Green Mountain Power's Lowell Mountain wind project. Lowell voters have voted twice to support it, but he said residents may be hesitant to back a project that produces renewable power legally credited to other states.
\
He said the statement from NextEra, a key industry player, could force Vermont to reconsider its renewable energy incentive program.
\
""It could finally expose this whole thing,"" he said. ""It could bring about pressure to have a renewable energy standard.""
\
The state operates under what is called the SPEED program, which is designed to move the state toward generating 20 percent of its power from renewable energy by 2017 by providing developers incentives for their projects.
\
Vermont is the only state in the nation that sells RECs and counts the power towards its renewable energy target, Jones said.
\
The Department of Public Service will report back to lawmakers next year on the environmental and economic benefits of adopting a renewable energy portfolio standard. Unlike Vermont's current voluntary program, an RPS would require Vermont to sell or keep renewable energy credits.

Under Vermont's clean energy development incentive program, this renewable power also counts toward the state's clean energy target.
\
On Jan. 1, Connecticut banned the purchase of Vermont credits that are also used to meet the state's renewable energy target. As a result, NextEra, which provides electricity in Connecticut, will no longer trade Vermont RECs in Connecticut.
\
Critics of Vermont's program say the state is claiming renewable energy credits that are sold to other states.
\
""The Connecticut Legislature did this because they knew that Vermont was trying to create the perception of being green without paying the full price of being green,"" said Kevin Jones, deputy director of the Institute for Energy and the Environment at Vermont Law School.
\
He said Vermont is selling its renewable energy to other states while importing fossil fuel-generated electricity. By claiming those credits to meet Vermont's renewable energy targets, Jones said, companies could be liable to pay penalties for purchasing fraudulent credits.
\
Darren Springer, deputy commissioner of the Vermont Department of Public Service, said NextEra's announcement will not slow renewable energy development in the state.
\
""There's going to be a value to the renewable energy credit regardless,"" Springer said. ""It doesn't necessarily signal a broader market issue at this point.""
\
RECs currently sell on the market for about 6 cents per kilowatt-hour. Springer said the sale of RECs reduces rates by about 5 percent.
\
The state's largest utility, Green Mountain Power, has sold $22 million in RECs to date, a company spokesperson said. The state also counts this renewable power generation toward the statewide renewable energy targets.
\
""This basically seems like blatant fraud to me,"" said Ben Luce, a Lyndon State College professor who last year unsuccessfully lobbied lawmakers to revise the program.
\
""The net effect of this is it gives Vermonters a false impression of how much renewable power costs,"" he said.
\
Luce is an outspoken opponent of Green Mountain Power's Lowell Mountain wind project. Lowell voters have voted twice to support it, but he said residents may be hesitant to back a project that produces renewable power legally credited to other states.
\
He said the statement from NextEra, a key industry player, could force Vermont to reconsider its renewable energy incentive program.
\
""It could finally expose this whole thing,"" he said. ""It could bring about pressure to have a renewable energy standard.""
\
The state operates under what is called the SPEED program, which is designed to move the state toward generating 20 percent of its power from renewable energy by 2017 by providing developers incentives for their projects.
\
Vermont is the only state in the nation that sells RECs and counts the power towards its renewable energy target, Jones said.
\
The Department of Public Service will report back to lawmakers next year on the environmental and economic benefits of adopting a renewable energy portfolio standard. Unlike Vermont's current voluntary program, an RPS would require Vermont to sell or keep renewable energy credits.

HARTFORD, CONN. Connecticut regulators ruled Wednesday that credits purchased from renewable electricity generated in Vermont can count toward that state's energy goals.
\
The decision means Vermont utilities can continue to sell their renewable energy credits in the regional marketplace, which brings in about $50 million a year that utilities use to lower electric rates here. The state worried that if Connecticut decided to exclude Vermont RECs, rates in the Green Mountain State would rise by 6 percent or more as soon as next year.
\
In a long-awaited draft ruling, the Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority found Vermont's renewable energy credits are acceptable despite some claims that Vermont RECs are ""double counted."" The credits represent the environmental attributes of electricity generated from renewables such as wind and solar and are purchased by utilities to meet renewable energy portfolio goals.
\
Critics of Vermont's SPEED program argue that Vermont utilities have been counting the same credits toward Vermont's renewable energy goal that are also sold to out-of-state utilities.
\
But Connecticut regulators said Vermont law does not establish a tangible renewable energy goal until 2017. As a result, Vermont utilities before that would not be applying the credits toward any real goal. The Shumlin administration has made that very point in defending the program.
\
""There simply is no direct annual goal between 2012 and 2017 toward which megawatt hours are claimed or counted,"" the ruling states. ""While there does appear to be an overarching 'glide path' goal over that timeframe to increase the percentage of renewable SPEED resources used, no megawatt hours are presently counted toward any identifiable goal today.""
\
That could change in 2017 when, under the SPEED program, Vermont utilities are asked to source 20 percent of their electricity from renewable energy generation projects built in Vermont. Regulators said if that occurs, the RECs from Vermont would be legally questionable.
\
The ruling comes one day after the Vermont House passed a new renewable energy policy to address the perception of double-counting. The bill, H.40, replaces Vermont's SPEED program with the so-called RESET program that would take effect in 2017.
\
""Proposed legislation in Vermont, if enacted, would provide more certainty today that SPEED 2017 goals would be administered in a way that is entirely compatible with other state RPS programs,"" the ruling says.
\
H.40 was introduced to the House Natural Resources and Energy Committee in January. The Department of Public Service said one of the reasons for pursuing the legislation was because utilities were having difficulty selling renewable energy credits in New England. These sales represent a $50 million source of revenue for utilities; without it, there would be a 6 percent statewide rate increase, DPS has said.
\
Darren Springer, deputy commissioner of the Vermont Department of Public Service, said H.40 is still necessary. He said regulators made clear that by 2017, the ""SPEED program may trigger a claim"" resulting in the loss of REC sales for Vermont utilities.
\
""We don't want to leave that type of uncertainty on the table for ratepayers,"" Springer said. ""We want to do something with H.40 that heads off any concerns in 2017.""
\
He said passing the bill now will give utilities time to adjust to the new regulations. Under RESET, utilities will have to purchase or retire RECs to meet meet state mandates. By 2017, 55 percent of a utility's electricity portfolio must come from renewables, and up to 75 percent by 2032.
\
Critics of Vermont's SPEED program say the ruling confirms the state has no current renewable energy goal. For years, the voluntary program has come under fire from critics who say it doesn't reduce Vermont's carbon footprint. The SPEED program was designed to reduce the upfront cost of renewable power generation by allowing utilities to sell RECs for projects built in Vermont.
\
""What is our goal? I am completely confused now,"" said Annette Smith, executive director of Vermonters for a Clean Environment, who was a party on the Connecticut docket calling for an investigation into Vermont's practices. ""We built a lot of renewable energy to serve Connecticut and Massachusetts.""
\
The three-panel regulatory body, which is part of Connecticut's Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, sent a letter last December to Gov. Dannel P. Malloy's office seeking to reinstate their independence, according to a news report.
\
Smith said the department's oversight creates a conflict of interest with the Malloy administration's policy agenda.
\
""It reeks of political interference. That's my gut reaction to it,"" she said of the decision.
\
The news was welcomed by Vermont's largest utility. Green Mountain Power sells renewable energy credits for nearly all of its wind and solar generated in Vermont, bringing in about $30 million per year.
\
""I think, overall, we view the ruling as good news for customers because it preserved the state's ability to keep rates low,"" said Kristin Carlson, a spokeswoman for Green Mountain Power, which was also a party to the case.
\
The company says it did not have any trouble selling RECs in recent months. Other utilities, such as Burlington Electric Department, Washington Electric Coop, and the Vermont Electric Coop had difficulty or stopped selling RECs to Connecticut while the decision was pending.
\
The parties have until March 18 to file a request for oral arguments. Regulators expect to issue a final decision by March 25.
