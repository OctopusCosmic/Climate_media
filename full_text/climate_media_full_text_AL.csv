MONTGOMERY -- Alabama's entire U.S. House delegation voted against President Barack Obama's new energy bill, including the three Democrats who are members of the president's political party.The energy bill that narrowly passed the U.S. House of Representatives, 219-212, on Friday goes to the U.S. Senate where energy and energy cap and trade tax legislation probably will be considered separately.Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., said he opposes at least the part he considers a federal energy tax. ""It is my hope that as the Senate considers energy legislation, we will seek broad consensus on reforms that increase the production of cost-effective clean energy, rather than the scope of government or the tax burden on consumers,"" Shelby said Monday.A year ago Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., was critical of a similar bill introduced to ease global warming by curbing emissions but which he defined as a tax.In May, the Alabama congressional delegation wrote the House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman, Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., expressing concern about the ""negative impact"" of the bill. On Friday, Alabama's four Republican and three Democrat House members voted against the bill they said would harm Alabama consumers and businesses.Voting no were Reps. Robert Aderholt, R-Haleyville, Spencer Bachus, R-Vestavia Hills, Jo Bonner, R-Mobile, Bobby Bright, D-Montgomery, Artur Davis, D-Birmingham, Parker Griffith, D-Huntsville, and Mike Rogers, R-Saks.University of Alabama political science professor David Lanoue said he wasn't surprised by the vote. He said Alabama's members of Congress believe the state has a different constituent mood than in other areas of the nation.""Certainly Bright and Griffith represent conservative districts and they'll want to distance themselves from Obama's administration,"" Lanoue said. ""With Artur Davis there's the specter of the governor's race and he also has been looking for opportunities to distance himself from the Obama administration.""Davis, a gubernatorial candidate, said he supports investing in renewable and alternative energy, endorses reducing carbon emissions and securing energy independence. ""While there have been serious and genuine efforts that have made this bill better, the fact remains that in Alabama, the bill will almost certainly cost us jobs and raise our utility rates,"" he said in a statement.Bachus said higher costs could make business less competitive and would send jobs overseas. ""One study has projected that the typical family in Alabama could eventually see electricity bills rise by more than $1,500 a year,"" Bachus said.Aderholt, who represents the district between the Tennessee Valley and the Birmingham area, explained why he voted no. At first glance, this legislation sounds like a good idea, but the fact of the matter is the legislation is a hidden national energy tax that will harm our economy and set unrealistic government mandates,"" Aderholt said.Bonner said the plan would cause electricity rates and gas prices to ""skyrocket,"" adding, ""For the sake of our environment and our nations economy, we need a comprehensive energy plan, not a national energy tax.""Bright is a freshman in Congress. ""This bill will raise energy costs for consumers, small businesses and farmers with no guarantee that it will achieve its goal of reducing the impact of global climate change,"" he said.Griffith, also a freshman, said the bill wasn't in the best interest of north Alabama that is almost exclusively supplied by the Tennessee Valley Authority utility. ""This legislation would cripple Alabama utilities with high and swift taxes, forcing them to choose between going out of business or passing the cost onto Tennessee Valley consumers,"" he said.Rogers said Alabamians already are struggling with higher gasoline costs. ""It has the chance to further harm our economy by increasing the cost of energy, hurting Americas competitiveness and sending good paying manufacturing jobs overseas,"" he said.Adam Snyder, executive director of Conservation Alabama, reacted to the delegation's vote.""When the Alabama delegation voted against the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009, they sent a clear message that Alabama is closed for business when it comes to clean energy jobs,"" Snyder said. ""Conservation Alabama believes that this bill is a jobs bill that will put Alabamians back to work, improve our national security by decreasing our dependence on foreign energy and ultimately reduce environmentally damaging carbon emissions.""

Dear Editor: Many liberals and environmentalists have bought into manmade global warming and support cap-and-trade legislation, while too many conservatives oppose all efforts to preserve the environment.
\
Make no mistake: We, as conservatives, must counteract those who seize on environmental problems solely to increase the role of government in our lives. But common sense should tell us that the Earth, as our only home, must be protected. There is a great need for a common sense conservatism to counter balance the liberalism that, because of conservative neglect, has become too dominant in environmental matters.
\
In reality, there is no conflict between conservatism and genuine environmentalism. I believe we would be much happier if we could reconnect with nature. We can do this by, among other things, growing our own gardens (even tiny ones); becoming more aware of the beauty and uniqueness of each season; creating nature friendly backyard retreats; visiting our rivers and forests; experiencing the serenity of sunrises and sunsets.
\
The American Indians had a joyful affinity with the Earth. It was not without reason that they considered much in nature holy.

Dear Editor: Since it was established in 1988, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has involved hundreds of scientists worldwide in preparing four major assessments and other reports that provide judgments on the climate of planet earth. These reports have raised serious questions about 'business as usual' in the burning of fossil fuels.
\
From ice cores, we know the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is the highest it has been in hundreds of thousands of years. More carbon dioxide makes oceans acidic, leading to a disruption of the food chain and the destruction of coral. With few exceptions, land (Antarctica, Greenland, Tibetan Plateau) and sea (Arctic Ocean) ice are shrinking worldwide. Globally, the temperature and the ocean level are rising.
\
Replacing fossil fuels would: reduce levels of mercury in the fish we eat; reduce concentrations of oxides of sulfur and nitrogen, small airborne particles and arsenic in the air we breathe; avoid spending treasure and spilling blood in protecting global oil supplies; and avoid huge transfers of wealth to foreign sources of oil.
\
Regarding the 'cap and trade' program proposed for lowering carbon dioxide emissions, knowledgeable economists report that such programs were successful in removing tetraethyl lead from our gasoline and in reducing acidification of our lakes and rivers. The European Union is now successfully using cap and trade to reduce their carbon dioxide emissions.
\
We urgently need the new jobs, cleaner environment, economic opportunities, international stability and moral leadership that alternative energy will provide. We must get on with it.

Last month, a U.S. House science committee hearing on President Barack Obama's proposed greenhouse gas rules was interrupted when the lights in the room went out.
\
The irony was lost on no one.
\
If the Environmental Protection Agency's regulations limiting carbon dioxide emissions are implemented, the result could be a slow-motion power failure for the United States. The EPA's rules will make it harder to produce energy and more expensive to buy it. This will mean fewer jobs for our workers and higher prices for their families.
\
My organization, Manufacture Alabama, represents hundreds of companies of all sizes and types. They create the technology, infrastructure and products that power our economy and, yes, protect the environment.
\
We already start at a disadvantage. High corporate tax rates and burdensome federal regulations make it significantly more expensive to manufacture in the U.S. than overseas.
\
But we enjoy a competitive edge in one area -- energy. It's abundant, cheap and reliable. This is especially true in states like Alabama, which rely on plentiful coal and inexpensive natural gas.
\
The EPA plan calls for a 30 percent cut in greenhouse gases by 2030. It would artificially and arbitrarily cap carbon dioxide emissions in Alabama and every other state, even during peak summer and winter months.
\
According to the National Mining Association, ""Over 20 percent of the country's coal-powered electricity (would be) removed from the energy grid by 2020, if not sooner.""
\
Recently, Alabama Power announced it would retire two coal-fired units and convert other units to natural gas. Jobs will be lost. So will power. These facilities were needed last winter to meet peak usage demands.
\
Americans insist on reliable energy. Coal currently meets about 40 percent of our energy needs. It doesn't take a scientist to do the math.
\
There are other unintended consequences. The chemical industry is a major user of natural gas. Their products are the building blocks of nearly all manufacturing. When gas is diverted to replace coal, everything from toothpaste to automobiles will be affected.
\
Nationwide, the EPA regulations could cost 224,000 jobs annually and reduce GDP by more than $50 billion a year, according to a U.S. Chamber of Commerce study.
\
""Regions of the country such as the South and Alabama will be more dramatically and adversely impacted,"" wrote Gov. Robert Bentley in a letter to the EPA.
\
We're already seeing the effects. The National Association of Manufacturers has found a drastic reduction in construction permits caused in part by uncertainty related to the new rules. The group also predicts a cutoff of research and development investment in, of all things, environmental technology.
\
In the cruelest irony of all, by ceding energy production to high-polluting nations, we make it harder -- not easier -- to protect Planet Earth.
\
Climate change is a global challenge that calls for a global solution. China alone accounts for about one-fourth of the world's CO2 emissions. A single coal plant in Taiwan emits more carbon dioxide than the country of Switzerland. Russia is in talks to build an even larger one.
\
Obama told the United Nations last month that ""there does not have to be a conflict between a sound environment and strong economic growth."" He's right. America has proven it by reducing carbon emissions to their lowest levels in 20 years -- without the new EPA regulations.
\
But wouldn't these regulations help us do even better? Not exactly. The EPA plan will ""not impact the climate in any meaningful way,"" testified Charles McConnell, Obama's assistant secretary of energy from 2011 to 2013. And yet, he said, Americans on average will pay double for power, and in the top electricity-producing states like Alabama, ""three times or four times more.""
\
Faced with growing public opposition, the EPA has extended the comment period to Dec. 1. We urge the agency to use the time wisely by ending its micromanagement of energy and industry. We ask that it ""recognize the limits of federal authority,"" as suggested by Gov. Bentley and 14 other governors. We ask that it finally conduct a real world cost-benefit and economic sustainability analysis. And we ask that the EPA not attempt to achieve through regulation what it could not by legislation -- namely, an unpopular ""cap-and-trade"" bill.
\
At the U.N., Obama pledged to ""answer the call"" on climate change. He's also promised an ""all-of-the-above"" energy strategy. The EPA's plan achieves neither. And all Americans, manufacturers and consumers alike will likely pay the price.

4,"If the Alabama Senate race is any indication, the climate change debate in the state hasn't budged in 10 years - or has simply sorted into a more partisan frame.\Republicans, some but not all of whom say there is a human role in rising temperatures, generally shy away from the question or actively oppose any government efforts to address the issue, arguing it could affect the state's energy sector and economic development efforts.\""I don't think we need any regulations,"" said Sen. Trip Pittman, R-Montrose, one of the contenders for the Republican nomination. ""Let's get the economy improving, and get the budget balanced before we start passing regulations.""\On the other side, Democrats say the state needs to address rising temperatures in the state; the long-term forecasts could not only mean hotter days but major threats to the state's economy, especially Alabama agriculture and coastal tourism.\""At the end of the day, we only have one planet, and we've got to do what we can to save that planet,"" said Doug Jones, seeking the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate. ""I would support reasonable restrictions on emissions.""\If the debate seems static, the issue isn't. Alabama already faces climate change impacts in precipitation shifts and more severe droughts. At the same time, the state's carbon emissions have started to drop, though they still remain 12 percent above their 1990 totals, according to the Energy Information Agency with the U.S. Department of Energy.\Change begun\But without further emission cuts or technological breakthroughs, the South could get hit hard by climate change. According to a study published in Science in June, rising temperatures could reduce gross domestic product in Alabama counties by five to 15 percent by the end of the century. Warmer temperatures could also increase mortality rates in the South relative to the rest of the country.\Effects in Alabama are beginning. Average annual precipitation in Alabama is five to 10 percent higher than it was in the first half of the 20th century.\""Unlike most of the nation, Alabama has not become warmer during the last 50 years,"" the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency wrote in a paper last August. ""But soils have become drier, annual rainfall has increased in most of the state, more rain arrives in heavy downpours, and sea level is rising about one inch every eight years.""\Heat should rise in in the state. Average summer temperatures, according to the Climate Impact Lab, could rise four degrees in Alabama by 2050. That would likely drive the number of average days over 95 degrees from an average of 12 a year to 50. Rising temperatures could drive more water out of the soil, leading to sharper and more prolonged droughts.\That could play havoc with the state's agricultural sector. Warmer temperatures could shift crops northward: Peach growing could move out of Chilton County, and north Alabama's apple industry could go out of the state entirely. Yields of some crops, like corn and soy beans, could decline. Hotter days could also lead to greater livestock stress.\Warmer winters might also mean pests normally killed by cold weather working longer on crops and trees, hurting the state's lumber industry. Ocean acidification could also hurt the state's shellfish area, and rising waters could affect the coastal areas of Alabama, whose tourism industry benefits the whole state.\Jones said those long-term changes need to be considered.\""People are looking at this in the short-term fashion, of 'how much is this going to cost me immediately,'"" he said.\Some progress has occurred, in part due to coal's long-term decline. According to the Energy Information Agency, Alabama put 147.4 million tons of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere in 2007, the highest rate since 1980. Coal-burning made up for more than half the emissions that year. The state's emissions fell to 123.2 million tons in 2014, the last year statistics were available. Coal accounted for roughly a third of those numbers.\Still, Alabama remains a significant carbon emitter. The state ranked 23rd among the 50 states and the District of Columbia in population in 2014 but was 15th in carbon emissions, ahead of more populated states like New Jersey, Virginia and Tennessee.\While both parties put forward carbon-cutting proposals in 2008 presidential election, the issue became politicized over the past ten years, and neither President Donald Trump nor Congress are considering significant climate change legislation. Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris Climate Accord earlier this year. In Alabama, attempts to address climate change have often run into resistance from business and utility interests, who argue coal helps keep electric rates down.\""What has happened is the national environment has aligned with the already existing Alabama environment,"" said Stephen Stetson, senior representative for the Sierra Club's Beyond Coal Campaign in Alabama. ""A little silver lining is in talking to folks around the state, there is a consensus that the weather isn't what it used to be.""\Partisan climates\As in the national debate, party affiliation sorts Alabama's candidates on the issue. Democrats, including Jones and Michael Hansen, executive director of the Birmingham-based environmental group GASP, say climate change is real and advocate action to address it. Hansen said Congress can take steps ranging from cap-and-trade to encouraging renewable energy to providing funds to promote energy efficiency.\""It's an absurd thing to pit clean air and a healthy environment against jobs,"" he said. ""You look at where job creation has been, it's been in clean energy and health care. The idea that clean energy doesn't create jobs is a lie.""\Opinions about climate change on the Republican side are far more diverse, with at least two candidates minimizing the consequences or the role of human beings in it. Pittman said ""you can be conscious of how things are done"" when it comes to the environment but says he would oppose efforts to curb climate change in Congress.\""When I was growing up, climate change was thermonuclear war,"" he said. ""We were worried about Russia and worried about thermonuclear war. That's climate change, burning up the atmosphere and burning up the planet.""\U.S. Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Huntsville, says there is ""no hard scientific factual data at this point"" on climate, and said more carbon dioxide would mean ""plant life does better because of the enriched environment on which they can live.""\""Most of our temperature data dates from 1960s and 1970s; that's about as good as our good scientific data goes,"" he said. ""To try to base long-term climate change prognostications on 40 or 50 years of data is absurd.""\Other GOP candidates say they believe there's a human role in climate change. Sen. Luther Strange - who as Alabama attorney general actively combated President Barack Obama's Clean Power Plan to address emissions - said in an interview he believes climate change is occurring and that ""man has some impact on it, though we don't know what that is.""\He also praised the work of EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt - who, as Oklahoma's attorney general, co-signed an editorial with Strange last year saying the science around climate change was ""far from settled"" - and said he opposed the federal government ""picking winners and losers"" on energy matters.\""We're moving the EPA back to its original goal of doing core issues like clean water and clean air and a strong vibrant economy,"" he said.\Former Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore's campaign declined to answer questions on the subject last week. Moore's campaign website does not state his views on climate change but says Moore supports ""energy independence"" and development of all sources of energy, with only ""reasonable regulations"" on coal mining and oil drilling.\Randy Brinson, another Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate, said that he supported Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris Accord - ""I think he's concerned about the environment, (but) felt like it was draconian compared to other countries"" - and said local governments should set emissions policies they feel are appropriate. But Brinson also said he supported the United States making investments in renewable energy projects in other countries.\""It's not a bad thing if it stimulates private investment or helps other countries grow their economy,"" he said.\Hansen says he favors tailored approaches to address the local impacts of climate change, but says the federal government can do things like establish targets and provide funding for new infrastructure.\""Those are all things that can be funded in part or fully by the federal government,"" he said. ""It's really about finding innovative solutions that work for the area. What's going to work for Birmingham isn't going to work in Selma.""\How climate change could affect Alabama.\montgomery\advertiser.com\getty images"

LONDON | Big business fears that the fight against climate change will cost billions are giving way to a different view: green can be the color of money.
\
The United States, Europe and Japan are locked in a frantic race to cash in on the exploding business of saving the planet. London has become the center for the multibillion dollar market in carbon emissions, attracting investors who trade CO2 allowances.
\
Silicon Valley is leading the way in attracting venture capital for green technologies that shows signs of mirroring the dot-com boom -- and critics say eventual bust -- of the 1990s. And Japan's Toyota has sold more than a million Prius hybrid models, its cutting-edge eco-friendly car.
\
Like all markets, the clean energy industry faces risks.
\
A sustained fall in the world's steep oil prices could make investment in alternatives to fossil fuels seem less attractive.
\
More important, to sustain business' new attraction to clean energy, governments must maintain, or even step up, efforts to cut carbon emissions. Toward that end, a major U.N. meeting will be held in Bali, Indonesia, in December aimed at reaching a new global climate pact to succeed the Kyoto Protocol, which expires in 2012.
\
But for now, the battle against global warming continues to offer investors an unusual chance to be idealistic and greedy at the same time.
\
""Everybody is jumping on the bandwagon,"" said Milo Sjardin, a senior associate at New Energy Finance, a research house in London on the world's clean energy and carbon markets.
\
The City of London financial district has taken the lead in making billions from the management of CO2 emissions, one of the fastest-growing segments in financial services.
\
The carbon market was created after Europe signed the 1997 Kyoto agreement on curbing green house gases. In 2005, European governments started capping the amounts of carbon dioxide that industries could emit, while letting them buy and sell CO2 emission allowances.
\
The cap-and-trade system encourages factories and industries to cut emissions by giving them ""pollution permits."" If they produce less greenhouse gases than the total of their permits, they can sell the surplus certificates -- also known as credits -- to companies that find them cheaper than cutting their own emissions.
\
That created the fast-growing carbon markets, where certificates are bought and sold like a commodity. It also includes investments in projects that help to generate additional credits.
\
About $30.4 billion of allowances were traded last year, representing 1.6 billion tons of CO2, double the volume of 2005, said Point Carbon, a company of market analysts based in Norway.
\
New Energy Finance estimates that $33.8 billion carbon credits will be needed to meet targets under the Kyoto Accord and the European Emissions-Trading Scheme by 2012.
\
Britain has emerged as the clear leader in carbon fund management, with 72 percent of private carbon funds and 50 percent of all carbon funds being managed out of London, New Energy Finance said.
\
The United States, which rejected the Kyoto agreement, has never adopted a federal system of controls for carbon-dioxide emissions, although California has binding targets to cut CO2 emissions and other states are expected to follow.
\
America, however, has emerged as the world leader in developing clean energy technologies.
\
It involves a wide range of sectors, including wind, solar, biofuels, biomass (organic material to produce power and heat), energy efficiency technology, hydrogen and fuel cells, and tidal power.
\
""General Electric has been a leader in the campaign to develop new clean technologies that allows one to save energy and make money at the same time,"" said Dr. Andrew Dlugolecki, head of Andlug Consulting, a strategic consultancy on climate change and the financial sector based in Perth, Scotland.
\
He said oil companies, carmakers and power generators are increasing their investments in renewables and biofuels.
\
Silicon Valley venture capitalists also are rushing into the business, hoping to design revolutionary technologies, drive down prices and defeat energy business giants, said Dlugolecki.
\
Some entrepreneurs are seeking technological and scientific innovations to produce alternatives to oil and coal, while others hope to find ways of using those fuels in cleaner and more efficient ways.
\
Other investors are pouring money into wind, solar, geothermal and hydropower as countries such as China and more than 20 states in America require a certain portion of energy sold to come from renewable sources.
\
A recent survey of investors found many of them are turning green.
\
Deloitte Touche's 2006 ""Global Venture Capital Survey"" in the Americas, the Asia-Pacific, Europe, the Middle East and Africa found that for a second year in a row respondents selected energy/environment as the sector most likely to see the highest increase in investment focus.
\
That also has led to a word of caution for investors.
\
""There's a lot of money chasing not so many ideas, so the prices are going up fast, raising some concern that this activity by venture capitalists and hedge funds could produce the next dot-com bust,"" said Dlugolecki.
\
New Energy Finance, which tracks all investment flows in the clean energy market, said 1,250 capital and private equity funds were investing in companies involved in the market in 2006.
\
In that year, $4 billion in investment originated in the Americas, mostly the United States, compared to $1.6 billion for Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
\
The investment in the clean energy market also doubled from 2005 to 2006 in the Americas, while remaining about the same in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, New Energy Finance said.
\
However, when it comes to initial public offerings for clean energy companies in 2006, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, turned the tables, producing a total value of $4.8 billion, compared to $2 billion in the Americas, said New Energy Finance.
\
One reason is that clean energy IPOs appear to favor London because AIM -- the Alternative Investment Market submarket of the London Stock Exchange -- allows smaller companies to float shares with a more flexible regulatory system than is applicable to the main market and Wall Street.

MONTGOMERY | There's a new sheriff in town, and he has a new posse to back him up.
\
Republican Gov. Robert Bentley succeeds two-term Gov. Bob Riley, but unlike Riley he has a supermajority of Republicans in the House and Senate to consider his legislative agenda, thanks to voters in November who ousted many long-time Democrats.
\
On the other hand, the House and Senate could thwart Bentley's agenda by going off on side trips.
\
Bentley doesn't think so. He said he's been working closely with legislative leaders about the session that begins at noon Tuesday.
\
Bentley is to address the Legislature and Alabamians at 6:30 p.m. on Tuesday. His State of the State address will be carried live by Alabama Public Television.
\
""I want to lay things out exactly the way they are,"" Bentley said in a recent interview. ""(The budgets are) worse than people realize, worse than the Legislature realizes.""
\
Bentley said he expects both budgets for next fiscal year to be smaller than this year's budgets.
\
""People need to know what the situation is, but we're going to try to present to people of Alabama how we will get through this economic situation,"" he said. ""It will be somber, but with hope.""
\
Athens State University government professor Jess Brown said the nation's mood about spending may take hold in Alabama. ""(An) assortment of 'benefit' issues for state workers will generate the most heat for members back home, but the overall political environment is ripe for reductions in state employee and educator benefits,"" Brown said.
\
Besides budgets, the new Republican supermajority in the House and Senate has plans to revitalize its ""Handshake with Alabama"" agenda.
\
""Our priorities are to fulfill our promise to the taxpayers through the completion of our 'Handshake,' working diligently to balance the state's budget and doing all that we can to develop policies that will assist in both job creation and the growth of existing businesses,"" said Senate President Pro Tem Del Marsh, R-Anniston.
\
Priorities for House Speaker Mike Hubbard, R-Auburn, include the ""Handshake with Alabama"" and developing legislation to help private sector job growth.
\
""Many other issues will certainly arise in this historic regular session, but keeping our promises and jumpstarting job growth tops the agenda,"" Hubbard spokesman Todd Stacy said.
\
The ""Handshake with Alabama"" unveiled in 2010 identified specific, issue-oriented bills. 'Handshake' goals include job creation, tax incentives and increasing the small business health insurance tax credit from 150 percent to 300 percent of the amount employees and employers pay for coverage premiums.
\
""The speaker and I have worked closely to develop a comprehensive agenda that will rein in spending, tackle tough issues like illegal immigration, provide tools for businesses to create jobs and to fulfill our campaign promises to the people of Alabama,"" Marsh said.
\
Along with that support for small businesses, union issues will be addressed.
\
""We will fight to ensure that Alabama remains a right-to-work state in order to keep employment costs low and demand legislation that protects the right to a secret ballot in union elections so that no worker may be harassed or intimidated for voting his or her heart and conscience,"" the 'Handshake' paper said.
\
Side issues will include efforts to reduce the effectiveness of the powerful Alabama Education Association that traditionally supports Democratic candidates and causes.
\
""If they come in they come in and deal with the people's business and budgets and policy questions honestly and fairly and come in with an attitude of let's work together for what's best, no, I don't feel defensive,"" said AEA executive Secretary Paul Hubbert. ""If they want to replay the last election to get back at us then we'll be very defensive. We'll be manning our guns.""
\
Other issues will include picture voter ID, illegal immigration, thwarting unpopular federal mandates like cap and trade and the Responsible Budgeting and Spending Act.
\
That bill would require state revenue estimates for budgets to be based on a 15-year rolling average of revenue growth or declines rather than unsupported projections.
\
On immigration, expect a Republican legislative majority to push for a bill similar to the one approved in Arizona. The Alabama bill will create a new state criminal trespass statute that will allow local law enforcement to arrest illegal immigrants for simply setting foot in Alabama, legislators said.
\
It also would be a crime to provide an illegal alien transportation in Alabama.
\
The 'Handshake' also includes prohibiting the federal government from requiring mandatory health insurance.
"
7,"By Twinkle Andress Cavanaugh\Since taking office as a member of the Public Service Commission, I have made it a priority to learn as much as possible about the various fees, costs and other factors that affect consumers' power bills. I ran for office on a platform of keeping utility rates as affordable as possible for Alabama families, and it is a promise I intend to keep.\Suffice it to say I was angered to find that consumers are being forced to pay billions of additional dollars for electricity simply because of laws and regulations passed by Congress or imposed by the Environmental Protection Agency. And, if the EPA has its way, more increases will find their way into your power bill.\Like so many things about Washington, bureaucrats and activists want to keep us in the dark about the costs of implementing the various environmental laws mandated by the federal government. It is time that we pull back the curtain and begin to shed some light on the subject.\Many of these mandates and spiraling costs are based upon the questionable science associated with ""climate change"" theories and speculation, and Alabama's economy could suffer tremendously because of those who are peddling the medicine show tonic of ""global warming.""\The simple fact is that the Southeast has historically enjoyed among the most affordable energy costs in the United States. Many of the large corporations, factories and industrial projects that Alabama has recruited over the past several years have been a result of the competitive power and electricity services we offer.\Powerful Democrats from the Northeast, who until recently controlled the U.S. Congress, pushed wrongheaded initiatives like ""cap and trade"" in an attempt to reverse our economic development successes and drain jobs from our region. It seems they think that increasing our energy costs is their only chance to compete with us in job recruitment, an area in which Alabama consistently leads the nation.\Now that Republicans have taken the U.S. House and hold a healthy number of seats in the Senate, ""cap and trade"" is all but dead, so the EPA is moving to implement similar policies through regulations and mandates.\There is no other explanation for D.C.'s demand that states convert to ""clean"" energy sources like wind and solar, yet two of the cleanest -- hydroelectric and nuclear -- were excluded from the acceptable list. It is no coincidence that those are the two sources that Alabama and other sister states depend upon heavily. Nor do they provide allowances for cleaner burning coal technology, another consideration that could allow the Southeast to remain competitive.\Our state and in fact our nation rely upon a 200-year supply of coal as part of an energy mix to produce inexpensive electricity. The EPA is attempting, through regulation, to make coal so expensive it can no longer be used to generate electric energy, and totally removing this workhorse from our energy sources will send even more manufacturing jobs fleeing overseas from the Southeast.\If fully implemented, new environmental demands would likely increase the cost of providing power in Alabama by 30 to 40 percent, and the low, stable prices consumers have enjoyed for many years may become a distant memory of the past. The utility companies have no choice but to spend large amounts of money to comply with the strict federal regulations, and, by law, they are allowed to pass their actual environmental costs incurred by these mandates to the customer.\This type of energy policy hurts our economy, suppresses job creation and places an unfair burden on families struggling to survive during difficult times.\Being elected to serve you as a member of the PSC has been a high point of my life, and I will faithfully exercise our powers to make sure regulated utilities toe the line to provide low-cost electricity to our state. But it is time that we all raise our voices to stop the bureaucratic power of Washington from undercutting our economy and hurting our families. Join me in asking our representatives in Congress to intervene and check the EPA's power.\Washington must allow Alabama to continue growing our economy using sound state energy policies that protect our environment. In fact, our state's future depends on it.\Twinkle Andress Cavanaugh is a member of the Alabama Public Service Commission.\ID_Code: DS-102040307"
8,"By Gary Palmer\Last fall's blockbuster revelation that some of the leading global warming proponents had manipulated data, destroyed data files and suppressed research that refuted their findings added to the public's declining belief that global warming is a major issue. In fact, poll data indicates that the 40th anniversary of Earth Day in the United States was not as well received as in the past.\A Gallup Poll released in March found that Americans' concern about environmental issues has hit a 20-year low. It seems Americans are more concerned about a cool economy than a warm planet. A record 53 percent of those surveyed now say that economic growth takes precedence, even if it hurts the environment. In fact, of the eight environmental issues listed in the survey, global warming was ranked last.\This ranking could be attributed to the fact that a majority of people know that global temperatures have actually declined over the last decade or they have paid attention to the last few years of extremely cold winters, record snowfalls and mild hurricane seasons. They may also have some well-founded distrust of the so-called scientific evidence for anthropogenic (human-induced) global warming.\For instance, a report from the United Nations International Panel on Climate Change was seriously compromised by revelations of errors and misrepresentations that further diminished the public's belief that global warming is a serious threat.\Critics of the UN report gave it an F for having so many sources that were not from peer-reviewed scientific reports or publications. Donna Laframboise, director of the organization that audited the UN report, stated, ""We've been told it's 100 percent peer-reviewed science. But thousands of sources cited by this report have been nowhere near a scientific journal.""\Laframboise pointed out that many sources cited by the UN report were press releases, newspaper and magazine stories, theses by college students, newsletters, discussion papers, and literature published by environmental activists.\The report included many scary predictions unsupported by scientific studies including the assertion that there would be a 50 percent decline in crop production in Africa and that water resources would be depleted for over half the world's population. Among the other errors and misrepresentations admitted to by the UN in their fourth assessment report of the IPCC was the prediction that up to 40 percent of the Amazon rainforest was endangered which came from an anti-smoking activist and had no scientific basis at all.\The report also predicted that the Himalayan glaciers would melt by 2035, which was based entirely on a pamphlet published by the World Wildlife Federation. Even though the head of the IPCC was informed the prediction was in error, he did nothing to correct it. Yet this is the report that the Environmental Protection Agency, the United States Department of State, and proponents of cap-and-trade legislation use as their excuse to radically constrain the American economy.\Britain's Climate Research Unit at University of East Anglia, NASA and the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have all been exposed for using data that misrepresents global climate change. Last December, the Institute of Economic Analysis based in Moscow published a report claiming that the Hadley Center for Climate Change at the headquarters for the British Meteorological office had probably tampered with Russian climate data.\Given that Russia represents more than 12 percent of the world's land mass, misrepresenting an increase in Russian land temperatures would result in an erroneous increase in global temperatures.\Phil Jones, the former head of the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia, was forced to resign as a result of the data scandal. Jones has now admitted that there has not been any significant warming since 1995. Moreover, he acknowledges that global temperatures may have been higher than current temperatures during the medieval warming period from 800-1300 AD, which indicates a natural cycle of warming and cooling unrelated to human activity.\The climate data scandal forced the proponents of an international climate change treaty to admit that the science on global climate change is not as settled as they have insisted. But that won't stop the hard-core liberals in Congress from trying to pass a cap-and-trade bill.\Perhaps the arrogance of this Congress helps explain why polls are now showing that almost 80 percent of all Americans say they don't trust the federal government. It also further explains the cooling effect in terms of the public's support of Earth Day and the rest of the environmental agenda.\Gary Palmer is president of the Alabama Policy Institute.

9,"By Michael Ciamarra\Alabama and the United States have made great strides over the past 30 years to clean up our air, land and water. Certainly there's more to be done and market forces have performed admirably.\At a time when we are on the verge of a huge increase in four to seven time more science and technology in the next 25 years than the past 25 years, we need a system which incentivizes and accelerates the rate of scientific change in energy. As we work to create an even cleaner, greener environment, we must also support continued economic development and prosperity for the people of Alabama.\Predictably, in Washington the heavy hand of government is readily apparent instead of allowing technology and science through the market to flourish. A recent American Solutions poll revealed that 67 percent of Americans do not support the passage of a cap-and-trade plan to regulate carbon emissions, if it will raise the cost of energy between $800 and $2,500 per household.\Such a plan will likely result in a loss of 1.3 million to 2.3 million American jobs. Simply put, the cap-and-trade plan is nothing more than an energy tax on every American.\On the state level, state Sen. Wendell Mitchell, D-Luverne, and Rep. Greg Wren, R-Montgomery, deserve a round of applause on this Earth Day. As joint chairs of the Permanent Joint Legislative Committee on Energy Policy, collectively their work, and the work of the full committee, is worth looking into. Sen. Mitchell's Senate Joint Resolution 10, part of the Joint Committee on Energy's efforts, puts into context how unfair congressional energy legislation is to Alabama.\Right now, policies promoted by the Obama administration and its congressional allies would require utilities to obtain as much as 25 percent of their power from ""renewable"" resources. While some would have us believe that picking only certain types of ""renewable"" technologies in Washington is a good thing, the truth is that the cost impacts on the people and businesses of Alabama -- a state with limited renewable options beyond our existing hydroelectric plants -- would be dramatic.\Unlike the Midwest, Alabama does not have sustained winds capable of producing significant amounts of power. Alabama also doesn't have enough regular sunlight to build cost-effective, large-scale solar plants, like states in the Southwest. (While we have a lot of sunlight, we have a lot of cloud cover as well.) Alabama has potential to generate power from biomass -- using wood and crops such as switchgrass -- and our state utilities are currently doing so. But in order to generate 25 percent of our electricity from biomass, we would need more than 3 million acres of trees to be planted as an energy crop to meet the demand. That's equal to the land area of Jefferson, Shelby, Tuscaloosa, Walker and Talladega counties combined.\What about hydropower or nuclear power, which produce no air emissions? Alabama is blessed with an abundance of waterways that allow hydroelectric generation. In fact, the U.S. Energy Information Administration currently ranks our state sixth in the country in terms of renewable energy resources -- based largely on the energy we make from our reservoirs across the state.\Believe it or not, power produced by these proven resources would not count toward the renewable requirement in the proposed legislation. The result: business and consumers would be forced to pay an ""Alternate Compliance Payment"" to the federal government to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars per year and billions through 2020.\It's simply unfair. What's more, it's unclear what -- if any -- environmental benefit Alabama would gain should our customers be forced to make the alternate payment. Under the proposed legislation, the ""Alternate Compliance Payment"" dollars flow to Washington, supposedly to be redistributed for renewable energy projects and energy efficiency, but at this time, there's no guarantee any money would trickle down to Alabama.\Let's be clear, ""green conservatism"" wholeheartedly supports efforts to develop technologies that will produce electricity safely, reliably and cleanly. We also agree that energy efficiency and conservation is an important part of the equation.\The ultimate goal of any ""renewable"" legislation should be to improve air quality and lower carbon emissions in the atmosphere and encourage the generation of clean, economical and dependable electric energy. Why not include all clean electricity generation technologies in the equation -- solar, wind, hydro, biomass, landfill methane, nuclear, coal with carbon capture and sequestration, and geothermal among others -- and let the marketplace determine the most affordable technology?\We believe that is a more sound approach rather than picking the technology winners and losers in Washington. Rest assured, solar and wind energy must be a part of a national energy strategy going forward. But our electric utilities have an obligation to keep the lights on even at night and when the wind isn't blowing. And we expect them to do so balancing the cleanest energy at the lowest price. To accomplish this, they need all of the technologies, including energy efficiency, in their basket of options.\Let's continue to work with those environmental advocates that seek to find a balanced approach to reduce carbon emissions that put Alabama and our country on a path to create a green economy. The answer is to develop a green conservatism movement that is environmentally sensitive, scientifically based, technologically smart and deeply committed to entrepreneurial creativity through prizes, incentives, and market oriented changes.\Michael Ciamarra is vice president of the Alabama Policy Institute and Alabama chair of American Solutions.

10,"U.S. Rep. Bobby Bright has become accustomed to answering questions about health care and combating what he says are lies, misinformation and distortions being spread by special interest groups.\So, as he has been traveling through his 16-county district during Congress' August recess, he has kept one of the health care proposals, HR 3200, with him. During the last week, he had the bill, which takes up three large binders, sitting just behind him as he drove.\He advises people to ""verify it before you believe it.""\Health care was the topic of choice during the congressman's Wednesday stops. He spoke at a luncheon of Montgomery area Realtors, addressed several classes at Daniel Pratt Elementary School and visited with people at a store at Maxwell Air Force Base.\Bright, a freshman Democrat from Montgomery, told the Realtors he is firmly against all five current health care proposals being considered by Congress, but interrupted their applause to say ""we've got to do something about health care"" to contain costs.\""America has the best health care in the world, but we've got some problems with it,"" he said.\Bright said he believes the current proposals are too drastic. He opposes a public option and a single-payer system, and supports the idea of a market-driven plan.\But, he added, ""a public option is not all bad,"" telling the real estate agents that senior citizens are pleased with their Medicare coverage.\Bright expects Congress to pass a health care plan, but he is unsure what the final version will contain.\Traveling the district\Bright has traveled back to the district every weekend since he was sworn in except for two, which included the inauguration of Barack Obama and a retreat dedicated to education.\He flies into Montgomery on Thursday evenings or Friday mornings and flies back to Washington on Mondays.\He has visited all 16 counties in the district since he was sworn in early this year and has visited 74 of the 93 incorporated jurisdictions in the district. And he plans to have visited all 93 by the end of the August work period.\""It is a pretty rigorous schedule,"" he said.\During his short time in office, Bright has traveled to Iraq, Afghanistan, Israel and Cuba.\He has about 20 staff members, half in Washington and half in the district. Often, in Washington, he said, staff members do not interact with constituents.\So, this week, his staff members will travel to the district and meet with constituents.\""Many times, congressmen will get disconnected,"" Bright said.\Bright has hosted Congress on Your Corner events in dozens of locations in the district, essentially taking his staff to the communities to answer questions and listen to concerns.\On Wednesday, Bright had his first Congress on Your Corner on a military base when he was at a store at Maxwell.\Civil disagreements\Bright said his biggest disappointment has been the partisan politics in Washington.\""I'm ashamed of what I'm seeing on TV right now,"" he said of the confrontations over health care. ""People are not treating each other with respect.""\People protested in front of Bright's Montgomery office Wednesday morning. He did not meet with them because of his schedule.\Bright said they should call his office and schedule a visit.\""If I'm in town, I'll meet with them,"" he said.\People must be heard, but must address each other in a ""civil manner,"" Bright said.\And, he said, the protesters need to lobby someone else because he is ""already on their side.""\Bright received a warm reception at other places on Wednesday.\He also attended the board meeting of the Federal Land Bank Association, talked on ""Alabama Live"" on WSFA, attended a ribbon cutting at Mora Surgical Center in Prattville, and attended a meeting of the Autauga County Farmers Federation.\After speaking to the real estate agents, some in attendance took pictures with the congressman and some had him sign their programs.\During his talk, some observers appeared to be agitated as he talked about health care and other issues.\Bright showed his voting card when talking to students at the elementary school and to the Realtors. When he sticks the identification card into a box on the back of a seat in the House chamber, he has three choices -- yes, no or present.\""That card gives me the privilege to vote on all of the big laws of our country,"" Bright said to a fifth-grade class. "" ... This gives me the right to go up there and vote for you.""\Several of the children asked about Obama, and one class asked Bright if he could get Obama to visit. He said ""probably not.""\Some girls wanted Bright to tell Obama's daughters they said ""hi.""\He was also asked if he had any bodyguards.\Different emotional issue\A few months ago, health care was not the most-asked about issue in the district, Bright said. People were asking about the so-called cap and trade legislation that passed the House, but has stalled in the Senate. Bright said the legislation dealing with carbon emissions is effectively dead.\This year, Bright's first, has been packed with emotional issues, he said.\Along with health care and cap and trade, Bright and Obama entered office with massive job losses and the ""economy tanking into a depression,"" the congressman said.\Talking to a mostly conservative group of Realtors, Bright said that regardless of what people think about Obama's policies, the president wants the nation to be successful, cares about the future of the nation and wants the nation to survive the economic hard times.\""We ought to pray that he will be successful for the future of our country,"" he said.\The National Republican Congressional Committee has bashed Bright for calling himself a conservative while praising the leadership of Obama and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\Andy Sere, a spokesman for the NRCC, criticized Bright for saying the economy ""would be in chaos"" without action by Obama, but then voting against the president's major proposals.\""Bobby Bright can't have it both ways,"" Sere said in a statement. ""He's certainly entitled to lavish praise on the president's big-government leadership and wax on about the sorry state we'd be in without Obama at the helm.""\But, he said, Bright should renounce his voting record ""and promise never again to masquerade as a check-and-balance to the administration's agenda.""\Bright responded: ""Something had to be done, but there's more than one way to do them.""\He said he would have spent less money, spread out the cash injection into the economy over a longer period, and spent the money on projects where people can see the benefit, such as building schools and highways.\Obama came into office at a critical time, Bright said.\""I acknowledge something needed to be done,"" he said. ""He took much more drastic action than I would have.""\Bright said he continues to answer questions from people who believe that when his vote is needed, he will cave and vote with the Democratic majority.\""I am not going to do it,"" he said.\An A for effort\The congressman said Obama deserves an ""A for effort for trying to do something about"" health care.\In the current environment, Bright said, sadly too many people are not being responsible in giving out information.\He mentioned death panels and funding abortion.\""It has been proven over and over that is not the truth,"" Bright said.\The first step, he said, is to move to control the ""escalating and exorbitant health care costs.""\Bright also supports allowing people to purchase insurance from other states, handling coverage for pre-existing conditions, allowing hospitals and doctors to write off some costs they are not reimbursed for as business expenses, looking into health care exchanges, and rewarding doctors and hospitals for results and not treatment.\He said he is not advocating tort reform, which he said is not being addressed, but added it needs to be discussed in any reasonable overhaul of health care reform."
11,"MEDICAID\Bush lets states cut benefits\WASHINGTON -- Millions of low-income Americans who\get health insurance through Medicaid could see their\benefits trimmed under a ""no run-around"" plan that President Bush offered states on Saturday. He hopes they will use the savings to cover some of those with no insurance at all.\""The goals of Medicaid are too important to get bogged down in a bureaucracy,"" Bush said in his weekly radio address, taped Friday. My administration cares about\results, about getting Americans broader and better medical coverage.""\The plan gives states new power to shape the package of\benefits offered to some 12 million people whose states have added to their Medicaid programs. It would not affect the poorest Americans, who are automatically eligible for\Medicaid coverage and whose benefits would remain\unchanged.\Also\GLOBAL WARMING\Senate moving ahead with environment agenda: Sens. John\McCain, R-Ariz., and Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., are\seeking mandatory limits on greenhouse gases because they\say the voluntary steps favored by President Bush to deal with global warming will not work. The two senators said Friday they would introduce legislation imposing a nationwide ""cap and trade"" system on greenhouse emissions.\UPDATE\Democrats will fight for expanded patients' rights\bill: The version of a patients' rights bill that passed the Republican-controlled House this week won't be the final\word on the issue, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee said Saturday.\Terry McAuliffe called the House bill ""imposter legislation"" in the Democrats' weekly radio address.\He promised that when Congress returns from its summer recess after Labor Day, Democrats will fight for a more\extensive bill.\""This week, thanks to an eleventh-hour, back-room deal, the House passed watered-down legislation, which benefits\HMOs and stacks the deck against American consumers,""\McAuliffe said."
12,"The failure of President Obama to accept the help offered by other countries during this time of crisis in the Gulf is pathetic. All he has to do is temporarily waive the Jones Act, a protectionist law that requires vessels working in U.S. waters be built in the U.S. and be crewed by U.S. workers.\George W. Bush suspended this law during the Katrina aftermath and Obama should do the same now. Not doing everything in his power to save the people, animals and wonderful environment from this catastrophe is criminal.\Perhaps he has a hidden agenda to take advantage of this disaster to push the unpopular ""cap and trade"" legislation or maybe he just doesn't care about this region of the country and the people who live there.\Whatever the reason, I think it shows the true colors of this liberal progressive administration. God help us all, especially those affected by this terrible tragedy, as this group of political animals ruins this country.\S.F. Johnson\Pike Road\ID_Code: DS-6290334"

MONTGOMERY -- There's a new sheriff in town, and he has a new posse to back him up.
\
Republican Gov. Robert Bentley has succeeded two-term Gov. Bob Riley, but unlike Riley he has a supermajority of Republicans in the House and Senate to consider his legislative agenda, thanks to voters in November who ousted many longtime Democrats.
\
On the other hand, the House and Senate could thwart Bentley's agenda by going off on side trips. Bentley doesn't think so. He said he's been working closely with legislative leaders about the session that begins at noon Tuesday.
\
Bentley is to address the Legislature and Alabamians at 6:30 p.m. on Tuesday. His State of the State address will be carried live by Alabama Public Television.
\
""I want to lay things out exactly the way they are,"" Bentley said in a recent interview. ""(The budgets are) worse than people realize, worse than the Legislature realizes.""
\
Bentley said he expects both budgets for next fiscal year to be smaller than this year's budgets.
\
""People need to know what the situation is, but we're going to try to present to people of Alabama how we will get through this economic situation,"" he said. ""It will be somber, but with hope.""
\
Athens State University government professor Jess Brown said the nation's mood about spending may take hold in Alabama.
\
""(An) assortment of 'benefit' issues for state workers will generate the most heat for members back home, but the overall political environment is ripe for reductions in state employee and educator benefits,"" Brown said.
\
Besides budgets, the new Republican supermajority in the House and Senate has plans to revitalize its ""Handshake with Alabama"" agenda.
\
""Our priorities are to fulfill our promise to the taxpayers through the completion of our 'Handshake,' working diligently to balance the state's budget and doing all that we can to develop policies that will assist in both job creation and the growth of existing businesses,"" said Senate President Pro Tem Del Marsh, R-Anniston.
\
Priorities for House Speaker Mike Hubbard, R-Auburn, include the ""Handshake with Alabama"" and developing legislation to help private sector job growth. ""Many other issues will certainly arise in this historic regular session, but keeping our promises and jump starting job growth tops the agenda,' Hubbard spokesman Todd Stacy said.
\
The ""Handshake with Alabama"" unveiled in 2010 identified specific, issue-oriented bills. ""Handshake"" goals include job creation tax incentives and increasing the small business health insurance tax credit. A pre-filed bill would allow a deduction of 100 percent of the amount employers and employees pay for coverage premiums.
\
""The speaker and I have worked closely to develop a comprehensive agenda that will rein in spending, tackle tough issues like illegal immigration, provide tools for businesses to create jobs and to fulfill our campaign promises to the people of Alabama,"" Marsh said.
\
Along with that support for small businesses, union issues will be addressed.
\
""We will fight to ensure that Alabama remains a right-to-work state in order to keep employment costs low, and demand legislation that protects the right to a secret ballot in union elections so that no worker may be harassed or intimidated for voting his or her heart and conscience,"" the ""Handshake"" paper said.
\
Side issues will include efforts to reduce the effectiveness of the powerful Alabama Education Association that traditionally supports Democratic candidates and causes.
\
""If they come in and deal with the people's business and budgets and policy questions honestly and fairly, and come in with an attitude of let's work together for what's best, no, I don't feel defensive,"" said AEA Executive Secretary Paul Hubbert. ""If they want to replay the last election to get back at us, then we'll be very defensive. We'll be manning our guns.""
\
Other issues will include picture voter ID, illegal immigration, thwarting unpopular federal mandates like cap and trade and the Responsible Budgeting and Spending Act.
\
That bill would require state revenue estimates for budgets to be based on a 15-year rolling average of revenue growth or declines rather than unsupported projections.
\
On immigration, expect a Republican legislative majority to push for a bill similar to the one approved in Arizona. The Alabama bill will create a new state criminal trespass statute that will allow local law enforcement to arrest illegal immigrants simply for setting foot in Alabama, legislators said.
\
It also would be a crime to provide transportation for an illegal alien in Alabama.
\
The ""Handshake"" also includes prohibiting the federal government from requiring mandatory health insurance.

14,"Climate change could have a significant impact on Alabama's water supply, and the state needs to take action on the issue, according to a report from the National Resources Defense Council.\""Ready Or Not,"" released earlier this month, said Alabama was one of 12 states in the nation that had not taken any formal steps to address climate change and the potential impacts. The report said the higher temperatures associated with climate change will lead to reduced water availability in the state by 2050, which could have significant consequences for Alabama's economy, particularly tourism.\""To date, the state has not taken concerted action to address either climate change or long-term water management issues,"" the report stated. ""Considering the enormous challenges the state faces from climate change ... Alabama should act now to reduce statewide greenhouse gas pollution and develop a plan for protecting water resources from these looming threats.""\Environmentalists and state experts said the state is taking some slow steps toward fighting emissions, particularly in the area of energy efficiency, but still has some ways to go to deal with the subject.\""If it is couched as carbon emissions and climate change, I think there's a lot of resistance to that in the state,"" said Adam Snyder, executive director of Conservation Alabama, an environmental group. ""If it's couched in a way as improving public health, the economy and the environment, people are attracted to that.""\The report said that rising sea levels likely will lead to a significant reduction of land on Dauphin Island, just outside Mobile Bay, and affect availability of surface water resources while significantly increasing the changes of extreme weather events.\""For Alabama and other states across the country, it's really about protecting public health, the economy and future generations from climate threats,"" said Ben Chou, a water policy analyst with the National Resources Defense Council and co-author of the report. ""The threats range from implications to the state's water supply and water quality, to coastal communities at risk as sea levels rise.""\The report recommends that the state set targets for reducing carbon dioxide emissions, a major driver of global warming, while developing statewide adaptation plans to address issues related to climate change. Alabama also was urged to develop a water-management plan, which it currently lacks.\The state's record on both issues is mixed. Despite an ongoing dispute with Georgia over access to water in Lake Lanier outside Atlanta, the state has not adopted a water-management plan. A legislative committee is moving forward on work to do so.\In 2009, the then-Democratic-controlled Legislature approved a resolution opposing congressional efforts to create a cap-and-trade system to regulate carbon dioxide emissions. Alabama also is involved in three federal lawsuits against the Environmental Protection Agency's regulation of pollutants, including carbon dioxide.\Gov. Robert Bentley last December ordered state agencies to reduce energy consumption by 30 percent from 2005 levels by 2015.\Bentley's order said the government could ""demonstrate leadership"" by engaging in practices that ""will preserve natural resources, conserve energy and water, and reduce waste and pollution.""\Alabama is one of the biggest carbon emitters in the nation, thanks in part to Alabama Power Co.'s heavy dependence on coal.\Alabama industry emitted 79.3 million metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2010, the ninth-most in the nation despite Alabama being the 23rd most populous state in the United States, according to the Energy Information Administration, part of the U.S. Department of Energy.\Jason Senkbeil, an assistant professor of geography at the University of Alabama, said that while the warming of the planet is all but certain, determining the effect that will have on precipitation is more difficult.\""It's a very random and chaotic thing to have to model,"" he said. ""It looks like some areas will get dry, and some might get wetter. But precipitation looks like it will become more unreliable. Regardless of where you are, there's going to be great periods of dry weather and great periods of wet weather.""\Senkbeil said Alabama, ""blessed with water,"" may not face the consequences that drier states such as Texas will, but may see fallout, particularly with increased demands for water by residents and industry. That was a view shared by Claude Boyd, a professor at Auburn University.\""The biggest problem I see for Alabama is that there's a number of places that in years where there's drought, there's not enough water, because more people are using it than in the past,"" he said.\Snyder, who lobbies on environmental issues, said Bentley's efficiency declaration was a positive step.\""Reducing our energy consumption reduces carbon emissions,"" he said. ""And it will save us money. For legislators to get on board with something like this, you just can't sell climate change. You've got to talk about the other benefits.""\ID_Code: DS-304230008"

Over the past several months, the Public Service Commission has held a number of informal hearings inviting public comment and questions regarding all aspects of Alabama Power's business. Interested organizations and citizens were given the opportunity to examine a wide range of topics from the Rate Stabilization and Equalization mechanism to reviewing Alabama Power's operations and painstakingly exploring its finances.
\
The reason for the explosion of interest in Alabama's utility rates has less to do with rate setting than it does a discussion about Alabama's environmental policies. Frankly, an open discussion over those policies is appropriate in Alabama, regardless of the events at the PSC.
\
The creeks where I play with my boys are likely much cleaner and safer now than they were several decades ago. Common-sense environmental practices are not only a good idea, but they improve our ability to leave a safe, clean world to our children. Recycling, conservation and even choosing products and services that would have a lower impact on the environment are reasonable and effective ways to improve our air, water and soil.
\
At the same time, environmental concerns are balanced against economic costs. Some of these costs we may be willing to incur; others we may not.
\
The participant and expert list for the recent PSC hearings is replete with environmental groups: the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, the increasingly-activist AARP, Southern Environmental Law Center, Greater Birmingham Alliance for Stopping Pollution and the Alabama Environmental Council.
\
The aforementioned groups push an agenda that is anything but mindful of cost. These are the same entities that advocate for more stringent and costly Environmental Protection Agency regulations. Many also support the type of ""cap and trade"" scheme that President Barack Obama said would cause energy prices to ""necessarily skyrocket."" Shutting down cheaper sources of energy such as coal results in higher-energy generation prices that are passed along to consumers -- period.
\
So what changed to make these environmental advocacy groups seem like advocates for low-cost energy? Environmentalists use the economically burdensome regulations they support as one of the most significant economic reasons why coal and oil-fired electricity generation must be shut down.
\
Many recognize that their idea of environmentalism at any cost fails to gain traction in a state like Alabama. So instead, they have decided to tap into Alabama's populist streak. Nobody likes paying the power bill, especially in the hot Alabama summer. If environmentalists can convince Alabamians that the power company is making too much as a result of existing PSC rate-setting mechanism, they see an opportunity to change the rate review structure in a manner that would serve their agenda.
\
A move to an adversarial formal review structure gives environmentalists the ability to shut down coal and other fossil-fuel generation through litigation and financial modeling that anticipates significant federal regulatory burdens without ever having to convince the people of Alabama of the merits of those ideas.
\
Similar environmental groups were successful at targeting coal and oil generation through Georgia's adversarial rate review, and Georgia Power has plans to retire 15 such plants. The economic models used to
\
justify the retirement of
\
coal facilities assume an
\
ever increasing cost of
\
federal regulation.
\
In other words, environmentalists use the economically burdensome regulations they support as one of the most significant economic reasons why coal and oil-fired electricity generation must be shut down.
\
Keep in mind that an informal mechanism to review power rates already exists, and Alabamians from across the political spectrum have provided their input. More importantly, there is a particularly formal means for Alabamians to ensure an appropriate balance between the customer's interest and the utility's profit: the election of PSC Commissioners.
\
When the PSC makes its rate determination, the average Alabama utility customer has the chance to respond. If he or she feels that rates are unbalanced, finds service to be insufficient or even desires a PSC that more aggressively champions the ideas of environmental activists, the customer can vote to change the commission's makeup at the polls.
\
Transparency is important, especially when it comes to regulated industries. The PSC would be wise to receive input and questions from anyone willing to put them forth, and they must weigh that information against that provided by the power company.
\
The same transparency must also be a priority for the groups promoting policies that would impact the entire state. Environmentalist groups have every right to advocate for the end of coal generation. They can pursue more stringent environmental standards than those already put forth by the EPA. In either case, they should make their case directly to the PSC, elected officials and the people of Alabama, rather than engaging in a populist sleight of hand.

Alabama also is involved in three federal lawsuits against the Environmental Protection Agency's regulation of pollutants, including carbon dioxide.\Gov. Robert Bentley last December ordered state agencies to reduce energy consumption by 30 percent from 2005 levels by 2015.\Bentley's order said the government could ""demonstrate leadership"" by engaging in practices that ""will preserve natural resources, conserve energy and water, and reduce waste and pollution.""\Alabama is one of the biggest carbon emitters in the nation, thanks in part to Alabama Power Co.'s heavy dependence on coal.\Alabama industry emitted 79.3 million metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2010, the ninth-most in the nation despite Alabama being the 23rd most populous state in the United States, according to the Energy Information Administration, part of the U.S. Department of Energy.\Jason Senkbeil, an assistant professor of geography at the University of Alabama, said that while the warming of the planet is all but certain, determining the effect that will have on precipitation is more difficult.\""It's a very random and chaotic thing to have to model,"" he said. ""It looks like some areas will get dry, and some might get wetter. But precipitation looks like it will become more unreliable. Regardless of where you are, there's going to be great periods of dry weather and great periods of wet weather.""\Senkbeil said Alabama, ""blessed with water,"" may not face the consequences that drier states such as Texas will, but may see fallout, particularly with increased demands for water by residents and industry. That was a view shared by Claude Boyd, a professor at Auburn University.\""The biggest problem I see for Alabama is that there's a number of places that in years where there's drought, there's not enough water, because more people are using it than in the past,"" he said.\Snyder, who lobbies on environmental issues, said Bentley's efficiency declaration was a positive step.\""Reducing our energy consumption reduces carbon emissions,"" he said. ""And it will save us money. For legislators to get on board with something like this, you just can't sell climate change. You've got to talk about the other benefits."""
17,"The annual observation of Earth Day is a noble idea, to ensure we cherish and improve our environment. But we have to make sure it is not just symbolism and feel-good gestures. We have to focus on the most important environmental issues, not just the ones that get the most attention.\It is especially important we focus on the world's top priorities. In September, all 193 governments will meet at the UN to set targets for the world for the next 15 years in what is explicitly labeled ""Sustainable Development Goals."" So, it is worth looking at what we should do first.\At my think tank, we asked teams of top economists, including several Nobel laureates, to evaluate the economic, social and environmental costs and benefits of the targets, so we can pick the best ones. Here is what we should do in environment.\Indoor air pollution is often overlooked, but is in fact the world's deadliest environmental problem. It kills 4.3 million people each year, mainly because 2.8 billion people still use firewood, dung and coal for cooking and keeping warm, breathing polluted air inside their homes every day.\An effective way to address this problem is to provide 30 percent of these 2.8 billion people with improved cooking stoves -- which dispel smoke outside through chimneys and vents. It will save almost 400,000 lives each year. The cost will be around $11 billion a year, but this investment will yield economic, social and environmental benefits amounting to $161 billion a year.\Many goals to improve biodiversity have been suggested, and the experts highlight stemming the loss of coral reefs as a very effective target. Coral reefs act as fish hatcheries and fishing resources while housing a large numbers of species. At the same time, coral reefs attract tourists, generating tourism revenues. At the same time most of us would also be willing to pay a certain amount to make sure coral reefs don't get ruined. Reducing global coral loss by 50 percent would cost about $3 billion a year but the total benefits are likely run to at least $72 billion.\Of course, climate change is also high on the agenda. The research on climate change targets shows that investing in the development of better energy technology is an effective goal.\Focusing on R&D in energy technologies can help create green energy solutions that are effective enough to take on fossil fuels on the market. This could be funded with a slowly rising carbon tax. In total, this solution would avoid $11 of climate damages for every dollar spent.\Compare this to another very prominent climate goal: double the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix. While it will do a lot of good -- it will provide energy and combat climate at a tune of $415 billion annually -- it also comes at a very large cost of $514 billion annually.\Another great goal would be to phase out fossil fuel subsidies. The world spends a whopping $548 billion on such subsidies, almost exclusively in developing countries. This drains already stretched budgets of resources that could be used to provide health and education services, while encouraging greater carbon-dioxide emissions.\We shouldn't just celebrate the environment, we should pledge to focus on the best ways to improve it.\Bjorn Lomborg is president of the Copenhagen Consensus Center."
18,"The ""law of demand,"" the most accepted principle of economics, states that if the price of something increases, the quantity demanded will decrease. For over a century, economists have proposed using price to require users and abusers of the environment to pay for what they use; their recommended approach is to impose an ""effluent tax"" on polluters. Unfortunately, at present, this type of solution lacks the support of many in Congress. A number of Progressive lawmakers resist the carbon tax believing that it ""puts the atmosphere up for sale,"" while several of their conservative counterparts refuse to admit that climate change is real or that any action now is called for.\The Climate Leadership Council, a group of prominent economists and politicians, recently targeted this bipartisan logjam. Led by conservative political giants, former Secretaries of State George Schulz and James A. Baker, a series of editorials in support of the carbon tax have appeared in our nation's leading papers. The Council proposes using pro-market principles to remedy the impending catastrophe that scientific studies are predicting. They note that for profit-seeking firms, it is often cheaper to emit greenhouse gases than to prevent their escape into the atmosphere. Applying the law of demand, they propose to reduce emissions with a tax on polluters of $40 per ton, adjusted as experience dictates.\Such a hefty tax would induce investment in abatement methods that are estimated to keep our emissions far below the levels agreed to in the Paris accords. However, the tax would withdraw substantial revenue from the economy; to avoid recession that money must get re-inserted back into the nation's spending stream. So, a sweetener is added to the tax proposal: redistribution of the tax revenue in the form of an equal per-person ""citizen dividend."" They estimate that a $40 per ton tax would return a dividend of roughly $2,000 per family of four.\Water and congestion\The principle applied in their proposal that ""people should pay for what they use in an amount that sustains the resource for the use of others"" is not new; it is simply bedrock conservative policy applied to a public good (in this case, the atmosphere). Markets in private goods do this automatically; for public goods, regulation must intervene. There are many other examples of how an incentive provided by prices can be utilized in managing public goods. Let's consider two: water usage and highway congestion.\Water usage\Traditionally, we respond to a perceived need for more water by seeking additional sources and arranging delivery to where it is needed. Then, we typically underprice the water, disregarding the impact that our overuse has on the depletion and quality reduction facing future water users. To take those impacts into account, today's price would have to be increased, which would induce users today to consume less water. Of course, the higher price would generate additional revenue which could be targeted for improvements to the waterworks infrastructure as well as to the same kind of citizen dividend fund contemplated by Schulz and Baker.\Congestion\The capacity of our road network is fixed, but the demand to use that capacity fluctuates throughout the day. During congested periods, each driver adds to the time cost of all other drivers behind them. The user-charge remedy for rush hour congestion is called a congestion tax. Faced with a congestion tax, drivers must determine for themselves whether the cost of driving during peak rush hour is worth the travel time plus the tax. Some will decide to travel before or after the rush hour, shifting some travel to off peak times and thus reducing travel time during rush hour for those willing to pay the tax. Like water infrastructure, the state of disrepair of our roads dictates that the revenue from the congestion tax be used to finance the repair and maintenance of our road network, with any surplus distributed back to the citizens.\The Climate Leadership Council should gain a serious hearing in Congress. They are applying a general economic principle that should be applied whenever the users of public goods can be identified and their use can be measured and taxed per unit. The revenue from the tax should first go to sustain the environmental resource, with any surplus distributed to citizens to gain acceptance of the tax.\William L.

If national renewal energy standards are established, they could cause problems for Southern states, Associate Public Service Commissioner Susan Parker said Wednesday.
\
Parker, elected to the PSC in 2006, told the Kiwanis Club of Gadsden that President Barack Obama and Congress will be coming forward with a climate-change energy policy package.
\
""When that comes, we in the Southeast will be in a difficult situation,"" Parker said.
\
She explained that most people believe Obama's proposal will require states to have a renewal portfolio standard, which means a percentage of energy used by the states has to come from renewable sources.
\
Thirty states but not Alabama already have renewal portfolio standards. For instance, California will require a renewal portfolio standard of 20 percent by 2020.
\
States in the West and Northeast are using wind power to meet their standards, while others use solar or landfill methane gas.
\
Parker said there is talk of not allowing existing hydropower when determining renewable energy percentages but allowing Western states to use their existing wind power.
\
Alabama could not have wind as a power source because that requires 30 mph sustainable winds, she said.
\
Secretary of Energy Steven Chu said he thought there would be some allowances for nuclear power. States unable to reach renewable energy goals will pay a ""carbon tax.""
\
Parker said the South which is in a good position now for economic development could have problems if energy costs increase because of a carbon tax.
\
Money from a carbon tax would be used for energy research.
\
Parker said states with higher energy costs would like to see more consistent rates to level the field in industrial recruitment.
\
""We're just going to beg for mercy and try to get our delegations together the best we can,"" she said.
\
The best answer for heavy coal usage states in the South would be for research for technology that would capture carbon emissions and pump the emissions underground.
\
Parker said the South has the largest number of caverns where the carbon could be stored, but the technology has not been perfected and additional research is needed.
\
The solution is an increased investment in nuclear energy, she said, and hybrid and natural gas cars.
\
""We need to put more of our money in nuclear,"" Parker said. ""We need to invest in the technology to get us through all this.""
\
Her goal is to balance the ""triangle"" of a clean environment, energy and the economy.
\
Parker said that because of the recession, industrial energy demand is down 20 percent in the state. Fuel costs are down as well.
\
She hopes electrical rates will be stable for the next couple of years.
\
Parker also noted that with the election in November of former Lt. Gov. Lucy Baxley, Alabama's Public Service Commission is the only such commission in the country comprised solely of women.

20,"For at least 30 years, the conservative mantra has been ""no new taxes."" No exceptions: to shrink government, deny it revenue. ""Starve the Beast"" is a ""take-no prisoners"" rallying cry that distracts from the different roles that various types of taxes play; particularly, the way they raise revenue and the way they affect incentives.\Consequently, it does not matter to no-new-taxers whether the tax that is cut is an income tax, a sales tax, a property tax or some other form of taxation. Their objective is the same: Oppose all tax increases and cut every existing tax whenever the opportunity arises.\In fact, different types of taxes have very different impacts on the economy. Consider the different impacts imposed by income taxes versus user charges: While both raise government revenues and shift purchasing power to government, they impose markedly different incentives on the people who pay them. The income tax does not change the relative prices of the goods and services that we buy, while the user charge does.\User charges are levied on purchases of specific goods and services; they induce buyers to shift their purchases away from the taxed good or service toward other goods and services. For example, a tax levied on the purchase of cigarettes helps to discourage smoking. It incentivizes health benefits while raising revenue. Similarly, because the gas tax requires motorists to pay for what they use, this ""user tax"" will encourage motorists to be more efficient in their road usage.\User charges embody another conservative principle: People should pay for what they use or for the damage they inflict. When the users of a public service can be identified and their individual usage measured, we have the necessary preconditions for the implementation of user charges. Such is the case for water consumption, airport landing fees, and the emission of sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide and methane. By contrast, user charges are a poor choice for financing police protection or homeland security since the amount of these services that an individual enjoys cannot be easily measured.\To be profitable enough to remain in the market, the price of the goods and services being sold to the consumer must include all directly incurred costs plus a reasonable rate of return on the seller's investment. If a firm should pollute the environment in the process of bringing its goods to market, they impose costs on society that that will not be reimbursed unless a user tax is imposed. These costs are referred to as ""external"" costs and are not added to the price. Because they are ignored, the market will underprice and over produce the goods. To correct for the inefficiently low price, economists recommend user taxes be added to the price.\Let's look at some examples. For decades we have been warned that water, the most vital resource, will be in short supply in our lifetime. The usual response to water ""shortages"" is to go get more and then underprice it. We build gigantically expensive pipelines, dams, reservoirs and desalination plants. Still, water remains in increasingly short supply in many major populated areas of this country. If the signs of a shortage were taken more seriously, water prices would have gone up, encouraging a reduction in the amount used and a much earlier installation of water-conserving equipment.\In the same way, in the absence of a carbon tax, polluters will tend to underprice and over-produce goods that generate external costs. So, for example, when a coal-fired power plant generates both beneficial electricity and detrimental carbon emissions, the market provides an incentive to sell the benefit but ignore the harm. Rather than accept the environmental harm, a carbon tax on major polluters incentivizes reduction in the harm while generating revenue that can be used to finance any number of public initiatives.\If we are to return to robust economic growth in this country, we have to invest in our public infrastructure - bridges, roads, school buildings and broadband. Somehow all of this must be paid for. At present, we are at a standstill because so many politicians, believing that they gain conservative bone fides by opposing taxes, are unwilling to support public investments. A greater understanding of well-targeted user charges might dislodge them from their position that is so clearly damaging the economic well-being of the nation.\William L.

Want to understand why Alabama has a broken transportation system? Here's an easy experiment: Go to the grocery store and buy a gallon of milk. Take it home and set it on the table. Now, just look at it. Keep watching. No matter how long you stare, the container won't get any bigger. The contents may spoil, but the size of that gallon jug will always remain the same.
\
This simple science project gets to the root of the crisis in Alabama's transportation funding. The buying power of a dollar goes down over time because of inflation, but the gallon is the same size it was in our grandparents' day.
\
This is a tremendous problem for transportation funding in Alabama, whether you're talking about buses, high-speed trains or old-fashioned roads and bridges. Gasoline is taxed by the gallon in Alabama. Because the state gas tax is not adjusted for inflation, the 16 cents per gallon you pay at the pump today is identical to the 16 cents per gallon you paid back in the early 1990s, the last time the state gas tax was increased.
\
Not only does the dollar buy less, but people also are filling up less often because vehicles get better gas mileage these days. Making fewer trips to the gas station is good for your pocketbook (and the environment), but it's bad for the federal Highway Trust Fund and the state Public Road and Bridge Fund. These funds, supported by gas tax revenue, are a key part of how we pay for the roads and bridges that allow us to get to work, the doctor's office, the football game and everywhere else we need to go.
\
What does Alabama's shrinking gas tax revenue mean to you? It means the folks tasked with filling our potholes and inspecting and maintaining our bridges are doing so with less money, even as labor and material costs go up. At best, it means slower roadwork and more traffic congestion. At worst, it could mean another catastrophe like the Interstate 35 bridge collapse in Minnesota in 2007.
\
The highway funding problem also has major implications for efforts to convince state leaders to invest in the public transportation systems that Alabama needs. If the state can't muster the will to pay to maintain the roads and bridges we already have, we're likely going to come up empty trying to fund more bus or van routes, covered shelters and benches for bus stops, or a fast train to take you from Birmingham to Mobile.
\
The gas tax crisis has been mounting for more than a decade. Unfortunately, because raising taxes is often unpopular, nothing much has been done to solve the problem. Transportation funding bills simply have added layers of patchwork solutions without addressing the fundamental causes of the crisis: decreasing gas consumption and increasing costs.
\
These issues are examined in depth in Connecting Our Citizens for Prosperity, a recent report co-authored by Arise Citizens' Policy Project and published by Alabama State University's Center for Leadership and Public Policy. The report, available at arisecitizens.org, surveys the increasingly dire reports from transportation planners and examines their proposed solutions.
\
Most planners agree that a necessary first step is to increase the gas tax for the first time in a generation. Should that prove to be politically impossible, some experts warn of a future where drivers are charged directly for using public roads, whether in the form of ubiquitous toll roads or a fee for vehicle miles traveled. If you think gas taxes are unpopular, consider those alternatives.
\
Alabama's transportation funding problem won't solve itself. Building roads with borrowed money may seem appealing, but it only delays the inevitable. Vehicles will continue to get better gas mileage, construction costs will continue to go up and our state's public transportation needs will remain unaddressed until our leaders act. We need to find the courage to deal with this problem now, not later.
\
Alabama has 21st-century transportation needs. It's time for our leaders to bring the gas tax into the 21st century to meet them. That gallon milk jug isn't getting any bigger.

This is not your regular gas tax. Agriculture and Industries Commissioner Ron Sparks calls a ""cow tax"" an ""absurd proposal"" and U.S. Rep. Robert Aderholt says it's not going to happen. But they're discussing it in Europe and the federal environmental agency wanted comments.
\
Sparks praised Alabamians who responded to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's request for comments about a proposed rule to treat barnyard animal intestinal flatus as greenhouse gas emissions that would require regulating or fees. Sparks said a proposed EPA flatus tax on cows, pigs, and beef cattle as ""an extremely serious situation for Alabama's farmers and producers.""
\
Aderholt, R-Haleyville, said a cow tax ""will not be a reality.""
\
The Supreme Court said greenhouse gases are pollutants under the Clean Air Act, according to the EPA, which issued an ""advance notice of proposed rulemaking regulating greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act.""
\
The New York Times reports that the United Nations said trillions of farm animals produce 18 percent of the emissions including methane thought to contribute to increased global temperatures.
\
Some emission reduction proposals include getting consumers to eat less meat, paying a tax on pork and beef, and labeling meat for animal gas production, the NYT said.
\
""Of course for the environment it's better to eat beans than beef, but if you want to eat beef for New Year's, you'll know which beef is best to buy,"" the New York Times quoted Claes Johansson, chief of sustainability at the Swedish agricultural group Lantmannen.

Whooping cranes
\
are coming
\
Those young whooping cranes will fly over Northwest Alabama but the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service isn't sure when.
\
Earlier this fall the fish and wildlife service said 14 endangered whooping cranes raised from hatchlings in Wisconsin were to be led by pilots in ultralight aircraft in an attempt to reintroduce them to former historical ranges in Florida. The reintroduction attempt is an effort by the Whooping Crane Eastern Partnership.
\
On Thursday the birds and their motorized leaders were in western Kentucky still headed to Chassahowitzka and St. Marks National Wildlife Refuges on Florida's Gulf Coast, the federal agency said. The tallest North American birds are following four ultralight aircraft.
\
The flock is to make stops in Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia and Florida.
\
The duration of their flight depends on the weather, as much for the ultralight pilots as the birds.
\
Last year's flight took 97 days to reach Florida. Those birds flew over the lower Appalachian Mountains but this year they'll skirt the Appalachians and pass through Alabama for the first time. The cranes will return north on their own in the spring.
\
Whooping cranes were almost extinct in the 1940s but today there are about 500. The fish and wildlife service said there are 68 wild migratory whooping cranes in eastern North America. They're protected by law.

Walker just doing his job
\
Alabama Homeland Security Director Jim Walker has been making public appearances lately, he says as part of his job. When asked about any political plans, he said he has ""been encouraged by private citizens and some civic organizations to continue in public service beyond the end of the Riley administration, but nothing specific.""
\
Gov. Bob Riley will leave office in 2011 because he was elected to two consecutive terms and by law may not seek a third consecutive term.
\
""I have not been approached or encouraged by any state political party leader, Republican or Democrat, to consider any elected post,"" Walker said.
\
He said he has not spent a lot of time thinking about life after 2010 because he is focused on his job.
\
""At some point, I will need to start thinking about the next chapter of my life,"" he said. ""I do enjoy public service and would pay close attention to any opportunity that allows me the chance to serve others.""

23,"JACKSONVILLE -- Lasharon Jenkins was all smiles when she got out of her mom's minivan.\""I passed!"" the 16-year-old Anniston High School student shouted to her mother, Parashonta Johnson, waiting on a bench outside the State Troopers post in Jacksonville to hear the good news about her daughter's driver's license test.\""She's already excited about getting a car,"" Johnson said Tuesday. ""She wants to go tonight and get one.""\While most 16-year-olds are happy to get behind the wheel, Americans in general are putting fewer miles on their cars. According to a study released last week by the United States Public Interest Research Group, the number of miles driven annually per person dropped by more than 10 percent in 18 states from 2005 to 2011, but Alabama saw a 3 percent increase.\The group's study, titled ""Moving Off the Road,"" found an overall 8 percent drop in the mileage the average American drove during that period. Alabama was just one of four states -- along with Louisiana, Nevada and North Dakota -- that bucked the trend with an increase in mileage.\""If you go back more years and cast a wider net, you see Nevada and Louisiana had years prior to 2005 with higher percentages,"" said Phineas Baxandall, the study's author. ""So really, it's just Alabama and North Dakota who are driving more.""\The study does not explain why Alabama has seen an increase in driving.\But Jack Plunk, a principal planner with the East Alabama Regional Planning and Development Commission, said land use in the state makes driving a car the only way to get around.\While Baxandall said he hopes his study will encourage lawmakers to back away from increasing road projects and look toward funding alternative forms of transportation, Plunk said he doesn't see that happening anytime soon in Alabama.\""They're doing just the opposite,"" Plunk said about state lawmakers. ""In fact, fuel and gas tax in this state specifically cannot go to fund public transportation.""\But even if drastic changes to policy took place overnight, Plunk said, a lot of drivers still wouldn't change behavior.\""If gas prices doubled tomorrow, a lot of us wouldn't have the option to use public transportation,"" Plunk said. ""We couldn't get on the bus, or ride your bike, or even carpool.""\Baxandall said the study looked at numbers before the recession and after the start of the economic recovery to prove that the decrease in numbers wasn't solely based on the economy. But some Alabama drivers said the climbing cost of gas prices keeps them off the road.\""Who wants to go anywhere with those outrageous prices,"" said Brandi Fowler, while filling up her gas tank at Walmart. Fowler, a Weaver resident, said she drives 20 miles to her job in Oxford seven days a week.\""Here in Alabama we're a little cheaper than some places,"" Fowler said. ""So maybe that's why we drive more.""\Mike Allen, who also was making a gas stop at Walmart, said he was driving a lot more five years ago when he lived in Pell City and commuted every day to his job at the Anniston Army Depot. He moved to Saks to cut down on the commute.\""Every penny saved counts,"" Allen said. ""If I'm buying more gas, I'm not buying groceries.""\It's not the working class that has factored most into the decrease in miles, though. Plunk said a younger, more urban population has started to see a shift in preference to public transportation -- a method that eliminates the burden of driving and opens up more free time to use smart phones and other devices.\According to Eddie Wheeler, the general manager of Sunny King Ford in Anniston, marketing suggests that a younger generation isn't buying cars.\""That demographic has pretty much gone away,"" said Wheeler about college-aged students. ""You really don't have first-time buyer programs anymore aimed at college kids. That started to disappear about four or five years ago.""\Baxandall said that's symbolic of a larger trend in the country of what he calls the end of the ""driving boom.""\""For 60 years we saw an increase in driving,"" Baxandall said. ""It used to be part of the American dream was to own your own car. Well, we've reached a peak in that, and now there's a push in the other way by a younger generation that's more environment-conscious.""\But many Alabama 16-year-olds are itching to get on the road, said Anniston resident Erica Brown while stopping to fill her gas tank on Tuesday.\""My kids go to Wellborn High School, and every morning you see kids pull in with their new cars,"" Brown said. ""The second they turn 16, they want a car and get out of here.""\Or, at least get to work. Parashonta Johnson said that while her daughter might think of a new car as freedom, Johnson sees it as a way to make sure she can get herself to work on time at her job at Zaxby's.\""It's a lot of responsibility,"" Johnson said. ""She needs that job, so she needs a car."""
24,"WASHINGTON -- Congress' failure to pass a long-term highway bill is especially damaging to Southern states, where the federal government pays for most road construction and where populations are growing, U.S. Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx said this week.\Congress also has done nothing to address declining gas tax revenues, forcing states to scramble for cash to maintain roads and bridges and, in some cases, to delay major new expansion projects.\""It breaks my heart because in places like Mississippi and Alabama down there in the Deep South, you've got good people trying to work hard and do the right thing, and in some cases they just can't get from A to B -- and that should not be in the 21st century,"" Foxx told the Montgomery Advertiser and other USA Today reporters on Wednesday. ""We're a better country than that.""\Foxx urged Congress to pass at least a four-year highway bill to give state transportation officials some assurances about how much money they can expect from the federal government over several years.\States get about $40 billion a year from the federal Highway Trust Fund -- a formula determines the exact amount for each state -- to pay for road and bridge work. The federal dollars cover about 78 percent of the cost of new road construction projects in Alabama, while the state chips in about 22 percent, according to federal transportation officials.\For the past six years, federal transportation programs have lurched from one short-term authorizing bill to the next -- a total of 28 times, Foxx said. At the same time, increasingly fuel-efficient cars mean there are fewer dollars available through the federal gasoline tax.\""Because of that uncertainty ... folks are saying, 'How can I plan a program of work over a period of years when I have months of funding?'"" Foxx said.\Alabama focuses on road maintenance\In Alabama, state transportation officials have scaled down plans for long-term construction work and are instead focused on maintaining existing roads.\""The impact of that is spread all over the state,"" said Tony Harris, a spokesman for the state Department of Transportation. ""We recognized about two years ago that we had about $4 billion in project development and new construction needs, and we cut that to reflect our actual funding levels of about $1.5 billion for new projects over a 10-year period.""\Foxx said states shouldn't have to choose between fixing existing roadways and expanding them.\Alabama has about 101,000 miles of public roads, and federal transportation officials estimate that 19 percent of them are in poor condition and 22 percent of the state's bridges are deficient or obsolete.

25,"President J. Cameron West says new roles will let him raise money for the college\An administrative shakeup at Huntingdon College that becomes effective June 1 is designed to shift the president's duties more prominently to raising money and to make students' educational experience more well-rounded.\Key features of the restructuring, first announced by President J. Cameron West in February, include the creation of provost, vice provost and other top positions.\""My job is to raise money, and these people can help run the college,"" West said. ""This will allow us to be true to our mission. This frees me up to take time to interpret the college's mission.""\Frank Montecalvo -- students call him Dean Frank -- has been selected as the school's first provost. He will oversee Glen Cobb, the vice provost for academic affairs and dean of faculty; Richard Jones, the dean of students; Christy MeHaffey, the director of admissions;\and Buzz Philips, the athletic director. Montecalvo, along with Jay Dorman, vice president for business and finance, and Mark LaBranch, vice president for institutional advancement and church relations, will report directly to West. A search committee chose each of the new administrators. The structure, West said, is designed to give him the time to raise funds and improve relations with the United Methodist Church. Two Huntingdon administrators were reassigned in the restructuring. Terry Haines, the vice president for government, corporate and foundation relations, has been reassigned as vice president for extended education and dean of the school for professional studies. Doug McGinty, who has held the position of vice president of academic affairs and dean of the college for almost a year, will return to the faculty as a full-time biology professor June 1. Montecalvo has served as Huntingdon's dean of students for the past five years. He said the provost position will allow him to more effectively contribute to students' well-being on campus. ""Everything we do will go to support the outcome of the classroom,"" he said. ""I don't know too many places in this country that would jump at this model that have the characteristics that are important to me private education and church related. It's a great time to be at Huntingdon."" Montecalvo's job is to connect the different kinds of learning available to students at Huntingdon academics, athletics, religious and social. By overseeing the managers of each of these ""spheres of learning,"" students will benefit from a better-connected learning environment, the provost said. Cobb, the vice provost for academic affairs and dean of faculty, comes to Huntingdon after more than 20 years of service in the Air Force. His most recent assignment was vice president and vice commander for the Community College of the Air Force at Maxwell-Gunter Air Force Base. Reaching out to the college's faculty is Cobb's first task, he said. ""I have to establish strong and trusting relationships with the faculty,"" he said. ""I need to make sure they have a clear understanding of the academic role of this organization's structure and reassure them of the academic mission."" Cobb said his long-term goal was never to enter the world of private education, but now as vice provost at Huntingdon, he feelswell-equipped to continue his life of service. ""I knew at some capacity I would live another life of service,"" he said. ""Every morning, consistently through my entire career, what gets me charged up is the idea of going out and being a service to my community and my nation. This was a logical extension."" Jones, the dean of students, came to Huntingdon in January and has experience in student affairs at several other universities. He is Huntingdon's first black dean, but said that isn't the reason he took the job. ""If I am a trailblazer, I want it to be because of the contributions I make. I want the path to be clear so that a person of any ethnicity can come into the position and be appreciated not for color, but for the gifts of the mind and the heart that they bring,"" he said. Montecalvo said the college's students can expect to get more out of their Huntingdon education when they return to campus in three months. With the various aspects of college life now connected, the experience will be more well-rounded and more beneficial. ""We will now be managing this learning environment to have the highest yield,"" he said. ""This is a focus on the primary objective achieve a degree.""\FINANCIAL STATUS\When the Elmore County Commission took over in 2000, the county was $750,000 in debt and already had spent the Highway Department funds for the year.

26,"washington -- Congress returns Tuesday for a four-week legislative sprint to confront a number of domestic and foreign policy matters before lawmakers adjourn for the annual August break.\A long-delayed transportation bill will take top billing with a July 31 deadline looming on how to keep funding flowing to the nation's highways and other infrastructure projects.\The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee recently approved a six-year highway bill, but how to pay for it remains a significant hurdle. Many lawmakers, mostly Democrats, want to pay for it in part by raising the gas tax, which has remained at 18.4 cents per gallon since 1993. But that's a non-starter for the GOP-controlled Congress. There is also a bipartisan effort afoot to raise revenues by raising taxes on profits U.S. companies earn overseas.\The highway bill is also expected to become a vehicle for a fight over whether to reauthorize the Export Import Bank of the United States, the nation's official export credit agency, whose charter expired on July 1.\The House and Senate are scheduled to take up a six-year reauthorization of the federal education law overseeing elementary and secondary education.\The Senate may try again to take up legislation overhauling the nation's cyber-security laws after an attempt to add it to a defense bill last month failed.\Congress may also be thrust into the ongoing international talks to get Iran to abandon its nuclear ambitions if the six world powers negotiating the deal strike a final agreement this month.\Then, of course, there are the 12 annual spending bills that fund the federal government. The House is nearing completion of its work, but Senate Democrats are blocking appropriations bills from moving in the Senate in order to force larger budget talks to set new spending levels for defense and domestic programs."
27,"A delay in funding for highway construction could cost billions\By Ledyard King Gannett News Service\WASHINGTON -- Congress will miss its Tuesday deadline to enact a massive highway and transit funding bill, a delay that states say could cost 90,000 people their jobs and billions of dollars in extra construction costs because of delays.\Lawmakers are moving to extend the current funding program several months while they wrangle over whether to raise the 18.4-cents per gallon gas tax to pay for a significant increase in highway aid.\""This is not our proudest moment,"" said Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee that unanimously endorsed a five-month extension last Tuesday. ""Our failure to pass a highway bill is a disservice to the American people.""\Capitol Hill's inability to reach consensus on a road bill is not new. Disagreement over details delayed approval of the current six-year program by nearly nine months. That forced states such as Georgia, Missouri and South Dakota to slow down construction projects.\This year's extension would provide states with roughly $17 billion for road and transit projects over the next six months, slightly more than they got during the same period a year ago.\But cautious state officials already have begun to put long-term projects on hold because they're not sure what Washington's commitment will be.\Federal highway and transit aid programs usually run six years, giving states time to plan for replacing bridges, widening roads and expanding public transit.\""A short-term extension is like a temporary job,"" explained Bill Buff, spokesman for the American Highway Users Alliance representing truckers to auto makers. ""You manage to pay the rent and buy the groceries, but you're not going to start making any major home improvements.""\Even a five- or six-month extension, as Congress is discussing, is going to cost, according to a survey conducted by the group that represents state transportation agencies. A survey released this month by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials found that states predicted at least $2.1 billion in increased costs because of delays and the loss of 90,000 construction-related jobs if a new highway funding bill were delayed for several months.\Delays hit northern states hardest because they have shorter construction seasons.\Among the survey's findings:\Idaho would have to delay some highway projects by as much as a year because of environmental conditions and rules that allow construction only during certain seasons.\Tennessee, Michigan and other states say the delay significantly could increase construction costs because the initial fall-off in work would drive some companies out of business and lead to less-competitive bidding for future projects.\New Jersey Transportation Commissioner Jack Lettiere said his state is bracing for the effects of Congress' failure to meet the deadline.\Contracts normally awarded this fall won't be let until the spring -- assuming Washington passes a six-year bill by then. That probably will force delays of up to a year because construction schedules could extend into winter, when little work takes place.\It costs extra to tie up contractors and their equipment over the winter, Lettiere said. Permits might expire, forcing more reviews of already approved work.\""It has a whole series of fiscal side effects that sometimes Congress doesn't consider,"" said Lettierre, who remembers the delays from the last stalled highway bill. ""Last time, it wasn't pretty. I had projects delayed. I was transferring money all over the place. I had to make deals where contractors would agree to (delayed) payments. It wasn't a good way to do business.""\Some states aren't as worried, considering lawmakers appear ready to give states a little more as part of a temporary fix while they forge a long-term bill.\""We look at it as pretty much inevitable now,"" said Laurie Maudlin, federal liaison for the Indiana Department of Transportation. ""We hope Congress will take those six months to make it the best bill possible. If an extension goes further than that, you really do see an impact."""
28,"29 days.\That's how much later Alabama's primaries are than Iowa's first-in-the-nation caucuses on Feb. 1, 2016. And that's why most presidential candidates are going out of their way to keep Iowa's special interests happy, even if it hurts hard-working Alabamians in the process.\One issue in particular stands out: the Renewable Fuel Standard. The RFS is a 2005 federal mandate that requires fuel refiners to blend biofuels -- primarily corn-based ethanol -- into gasoline.\It's a big deal in Iowa, which produces much of the ethanol the rest of us are forced to use, despite higher costs and dubious benefits.\The RFS amounts to a regressive gas tax. It harms low- and middle-class families in Alabama and across the country by driving up the cost of gasoline and pushing down total miles per gallon. And despite its intentions, it actually harms the environment.\Consider the RFS' effect on gas prices. The Congressional Budget Office recently estimated the RFS could raise prices at the pump by 13 to 27 cents per gallon by 2017, and diesel by 30 to 51 cents. With Alabama gas prices averaging around $2.54 per gallon today, the RFS could raise them by close to 10 percent or more.\This comes at a bad time for Alabamians. Affordable gasoline has offered a lifeline to households currently struggling to make ends meet, providing the equivalent of a $700 tax cut per family since last June. The RFS will reverse this much-needed reprieve.\Making matters worse is that ethanol has a lower fuel economy than gasoline. So as the RFS requires increasingly more ethanol to be blended into your gas, it decreases the distance each gallon will take you. The result is more trips to the gas station and less money in your pocket.\And while the RFS was passed on promises that it would be environmentally friendly, in practice it has been anything but. When factoring in the additional farming and refining ethanol requires, the World Resources Institute found that it does more harm than good.\Which begs the question: If the RFS is all pain and no gain, why would presidential candidates support it? Perhaps because Iowa's presidential caucuses, the first in the nation, come well before Alabama's primaries--which supposedly makes their interests more important than ours.\The ethanol special interests in Iowa and Washington, D.C. are already betting the farm to keep the RFS alive. Lobbyists at the Renewable Fuels Association recently launched a multi-million PR campaign they described as ""the most aggressive issue advocacy effort people have ever seen in the history of the Iowa caucuses."" Their goal? To get White House hopefuls to support the RFS by dangling Iowa's votes.\Of course, Congress could easily take this issue off the table by repealing the Renewable Fuel Standard on its own. Half measures, such as legislation to repeal only the corn mandate, would make America's energy policy resemble California's, where gas prices are far and away the highest in the nation.\Americans may wish we had California's sunshine, but we don't need their high gas prices. The only acceptable solution is to repeal the mandate entirely. U.S. Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va. has already introduced legislation that would do just that. Alabamians should encourage their Members of Congress to join him in passing it without delay.\Meanwhile, instead of focusing on how to get votes in just one state, presidential candidates should focus on what's good for the whole country. With the primaries and caucuses still nine months away, there's plenty of time to make sure the RFS gets the national attention it deserves. Opposing it should be an easy decision for principled candidates who side with American families over special interests.\Charles Drevna is a Distinguished Senior Fellow at the American Energy Alliance.\COLUMN Charles Drevna"
29,"In February, Alabama legislators anticipated passing two of the largest budgets in state history, budgets that in real terms would bring spending on education and services to where they were before the downturn caused by the Great Recession.\The coronavirus pandemic has put that in doubt.\""I'm prepared to throw a yellow flag on anybody at this point,"" said Senate Finance and Taxation General Fund chair Greg Albritton, R-Atmore, on Thursday. ""I know everything needs to be taken a look at holistically. And we're going to that.""\Officials and legislators said in separate interviews Thursday they do not anticipate cuts to the current year's budget, which runs through September 30. They also said it was still too early to determine the full effect of COVID-19 on next year's budgets. But they also acknowledged the damage the outbreak is doing to the state and national economy could require a cold, hard look at current budget plans, with potential impacts for classrooms and state services.\""It could very well affect what we're planning next year,"" House Ways and Means General Fund chair Steve Clouse, R-Ozark, said. ""It could very well affect that budget.""\Alabama has two budgets: The Education Trust Fund (ETF), which pays for education in the state, and the General Fund, which provides money for other state services. State agencies, most notably Medicaid, also get federal funding.\A downturn would harm both budgets. The $7.1 billion ETF gets about 63% of its revenue from state income taxes, and about 28% from sales taxes, according to the Legislative Services Agency. Both are growth revenues that are sensitive to economic conditions.\The Great Recession ravaged income and sales tax receipts. Despite steady growth in Alabama's economy, the budgets are only starting to return to pre-recession levels. Gov. Kay Ivey's proposed $7.5 billion ETF for fiscal year 2021 – which begins Oct. 1 — would be the largest in real terms since 2008.\An economic slowdown could undo that progress with lightning speed. There are already troubling signs. The Alabama Department of Labor reported on Wednesday it had received 3,867 claims for unemployment benefits since Monday, more than double what it received in the same period last week.\Kelly Butler, the state Director of Finance, said in a statement Thursday that the office was continuing to watch revenue streams, though he said right now they were not planning for the chances of cuts to the current year's budget.\""Although the full impact on the economy is yet to be seen, at this time we do not anticipate proration in the General Fund or Education Trust Fund for FY2020,"" the statement said. ""It is possible that the FY2021 budgets will need to be adjusted downward.""\House Speaker Mac McCutcheon, R-Monrovia, said in a statement Thursday he believed revenue caps implemented in the 2011 Rolling Reserve Act could ""protect state finances during events like this.""\""I expect our budgets to remain in good shape in the short run, but in this unpredictable environment, only time will tell how they will be affected in the long term,"" the statement said.\The $2.2 billion General Fund, which gets revenue from about three dozen sources, has fewer growth revenues. But Clouse said it isn't immune to an economic downturn. Insurance premium tax receipts, for example, are likely to fall in a downturn. The budget will also see less revenue from interest payments as the Federal Reserve tries to stimulate the economy.\""Interest rates have gone to zero, that will affect us,"" Clouse said. ""With oil prices going so low, that will affect the amount going to the oil and gas tax fund. It's just a whole domino effect there.""\Both budgets have several ambitious items this year, including pay raises for teachers and state employees; increased corrections spending to address the violence and overcrowding in state prisons; and an initiative to improve access to mental health care.\Legislators running the budgets said nothing had been decided on that front.\""We may delay taking up the budget in order to answer as many of these questions as possible, as we make informed decisions about education funding,"" said House Ways and Means Education committee chair Bill Poole, R-Tuscaloosa. ""We obviously don't have data at this point to rely upon.""\Contact Montgomery Advertiser reporter Brian Lyman at 334-240-0185 or blyman@gannett.com.\CREDIT: Brian Lyman"
30,"For at least 30 years, the conservative mantra has been ""no new taxes."" No exceptions: to shrink government, deny it revenue. ""Starve the Beast"" is a ""take-no prisoners"" rallying cry that distracts from the different roles that various types of taxes play; particularly, the way they raise revenue and the way they affect incentives.\Consequently, it does not matter to no-new-taxers whether the tax that is cut is an income tax, a sales tax, a property tax or some other form of taxation. Their objective is the same: Oppose all tax increases and cut every existing tax whenever the opportunity arises.\In fact, different types of taxes have very different impacts on the economy. Consider the different impacts imposed by income taxes versus user charges: While both raise government revenues and shift purchasing power to government, they impose markedly different incentives on the people who pay them. The income tax does not change the relative prices of the goods and services that we buy, while the user charge does.\User charges are levied on purchases of specific goods and services; they induce buyers to shift their purchases away from the taxed good or service toward other goods and services. For example, a tax levied on the purchase of cigarettes helps to discourage smoking. It incentivizes health benefits while raising revenue. Similarly, because the gas tax requires motorists to pay for what they use, this ""user tax"" will encourage motorists to be more efficient in their road usage.\User charges embody another conservative principle: People should pay for what they use or for the damage they inflict. When the users of a public service can be identified and their individual usage measured, we have the necessary preconditions for the implementation of user charges. Such is the case for water consumption, airport landing fees, and the emission of sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide and methane. By contrast, user charges are a poor choice for financing police protection or homeland security since the amount of these services that an individual enjoys cannot be easily measured.\To be profitable enough to remain in the market, the price of the goods and services being sold to the consumer must include all directly incurred costs plus a reasonable rate of return on the seller's investment. If a firm should pollute the environment in the process of bringing its goods to market, they impose costs on society that that will not be reimbursed unless a user tax is imposed. These costs are referred to as ""external"" costs and are not added to the price. Because they are ignored, the market will underprice and over produce the goods. To correct for the inefficiently low price, economists recommend user taxes be added to the price.\Let's look at some examples. For decades we have been warned that water, the most vital resource, will be in short supply in our lifetime. The usual response to water ""shortages"" is to go get more and then underprice it. We build gigantically expensive pipelines, dams, reservoirs and desalination plants. Still, water remains in increasingly short supply in many major populated areas of this country. If the signs of a shortage were taken more seriously, water prices would have gone up, encouraging a reduction in the amount used and a much earlier installation of water-conserving equipment.\In the same way, in the absence of a carbon tax, polluters will tend to underprice and over-produce goods that generate external costs. So, for example, when a coal-fired power plant generates both beneficial electricity and detrimental carbon emissions, the market provides an incentive to sell the benefit but ignore the harm. Rather than accept the environmental harm, a carbon tax on major polluters incentivizes reduction in the harm while generating revenue that can be used to finance any number of public initiatives.\If we are to return to robust economic growth in this country, we have to invest in our public infrastructure - bridges, roads, school buildings and broadband. Somehow all of this must be paid for. At present, we are at a standstill because so many politicians, believing that they gain conservative bone fides by opposing taxes, are unwilling to support public investments. A greater understanding of well-targeted user charges might dislodge them from their position that is so clearly damaging the economic well-being of the nation.\William L.

Kroncke, PhD, is retired Professor of Finance and Business School Dean at several universities, including Auburn University."
31,"There was nowhere to go but up after the Alabama Democratic Party's dismal performance in the 2014 state elections.\Heading into Tuesday's primaries, Democrats have far more candidates on the ballot than they did four years ago, and unlike 2014, they can point to a recent victory: Doug Jones' victory in December's special U.S. Senate election, the first statewide victory for the party in nearly a decade and its first victory in a U.S. Senate race in Alabama in 25 years.\But it's still to be determined whether the party, once so dominant in Alabama, can translate that victory and newfound enthusiasm into more statewide victories.

Some funds would go toward bridging the gaps for Pell Grants for college education. Cobb also supports an increase in the gas tax — which has not been raised since 1992 — to pay for needed improvements to roads and bridges in the state. She supports Medicaid expansion, though she says the state will have to do ""a variety of things"" to find matching funds, and wants much greater state investments in ensuring clean drinking water.

He is critical of HB 317 and says he wants to create a ""culture of compliance"" in Montgomery. Christie also wants to use the resources of the office to address violence within state prisons, and says he would generally leave gambling enforcement to local authorities. He believes the state's response to opioids needs to keep focused on the public health component.

32,"Pollution in Alabama is a civil rights issue.\Coal-fired power plants are a major cause of heart and lung disease in the United States, and the pollution has the highest impact on the communities living near the plants -- primarily communities of color. At the same time, these communities reap few of the economic benefits from the energy sector.\The NAACP recently released a report titled ""Just Energy Policies: Reducing Pollution and Creating Jobs,"" which examined the inequity in both the incidence of disease and the economic burden for these communities. Alabama ranked as one of the three worst states in the nation for clean and equitable energy.\A big part of the problem is that Alabama offers almost no state standards on energy production. Still, what we lack in progress we make up for in potential. Just as timber, water and soil made Alabama an exciting destination for westward-bound settlers in the 19th century, Alabama has the potential to lead another revolution into uncharted territory with its abundant natural resources: solar, wind and geothermal energy.\Alabama ranked sixth among 50 states in net electricity generation from renewable energy resources in 2010. With more investment in green projects -- like the two wind farms that Pioneer Green Energy has planned in Cherokee and Etowah counties -- we can replace dirty energy with clean renewable fuels, saving lives, dollars and the environment.\In order to encourage this type of investment, the NAACP recommends a program of ""25 by 25"": every state should mandate that 25 percent of energy comes from renewable sources by 2025. That includes solar power, wind and geothermal sources, which together can offset the damage from fossil fuels. We also recommend that every state, including Alabama, set a goal of reducing retail electricity sales by two percent each year and encourage consumers to sell back excess electricity through net metering standards.\This is not a pipe dream. California has a mandatory renewable portfolio standard of 30 percent by 2020, and Kansas has approved a 20 percent standard over the next seven years. Just next door, Louisiana has introduced net metering standards to encourage its residents to contribute to the green revolution. Alabama needs to follow in their footsteps.\As our state moves toward a 21st-century green economy, we also must encourage equal access to green jobs. According to a 2010 study, African-Americans spent $41 billion on energy in 2009, but only held 1.1 percent of energy jobs and only gained .01 percent of the revenue from the energy sector profits. Alabama should pass a ""Local Hire Provision"" that ensures that tax dollars from green energy projects are reinvested back into the local economy and that they provide jobs to people who live near where they work.\Clean and equitable energy is America's future, and it could be Alabama's future. But we have to want it first.\Benard Simelton is president of the NAACP Alabama State Conference.

33,"By Lance Brown\A renewable energy proposal in Washington, if passed into law, could have a major impact on jobs and electricity rates in Alabama. The proposal creates a national Renewable Portfolio Standard that would require all states to produce 20 percent of their electricity from renewable sources by 2021. Renewable energy generation would have to begin immediately.\A national standard for renewable energy might sound good on the surface, but when you look at our options for meeting the standard, you realize that states like Alabama and others across the Southeast really suffer compared to other places.\My organization, the Partnership for Affordable Clean Energy, is a coalition of the state's manufacturers, workers, small businesses and consumer advocates. We estimate that the proposal could cost Alabama electricity ratepayers as much as $380 million per year, if not more.\Under the current proposal, Alabama power producers would have to generate almost 13 million megawatt-hours from renewable sources like solar, wind and biomass (organic materials such as wood).\The current RPS proposal, sponsored by Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., would not allow states to count power generated by existing hydroelectric plants toward the new standard. Why is that important? Hydroelectric power is one of the Southeast's most plentiful renewable sources of energy.\In fact, Alabama ranks fifth in the nation in hydroelectric generation, producing more than 5 million megawatt-hours from hydroelectricity last year. That provision of Bingaman's proposal alone would cost Alabama electricity ratepayers about $137 million per year, and will cost the Southeast about $700 million annually.\In short, the Bingaman proposal requires Alabama to produce 20 percent of its energy from renewable sources, but won't allow us to include our greatest source of renewable energy today -- hydroelectric. The bottom line is that families like yours and mine could soon going to be paying heavy penalties to the government for not meeting this unrealistic standard.\Under the proposal, power producers would pay a 3-cents-per-kilowatt-hour penalty for all power that doesn't meet the national standard. PACE calculates that this ""Alternative Compliance Payment"" would amount to $380 million each year for Alabama. Across the Southeast, the penalty could be as high as $5 billion annually. This sum would be passed through to residential and industrial electricity customers, resulting in higher power bills for everyone.\With hydroelectric not an option, Southern states would have to rely on solar, wind and biomass to meet a 20 percent standard. However, the U.S. Department of Energy reports that very little solar or wind capacity exists in Alabama today. Even U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu recently testified that biomass is the Southeast's only viable option for meeting a renewable energy standard. What does that mean?\Major Alabama industries such as the state's 14 pulp and paper mills currently rely on forest resources for raw materials. These industries support tens of thousands of jobs for Alabamians, not to mention jobs in related forest products industries. Higher demand for forest products, as well as higher prices for raw materials, could force the closure of some of these mills. The same is true across the Southeast, where forest industries thrive.\We need to be looking for the most affordable way to have a clean energy future, one that doesn't cost us jobs and saddle the Southeast with drastically higher electricity prices. We need to ensure that whatever renewable energy policy we enact actually helps the environment here in Alabama, and doesn't simply export our dollars to T. Boone Pickens and the energy giants of the Midwest and West.\But right now, lawmakers don't seem to be headed in that direction. Instead, they are cherry-picking favored energy sources while leaving others out, all to our detriment.\I created PACE because the current energy proposals are not fair to the Southeast, where I live and work. The bottom line is that working families and businesses here don't deserve to pay more under a renewable energy standard, while others pay less. If you agree, I encourage you to sign the PACE Petition at www.energyfairness.org.\Lance Brown is executive director of the Partnership for Affordable Clean Energy, a non-profit organization headquartered in Montgomery."
