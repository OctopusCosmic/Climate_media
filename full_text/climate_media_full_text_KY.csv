2,"LEXINGTON, Ky. -- Democratic U.S. Rep Ben Chandler and Republican attorney Andy Barr highlighted their differences on the cause of the economic recession, cap and trade energy policy and health care reform in a debate Monday night that largely remained free of personal attacks.\The two are running for the 6th Congressional District seat, which encompasses 16 counties in central Kentucky, including the city of Lexington.\Although the two have lobbed negative television ads against each other, the debate on Kentucky Educational Television largely remained free of personal attacks and focused instead on issues that contrast Republicans and Democrats in mid-term congressional races across the country.\""Andy believes apparently that (the recession) was the government's fault,"" Chandler, 51, said. ""I think that we had some greedy people on Wall Street. It seemed to me the Wall Street bankers were a little bit involved with it.""\Political observers say they will watch this race closely as a bellwether on Election Day on Nov. 2 because the seat is in a rural area and is held by a Democrat with some tendencies to vote conservative.\Chandler is the grandson of former Kentucky Gov. A.B. ""Happy"" Chandler, a Democrat, and Barr was an attorney for former Republican Gov. Ernie Fletcher.\Barr, 36, said he believes the recession that began in 2008 was caused by bad government housing policies and was not solved by the federal economic stimulus package.\""It's clearly a breathtaking failure,"" Barr said of the stimulus.\He said unemployment is still at 10 percent in Kentucky, and the country has lost 3 million jobs since the recession began.\Chandler, who voted for the stimulus, said he believes unemployment would be worse without the program.\""Where would we be without the money that came into Kentucky that created Kentucky jobs, that saved Kentucky jobs?"" Chandler asked rhetorically.\Chandler defended his vote for cap and trade energy legislation, which would have limited the amount of carbon emissions industries could release into the environment.\""I think it's extremely important for us to have an energy policy that expands our renewable energy efforts,"" he said. ""We cannot just rely on fossil fuels or any other one source of energy.""\Barr said he believes cap and trade was ""the worst possible piece of legislation that Congress could have passed or could've voted on in the last Congress right in the middle of a huge economic downturn. It is a job-killer.""\On health care reform, Chandler, who voted against the measure, said he would vote to repeal flawed parts, but not the entire law.\He said it includes some positive provisions, such as requiring insurance companies to cover individuals with pre-existing conditions.\Barr said he believes health care reform is unconstitutional and ""exceeds the Congress' power under the Commerce Clause.""\Reporter Stephenie Steitzer can be reached at (502) 875-5136."

St. Louis-based Armstrong Coal Co. has four mines in Ohio and Muhlenberg counties today, employing 437 people mining 3 million to 4 million tons of coal a year.
\
But the company expects to increase employment to between 600 and 700 people next year and between 800 and 900 by 2012, Kenny Armstrong, the company's vice president for operations, told the Green River Area Development District's board of directors Thursday.
\
It expects to add a fourth mine in Ohio County later this year and a fifth by the end of next year. Armstrong has one mine in Muhlenberg County.
\
Coal shipments should increase to 5 million tons by the end of this year, Armstrong said, and 7.8 million tons by the end of 2010.
\
Armstrong eventually plans to ship 10 million to 12 million tons of coal a year from its area mines, he said.
\
But a lot of that depends on what happens in Washington with the ""cap-and-trade"" legislation, which is designed to reduce greenhouse gases and promote such things as solar and wind energy.
\
State Rep. Jim Gooch, a Providence Democrat who chairs the House Natural Resources and Environment Committee, said at the meeting at GRADD's office, 3860 U.S. 60 W., that coal is the nation's cheapest source of energy but admits more carbons than other forms.
\
If cap-and-trade legislation clears the U.S. Senate, he said, Kentuckians will see a significant increase in the cost of electricity and a loss of jobs in the steel and aluminum industries.
\
President Barack Obama has that the legislation would raise the average family's utility bill by only about the cost of a postage stamp - 44 cents - each day. That's about $160 a year.
\
Gooch said some critics have said the average family may spend an extra $3,000 a year on utilities if the legislation passes.
\
He said Kentuckians now see some of the lowest rates in the country because 95 percent of the state's electricity comes from coal-fired plants.
\
""We don't have hydro, wind, solar or nuclear energy in this state,"" Gooch said. ""The increase in Kentucky will be three times the national average. We'll be one of the three or four states hardest hit by this.""
\
Kentucky has 30 percent of the nation's stainless steel production, he said, and between 30 and 40 percent of the aluminum production.
\
""Those plants will go overseas if we lose our cheap electricity,"" Gooch said. ""We're not going to be able to take advantage of solar and wind energy in this state.""
\
Allen said Armstrong has 39,000 acres and 450 million tons of coal reserves in western Kentucky.
\
He said the nation's first clean-air act was passed in 1976 to prevent ""another ice age within 50 years.""
\
Now, he said, scientists are worried about global warming.
\
""The polar ice cap is melting,"" Allen said. ""But we need to keep the lights and air conditioning running. Cap-and-trade is premature. There has to be some method that works to keep using coal.""
\
The world has used coal for energy since the 1500s, he said.
\
""Over 50 percent of our nation's energy comes from coal,"" Allen said. ""We're totally dependent on energy. We can't even go to the bathroom without energy.""
\
The Illinois Basin, which includes western Kentucky, is second only to Montana in coal reserves, he said.
\
Allen said coal is already cleaner than it was 30 years ago.
\
""Since 1976, coal use is up 300 percent,"" he said, ""but emissions are down 50 percent. We're smart enough to use it in environmentally friendly ways. We've got to step up to the challenge.""
\
Allen said Armstrong's mines ship to Louisville Gas & Electric, Owensboro Municipal Utilities, East Kentucky Power Cooperative, Alcoa and the Tennessee Valley Authority.

4,"As the BP oil disaster poisons the waters off the states where many of them live, Southern Baptists are issuing their most sweeping call ever for something they have long distrusted -- government regulation of the environment.\And a Louisville seminary dean who helped push through that resolution says the catastrophe has the potential to galvanize conservative evangelicals just like the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion.\""In many ways, this ecological catastrophe can provide the exact same awakening for evangelicals,"" said Russsell Moore, dean of the School of Theology at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary and chairman of the resolutions committee at last week's meeting of the Southern Baptist Convention in Orlando, Fla.\In the resolution, passed overwhelmingly, the nation's largest Protestant denomination, with 16 million members, called on ""governing authorities to act ... with undeterred resolve to end this crisis.""\It also called on them ""to fortify our coastal defenses; to ensure full corporate accountability for damages, clean-up, and restoration; to ensure that government and private industry are not again caught without planning for such possibilities; and to promote future energy policies based on prudence, conservation, accountability, and safety.""\Catholic bishops and more moderate and liberal Protestant denominations have for years made strong calls for government environmental regulation. Many evangelicals have joined them in recent years, including some individual Southern Baptists.\But as a group, the Southern Baptist denomination has emphasized good private stewardship of the environment, rather than government regulation. In 2006, it charged that some unspecified government policy proposals were based on disputed claims of ""extremist"" and ""neo-pagan"" environmental groups.\Moore himself influenced a 2007 resolution that cast doubt on the ability of proposed carbon-emissions regulations to stop global warming.\Moore -- the top academic officer for the seminary under its president, Albert Mohler -- said he stands by that view, adding that it's difficult to determine how such regulations will affect climate change.\But he acknowledges his thinking was profoundly changed during a recent trip to his native Biloxi, Miss. And he said it's no coincidence that many Southern Baptists -- who live in large numbers along the Gulf Coast -- are taking the disaster personally.\Moore said in an interview that he saw an ""entire community numb"" in Biloxi, with family oyster-harvesting businesses in peril.\""When a hurricane comes through, everyone is apprehensive,"" but it's over soon enough and people can rebuild, Moore said. But the spill has no end in sight.\""There's simply this sense of waiting for apocalypse,"" he said.\Evangelicals who have called for more environmental activism say they are surprised and pleased with the Baptists' actions.\Moore has proven ""you don't have to compromise your core beliefs as a conservative or as a Christian to be an environmentalist,"" said Jonathan Merritt, a Southern Baptist author of the book ""Green Like God.""\""My hope is if this kind of transformation can happen with a conservative dean at one of the most conservative seminaries in the United States, then this type of experience can easily happen in the churches and pews and universities ... in even the most conservative places in the United States.""\Moore said his argument is a conservative one -- that God ordained governments to restrain evil done by sinful humans. He denounced as ""outrageous"" the apology by U.S. Rep. Joe Barton to BP for the Obama administration's actions, and called talk-show titan Rush Limbaugh's defense of Barton ""reprehensible.""\""The Gulf of Mexico catastrophe shows us the failure of both private industry to do what it is right, and government to exercise oversight,"" he said. ""Regardless of what one thinks about the proper size of government, surely we can all agree that the law ought to ensure that corporations don't defraud or harm the populace.""\Robert Parham -- executive director of the Nashville-based Baptist Center for Ethics and longtime critic of the Southern Baptists' conservative leadership -- said the latest resolution marks a pivot away from the denomination's ""faithfulness to the political right.""\A Gallup survey in late May, a month after the Deepwater Horizon explosion, found 55 percent of Americans said environmental protection should take priority over energy production. That compared to 50 percent before the disaster.\A Pew Research Center survey in mid-June found more support for environmental protection than low gas prices among Americans overall and among Democrats and independents -- while more Republicans put a priority on low prices.\Richard Land, the Southern Baptists' chief lobbyist, said he agrees with the Southern Baptist resolution but cautioned against reading it as offering too much support for the government\Land -- who in a radio broadcast emphasized the Obama administration and environmentalists' opposition to drilling in land reserves and shallower seas -- also faulted BP in a follow-up interview. He said many Gulf residents are angry at government failures before and after the Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion.\""This is yet another blow to confidence in federal competence,"" said Land, president of the convention's Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission.\He added that any proposed support for a cap-and-trade policy on carbon fuels would have been ""smashed"" on the convention floor. ""This does not mean we've been converted to supporters of Al Gore,"" he said.\Even if Baptist leaders wanted to guide their members' environmental views, they're working in an era of declining denominational influence, said Mark Silk, director of the Leonard Greenberg Center for the Study of Religion in Public Life at Trinity College in Connecticut.\""It may be that they're following rather than leading"" a trend among their grassroots, Silk added.\Reporter Peter Smith can be reached at (502) 582-4469.\On the Web\Read the full resolution at www.courier-journal.com."
5,"The 40-year distance by the religious right from protection of the environment was changed in part recently by the Southern Baptist Convention resolution to encourage government to be involved even more in regulating pollution. Alas, there is still a faction, as represented by a letter writer in the Courier-Journal Forum (Sunday, June 27), still railing against ""environmental extremists.""\The letter-writer cited at least 10 factual errors, resulting in at least 10 erroneous conclusions.\The United States does not have five times more oil reserves than Saudi Arabia. This country's oil extraction peaked several decades ago because all of the low-hanging fruit has been plucked. Only the hard-to-reach petroleum in pristine areas (the Arctic) and deep in the ocean (the Gulf of Mexico) remains. Environmentalists have not chased them there.\Nor did environmentalists stop the American nuclear industry. They may have delayed it, but the Three Mile Island accident in Pennsylvania and the Chernobyl disaster in Ukraine combined with the high construction costs of atomic electrical power to halt the industry. It was mainly an economic decision.\Environmentalists also did not shut down farming in the West. The lack of water did. In the northern Great Plains, the once-gigantic Ogallala water reservoir keeps sinking to depths that prove too expensive to drill. Also, streams such as the Colorado River have become so overused that sometimes no water ever reaches the Pacific Ocean at the mouth.\The letter-writer's paranoia on the role of government blinds him to all collective solutions to mainly privately induced problems. His pessimistic view of government flies against the idea that we are the government because we the people elect representatives to give us clean air to breathe, safe water to drink and a habitat allowing wildlife to flourish.\DAVID ROSS STEVENS\Borden, Ind. 47106\Stay out of it\I couldn't help but take note of the Courier-Journal article about Southern Baptists voicing in on the oil spill and the environment. While they are at it, why not endorse cap-and-trade, opposition to oil drilling in the Arctic Wildlife Reserve, opposition to snowmobiling in national parks and other environmental issues? And while you're delving into those, why not endorse the Humane Society and animal rights? And why not chime in on other liberal-agenda issues? Southern Baptists might find better numbers in staying out of politics and sticking to proclaiming the Gospel message of salvation and life in the name of Jesus Christ.\LINDY ROBERTSON, Jr.\Louisville 40220\Save small businesses\As the fifth-generation president and owner of Louisville's oldest company, The Stiglitz Corp. Inc., I find it confusing as to how the Vice President can come to Louisville to talk up the stimulus and how great GE is doing for the local economy while they have caused my business to shut down. They are moving my company's stamping business to Georgia and putting me and 56 dedicated, long-term employees out of work. I am sure the company inGeorgia taking my business feels stimulated, but at what cost?\We have been a dedicated and loyal vendor to GE for more than 40 years, but now we are watching our business loaded onto trucks and sent south, while the city gives GE tax breaks. My company has provided employmentfor untold thousands during our 192 years in this city, and not once have we asked the city to give us anything but a chance to run our business without interference. Never have we received a penny from taxpayers, and now we watch as GE is celebrated while takingtax money and putting Louisville small businesses out of business. Maybe GE will use some of their stimulus money and come to the auction of my assets and help me. They have access to the money, not the small businesses in real need.\DOUGLAS E. STIGLITZ\Louisville 40206\Separate Louisville\Here we go again. In ""Quality of place crucial to city,"" the C-J seeks ways to make Louisville a better place to live, all the while ignoring the dead horse in the living room. Yes, we need more high-skill, high-paying jobs. We also need better roads, a new bridge or two, higher standards for education, etc., but -- as economist Paul Coomes showed several years ago -- Louisville can never be a first-class city so long as the Kentucky state legislature continues to embezzle two-thirds of our tax revenues (that includes both state and federal). The great sucking sound we hear is our money being siphoned off to support the petty bureaucrats who run Kentucky's 120 counties. And let's not forget that the BOPTROT scandal of the early 1990s showed our beloved legislators to be among the most corrupt politicians on planet Earth. It seems that Louisville's only hope for prosperity is to secede from Kentucky. I suggest as our motto: ""Welcome to the State of Louisville -- Solvent at Last.""\JOHN GAMEL\Louisville 40207\Going Gaga\Lady Gaga is a repulsive image that all people of goodwill should strive to avoid. Her most recent pornographic music video, which features highly sexualized images coupled with Catholic religious symbols, betrays her as nothing more than a mediocre Madonna-wannabe. In the video, she squirms around half-naked with half-naked guys while abusing Catholic symbols. It is clear the singer has now become the new poster girl for American decadence and Catholic bashing, which she perversely fobs off to the world as ""creative art.""\When asked in a recent interview by Larry King if she was considering having children some day, she answered ""not right now because it would destroy my creativeness."" She seems oblivious to the fact that there is nothing more creative for a woman than to have a child. Sadly, fame, fortune and false idolatry have become the heartbeat of American culture. These things seem more important to the masses than life itself. But in the end, they are all only illusions that will wither and fade. In the end, ""the first will be last and the last will be first.""\JANINE COLBERT\Louisville 40204"

Time to drop this ""war on coal"" talk. Time to ignore the hollering by coal country politicians over President Obama's beefed-up plan to combat global warming.
\
No, the Clean Power Plan will not ruin their local economies, because coal has already done that, certainly in Appalachia. Look at those barren flats where majestic mountains once stood. The coal industry lopped off the mountaintops and fouled the streams, depriving West Virginia and eastern Kentucky of a key recruiting tool for modern employers prizing a healthy environment.
\
But let's not go overly negative here. Coal did its job. It powered 20th-century America. The Appalachian coal regions gave and gave. We honor their sacrifice.
\
So rather than call the new plan a war on coal, let us call it a retirement party for coal. Coal is the largest source of planet-warming gases. It must make room for 21st-century power.
\
Mother Nature has already offered us a foretaste of what she has in mind should global warming go unchecked. Higher temperatures have worsened drought in the West, igniting large swaths of California, Washington and Oregon.
\
Glacier National Park in northern Montana may sound like a cool, watery place. But tourists there have been abandoning their cars to flee wildfires. The glaciers themselves are melting and may be gone in 30 years.
\
Flooding in other parts of the country is part of the same climate phenomenon.
\
Natural gas emits about half as much carbon as does coal and can transition us to truly clean power. But the future is clearly renewable energy from such sources as the sun and wind.
\
The new rules push us in that direction.
\
They will require utilities to generate at least 28 percent of their electric power from renewable sources by 2030. (Renewables accounted for only 13 percent last year.)
\
This is not mission impossible. In 2011, California mandated that 33 percent of its electricity come from renewable energy sources by 2020. California's economy is booming -- aided no doubt by all that clean-energy venture capital (almost 60 percent of America's total) flowing into the state.
\
Obama's plan promotes a cap-and-trade system. States place a limit on greenhouse gases and let businesses buy and sell permits to emit them. This market-based approach started off as a conservative idea. Do remember that when the opposition rails against the idea as ""cap and tax.""
\
California already has a cap-and-trade system, and 10 other states have followed suit. At least 30 other states also have mandates for renewable energy.
\
Foes will no doubt bash the Clean Power Plan as radical, but the public should know that even these stricter regulations will not save us from global warming. They will only stop a free fall into planetary catastrophe.
\
What about other countries? A reasonable question. The plan will give Obama something serious to unfurl at the climate change summit this December in Paris. When the United States offers a plausible blueprint to meet the challenge, other countries, notably China, will be pressed to follow suit.
\
And what about the coal regions? Appalachia has considerable natural beauty left, a great location and plenty of water. Coal-producing Wyoming has its own attractions, some quite magnificent.
\
Coal is yesterday's fuel. Give it a respectful goodbye and dry the tears.

8,"As President Obama prepared to address the nation about the Gulf oil blowout last week, some in his administration wanted him to use the occasion to push for an energy bill that would put a price on carbon, through a cap-and-trade system much like one that the House narrowly passed last year.\But the president did not do that, apparently heeding his political advisers, who were wary of binding him to an idea he has long favored but one that faces an uphill fight in the Senate and is already causing problems for Democrats in this year's elections -- including some in Kentucky.\That may have been evident in the political posturing of Kentucky's senior senator, Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, in the run-up to Obama's speech. Decrying cap-and-trade, he said Democrats ""want to do something that has absolutely nothing to do with getting the leak stopped and getting the oil cleaned up.""\McConnell even went so far as to accuse Democrats of ""holding the Gulf hostage to a national energy tax,"" which was silly and false. The cap-and-trade debate will have no effect on the short-term fate of the Gulf Coast. But in suggesting that it might, McConnell subtly argues that Obama is mismanaging the situation, and diverts attention from the baggage that Republicans bring to the blowout. (It's far worse than a ""spill,"" the unfortunately accepted nomenclature.)\The blowout is primarily perceived as Obama's problem, but his main point of accountability is getting it cleaned up. Only BP and others in the oil industry can stop the leak. Meanwhile, evidence mounts that the well blew out because BP skimped on safety, with the help of a Minerals Management Service that became a handmaiden to the industry during an administration headed by two oilmen, George W. Bush and Dick Cheney.\For sure, the Obama administration did not bring about enough change at MMS, so the President and Interior Secretary Ken Salazar must share in the blame for the routine MMS approval of BP's corner-cutting. But they focused on cleaning up gross corruption that had given the agency a bad name, not its technical side, which had no such high-profile problems.\As the reasons for the blowout become clearer, they are likely to buttress arguments for stronger environmental regulation of the oil industry, and more federal oversight of business in general, like that in the financial-reform bill nearing final passage.\Since Democrats generally favor regulation and Republicans generally oppose it, McConnell and his party need to change the conversation. That's why they talk about cap-and-trade, which would limit emissions of greenhouse gases that cause global warming and climate change.\Though it now appears that the concept will fall short of the 60 votes needed to pass the Senate, Republicans will keep reminding us of it, calling it ""cap and tax"" because it would raise the cost of energy, especially electricity generated by burning coal.\That's especially true in Kentucky, where 92 percent of the electricity comes from coal. Republicans are already using the issue against Democratic 6th District U.S. Rep. Ben Chandler, whose vote helped pass cap-and-trade in the House, and Democratic Senate nominee Jack Conway, who gave qualified support to the concept before backing away from it a year ago.\Chandler's Republican opponent is Lexington lawyer Andy Barr, who has not been ranked as a major challenger nationally but now claims that his own polling shows him within easy striking distance of the Democrat. Barr's current treatment of the cap-and-trade issue seems more designed to attract money and support from people sympathetic to the coal industry than a broader appeal based on electric rates, but that seems likely to change after the current fund-raising period ends June 30.\Chandler's Bluegrass district has no coal, but is home to many professionals who are affiliated with the industry and support it with political contributions. He has defended the cost of cap-and-trade as a relatively small price to pay for a long-term investment in protecting the global environment, and his district has plenty of voters who are not sympathetic to the coal industry, particularly its mountaintop-removal practices, which he has said should be changed and Barr has defended.\If Barr makes cap-and-trade a big issue against Chandler, that will create problems for Conway, who is already being accused by Republican Senate nominee Rand Paul of supporting the concept -- and had to defend himself against the same argument in the primary with Lt. Gov. Dan Mongiardo (who has yet to endorse Conway). Conway's reservations about the concept were so broad that it's hard to say he actually supported it, but those nuances are likely to be lost on many voters.\While the oil blowout makes a case for stronger regulation of the oil industry, the public has yet to make a strong connection between the blowout, America's hunger for fossil fuels and the need to do something about greenhouse gases and climate change. Obama made those connections in his speech, but didn't specifically endorse cap-and-trade.\Perhaps the president concluded that voters can stand only so much change, especially at a time of economic stress and unhappiness with government in general. McConnell seems to think so, as he appeals to voter frustration and impatience, which begins with the economy and ends with lack of confidence in government, which the blowout exacerbates.\McConnell, as usual, is on the side of political expediency and immediate advantage. The cap-and-trade Democrats are on the side of long-term protection of the environment -- and probably the economy, but this is a time when short-term concerns seem to prevail.\Al Cross, former Courier-Journal political writer, is director of the Institute for Rural Journalism and Community Issues in the School of Journalism and Telecommunications at the University of Kentucky.

9,"The House Energy Committee begins marking up the Waxman-Markey bill addressing climate change this week. This is one of the most important bills of the decade. It is imperative that we get strong, effective legislation if the planet is to remain livable for our children and grandchildren. A strong, comprehensive climate and energy bill must include some key elements:\A cap on global warming pollution that will cut our emissions at least 25 percent by 2020 and 80 percent by 2050.\A renewable electricity standard that requires 25 percent of our electricity to come from renewable sources by 2025.\A 100 percent auction of greenhouse gas emissions allowances. No longer can the air be used as a free trash dump. Polluters must pay.\This legislation will rebuild and renew our economy with millions of new green jobs from investments in clean energy technologies and energy efficiency, and it is an essential step toward fighting global warming. We must all encourage Congress to take this action without watering down the needed provisions, for our economy, and for a livable environment.\WALLACE McMULLEN\Conservation Chairman,\Greater Louisville Sierra Club\Prospect, Ky. 40059\Absolute power\When a government has absolute power over its citizens (in other words, a fascist regime), it might try to impose restrictions and regulation on the populace.\Government impositions might include auto emissions, miles per gallon, cap and trade, banning wood-burning fireplaces, rationing of electricity and natural gas (it's coming), gallons per flush and bankrupting the coal industry, all for the sake of the planet.\Government impositions might also include capping CEO salaries, transferring 55 percent of an auto company to its union and imposing higher taxes on things it does not approve (tobacco, alcohol, successful carriers, etc.), all in the name of fairness.\Such a government might want to nationalize banks, auto industries, health care and the education system, all in the name of taking care of its citizens. Such a government might want to redistribute wealth and give tax dollars to corrupt organizations (ACORN). Such a government might want to free terrorists or move them to U.S. soil, at the same time regulating firearms and ammunition.\Such a government might want to control radio programming while subsidizing sympathetic news print.\And on, and on ...\FRANK FAIN\Crestwood, Ky. 40014\Notre Dame's rights\Notre Dame has the right to invite President Obama to speak.

It's possibly the largest tax increase in U.S. history,"" said Young, an attorney in Paoli who is seeking his first public office. ""It could kill 40,000 Hoosier jobs, increase the price of our most basic bills and also make the environment dirtier.""\The energy bill, which passed the House but stalled in the Senate, was meant to cut the nation's greenhouse gas emissions. It would create a complex system in which the government would cap the total amount of carbon emissions, and companies exceeding their allotment could buy credits from those who were under their caps.\Young and Knott said the proposal would hurt coal-dependent states, including Indiana, raising electric rates and eliminating Hoosier jobs.\But Hill said he worked with other legislators from rural areas to ensure that Indiana and other coal states were better protected than they would have been under the bill as introduced. He said he refused to cast a yes vote without changes.\Hill also countered that the bill actually would produce about 30,000 alternative energy jobs in Indiana, while reducing the nation's carbon footprint and dependence on foreign oil.\""It was a good bill,"" Hill said. ""It wasn't a perfect bill.""\Knott said he would take a different approach, offering companies tax credits for working on renewable forms of energy and for natural gas because it is a domestic fuel.\The environmental issue was one of the questions posed to each of the three candidates during the first half of the two-part forum at the Jasper Art Center.\The candidates first took turns on stage, answering questions from a panel that included Kathy Tretter, publisher of The Ferdinand (Ind.)

12,"SubHead: Environmentalists say rule too weak\Byline: James Bruggers\jbruggers@courier-journal.com\Source: The Courier-Journal\Mercury pollution from the nation's coal-fired power plants is projected to be cut nearly 70 percent over the next 13 years under new federal regulations issued yesterday.\Officials at two major Kentucky and Indiana utility companies said they would have no trouble meeting the new requirements.\But environmentalists and others ridiculed the limits as inadequate to stop mercury poisoning that can cause nerve damage in fetuses and young children. They said the new regulations do not set strict limits for all power plants and allow them too much time to comply.\""At the behest of industry, the Bush administration has just endorsed the continued poisoning of children and pregnant women with mercury,"" said Sen. James Jeffords, I-Vt. ""We will fight it in the courts, we will fight it here in Congress, and we will fight it in statehouses across the nation.""\Under the new mercury regulations, utilities must do no more during the first five years than they already are required to do under another EPA rule issued last week for nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide.\But the new mercury rule would allow a ""cap-and-trade"" approach , one that sets a maximum on how much pollution should be allowed, then lets companies trade within those limits.\Some plants or companies could avoid making cuts, while others could profit by selling their unused pollution allowances.\By 2018, this approach should reduce mercury emissions from the nation's 600 coal-fired power plants from 48 tons a year to 15 tons, the EPA said.\The Clean Air Mercury Rule is the "" first-ever federal rule regulating mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants, (and) the United States is now the first and only country in the world to regulate mercury from coal-fired power plants,"" said Jeffrey Holmstead , the EPA's top air pollution official.\He said it also would ""help to maintain coal as a viable energy source in the United States.""\Risk to health\Exposure to mercury at high levels can harm the brain, heart, kidneys, lungs, and immune systems of people of all ages, according to the EPA, and at high levels in unborn babies and young children, mercury can damage the ability to think and learn.\The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has indicated as many as one in 12 women of childbearing age has unsafe mercury levels.\Dan Riedinger , spokesman for the power industry's Edison Electric Institute, said a cap-and-trade approach is preferable to setting a single deadline for making technology improvements that, once met, gives ""little or no incentive"" to cut more pollution.\But Dr. George Rodgers , a University of Louisville medical school professor of pediatrics and toxicology, said he's concerned that areas with excessive mercury, including Kentucky, will not see enough improvement.\""It's basically a trade-off system"" where utilities can ""buy and sell the rights to pollute,"" he said. ""I think that's a bad system.""\Officials with LG&E Energy and Cinergy in Kentucky and Indiana, which rely heavily on coal to produce electricity, said yesterday that their previously announced efforts to control other pollutants also would reduce their mercury emissions.\""Our preliminary estimates indicate that we're already in compliance with the first phase"" of the EPA's mercury rule, said LG&E spokesman Chip Keeling .\Last week, Keeling said LG&E customers could pay up to 14 cents more a month this year, rising to 32 cents by 2008, to comply with the new rule covering nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide.\The mercury rules won't initially require any additional immediate rate increases, LG&E officials said yesterday.\Spokeswoman Angeline Protogere said that Cinergy has not closely reviewed the new regulations but that it appears $2 billion in pollution controls announced last year will bring about the necessary cuts in mercury emissions.\If regulators approve, Protogere said Cinergy customer s' bills could increase by an average of 3 percent in the next five years to pay for new pollution controls, which include anticipated mercury reductions at its Gallagher plant in New Albany and at its Gibson plant near Princeton.\Regional warnings\Both Kentucky and Indiana have wrestled with high mercury levels in recent years.\Indiana environmental regulators estimate that 54 percent to 64 percent of that state's lake acreage and all of its rivers are covered by fish consumption advisories for mercury.\And Kentucky officials have issued advisories for the possible presence of mercury in fish caught in all of the state's waters.\Moreover, a report on children's health issued last year by the Kentucky Environmental Quality Commission identified 18 lakes where fish had been found to contain elevated concentrations of mercury.\But there has been a debate over how much of the mercury problem in the state's fish is from power plants, which emit about 95 percent of Kentucky's industrial emissions of mercury, said Leslie Cole , executive director of the environmental commission, an advisory body.\The commission last May recommended that state regulators take steps to address mercury pollution, including testing rainwater to see whether it contains mercury from air emissions, improving public education, increasing the monitoring of fish in lakes and rivers, and improving public health surveillance.\Yesterday, officials with the Kentucky Environmental and Public Protection Cabinet said a state mercury task force has been meeting since October and reviewing new ways to reduce mercury contamination and increase public awareness of the danger.\Cabinet Secretary LaJuana S. Wilcher , in a release, said state officials are reviewing the new regulations, but added: ""We need to do everything we can to reduce mercury contamination in the environment, especially where children are at risk.""\Holmstead said most of the mercury that people are exposed to is in seafood from other countries.\That might be true, Cole acknowledged, but she said the idea should be to make the environment in Kentucky as safe as possible and to ""focus on the contribution Kentucky is making to the problem.""\Officials of the Indiana Department of Environmental Management are pleased that the EPA has adopted the mercury rules to address the problem, said Laura Pippenger , agency spokeswoman.\The Associated Press contributed to this story.\INFORMATIONAL GRAPHIC; HOW PEOPLE CAN BE EXPOSED TO MERCURY BY STEVEN REED, THE COURIER-JOURNAL (SEE LIBRARY MICROFILM OR LIBRARY KIOSK PDF PAGES)\MERCURY WARNINGS AT KENTUCKY LAKES\Kentucky environmental officials sampled fish from 27 lakes and reservoirs between 1995 and 2001, and found that two-thirds had fish with elevated levels of mercury in their tissue:\Barren River Reservoir\Buckhorn Lake\Chickasaw Lake\Lake Cumberland\Grayson Lake\Green River Reservoir\Guist Creek Lake\Herrington Lake\Kentucky Lake\Laurel Lake\Long Run Lake\McNeely Lake\Metropolis Lake\Mirror Lake\Nolin River Reservoir\Rough River Reservoir\Taylorsville Lake\Yatesville Lake\FACTS ABOUT MERCURY\Mercury is found naturally in the environment and is in many types of rock, including coal.\Coal-burning power plants account for about 40 percent of all U.S. domestic mercury emissions.\In Kentucky, coal-fired plants contribute about 95 percent of mercury emissions to the air, or about 3,540 pounds in 2002.\Heath effects\High mercury levels can harm the brain, heart, kidneys, lungs and immune system.

I propose we take the necessary steps to incentivize our economy. By lowering taxes, reducing regulations and encouraging innovation, we can reinstill some certainty into a fragile marketplace. We must grow our way out of the recession.\I do not favor tax increases. I believe we must stop all new spending, even for programs that might prove to be popular, in order to get our fiscal house in order. I also fully support extending the Bush tax cuts. If the top bracket is allowed to expire, two-thirds of small businesses will be hit with a tax increase and be forced to make difficult decisions regarding future hiring.\After repealing the damage that has been done, we must seize the opportunity to ensure that constructive solutions to address the health care problems we face are the result of listening to the American people. I have proposed the Hoosier Health Care Plan. A list of 10 cost-effective solutions to health care. My plan is just a start, but lists proposals I believe will reduce costs, increase coverage and retain personal liberties.\Yes and yes. Until commanders tell us it's time for them to go home.\I believe Hoosiers are looking for a balance of policies that reduce our dependence on foreign sources of energy, respect the environment, while remaining cost effective. . Analysis done on the cap-and-trade climate change legislation passed by the House last June would raise electricity prices on Hoosiers $507.92 per household, raise each gallon of gas 70 cents and cost Indiana over 29,000 jobs.\For far too long, members of Congress have been more worried about sending pork back home than getting our nation out of debt.There has long been a lack of wise stewardship of taxpayer money. Hoosiers have every right to be outraged. The longer earmarks continue to clog up the legislative plumbing, the more debt and larger national deficit will be passed on to our children and grandchildren.\Brad Ellsworth (D)\U.S. Senate\There are a number of things we can do to promote job creation around the state, and during my time on the Small Business Committee I've been proud to sponsor legislation to cut red tape for small businesses and lower payroll taxes for employers who hire new workers. If we truly want to create lasting economic security, it starts with a strong manufacturing base here at home.\We need to pass a constitutional amendment requiring Congress to balance the federal budget; something nearly all state and local governments do. You can make a lot of progress balancing the budget by placing hard caps on annual discretionary program spending and sticking to statutory Pay-As-You-Go budget tools to rein in spending.\I supported the legislation because I determined that it would ultimately benefit Hoosiers. Small businesses are already receiving tax breaks to reduce their health care costs, children can no longer be denied coverage for pre-existing conditions, and seniors will see substantial savings on prescription drugs. I will work to determine what parts are working best and what parts need to be tweaked.\We must never forget the seeds of 9/11 were sown in Afghanistan where the Taliban gave safe harbor to al- Qaida. A safe harbor for al-Qaida must never exist again. The goal of President's strategy is sound -- to clear Afghan population centers of insurgents and then to hold, build and transfer these areas to a more stable Afghan government. However, this strategy cannot be open-ended.\As a matter of political philosophy, I believe we must make a stronger investment in cleaner sources of energy. I believe the best way to do that is providing individuals and companies the tools and incentives they need to conserve energy and investing in cleaner, renewable sources. I believe the stimulus bill was a great step in this direction, and we should continue to build on this effort.\I will accept requests from Indiana employers, universities, health care providers, military leaders, local elected officials, nonprofits, and individual Hoosiers, and I will judge each project on how it would benefit Hoosiers, our communities, and our country.\Rebecca Sink-Burris (L)\U.S. Senate\My plan for economic growth is clear and Constitutional:\*Implement the FairTax -- a national sales tax that would replace income and payroll taxes with the same amount of revenue, be fairer for the working poor and make small businesses more able to hire new workers.\*Lower corporate income tax rates for small business only..\I will vote against any tax increase. Slashing spending and starting to pay off debt is going to take a tremendous amount of courage. The good news is there are trillions of dollars of spending that can be cut without making a significant impact in the standard of living of everyday Hoosiers.\As your senator, I will vote to repeal the health care reform bill. I support legislation to allow consumers to buy or not to buy insurance products they wish -- even across state lines, allow taxpayers to deduct the cost of insurance on their IRS filings just like we allow corporations, and provide additional tax savings for those who participate in health savings accounts.\I have always been against the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and to the Bush doctrine of pre-emptive attack. These are wars of choice, profit and politics with no clear positive effect on our nation or Indiana. In fact, the evidence is clear that war abroad makes us less safe at home. The troops should be brought home as immediately as they can safely leave.\I believe the vast majority of emissions-based regulations for power generation and private industry are unnecessary and harmful. I specifically oppose the cap-and-tax scheme because 1) the science behind climate change is in doubt, 2) such legislation would cause dramatic price increases, 3) it would slow innovation in clean coal technology, and 4) it would have no beneficial effect on the environment.\If a request for federal funding conforms to the constitutionally delegated powers of the central government, I will work night and day to secure the monies through any legal means. But I will not vote for any legislation that increases your tax burden or violates Article I Section 8 of the constitution.\Baron P. Hill (D)\U.S. House\I believe targeted investments in local infrastructure and giving tax breaks to first-time homebuyers and working families are having a positive impact on the economy. However, I do not believe our economy can fully thrive until our fiscal structure is sound. I will continue to fight for fiscal reforms, like PAYGO, that will force Congress to make the tough budgeting decisions that Hoosier families make day in and day out.\I would prefer that Congress make the difficult budgeting decisions we need to make.I support a balanced budget to the U.S. Constitution that would require Congress to produce a balanced budget every fiscal year. I am a co-sponsor of legislation that sets concrete goals for deficit reduction and compels Congress to take action in order to meet those goals.\I supported the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act . I believe the long, deliberative and passionate process rendered a fiscally responsible, inclusive and effective final product. The revised reform version covers more uninsured Americans than the respective House and Senate bills, while also reducing the deficit more significantly.\I agree with President Barack Obama's decision to draw down our troop presence in Iraq. And, after visiting with our troops in Afghanistan this past winter, I believe our enhanced focus there is the right strategy. I had serious concerns about adding more troops and spending more money in Afghanistan before seeing for myself that we are making significant strides over there.\I have devoted significant time to crafting a new energy policy for this country - one that protects Hoosier ratepayers while allowing us to use local resources to our advantage. Investing in and developing new energy-efficient technologies would lead to the creation of homegrown, clean-energy jobs that cannot be shipped overseas, and greatly strengthen our economic and national security.\I am fully supportive of, and have been fully compliant with, the earmark reforms this Congress enacted. Such reforms, and a commitment to significantly reduce the number of earmarks, have led to a cut in the cost of earmarks by 50 percent. I am proud of the federal funds I secure for our local projects back home that spur job creation and innovation and assist and improve our local communities.\Greg ""No Bull"" Knott (L)\U.S. House\No answer given.\No answer given.\No answer given.\No answer given.\No answer given.\No answer given.\Todd Young (R)\U.S. House\First, repeal the recent health care legislation and enact common-sense health care reform that actually brings down the cost of health insurance. Second, refrain from passing job-killing ""cap and trade"" energy taxes. Third, reform our tax code and federal regulations so that we reward work, savings and investment and position America to compete globally.\Cut, cut, cut. Then cut some more. Raising taxes would be the worst possible thing we could do in this environment. There are many departments and services that could be streamlined and consolidated for cost savings. Additionally, cracking down on waste and fraud across every federal department will provide significant savings.\Repeal it. Don't trim it around the edges, don't try to fine tune it, just repeal it. I would replace it with market-based solutions that keep medical decisions between the patient and their doctor and remove the government from the insurance business. The two immediate fixes I would support would be to allow for the purchase of insurance across state lines and reforms to our tort and medical malpractice systems.\We should stay in those countries long enough to win. Victory isn't complete in Iraq, but we are a lot closer because of President George Bush and General David Petraeus. Afghanistan is a more complicated situation at this point. I supported President Barack Obama's decision to increase our troop presence in that country and I support the hard work our men and women in uniform are doing.\I do not support the cap-and-trade legislation that will do nothing but increase our energy bills. I do support the United States utilizing our own national resources and developing our own oil reserves. Additionally, I am encouraged by the growth in private efforts to advance research into alternative energy options.\Earmark spending needs to be transparent and significantly limited, and is only permissible when faithful to a specific, enumerated power in our constitution. If Congress cannot achieve that objective, then no earmarks."
14,"Judging by the howls of protests, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's first limits on heat-trapping gases from existing power plants could deal a fatal blow to the economies of coal-dependent states such as Kentucky and Indiana.\""We cannot afford to have rolling blackouts and brownouts that could endanger human lives,"" warns Kentucky state Rep. Jim Gooch, a Providence Democrat who is chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, which deals with mining issues.\But Kentucky and Indiana actually may have a leg up on meeting the proposed regulations on greenhouse gases from power plants, the country's single largest source of carbon pollution. Both states' carbon dioxide emissions already are declining, and the rules were written to take into account their historic reliance on coal and manufacturing.\As a result, some experts are concluding that the EPA's Clean Power Plan unveiled June 2 won't be nearly as onerous as some industries and political leaders suggest, even as state regulators charged with enforcing them and electric utilities are trying to determine their impact.\""The political reality (of coal-dependence) has actually been heard by the agency and has been reflected in the rule,"" said Tim Profeta, a professor and director of the nonpartisan Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy Solutions at Duke University.\Kentucky officials acknowledge the state already may be more than halfway toward achieving its targets under the proposed rules that give states up to 16 years to meet them.\To be sure, the outcry is also about losing coal mining jobs, which already have plummeted in Kentucky from 18,000 in 2011 to 12,000 last year. But the EPA has said it still expects coal to provide 30 percent of the nation's electricity in 2030, down from about 38 percent now.\The EPA also said the rule will create more energy efficiency jobs, while not detailing which states will gain or lose employment.\""The rhetoric we are hearing (from critics) ... is far outpacing reality,"" said Bill Becker, executive director of the National Association of Clean Air Agencies, whose members include state and local air pollution regulators from across the country, including some in Kentucky and Indiana. He said members have not been ""screaming about this rule (or) reacting terribly to it.""\One reason, Becker said, is the EPA made ""an enormous concession"" when it decided to use 2005 as its baseline for seeking an overall 30 percent reduction in climate pollution from the nation's 1,000 fossil fuel power plants.\That allows states to get credit for some carbon dioxide emission reductions that already have occurred, Becker said.\Another reason, he said, is that each state's goals were tailored to their energy and economic circumstances, thus avoiding ""huge heavy lifting"" while still seeking to get ""meaningful"" cuts.\Art Williams, a retired director of the Louisville Metro Air Pollution Control District, took it a step further:\There is a ""plausible argument"" that even if the EPA rule were not put in place, the states and nation would meet the goals through already occurring changes in the energy sector of the nation's economy.\Coal is getting more expensive, natural gas has become cheaper, and such renewable forms of energy as wind and solar are also competing better, said Williams.\""You have to wonder how much this rule is really going to affect the marketplace,"" he said. ""My guess is not as much as all the wailing and gnashing of teeth. We may be a hair away from that victory over a 16-year period, even in Kentucky,"" he said.\Indiana is also making headway.\""There are things that Indiana is doing today or will be doing in the next few years, in terms of retrofitting of coal plants to burning natural gas, that will move us in that direction,"" said Douglas J. Gotham of the State Utility Forecasting Group, a state funded Purdue University research group. ""How far it moves us, I don't know.""\Modern natural gas plants produce about half as much carbon dioxide as coal plants.\'War on coal'\Still, the rules have been very controversial in Kentucky and Indiana, where a ""war on coal"" battle cry has been sounded by Republicans and Democrats alike.\Republican Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, for instance, has called the regulations ""devastating for Hoosier workers and families.""\U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, described the EPA's action as a ""dagger to the heart of the American middle class,"" while his Democratic challenger, Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, defended coal with an industry slogan -- ""coal keeps the lights on"" -- and also promised to fight the rules in the Senate, if elected.\Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear took a more nuanced approach, saying he appreciated that the EPA recognized ""that differences do exist among manufacturing states and in states that produce the nation's energy.""\But he said he is ""extremely concerned that (the proposal) does not provide adequate flexibility or attainable goals.""\While the political rhetoric has been flying, regulators and analysts in both states are scrutinizing the voluminous documents that make up the regulations, saying it's too soon to predict what impact they might have or how they might craft a compliance plan.\""We are just starting to look at the documents,"" said Dan Goldblatt, spokesman for the Indiana Department of Environmental Management.\Kentucky has ""a whole team of people, including legal, technical and policy folks, looking at various aspects"" of the proposal, said John Lyons, assistant secretary for climate policy in the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet.\Electric utilities are also combing through the proposal in preparation for submitting comments to EPA.\""We are beginning to find some inconsistencies,"" said John Voyles, vice president of transmission and generation services for LG&E and KU Energy.\The company, for example, is not sure how much credit, if any, it can get for efforts already taken to diversify its energy mix, he said. ""We are trying to sort it out, get back with the EPA technical people, and trying to figure out what they meant.\""There will be some cost impacts to the consumers. We don't know what that will be.""\Nationally, average monthly electricity bills are anticipated to increase by roughly 3 percent by 2020, but decline by roughly 9 percent by 2030 because increased energy efficiency will lead to reduced usage, according to the EPA.\How it works\The rules are based on achieving the national 30 percent reduction in the amount of power plant emissions of carbon dioxide, a type of pollution blamed for causing global warming.\To get there, the EPA measures the rate of pounds of carbon dioxide per kilowatt hour of energy produced, a reflection of carbon intensity. The EPA has proposed a different emission rate target for each state and uses 2012 as a baseline for calculating those targets.\It says that if every state meets its emission rate reduction goals, the nation as a whole should achieve the 30 percent goal.\States that burn a lot of coal and have a lot of manufacturing, such as Kentucky and Indiana, don't have to reduce their emission rates as much as other states, reflecting their roles in the nation's economy.\It all comes down to the numbers.\If the proposal isn't changed, Kentucky will need to go from a rate of 2,158 pounds carbon dioxide per megawatt hour in 2012, to 1,763 pounds in 2030. That's a reduction of 18 percent. Indiana has to drop from 1,923 to 1,531 pounds, a decline of 20 percent.\Even in 2030, both states are projected to be among the national leaders in carbon dioxide emissions.\Lyons said state officials have estimated that Kentucky since 2012 has already dropped to 1,951 pounds of carbon dioxide per megawatt hour, a decline of 10 percent from the EPA's emission-rate 2012 baseline. That's mainly due to the retirement of older, less-efficient coal-fired plants that were not compliant with new, tighter rules on mercury and other pollutants, state officials said.\Indiana has yet to make a similar calculation, Goldblatt said.\But for Kentucky, the estimates show that the state is more than halfway to its goal, right out of the starting gate.\And some other power plant conversions to natural gas are in the works, such as Louisville's Cane Run power plant, that officials predict would bring Kentucky even closer, to nearly 11 percent of the 18 percent reduction goal.\""We have a couple of hundred pounds to go,"" Lyons said. ""I am telling you, that will be a challenge.""\It could have been more difficult. EPA chose a goal for Kentucky that was substantially less stringent than had been proposed by environmentalists, and had been feared and analyzed by state regulators. That proposal would have sought a 45 percent reduction in Kentucky's carbon dioxide emission rate.\The EPA, Lyons acknowledged, ""landed somewhere in the middle.""\Profeta, the Duke professor, credited Beshear's administration with getting its message across to the EPA in advance of the carbon rule roll out\""The leadership in Kentucky did a very effective job engaging the federal government and sort of bringing to them the challenge the state has in reducing greenhouse gases, and the economic situation in Kentucky, and the importance of low-cost power to Kentucky's manufacturing economy,"" Profeta said.\He also acknowledged the regulations by themselves won't solve the global climate problem, which will require international cooperation. Many scientists have argued for much deeper global cuts, in the range of 70 percent by mid-century.\""The intent of this rule is to change the investment paradigm in the energy sector and to make investment flow to the right technologies, to begin to shift the direction,"" Profeta said.\Optional approaches\Beshear and Energy and Environment Cabinet Secretary Len Peters pressed the EPA for as much flexibility as possible, arguing against slapping mandatory cuts at each plant in favor of allowing reductions to be made through energy efficiency and other means.\Under the EPA plan, states can achieve their goals by using a range of strategies, including alternative energy -- such as solar, wind or hydro power.\They can develop better programs to help homes and businesses use electricity more efficiently, such as programs that reduce demand by offering rebates on appliances.\LG&E and KU, for example, already have a home energy rebate program that offers $50 to $750 for qualifying items. More than 44,000 customers have participated since the program started in 2011.\The EPA says utilities also can make changes in their plants to burn coal more efficiently, estimating a typical plant could become 6 percent more efficient.\""I don't know what the realistic number is,"" Voyles countered. ""I would tell you 1 percent or less.""\Lyons said it would take a ""plant-by-plant"" assessment to determine what's possible.\States also could join other states in regional ""cap and trade"" programs, in which utilities that cut pollution could sell credits to those who don't.\Lyons questioned whether cap-and-trade would benefit Kentucky, saying the state likely would only be able to buy pollution credits, and that would raise electric rates.\Williams and Profeta, however, disagreed. Kentucky has so much energy waste that ""it could become a place where others invest in reductions,"" even without a formal cap-and-trade program, Profeta said.\Industries that are not already capturing waste heat, for example, can begin to do so and use it to boil water and make electricity, said Jesse Kharbanda, executive director of the Hoosier Environmental Council.\But by all accounts, the EPA effort will face continued opposition. Pence has promised as much, as has Gooch, who denied any climate threat from power plants, saying ""carbon dioxide is plant food.""\Once a rule is final, officials said Kentucky and Indiana are likely to develop their plans for compliance, even as lawsuits are expected to challenge it, and Kentucky will get a new governor.\The ultimate incentive is that, if states don't draft their own plans, the EPA will step in and write one for them, said attorney Tom FitzGerald with the Kentucky Resources Council.\Elected officials, he said, will probably dislike that even more.\Reach reporter James Bruggers at (502) 582-4645 or on Twitter @jbruggers.\Getting there\Pounds of\carbon dioxide per megawatt hour in Kentucky\2012\2,158\2014\1,951\2030\1,763\Source: U.S. EPA and Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet\CARBON REGULATIONS\Kentucky power plants are over halfway to the governments heat-trapping emissions goal.

15,"The last Friday in April is National Arbor Day. You knew that, didn't you? Born in the Victorian era, Arbor Day began mainly as a gentle reminder to admire trees as things of beauty. As an environmental observance, it has been upstaged by the more comprehensive Earth Day (itself now almost 50 years old). But Arbor Day has been very much updated.\The status of trees as uniquely important environmental players has risen in recent years. Trees are now on the front lines in the battle against climate change. That's because forests absorb nearly 40 percent of human-made fossil fuel emissions every year. Burning wood and rotting trees release carbon dioxide into the air.\This makes massive deforestation a harbinger of doom for the environment as we know it. Fortunately, there are ways to head this off. Proposals to create a carbon-offset market for trees, if put in motion, could reverse the destruction. Right now, these cap-and-trade setups are open only to utilities and industrial companies. Adding trees to a cap-and-trade system would let owners of forested acres make real money by not cutting down trees.\The fate of tropical forests, particularly in Southeast Asia, is of greatest concern. The ranching, mining and timber industries have played a major role in leveling more than a billion acres of tropical forest over the last 40 years. The loss of these trees contributes an estimated 12 to 15 percent of the world's carbon dioxide emissions a year.\Here's a simplified version of how a market for trading carbon offsets now works: Company A reduces its emissions below a government-set cap. Company B's emissions, by contrast, exceed the limit. To avoid paying a penalty, Company B buys offset credits from Company A.\The price of credits is set by supply and demand. That these systems are market-oriented pleases conservatives committed to fighting climate change. Trade in these markets already totals billions of dollars a year.\Some 40 countries now put a price on carbon. Some do it via cap-and-trade. Others, such as Canada, place a tax on fossil fuels, with most of the proceeds going back to Canadians through reductions in their tax bills. The United States does none of the above, but California and nine Northeast states have established their own cap-and-trade systems.\Where do trees come in? Removing trees increases emissions. Letting them grow reduces them. Putting a price on leaving them alone would act as a powerful incentive to not cut them down.\There remains the dilemma that many locals in and around tropical forests currently make a living in ways that require their destruction. Under a proposal known as the Rainforest Standard, however, mechanisms would be set up to spend some of the money building new livelihoods not dependent on axing trees. Examples include ecotourism, fishing and harvesting tree products, such as nuts and palm fruit.\Ordinary homeowners don't have big forests to preserve but can nonetheless use trees to reduce their carbon footprint. Trees shading the house have a cooling effect in hot weather, reducing the need for air conditioning. And there is some money in this, of course, in the form of lower electricity bills.\So National Arbor Day is coming. Bear in mind that your state's Arbor Day may fall on a different date than the national one. Many states move their observance to coincide with the best times in their area to plant trees. The big news this year is that in addition to providing beauty and serenity, trees can play a major role in saving our world from catastrophe. Is there a poem for that?\"
16,"3rd congressional district\All focus on\jobs, taxes\By Chris Kenning\ckenning@courier-journal.com\The Courier-Journal\Hoping to capitalize on anti-incumbent sentiment and anger over health care reform, a Louisville accountant, a Pizza Hut franchisee, a UPS pilot and a financial adviser are all vying to win the Republican nomination and challenge Democratic U.S. Rep. John Yarmuth in November.\Each is a fiscal and social conservative, all but one are new to politics, and all say that, with unemployment reaching 12 percent in Louisville, their top priority would be creating jobs by lowering taxes.\""Jobs are the signature issue in this election,"" said Todd Lally, a 39-year-old UPS pilot who lives in the Highlands, one of four candidates hoping to win the May 18 Republican primary for Louisville's 3rd Congressional District.\The others are 57-year-old Pizza Hut franchisee Jeff Reetz, 45-year-old financial adviser Larry Hausman, and 51-year-old accountant Brooks Wicker.\Yarmuth, who is unopposed in the Democratic primary, had almost a half-million dollars for his campaign as of the end of 2009. A sixth candidate, Michael D. Hansen, a 56-year-old industrial electrician at Ford's Kentucky Truck Plant, is running as an independent in the general election.\The Republican candidates said that in a crowded field of GOP primary races, including a high-profile Senate race, fundraising has been a challenge. But they're hoping to latch on to still-fresh opposition to health care reform and simmering tea party anger over government and stimulus spending, and corporate bailouts.\A Courier-Journal/WHAS 11 Bluegrass poll conducted last month found that 48 percent of Jefferson County voters said they are not sure whether they will support Yarmuth until they know who else is on the ballot.\For the Republican primary candidates, their biggest immediate challenge may be standing out from the competition; all four share similar views on issues from limited government and tax cuts to immigration reform and efforts to repeal the military's ""Don't ask, don't tell"" policy on homosexuality.\So far, neither Kentucky's most powerful Republican, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, nor the Jefferson County Republican Party has endorsed oa candidate. But the local GOP is helping each promote his campaign events.\And each says he has the business-world experience to get elected and help turn the nation in a new direction.\Larry Hausman\Hausman was raised in the Highlands, the oldest of six children. After starting his first business in 1989, he is now a financial adviser who works in real-estate investment.\Concerned about what he views as an overreaching government, Hausman said he tried to recruit several wealthy real-estate clients to challenge Yarmuth. They said no, but offered support -- and in the end he decided to run himself.\""I felt like the country was heading in the wrong direction on spending and its disregard for the Constitution,"" he said, explaining that he thinks requiring most people to buy health insurance is unconstitutional.\Agreeing with the conservative tea party movement, Hausman said he is concerned about government spending and opposes the new health care law.\Although he said he would ""love to repeal it,"" Hausman said it's unlikely to happen. Instead, he wants to make changes so that employees would get a stipend they could use for health insurance or put into a health spending account.\To spur jobs, he wants to offer businesses a tax credit equal to double a new hire's salary for a year. It would ""put tax dollars into the hands of profitable business owners,"" he said.\Hausman, who favors a balanced budget amendment, is also a flat-tax proponent: ""The first $25,000 would be tax-free, and anything above that would be taxed at 20 percent, with only three exemptions -- for retirement savings, health care and charitable giving.""\On social issues, he opposes abortion, stem-cell research and gay marriage. He thinks that Roe v. Wade is the result of ""a Supreme Court gone rogue."" And, with immigration reform on President Barack Obama's agenda, he said existing immigration laws should be better enforced.\He is opposed to Obama's carbon-emissions proposal called ""cap and trade"" -- limiting the amount of greenhouse gases that could be released and allowing firms to trade credits. He said it would harm Kentucky's coal-based economy. But he favors more emphasis on nuclear energy.\""I'm not convinced that global warming exists"" as a man-made phenomenon, he said.\Todd Lally\Lally, an Atherton High School graduate, has served 22 years in the military.\A member of the Air National Guard and a veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan, he ran unsuccessfully in 1998 for the General Assembly.\The UPS pilot said he decided to run against Yarmuth because of government spending on the stimulus and health care reform, which he said the nation can't afford.\""As a country, we have to make choices. We need to stop extending the debt ceiling, so we don't eventually have to ask China if it's OK to do a military operation,"" he said.\He suggested making cuts on programs such as NASA's space missions and reducing what he views as ""professional entitlement-takers"" who he said simply choose not to work but still accept welfare benefits.\A former member of the Jefferson County Republican Party executive committee, Lally favors less government regulation and taxation of business, saying lower taxes will help boost the economy and reduce the unemployment rate.\He is against the cap-and-trade emissions proposal, partly because he rejects the science behind global warming and partly because it would raise electricity rates.\""I don't think Kentucky's families are ready for that right now,"" he said.\Although he said he has raised close to $100,000, he acknowledges that fundraising has been tough with the sluggish economy: ""Prolific donors this year are barely able to do anything"" and ""small businesses are too nervous about the future,"" he said.\Still, Lally, an anti-abortion and gun-rights advocate, said he likes his chances of defeating Yarmuth. He points to a recent billboard in Louisville, paid for by a group of small-business owners, picturing Yarmuth next to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and reading, ""Congressman Yarmuth: This is Louisville, Ky. Start Voting Like it.""\""So many (Republicans) are unhappy with Yarmuth,"" he said.\Brooks Wicker\The son of a drugstore owner from Lyon County, Ky., Wicker has worked as a financial officer in various fields and now is a financial adviser and a certified public accountant.\""I've sat back and complained for 20 years, at least, on the direction of our government, society and economy was going,"" he said. ""What tipped me over the edge was the rising national debt.""\He opposes health care reform, saying: ""I don't see a need to turn an entire system that works for most people."" But he doesn't think there will be a move to repeal it.\Although the Obama administration has argued that the stimulus funding had created as many as 2.8 million jobs, Wicker said ""the current administration has paid too little attention"" to unemployment, and he called the stimulus ""a waste of time and money.""\He supports budget cuts and believes that lower taxes will stimulate the economy.\""We need to change and simplify the tax code"" he said, to reduce rates for top earners. ""Wealth is a bad word in this country, but you don't create jobs without some wealth.""\He opposes cap-and-trade emissions controls, favors a strong national defense and opposes removing ""Don't ask, don't tell"" in the military. But he said he's not a ""cookie-cutter Republican candidate"" and would vote in Congress based on ""principles, not party.""\""I'm not courting the established party base to win this seat,"" he said. ""I'm going to the people of Jefferson County.""\Wicker isn't sure how much he'll be able to raise and spend in a tough fundraising environment but said his message about jobs would resonate.\""We need someone with a background in economics and finance who can address those problems,"" he said.\Jeff Reetz\Reetz spent years in the fast-food industry before becoming a franchisee of 30 Pizza Hut outlets in Kentucky, Indiana, Iowa and Illinois, employing more than 700 people.\Born in Wisconsin and raised in the Chicago suburbs, Reetz began living in Louisville in 2000. About five years ago, he bought a home in Arizona while his daughter attended college. For a time he was registered to vote there, according to his campaign manager.\Now a permanent resident of Louisville, Reetz decided to run against Yarmuth in part to reduce government spending and unemployment, he said.\""We need to get Americans back to work and put money in the hands of consumers through lower taxes,"" he said. ""Consumer spending equals jobs.""\He believes giving credits to businesses for making hires is a good idea but also wants to boost consumer spending by making the Bush tax cuts, scheduled to expire at the end of this year, permanent. And he wants cuts in government discretionary spending on areas outside of military and Social Security.\Reetz said he would support a term-limit law for the House and Senate and promised not to vote for any spending bill that puts the United States further into debt unless it is related to defense and tax cuts.\He said the United States needs to put more emphasis on math and science in schools to boost global competitiveness. ""For long-term growth, we need new technology,"" he said.\He calls any legislation to limit greenhouse gases ""premature"" because he doesn't believe global warming has been proved, and he worries that cap-and-trade proposals would harm the economy with higher energy prices.\He favors stricter immigration enforcement and opposes abortion, embryonic stem-cell research, gay marriage and attempts at more gun control. He believes the United States should try suspected terrorists in military courts, not civilian courts.\Although Reetz also has found fundraising ""challenging,"" he said his experience gives him the ability to create jobs for Louisville.\""I'm the only guy that created jobs for hundreds of employees,"" he said.\Reporter Chris Kenning can be reached at (502) 582-4697.\E-VOTER GUIDE\Read much more about the four GOP 3rd District candidates' views on important issues, along with those of hundreds of other candidates in the primary, then create your own ballot at www.courier-journal.com/voterguide.\LOCATION MAP (SEE LIBRARY MICROFILM OR LIBRARY PDF PAGES)"

18,"Hoping to capitalize on anti-incumbent sentiment and anger over healthcare reform, a Louisville accountant, a Pizza Hut franchisee, a UPS pilot and a financial adviser are all vying to win the Republican nomination and challenge Democratic Rep. John Yarmuth in November.\Each is a fiscal and social conservative, all but one are new to politics and all say that, with unemployment reaching 12 percent in Louisville, their top priority would be creating jobs by lowering taxes.\""Jobs are the signature issue in this election,"" said Todd Lally, a 39-year-old UPS pilot who lives in the Highlands, one of four candidates hoping to win the May 18 Republican primary for Louisville's 3rd Congressional District.\Lally's competitors are 57-year-old Pizza Hut franchisee Jeffrey Reetz, 45-year-old financial adviser Larry Hausman, and 51-year-old accountant Brooks Wicker.\Yarmuth, who is unopposed in the Democratic primary, had almost a half-million dollars for his campaign as of the end of 2009. A sixth candidate, Michael D. Hansen, a 56-year-old industrial electrician at the Kentucky Truck Plant, is running as an independent in the general election.\The Republican candidates said that in a crowded field of GOP primary races, including a high-profile Senate race, fundraising has been a challenge. But they're hoping to latch on to still-fresh opposition to healthcare reform and simmering Tea Party anger over government spending, stimulus and corporate bailouts.\A Courier-Journal/WHAS 11 Bluegrass poll conducted last month found that 48 percent of Jefferson County voters said they are not sure whether they will support or oppose Yarmuth until they know who else is on the ballot.\For the Republican primary candidates, their biggest immediate challenge may be standing out from the competition --all four share similar views on issues from limited government and tax cuts to immigration reform and efforts to repeal the military's ""Don't ask, Don't tell"" policy on homosexuality.\So far, neither Kentucky's most powerful Republican, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, nor the Jefferson County Republican Party, has endorsed one of the candidates. But the local GOP is helping each candidate promote his campaign events.\But each says they have the business-world experience to get elected and help turn the nation in a new direction.\Larry Hausman\Hausman was raised in the Highlands, the oldest of six children. After starting his first business in 1989, he is now a financial adviser who works in real-estate investment.\Concerned about what he views as an overreaching government, Hausman said he tried to recruit several wealthy real-estate clients to challenge Yarmuth. They said no, but offered support -- and in the end he decided to run himself.\""I felt like the country was heading in the wrong direction on spending and its disregard for the Constitution,"" he said, explaining that he thinks requiring most people to purchase health insurance is unconstitutional.\Agreeing with the conservative Tea Party movement, Hausman said he is concerned about government spending and opposes the healthcare reform legislation recently passed by Congress.\Although he said he would ""love to repeal it,"" Hausman said it's unlikely to happen. Instead, he wants to make changes so that employees would get a stipend they could use for health insurance or put into a healthcare spending account.\To spur jobs, he wants to offer businesses a tax credit equal to double the new hire's salary for a year. It would ""put tax dollars into the hands of profitable business owners,"" he said.\Hausman, who favors a balanced budget amendment, is also a flat-tax proponent: ""The first $25,000 would be tax free, and anything above that would be taxed at 20 percent, with only three exemptions -- for retirement savings, health care and charitable giving.""\On social issues, he's an anti-abortion Republican opposed to stem-cell research and gay marriage. He thinks that Roe v. Wade is the result of ""a Supreme Court gone rogue."" And, with immigration reform on Obama's agenda, he said existing immigration laws should be better enforced.\He is opposed to the idea of Obama's carbon-emissions proposal called ""cap and trade"" -- limiting the amount of greenhouse gas that could be released and allow firms to trade credits. He said it would harm Kentucky's coal-based economy. But he favors more emphasis on nuclear energy.\""I'm not convinced that global warming exists"" as a man-made phenomenon, he said.\Todd Lally\Lally, a Louisville native and Atherton High School graduate, has served 22 years in the military.\A member of the Air National Guard and a veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan, he ran unsuccessfully in 1998 for the state legislature.\The UPS pilot said he decided to run against Yarmuth because of government spending on stimulus and healthcare reform, which he said the nation can't afford.\""As a country, we have to make choices.

19,"By Stephenie Steitzer\ssteitzer@courier-journal.com\The Courier-Journal\LEXINGTON, Ky. -- Democratic U.S. Rep. Ben Chandler and Republican lawyer Andy Barr highlighted their differences on the cause of the economic recession, cap and trade energy policy and the health care overhaul in a debate Monday night that was largely free of personal attacks.\The two are running for the 6th Congressional District seat. The district encompasses 16 counties in Central Kentucky and includes Lexington.\Although the two have aired negative television ads, the debate on Kentucky Educational Television focused instead on issues that contrast Republicans and Democrats in mid-term congressional races across the country.\""Andy believes apparently that (the recession) was the government's fault,"" Chandler, 51, said. ""I think that we had some greedy people on Wall Street. It seemed to me the Wall Street bankers were a little bit involved with it.""\Political observers say they will watch this race closely as a bellwether on Nov. 2 because the seat is in a rural area and is held by a Democrat with some tendencies to vote conservative.\Chandler is the grandson of former Kentucky Gov. A.B. ""Happy"" Chandler, a Democrat, and Barr was an attorney for former Republican Gov. Ernie Fletcher.\Barr, 36, said he thinks the recession that began in December 2007 was caused by bad government housing policies and was not solved by the Democrats' federal economic stimulus package.\""It's clearly a breathtaking failure,"" Barr said of the stimulus.\He said unemployment is still at 10 percent in Kentucky, and the country has lost 3 million jobs since the recession began.\Chandler, who voted for the stimulus, said unemployment would be worse without the program.\""Where would we be without the money that came into Kentucky that created Kentucky jobs, that saved Kentucky jobs?"" he asked.\Chandler defended his vote for cap and trade energy legislation, which would limit the amount of carbon emissions industries could release into the environment.\""I think it's extremely important for us to have an energy policy that expands our renewable energy efforts,"" he said. ""We cannot just rely on fossil fuels or any other one source of energy.""\Barr said cap and trade, which has passed the House but not the Senate, was ""the worst possible piece of legislation that Congress could have passed or could've voted on in the last Congress right in the middle of a huge economic downturn. It is a job-killer.""\On the health care changes, Chandler, who voted against the measure, said he would vote to repeal flawed parts but not the entire law.\He said it includes some positive provisions, such as requiring insurance companies to cover individuals with pre-existing conditions.\Barr said he thinks the health care overhaul, the centerpiece of the Obama administration's legislative agenda, is unconstitutional and ""exceeds the Congress' power under the commerce clause.""\Reporter Stephenie Steitzer can be reached at (502) 875-5136."
20,"Indiana ponders\tightening rules\By James Bruggers\jbruggers@courier-journal.com\The Courier-Journal\Twenty- two states -- but not Kentucky -- have enacted more stringent measures to control mercury emissions from power plants or are considering doing so, a national survey shows.\The results suggest that many states are concerned that the Bush administration's mercury rules, which were adopted last year, do not go far enough to protect the public and the environment from a potent neurotoxin, said Bill Becker , executive director of the National Association of Clean Air Agencies, which conducted the survey.\Some are concluding that the federal rules give coal-fired plants too many years to comply with mercury limits, that the limits themselves are too lenient or that they will perpetuate polluted ""hot spots"" by letting some plants comply by paying others to cut back through a cap-and-trade program, Becker said.\Indiana is considering a proposal to stiffen its mercury rules, but Thomas W. Easterly , commissioner of the Indiana Department of Environmental Management, has recommended going along with the federal rules, said Rob Elstro , an IDEM spokesman.\Becker, head of the group of state and local air-pollution agencies, called the rules ""mediocre at best.""\Mercury from coal-fired power plants gets into waterways, contaminating fish that people might eat. The biggest health concerns center on children and pregnant mothers.\Both Kentucky and Indiana warn people to limit the amount of fish they consume from state waters.\U.S. Environmental Protection Agency officials have said the rules would ""significantly reduce emissions from the nation's largest remaining source"" of mercury in air pollution.\Under the federal rules, mercury would be cut by about 70 percent from the nation's coal-fired power plants over 13 years. By comparison, Illinois and Pennsylvania are poised to enact rules calling for a 90 percent reduction much sooner, the survey found.\Both are coal states, like Kentucky and Indiana.\Kentucky should follow the lead of states that are moving toward tougher mercury controls, said Tim Guilfoyle , an avid fisherman from Edgewood, Ky., who is also active with several conservation groups.\""It's the absolute responsible thing to do,"" Guilfoyle said.\A state agency holds a different view. Kentucky should deviate from the federal rules only ""if there is compelling evidence that adverse localized impacts occur,"" said Mark York , spokesman for the Kentucky Environmental and Public Protection Cabinet. ""Our initial review of data did not indicate the presence of localized hot spots.""\Dan Riedinger , spokesman for the Edison Electric Institute, which represents utilities nationwide, called the hot-spot concerns ""another emotional issue.""\Based on how similar pollution-reduction programs have worked, he said, nearly all sources of mercury emissions would end up cutting back to reach the federal targets.\A Kentucky task force of state health and environmental officials this year looked into questions about mercury and the environment. In a September report to the Kentucky Environmental Quality Commission, the task force called the federal rules ""stringent"" and did not suggest tightening them.\Instead, the task force emphasized education efforts to reduce people's exposure to mercury, while cautioning against warnings that would create ""fear or panic"" that might preventing people from going fishing or eating some of what they caught.\Lindell Ormsbee , chairman of the commission and a University of Kentucky engineering professor, said he had not reviewed the task force report and could not comment on it.\But Guilfoyle called the cautious approach to warnings ""a cop-out,"" saying mercury is enough of a problem to risk scaring people.\""We need to inform the public about risks to kids,"" he said.\Reporter James Bruggers can be reached at (502) 582-4645."
21,"The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday took its biggest step ever to curb emissions of mercury and other toxic pollutants from power plants.\In its announcement, the agency asserted that the changes will save lives and reduce health care bills -- but also raise electric rates.\EPA Administrator Lisa M. Jackson said the benefits will greatly exceed the costs, rejecting some industry claims that the rule could threaten as many as 1.4 million jobs.\""This is a great victory for public health, especially for the health of our children,"" Jackson said at an announcement at Children's National Medical Center in Washington, D.C.\The rule will especially affect Kentucky and Indiana, where the dirtiest power plants -- those that burn coal -- supply more than 90 percent of the two states' electricity. Some older plants will likely be shut down and replaced with cleaner-burning fuels or technology, and others will be modernized to meet standards that Jackson said were 20 years in the making.\Utilities will have up to four years to comply, the EPA said.\The rule would reduce mercury emissions from power plants by 90 percent, while costing the nation's utilities about $9.6 billion annually, the EPA said. It also targets such hazardous air pollutants as arsenic, lead, chromium and acid gases.\It replaces Bush-era regulations, thrown out by the federal courts, that had relied on a cap-and-trade strategy, in which utilities that made cuts could sell credits to those that didn't. At the time, the Bush administration predicted that its rule would reduce mercury pollution from coal-fired power plants by 70 percent over 13 years.\The result under the new rule will be up to 11,000 fewer premature deaths and 4,700 fewer heart attacks a year, among other health benefits, the EPA said.\Mercury has been shown to cause neurological damage, including lower IQ in children exposed in the womb and during early development. All Kentucky streams carry fish-consumption warnings for mercury, as do many in Indiana.\Lexington physician Vicki Holmberg, a consultant for the Kentucky Environmental Foundation, called the final rule ""a step in the right direction for protection of our families by limiting the amount of mercury that will enter our environment, contaminate our water supplies and wind up in our food chain.""\She said the amount of mercury now released into the air from coal-fired power plants and other industrial sources ""can overwhelm the capacity of our bodies to metabolize and eliminate toxic metal pollutants and have been shown to contribute to neurological damage and cardiovascular disorders.""\While both Indiana and Kentucky have many coal-fired power plants, some environmentalists and medical doctors have called the Louisville area a mercury ""hot spot"" because of its concentration of coal-fired plants amid a large population. Two are within the city limits, and another is across the Ohio River in New Albany, Ind.\People who live nearest to older, more polluting plants like those in the Louisville area will benefit the most from the new standards, with fewer illnesses and fewer asthma attacks, said James Pew, an attorney with Earthjustice, a nonprofit environmental law group based in San Francisco. Pew, who helped bring the legal challenge against the Bush-era rule, said, ""This is really good news.""\U.S. Rep. John Yarmuth, D-3rd District, embraced the EPA action.\""This will be very good news to the thousands of Louisvillians who suffer from asthma and other health problems related to toxins in our air,"" Yarmuth said.\But the rule, since it was first proposed earlier this year, has been sharply criticized by Republicans in Congress, who have tried unsuccessfully to block it with legislation. They have argued that it is too costly.\""These rules hurt consumers, they hurt businesses, and they hurt jobs,"" said U.S. Rep. Ed Whitfield, R-1st District.\Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said the EPA was overstating the problem of mercury from domestic sources.\""Mercury emissions should be controlled, but in a way that balances thoughtful science with economic realities and our energy needs,"" he said. ""This rule does not reflect this balance and should be repealed.""\Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., agreed.\""Kentucky's approximately 18,000 coal miners are already facing an uncertain future, and these constant attacks by the administration must stop.""\While some business groups focused on clean energy and sustainable business practices praised the EPA, others in industry predicted dire economic circumstances.\""It will increase the cost of power, undermining the international competitiveness of almost two dozen manufacturing industries, and it will reduce employment ... in the mining sectors,"" Scott Segal, director of the Electric Reliability Coordinating Council, a coalition of utilities that works on air issues, said in a statement. Citing an industry-funded study, he said that ""all told, it is anticipated that the rule will result in the loss of some 1.4 million jobs by 2020.""\Jackson disagreed, saying the EPA standards would result in a net increase in jobs, including 46,000 short-term construction jobs and 8,000 longer-term utility sector jobs.\""It's good to have the final standards so that we have a clearer picture of the requirements and can solidify our compliance plans,"" said Chris Whelan, spokeswoman for Louisville Gas and Electric Co. and Kentucky Utilities. She said that company officials need to study the final rule's details but that they are already making plans to comply by 2016.\In September, LG&E and KU officials said stricter mercury limits were prompting them to replace their 57-year-old, coal-fired Cane Run Station in Louisville with a new plant next door powered with cleaner-burning natural gas by 2016.\The company is also closing two other coal-fired plants operated by KU: Green River in Central City and Tyrone in Versailles. The Tyrone plant has already been mothballed.\But the environmental upgrades come at a cost to customers.\LG&E and KU have negotiated a rate increase with environmental and consumer groups that was approved earlier this month by the Kentucky Public Service Commission to cover mercury and other emission rules.\Whelan said that addressing the mercury and toxic air limits was the largest part of the planned rate increase.\LG&E will be allowed to raise electric rates by about 18 percent by 2016 to pay for the environmental upgrades. Customers of Kentucky Utilities, which serves 77 Kentucky counties, will see a smaller rate increase of about 9.7 percent by 2016.\LG&E plans to spend $1.4billion to modernize the sulfur-dioxide scrubbers at Mill Creek Station in southwestern Jefferson County and install new filters to better control mercury and particulates at a unit of the Trimble County generating plant.\Mill Creek will also get the new filters, called bag houses, which function much like vacuum cleaners and are as large as a football field and 10 stories tall.\Duke Energy has promised fewer mercury emissions from its Gallagher plant in New Albany, as part of an earlier court settlement with the EPA.\Lew Middleton, a Duke spokesman, said the company awaits a decision on its request with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission to purchase a portion of the Vermillion Generating Station and then retire two of four coal-burning units at Gallagher. Alternatively, the company has sought to convert two Gallagher units to cleaner-burning natural gas.\Middleton declined to comment on the EPA's action.\""We will need some time to review EPA's final rule to truly understand what it means to our plants,"" he said.\City officials have predicted cleaner air locally, as the rule will also result in fewer emissions that cause smog and high levels of lung-damaging particulates -- both long-time challenges for the Louisville area.\For example, LG&E has said that a natural gas plant at Cane Run would clean up more than just mercury, metals and acid gases. It would have 98 percent fewer emissions of sulfur dioxide than the current plant, 70 percent fewer emissions of nitrogen oxides and 60 percent less particulate emissions, they have said.\Thomas Nord, spokesman for the Louisville Metro Air Pollution Control District, commended LG&E for being ""proactive"" and said the rule would make breathing easier and reduce pollution downwind. Less coal being burned will mean cleaner skies, he added.\""This is something that was a long time coming,"" Nord said.\Reporter James Bruggers can be reached at (502) 582-4645.\Impact of rule\By 2016, EPA says, its mercury and air toxics standards would:\Cost electric utilities as much as $9.6 billion per year.\Generate $37 billion to $90\billion in health and welfare\benefits.\It would avoid:\11,000 premature deaths\2,800 cases of chronic bronchitis\4,700 heart attacks\130,000 cases of aggravated asthma\5,700 hospital visits\540,000 missed days of work"
22,"Power plants in 31 states would have to tailor their smog-fighting efforts to meet the needs of cities up to hundreds of miles downwind under new regulations proposed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Wednesday.\The rule is aimed at helping cities and states that are trying to stay within federal air pollution limits only to have their efforts overwhelmed by pollution that blows in on the prevailing winds.\It would reduce the amount of pollution that reaches Louisville from power plants in states like Indiana, Illinois and Missouri. States in the Northeast would be on the receiving end of less pollution from Midwestern power plants. The rule is designed to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide, which contribute to smog, fine particle pollution and acid rain.\The announcement came as tens of millions of Americans in the eastern United States faced smog alerts this week amid stagnant air and sweltering heat.\With the summer temperatures soaring into the 90s again, regulators predicted the air on Wednesday in the Louisville area to be unhealthy for children, older adults, active adults and anyone with heart or lung ailments, with key being ozone.\""This is attempting to give people cleaner air to breathe,"" assistant EPA administrator Gina McCarthy said of the proposed rule. The benefits, calculated as worth up to $290 billion in annual health and welfare benefits far outweigh the estimated cost of $2.8 billion per year, she added.\Each of the 31 states in the eastern half of the country would be put on a pollution budget determined by what's needed by downwind states to help them comply with federal ozone and fine particle standards, McCarthy said.\Matt Stull, spokesman for the Louisville Metro Air Pollution Control District, noted that in recent years the city had counted on a Bush administration EPA rule from 205 to reduce pollution from the west and southwest. Because the new rule appears to be more stringent than the 2005 rule, Louisville may see even more improvement, he said.\""On the other hand, we are an upwind state as well,"" said Lauren Anderson, executive director of the district. ""People will be looking at Kentucky to make reductions.""\By 2014, the rule would help reduce sulfur dioxide emissions by 71 percent over 2005 levels and emissions of nitrogen oxides would decline by 52 percent. McCarthy said ""downwind states will know just how much upwind states are required to control.""\The EPA estimates the rule will avoid 14,000 to 36,000 premature deaths, 23,000 non-fatal heart attacks, 26,000 emergency room visits and 1.9 million lost days of work or school.\The 1,361-page ""transport rule"" is designed to replace the 2005 Bush administration rule that was struck down in 2008 and partially restored.\Karen Wilson, spokeswoman for the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet, said the new rule is more stringent than the Bush administration's and offers states less flexibility to meet its requirements. E.On U.S., which operates LG&E and Kentucky Utilities, said it doesn't anticipate much difficulty complying with the new rule at its fleet of power plants.\Gary Revlett, air director for the utility, said that E.On had complied with the requirements of what the Bush administration called its Clean Air Interstate Rule. That included adding pollution control devices to some of its power plants to curb nitrogen oxides.\E.On also used the devices year-round instead of just during the spring and summer smog season, and added sulfur dioxide scrubbers to some units.\Without knowing all the details, Revlett said: ""We really at this time ... feel comfortable we will be in compliance with the new rule without significant additional cost.""\But Frank Maisano, an energy lobbyist with the law firm Bracewell & Giuliani, predicted the new rule would increase electricity prices, ""since it will force many older coal-fired power plants to be closed.""\Environmentalists praised the EPA, while agreeing with McCarthy, who said the rule does not go far enough to help states meet air quality standards that are still in the works.\""This EPA proposal is a big step in the right direction,"" said Frank O'Donnell, president of Clean Air Watch in Washington, D.C. ""There is no question we will need further pollution cuts from power plants to meet updated national clean air standards for smog and soot.""\Sarah Lynn Cunningham, a Louisville environmental advocate who also suffers from asthma, said she hopes the EPA puts the rule in place.

Barack Obama was elected, in part, as the antidote to ambition. Unlike John F. Kennedy, who campaigned against the golf-playing complacency of the Eisenhower era, Obama appealed to a nation weary of large national exertions - a nation longing for a normality beyond the wars, hurricanes, floods and assorted plagues of the Bush years.
\
Yet, headed toward the inauguration, the scale of Obama's ambition is becoming evident.
\
I am not referring to his stimulus plan, which tends toward the limited and conventional. Obama's tax cuts are designed to improve household cash flow. But it is the iron rule of stimulus packages that temporary tax cuts have temporary results - like coffee instead of a meal for a hungry man.
\
Obama's proposed infrastructure spending has the Lincolnian appeal of fostering ""internal improvements"" - raising the prospect that public spending might have some lasting public benefit. But there is a fine line between infrastructure and pork - the line between building a bridge, which might promote economic growth, and painting a bridge, which merely provides a few jobs for a few weeks. And Congress is not particularly known for its navigation of fine lines.
\
The Obama economic plan is expensive but hardly revolutionary - much less ""socialist."" In reality, American presidents have few levers long enough to shift a continental economy. During an economic winter, they shovel the snow - and then take credit for the spring.
\
But there are two other areas where Obama's campaign pledges are proving ambitious.
\
First, Obama proposes to require all but the smallest businesses to provide health coverage to employees - or pay a tax. He would also create a government-run insurance plan similar to Medicare that would compete with private companies to cover the uninsured. The problem is this: Because government can impose price controls, it can make the public option cheaper. Companies, tired of dealing with complicated healthcare burdens, would have an incentive to drop employees from coverage, and uncovered individuals would have an incentive to join the public system - achieving universal nationalization of health care by small steps.
\
In reacting to this approach, Republicans face a difficult, defining moment. This is not 1994, when opponents, offering no alternatives, killed the Clinton health reform. Many businesses are sincerely discontented with the current employer-based system.
\
But predominantly publicly run health care is an ideological red line for Republicans. In other instances where the middle class has become dependent on government for its health care - witness Britain - the conservative case for individual responsibility and limited government has been fundamentally undermined. People hold tightly to the security of their benefits even when treated by a health system with surly incompetence. Not even the most compassionate conservative is going to accept government control of 16 percent of the economy.
\
If Obama's proposal demonstrates genuine neutrality between public and private health options - empowering individuals to make a free choice - it could gain significant Republican support. If the plan is an intermediary step toward a single-payer system, Obama can expect a serious fight; even from a weakened opponent, because the deepest values of American conservatism will be at stake.
\
Second, the scale of Obama's environmental ambitions has been highlighted by the current economic crisis.
\
It is another iron rule that prosperous, confident nations do more for the environment than economically struggling ones. And this sets up a conflict between Obama's urgent environmental diagnosis - a cumulative scientific case for serious, possibly catastrophic climate disruption - and the economic and political realities of the moment.
\
The centerpiece of Obama's environmental approach is an ""economy-wide cap-and-trade program,"" designed to dramatically limit greenhouse gas production. But this would act as a large tax on the use of fossil fuels - in an economy where falling energy prices have been one of the few sources of good news.
\
If Obama plows ahead with an aggressive cap-and-trade system, Republican and Democratic opponents - focused exclusively on jobs - will find plenty of excuses for legislative inertia. If he phases in a system too slowly, it will undermine his own arguments for urgency. If he abandons a cap-and-trade system in favor of investing in eco-infrastructure - a more efficient energy grid, weatherizing public buildings - he will get what he wants, and also get slammed for betraying a serious commitment.
\
During the campaign, I sometimes criticized Obama for lacking specificity and ambition. But as the specifics emerge, the ambitions of his campaign pledges are ever more clear.
"
24,"The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday took its biggest step ever to curb emissions of mercury and other toxic pollutants from power plants.\In its announcement, the agency asserted that the changes will save lives and reduce health care bills -- but also raise electric rates.\EPA Administrator Lisa M. Jackson said the benefits will greatly exceed the costs, rejecting some industry claims that the rule could threaten as many as 1.4 million jobs.\""This is a great victory for public health, especially for the health of our children,"" Jackson said at an announcement at Children's National Medical Center in Washington, D.C.\The rule will especially affect Kentucky and Indiana, where the dirtiest power plants -- those that burn coal -- supply more than 90 percent of the two states' electricity. Some older plants will likely be shut down and replaced with cleaner-burning fuels or technology, and others will be modernized to meet standards that Jackson said were 20 years in the making.\Utilities will have up to four years to comply, the EPA said.\The rule would reduce mercury emissions from power plants by 90 percent, while costing the nation's utilities about $9.6 billion annually, the EPA said. It also targets such hazardous air pollutants as arsenic, lead, chromium and acid gases.\It replaces Bush-era regulations, thrown out by the federal courts, that had relied on a cap-and-trade strategy, in which utilities that made cuts could sell credits to those that didn't. At the time, the Bush administration predicted that its rule would reduce mercury pollution from coal-fired power plants by 70 percent over 13 years.\The result under the new rule will be up to 11,000 fewer premature deaths and 4,700 fewer heart attacks a year, among other health benefits, the EPA said.\Mercury has been shown to cause neurological damage, including lower IQ in children exposed in the womb and during early development. All Kentucky streams carry fish-consumption warnings for mercury, as do many in Indiana.\Lexington physician Vicki Holmberg, a consultant for the Kentucky Environmental Foundation, called the final rule ""a step in the right direction for protection of our families by limiting the amount of mercury that will enter our environment, contaminate our water supplies and wind up in our food chain.""\She said the amount of mercury now released into the air from coal-fired power plants and other industrial sources ""can overwhelm the capacity of our bodies to metabolize and eliminate toxic metal pollutants and have been shown to contribute to neurological damage and cardiovascular disorders.""\While both Indiana and Kentucky have many coal-fired power plants, some environmentalists and medical doctors have called the Louisville area a mercury ""hot spot"" because of its concentration of coal-fired plants amid a large population. Two are within the city limits, and another is across the Ohio River in New Albany, Ind.\People who live nearest to older, more polluting plants like those in the Louisville area will benefit the most from the new standards, with fewer illnesses and fewer asthma attacks, said James Pew, an attorney with Earthjustice, a nonprofit environmental law group based in San Francisco. Pew, who helped bring the legal challenge against the Bush-era rule, said, ""This is really good news.""\U.S. Rep. John Yarmuth, D-3rd District, embraced the EPA action.\""This will be very good news to the thousands of Louisvillians who suffer from asthma and other health problems related to toxins in our air,"" Yarmuth said.\But the rule, since it was first proposed earlier this year, has been sharply criticized by Republicans in Congress, who have tried unsuccessfully to block it with legislation. They have argued that it is too costly.\""These rules hurt consumers, they hurt businesses, and they hurt jobs,"" said U.S. Rep. Ed Whitfield, R-1st District.\Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said the EPA was overstating the problem of mercury from domestic sources.\""Mercury emissions should be controlled, but in a way that balances thoughtful science with economic realities and our energy needs,"" he said. ""This rule does not reflect this balance and should be repealed.""\Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., agreed.\""Kentucky's approximately 18,000 coal miners are already facing an uncertain future, and these constant attacks by the administration must stop.""\While some business groups focused on clean energy and sustainable business practices praised the EPA, others in industry predicted dire economic circumstances.\""It will increase the cost of power, undermining the international competitiveness of almost two dozen manufacturing industries, and it will reduce employment ... in the mining sectors,"" Scott Segal, director of the Electric Reliability Coordinating Council, a coalition of utilities that works on air issues, said in a statement. Citing an industry-funded study, he said that ""all told, it is anticipated that the rule will result in the loss of some 1.4 million jobs by 2020.""\Jackson disagreed, saying the EPA standards would result in a net increase in jobs, including 46,000 short-term construction jobs and 8,000 longer-term utility sector jobs.\""It's good to have the final standards so that we have a clearer picture of the requirements and can solidify our compliance plans,"" said Chris Whelan, spokeswoman for Louisville Gas and Electric Co. and Kentucky Utilities. She said that company officials need to study the final rule's details but that they are already making plans to comply by 2016.\In September, LG&E and KU officials said stricter mercury limits were prompting them to replace their 57-year-old, coal-fired Cane Run Station in Louisville with a new plant next door powered with cleaner-burning natural gas by 2016.\The company is also closing two other coal-fired plants operated by KU: Green River in Central City and Tyrone in Versailles. The Tyrone plant has already been mothballed.\But the environmental upgrades come at a cost to customers.\LG&E and KU have negotiated a rate increase with environmental and consumer groups that was approved earlier this month by the Kentucky Public Service Commission to cover mercury and other emission rules.\Whelan said that addressing the mercury and toxic air limits was the largest part of the planned rate increase.\LG&E will be allowed to raise electric rates by about 18 percent by 2016 to pay for the environmental upgrades. Customers of Kentucky Utilities, which serves 77 Kentucky counties, will see a smaller rate increase of about 9.7 percent by 2016.\LG&E plans to spend $1.4 billion to modernize the sulfur-dioxide scrubbers at Mill Creek Station in southwestern Jefferson County and install new filters to better control mercury and particulates at a unit of the Trimble County generating plant. Mill Creek will also get the new filters, called bag houses, which function much like vacuum cleaners and are as large as a football field and 10 stories tall.\Duke Energy has promised fewer mercury emissions from its Gallagher plant in New Albany, as part of an earlier court settlement with the EPA.\Lew Middleton, a Duke spokesman, said the company awaits a decision on its request with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission to purchase a portion of the Vermillion Generating Station and then retire two of four coal-burning units at Gallagher. Alternatively, the company has sought to convert two Gallagher units to cleaner-burning natural gas.\Middleton declined to comment on the EPA's action.\""We will need some time to review EPA's final rule to truly understand what it means to our plants,"" he said.\City officials have predicted cleaner air locally, as the rule will also result in fewer emissions that cause smog and high levels of lung-damaging particulates -- both long-time challenges for the Louisville area.\For example, LG&E has said that a natural gas plant at Cane Run would clean up more than just mercury, metals and acid gases. It would have 98 percent fewer emissions of sulfur dioxide than the current plant, 70 percent fewer emissions of nitrogen oxides and 60 percent less particulate emissions, they have said.\Thomas Nord, spokesman for the Louisville Metro Air Pollution Control District, commended LG&E for being ""proactive"" and said the rule would make breathing easier and reduce pollution downwind. Less coal being burned will mean cleaner skies, he added.\""This is something that was a long time coming,"" Nord said.\Impact of rule\By 2016, EPA says, its mercury and air toxics standards would:\Cost electric utilities as much as $9.6 billion per year.\Generate $37 billion to $90 billion in health and welfare benefits.\It would avoid:\11,000 premature deaths\2,800 cases of chronic bronchitis\4,700 heart attacks\130,000 cases of aggravated asthma\5,700 hospital visits\540,000 missed days of work\ID_Code: B2-312210090"
25,"would be affected\By James Bruggers\jbruggers@courier-journal.com\The Courier-Journal\Power plants in 31 states would have to tailor their smog-fighting efforts to meet the needs of cities up to hundreds of miles downwind under regulations proposed Tuesday by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\The rule is aimed at helping cities and states that are trying to stay within federal air pollution limits, only to have their efforts overwhelmed by pollution that blows in on the prevailing winds.\It would reduce the amount of pollution that reaches Louisville from power plants in states such as Indiana, Illinois and Missouri. States in the Northeast would receive less pollution from Midwest power plants. The rule is designed to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide, which contribute to smog, fine particle pollution and acid rain.\The announcement came as tens of millions of Americans in the eastern United States faced smog alerts this week amid stagnant air and sweltering heat.\With the temperatures soaring into the 90s again, regulators predicted the air Wednesday in the Louisville area would be unhealthy for children, older adults, active adults and anyone with heart or lung ailments, with the key being ozone.\""This is attempting to give people cleaner air to breathe,"" assistant EPA administrator Gina McCarthy said of the proposed rule. The benefits, calculated as worth up to $290 billion in annual health and welfare savings, far outweigh the estimated cost of $2.8 billion a year, she added.\Each of the 31 states in the eastern U.S. would be put on a pollution budget determined by what's needed by downwind states to help them comply with federal ozone and fine particle standards, McCarthy said.\Matt Stull, spokesman for the Louisville Metro Air Pollution Control District, noted that in recent years the city had counted on a Bush administration EPA rule from 2005 to reduce pollution from the west and southwest. Because the new rule appears to be more stringent than the 2005 rule, Louisville may see even more improvement, he said.\""On the other hand, we are an upwind state as well,"" said Lauren Anderson, executive director of the district. ""People will be looking at Kentucky to make reductions.""\Benefits of the rule\By 2014, the rule would help reduce sulfur dioxide emissions by 71 percent over 2005 levels, and emissions of nitrogen oxides would decline by 52 percent. McCarthy said ""downwind states will know just how much upwind states are required to control.""\The EPA estimates the rule will avoid 14,000 to 36,000 premature deaths, 23,000 non-fatal heart attacks, 26,000 emergency room visits and 1.9 million lost days of work or school.\The 1,361-page ""transport rule"" is designed to replace the 2005 Bush administration rule that was struck down in 2008 and partially restored.\Karen Wilson, spokeswoman for the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet, said the new rule is more stringent than the Bush administration's and offers states less flexibility to meet its requirements. E.On U.S., which operates LG&E and Kentucky Utilities, said it doesn't anticipate much difficulty complying with the new rule at its power plants.\Gary Revlett, air director for the utility, said that E.On had complied with the requirements of what the Bush administration called its Clean Air Interstate Rule. That included adding pollution control devices to some of its power plants to curb nitrogen oxides.\E.On also used the devices year-round instead of just during the spring and summer smog season, and added sulfur dioxide scrubbers to some units.\Without knowing all the details, Revlett said: ""We really at this time ... feel comfortable we will be in compliance with the new rule without significant additional cost.""\But Frank Maisano, an energy lobbyist with the law firm Bracewell & Giuliani, predicted the new rule would increase electricity prices, ""since it will force many older coal-fired power plants to be closed.""\'A big step'\Environmentalists praised the EPA while agreeing with McCarthy, who said the rule does not go far enough to help states meet air quality standards that are still in the works.\""This EPA proposal is a big step in the right direction,"" said Frank O'Donnell, president of Clean Air Watch in Washington, D.C. ""There is no question we will need further pollution cuts from power plants to meet updated national clean air standards for smog and soot.""\Sarah Lynn Cunningham, a Louisville environmental advocate who also suffers from asthma, said she hopes the EPA puts the rule in place. The agency intends to have a 60-day public comment period, with a target of making them final next June.\""If we have less pollution, then there will be fewer days when the Air Pollution Control District tells people who have asthma or heart problems to stay indoors,"" she said.\In 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia struck down the 2005 rule over its cap-and-trade provisions.

On a picture-perfect late afternoon at Reid's Orchard in front of about 400 people Monday, Republican U.S. Senate candidate Rand Paul looked for his Democratic opponent, Jack Conway, and didn't see him.
\
So Paul lit into President Barack Obama.
\
""The president is wrong on every major decision he's made,"" Paul said to the delight of his many supporters at the Red, White & Blue political picnic.
\
Warning that 1,600 aluminum industry jobs in this region are in danger, Paul said, ""We are in the midst of a great recession, with 10 percent-plus unemployment. ... What does the president want? Cap and trade to put them out of work.""
\
Cap and trade is a method of reducing emissions that critics believe will hurt the coal industry and cause the cost of generating electricity from coal to skyrocket. Aluminum smelters in Kentucky rely on relatively inexpensive electricity from coal-fired power plants.
\
""The president is also wrong on the federal takeover of health care,"" Paul said. ""We can't let it happen.""
\
Paul and Conway were to be the headliners at the political event which featured more than two dozen candidates for local, state and national office. Paul performed his role to applause and loud cheers, but Conway was a no-show. Event officials said he had an out-of-state conflict. State Auditor Crit Luallen spoke in his place.
\
Paul hammered hard on his criticisms of Washington, including the federal budget deficit and $400 billion in annual interest payments on the debt.
\
""A day of reckoning is coming,"" he said. ""Enough is enough. We have to take our government back.""
\
Paul said he would fight ""day in and day out"" for a balanced budget, term limits and limited constitutional government.
\
""This election is about competing visions,"" Paul said. ""The president wants more government. Our vision is too free up individual businessmen and -women to produce jobs.""
\
Luallen praised Conway, Kentucky's attorney general, for what she said was his intellect, integrity and deep commitment to public service. She said he has protected children by removing child pornography from the Internet and has aggressively pursued drug dealers.
\
""Jack will hold Wall Street and Washington accountable,"" she said. ""Rand Paul's extreme views are out of touch with the values of Kentucky. Rand Paul says he will balance the budget, but he won't say how. ... This election gives Kentucky the opportunity to send a senator who is a true champion for Kentucky.""
\
Monday's event also featured candidates for the Second District U.S. House of Representatives seat now held by Republican Brett Guthrie and Republican candidates for Kentucky governor.
\
Guthrie was present, along with his Democratic challenger Ed Marksberry of Owensboro.
\
Marksberry accused Guthrie of voting with the Republican leadership every time they oppose bills that he said will help working people.
\
""Our (U.S. 60) bypass project is a stimulus project,"" Marksberry said of the highway extension project now under way. ""Our congressman (Guthrie) voted against the stimulus bill. He voted against Daviess County.""
\
Guthrie didn't mention Marksberry, aiming his criticisms at Washington Democrats instead.
\
""Democrats will put a bureaucrat between you and your doctor,"" he said. ""Everyone agrees that Wall Street caused the problems, not main street, but Democrats disagree. The financial reform bill was endorsed by CityGroup and Wall Street.""
\
Guthrie accused Democrats of declaring war on coal with the cap and trade legislation, which he said will cost thousands of jobs.
\
""I'm not endorsing two more years of party gridlock,"" Guthrie said. ""My hope is President Obama will meet us in the middle like President Clinton did.""
\
The final speakers of the day were David Williams, president of the Kentucky Senate, and Phil Moffett, managing partner of the telecommunications management company CCS Partners of Louisville. Both are seeking the Republican nomination for governor in next May's primary.
\
Moffett, a tea party candidate, said he will focus on state sovereignty and challenges every federal law, mandate and regulation by holding them up to the Constitution.
\
""If they don't measure up, we'll fight them,"" he said.
\
Moffett said Kentucky is not getting jobs that are leaving states like New Jersey, New York and California because Kentucky's business environment is no better than in those states.
\
""I'm for a single tax rate for goods and services,"" he said. ""We need to be a state that allows business to succeed."" He said Kentucky's public education system isn't very good and one reason is students are not required to submit to teachers. They need to, he said. School choice for parents and charter schools are needed, he said.
\
""Let's make state government smaller,"" Moffett concluded.
\
Williams spoke only briefly, and spent most of his time recognizing friends. But he did jab at Gov. Steve Beshear, calling him a caretaker governor in charge of a rudderless government.
\
""I'm a strong supporter of Rand Paul,"" Williams said. ""I think he will give Washington a strong dose of what it needs.""
\
Williams promised that if Republican Joe Bowen is elected to the State Senate, he will be appointed to the budget and appropriations committee.
\
""Richie Farmer (his running mate) and I believe it is time for a change,"" Williams said. ""We will create a tax system that will make us competitive with states to the south and put the emphasis on coal that it deserves. I will be proud to be the governor of a coal state.""
\
Many current and past elected officials were in the crowd Monday, including Owensboro Mayor Ron Payne, former U.S. Sen. Wendell Ford and Former Kentucky Speaker of the House Don Blandford.

27,"LG&E and Kentucky Utilities electricity rates would increase by about $10.50 per month for a typical home in three years, and $18 a month by 2020, under the climate change bill passed by the U.S. House of Representatives, according to company officials.\Commercial and industrial rates would go up even more -- as much as 39 percent in 2020.\But the increases, 14 percent for residential customers by 2012 and 24 percent by 2020, would be much lower than E.On U.S., parent of the two power providers, warned its customers about in bills mailed out just before the vote in Congress. Those mailings predicted rates would soar 40 percent to 80 percent.\The battle over climate change legislation now moves to the Senate, which returns Monday with the goal of delivering a bill to President Barack Obama by the end of the year.\E.On's new estimates reflect concessions Congress made to the electric utility industry that will funnel money to utilities to help buffer costs of moving to cleaner energy, said Chip Keeling, an E.On spokesman.\""We're trying to reduce any increase for our customers,"" Keeling said, adding that E.On is now ""extremely pleased with the framework of the bill.""\The American Clean Energy and Security Act, passed the House 219-212 on June 26, is the first bill to limit the pollution blamed for warming the planet to pass either Congressional chamber. It comes as many of the world's scientists are sounding ever-more-urgent alarms about environmental, social and economic chaos should governments fail to act.\The bill's sweeping scope ranges from requiring more energy-efficient building codes to promoting electric vehicles, while investing in cleaner coal technology.\It would establish an overall limit on greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane that industries can produce. Those that produce less of the pollution could sell credits to companies that produce more. Called ""cap and trade,"" the system would require cutting 2005 greenhouse gas emission levels by 17 percent in 11 years and 83 percent by 2050.\Creating an asset -- and a way to turn it into cash -- for polluters who clean up their operations has effectively addressed other problems such as sulfur dioxide, a cause of acid rain.\Under the bill, electric utilities would also have to produce 20 percent of their power from renewable sources such as wind, solar and wood or agricultural wastes by 2020. Utilities would be given the option of producing up to 8 percent less from renewables by operating energy-efficiency programs for their customers. Another option for utilities would be to make payments to funds that support renewable energy.\Easily offset\Kentucky Rep. John Yarmuth, D-3rd District, who voted for the bill, acknowledged the potential impact on consumers.\He said he was pleased that E.On is now saying the bill won't cost its customers as much, and said that its projections now are more in line with the Congressional Budget Office's estimated annual economywide cost of the bill at $175 per household in 2020.\""That is the type of thing that simple adjustments in usage could offset,"" hesaid.\The CBO estimate goes far beyond electric rates, however. It includes more expensive goods and services, as well as the value of benefits such as rebates for low-income households, payments to utilities to help offset electricity rate increases, payments to businesses to help offset their costs, and payments to local and state governments.\Any electricity rate increases must be approved by the Kentucky Public Service Commission, said PSC spokesman Andrew Melnykovych. He said there are provisions to allow the companies to pass through the costs of complying with environmental regulations to their customers.\Also, Yarmuth said, he expects the bill's provisions supporting cleaner coal-burning technology and renewable energy will create jobs.\When the Senate takes up the issue, Louisville's Mitch McConnell will be fronting the opposition.\McConnell, the minority leader, declined to be interviewed, but a spokesman provided a McConnell transcript from Fox News, when the senator said the bill is ""going to cost jobs.""\""If we do have a global warming problem, and many people believe we do, we need to target it on a global basis.""\Costly for coal states\Kentucky and Indiana are more than 90 percent dependent on coal for their electricity, and are also leading coal producers. The bill is particularly costly for coal states because it penalizes the fuel -- which produces more carbon dioxide than other forms of energy -- as an electricity source, said Len Peters, secretary of the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet.\Gov. Steve Beshear did not take a position on the bill, saying that would have been premature given the pending Senate action.\Peters said Congress needs to do something, however.\""This is where the proverbial ounce of prevention is worth the pound of cure,"" Peters said. ""We can't wait until the effects (from global warming) are so huge we can't counteract them. We have to put in place policies and procedures that are mitigating greenhouse gas emissions.""\But with the House bill, he noted, estimates of just how much the legislation will cost are ""all over the map.""\Organizations doing the calculating use different methods to reach different conclusions.\The federal Environmental Protection Agency has said it would cost households $80 to $111 per year, while opponents of the bill have estimated much larger costs. The conservative Heritage Foundation says the bill ""would slap the equivalent of a $4,609 tax on a family of four by 2035.""\To some, like Sarah Lynn Cunningham, an environmental engineer and a leader of the Louisville Climate Action Network, higher electricity rates are a small price to pay for helping to save the planet.\""We live in a society that doesn't conserve what we think of as cheap,"" she said. ""As long as we keep thinking our energy is cheap, we are not going to use it efficiently.""\But others, including some business leaders and people who remain unconvinced of the threats from global warming, said they are concerned about the prospect of higher electricity bills.\""I don't buy the climate change rhetoric,"" said Bill Short, an LG&E customer. ""I wouldn't like it,"" he said of higher power bills.\Carmen Hickerson, spokeswoman for Greater Louisville Inc., the metro chamber of commerce, said Congress improved the bill with some of its amendments, ""but it's still really not great.""\Even E.On's new, lower projections for higher electricity bills are going to have a ""negative impact on industry and commerce,"" she said.\She said the Senate should give the industry more time to meet the targeted emission cuts. That would allow more opportunity to develop technology to curb carbon dioxide emissions, she said.\Local employers Ford Motor and General Electric are part of the U.S. Climate Action Partnership, which supported the House efforts to pass the climate change bill, as is DuPont, which has a chemical plant in Louisville, and Duke Energy, which operates the Gallagher power station across from downtown Louisville and serves customers in Indiana and Kentucky.\DuPont Chairman and former CEO Chad Holliday testified in support of the bill, telling Congress: ""The science on climate is sufficient to compel prudent action"" and ""voluntary efforts alone will not solve the climate problem.""\A Ford spokeswoman did not return telephone calls to discuss the bill and its impact on its Louisville factories.\But a senior attorney for General Electric's Louisville-based Consumer & Industrial division said all that's needed is some innovation and creativity.\Earl Jones, the GE attorney, acknowledged the bill contains millions of dollars in financial support to industries, like his, that are developing a new generation of energy efficient products. But he also said he doesn't believe that the rates will go as high as E.On estimates because of technology breakthroughs.\""We always look for ways to operate more efficiently and to reduce costs,"" Jones said.

Called ""cap and trade,"" the system would require cutting 2005 greenhouse gas emission levels by 17 percent in 11 years and 83 percent by 2050.\Creating an asset -- and a way to turn it into cash -- for polluters who clean up their operation has effectively addressed other problems such as sulfur dioxide, a cause of acid rain.\Under the bill, electric utilities would also have to produce 20 percent of their power from renewable sources such as wind, solar and wood or agricultural wastes by 2020. Utilities would be given the option of producing up to 8 percent less from renewables by operating energy efficiency programs for their customers. Another option for utilities would be to make payments to funds that support renewable energy.\Easily offset\Rep. John Yarmuth, D-3rd District, who voted for the bill, acknowledged the potential impact on consumers.\He said he was pleased that E.On is now saying the bill won't cost its customers as much, and said that its projections now are more in line with the Congressional Budget Office's estimated annual economywide cost of the bill at $175 per household in 2020.\""That is the type of thing that simple adjustments in usage could offset,"" Yarmuth said.\The CBO estimate goes far beyond electric rates, however. It includes more expensive goods and services, as well as the value of benefits such as rebates for low-income households, payments to utilities to help offset electricity rate increases, payments to businesses to help offset their costs, and payments to local and state governments.\Any electricity rate increases must be approved by the Kentucky Public Service Commission, said PSC spokesman Andrew Melnykovych. He said there are provisions to allow the companies to pass through the costs of complying with environmental regulations to their customers.\Also, Yarmuth said, he expects bill's provisions supporting cleaner coal burning technology and renewable energy will create jobs.\When the Senate takes up the issue, Louisville's Mitch McConnell will be fronting the opposition.\McConnell, the minority leader, declined to be interviewed, but a spokesman provided a McConnell transcript from Fox News, when the senator said the bill is ""going to cost jobs.""\""If we do have a global warming problem, and many people believe we do, we need to target it on a global basis.""\Costly for coal states\Kentucky and Indiana are more than 90 percent dependent on coal for their electricity, and are also leading coal producers. The bill is particularly costly for coal states because it penalizes the fuel -- which produces more carbon dioxide than other forms of energy -- as an electricity source, said Len Peters, secretary of the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet.\Gov. Steve Beshear did not take a position on the bill, saying that would have been premature given the pending Senate action.\Peters said Congress needs to do something, however.\""This is where the proverbial ounce of prevention is worth the pound of cure,"" Peters said. ""We can't wait until the effects (from global warming) are so huge we can't counteract them. We have to put in place policies and procedures that are mitigating greenhouse gas emissions.""\But with the House bill, he noted, estimates of just how much the legislation will cost are ""all over the map.""\Organizations doing the calculating use different methods to reach different conclusions.\The federal Environmental Protection Agency has said it would cost households $80 to $111 per year, while opponents of the bill have estimated much larger costs. The conservative Heritage Foundation says the bill ""would slap the equivalent of a $4,609 tax on a family of four by 2035.""\To some, like Sarah Lynn Cunningham, an environmental engineer and a leader of the Louisville Climate Action Network, higher electricity rates are a small price to pay for helping to save the planet.\""We live in a society that doesn't conserve what we think of as cheap,"" she said. ""As long as we keep thinking our energy is cheap, we are not going to use it efficiently.""\But others, including some business leaders and people who remain unconvinced of the threats from global warming, said they are concerned about the prospect of higher electricity bills.\""I don't buy the climate change rhetoric,"" said Bill Short, an LG&E customer. ""I wouldn't like it,"" he said of higher power bills.\Carmen Hickerson, spokeswoman for Greater Louisville Inc., the metro chamber of commerce, said Congress improved the bill with some of its amendments, ""but it's still really not great.""\Even E.On's new, lower projections for higher electricity bills are going to have a ""negative impact on industry and commerce,"" she said.\She said the Senate should give the industry more time to meet the targeted emission cuts. That would allow more opportunity to develop technology to curb carbon dioxide emissions, she said.\Local employers Ford Motor and General Electric are part of the U.S. Climate Action Partnership, which supported the House efforts to pass the climate change bill, as is DuPont, which has a chemical plant in Louisville, and Duke Energy, which operates the Gallagher power station across from downtown Louisville and serves customers in Indiana and Kentucky.\DuPont Chairman and former CEO Chad Holliday testified in support of the bill, telling Congress: ""the science on climate is sufficient to compel prudent action"" and ""voluntary efforts alone will not solve the climate problem.""\A Ford spokeswoman did not return telephone calls to discuss the bill and its impact on its two Louisville factories.\But a senior attorney for General Electric's Louisville-based Consumer & Industrial division said all that's needed is some innovation and creativity.'\Earl Jones, the GE attorney, acknowledged the bill contains millions of dollars in financial support to industries, like his, that are developing a new generation of energy efficient products. But he also said he doesn't believe that the rates will go as high as E.On estimates because of technology breakthroughs.\""We always look for ways to operate more efficiently and to reduce costs,"" Jones said. ""We are confident we will be able to figure out how to operate in an environment in which the cost of electricity may be rising.""\Reporter James Bruggers can be reached at (502) 582-4645.\Bill's highlights\Reducing greenhouse gases by 17 percent from 2005 levels by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050 through a cap-and-trade program that allows pollution permits to be bought and sold.\Limiting emissions from major industrial sources.

29,"As the nation decides which party will control the Senate this November, the race in Kentucky stands out for one big reason: Mitch McConnell.\Loathed by Democrats across the country as a cynical power broker but praised by Republicans as a shrewd political tactician, the GOP's longest-serving Senate majority leader is being challenged by a well-funded retired Marine lieutenant colonel and fighter pilot who flew in 89 combat missions, including bombings of al-Qaeda and the Taliban.\Though climate change likely won't be a key voting issue in the race, the candidates have approaches toward global warming in a state with a historic — but drastically shrinking — dependence on mining coal, a leading contributor to climate change.\Kentucky coal production in the second quarter of 2020 was down 83% from the same period a decade earlier. Coal mining jobs dropped from 17,111 to 3,760.\In Kentucky, temperatures are already rising. Growing seasons are changing, and there are concerns that heavier rains are causing more flooding.\Scientists have warned that it will get worse down the road, with decreasing crop yields and dangerous landslides on strip-mined mountain landscapes.\Amy McGrath has been frank in identifying the threats posed by global warming.\McConnell, for his part, has moderated his past statements: He now acknowledges that human-caused climate change exists.\For years, McConnell would not accept climate science, telling journalists that he did not know whether humans burning fossil fuels was contributing to global warming.\""I'm not a scientist,"" he would say, adding that his priority was Kentucky coal communities, even though their economic decline accelerated under his watch and some critics have said he should have done more to transition away from coal.\Still, McConnell has sent millions of dollars to the state's coal-mining counties over the years, and he has promised to stay ""committed to helping coal communities plan for the future with training and employment services as well as economic development,"" according to a statement his office provided in response to an interview request.\He opposed the global Paris climate agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions — a campaign spokeswoman called it ""disastrous"" — while McGrath thinks the Trump administration should not have withdrawn from the accord.\McConnell also is against the Green New Deal, the Congressional resolution backed by some Democrats — though not McGrath — that proposes a massive shift in federal spending to create jobs and hasten a transition to clean energy by 2050.\In March 2019, in discussing a ""show vote"" — engineered as a political trap for Democrats — on his own version of the Green New Deal, McConnell told reporters he believed in human-caused climate change.\""I do,"" the six-term Kentucky senator said. ""The question is, how do you address it? The way to do this consistent with American values and American capitalism is through technology and innovation. And there is no question that is the way to get results, not to shut down your economy, throw people out of work, make people reconstruct their homes, get out of their cars ... this is nonsense.""\McConnell tends to play defense on climate change.\He has not put forward his own climate plan, nor have Republicans in the Senate under his leadership.\After the House of Representatives passed cap-and-trade legislation in 2009, McConnell referred to the bill as the national energy tax and said he was glad to see its demise in the Senate, which did not put it up for a vote.\Now, McConnell is touting his support for carbon capture and storage — a technology embraced by many Republicans as a way to keep burning coal in a carbon-constrained world — and for budgets that include energy efficiency.\He favors, he says, ""common sense and actually attainable solutions to protect our environment.""\The League of Conservation Voters gives McConnell a 14% 2019 score and a 7% lifetime score for his votes on environmental legislation.\McConnell has defended his overall environmental record, mentioning his funding of local conservation efforts in Kentucky and his backing of this year's bipartisan Great American Outdoor Act.\The act, signed into law by President Donald Trump, provides $900 million in annual funding for public land protection and up to $1.9 billion a year for five years to fund a maintenance backlog at national parks, forests and wildlife refuges.\Both McConnell and McGrath have shown an ability to raise large amounts of money, with McGrath surprisingly in the lead as of the end of June, tapping into the pool of political contributors who want to see McConnell retired.\In an interview, McGrath spoke more forcefully about climate change than is typical for a major party nominee in Kentucky.\She said she sees climate change through the lens of her military training,\""This is a national security issue,"" she said. ""This is an international security issue.""\She added, ""We are already seeing weather patterns like we have never seen before. Wildfires we've never seen, desertification. We are going to see mass migrations.""\Low-lying military bases are being flooded from sea level rise, McGrath said. ""We have to plan for this. McConnell does not have a plan.""\When asked at a campaign stop in Louisville this summer what her plan for global warming would be, McGrath signaled support for Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's climate plan, giving it a tentative endorsement.\""There's a lot of what I have seen about it that is good,"" she said, adding that she understands it to be an aggressive proposal.\Biden in July announced a $2 trillion clean economy jobs program he calls ""Build Back Better,"" with jobs-creation and environmental justice as its pillars. Biden also wants Congress to pass emissions limits with ""an enforcement mechanism ... based on the principles that polluters must bear the full cost of the carbon pollution they are emitting.""\McGrath said putting a price on carbon appears to be an effective tool to combat climate change and has bipartisan appeal, but she said she would want to make sure it didn't hurt ""middle-class and working-class families.""\She likes the jobs and infrastructure aspects of Biden's plan, she said, but believes that coal is still essential and Biden should focus more on helping fossil-fuel dependent communities make an economic transition.\""We have a debt to pay to our coal communities, and legislation needs to account for that directly,"" McGrath said.\Talking about climate change from the perspective of military experience is a new approach for a politician in Kentucky, a state that has a history of supporting candidates who are sympathetic to coal, even outside of Kentucky's coalfields, said D. Stephen Voss, associate professor of political science at the University of Kentucky.\One example, he said, is how U.S. Rep. Andy Barr, R-Lexington, made former Democratic Congressman Ben Chandler pay a price in 2012 for his 2009 vote for the cap-and-trade bill.\Barr's campaign was able to paint Chandler, who served four terms representing the state's second-largest city and the horse country surrounding it, as anti-coal.\""What Amy McGrath is doing with environmental policy fits with how she handles many of the issues that bring down Democrats in a state like Kentucky,"" Voss said.\""She has been willing to offer a fairly typical Democratic Party issue platform, but she is experimenting with defending it and promoting it using language and attitudes that are more comfortable and familiar with places that tend to vote more Republican.""\Whether it will work, Voss said, he's not predicting. But he does not believe climate policy will play much of a role, if any, in the outcome of the McConnell-McGrath race.\It is not an issue that moves the people in the middle of the political spectrum who are so important to the outcome, he said.\A handful of polls have shown the race to be tight, according to FiveThirtyEight.\Environmental advocates had put their hopes behind state Rep. Charles Booker, a progressive whose ""hood to holler"" message had sought to connect the needs of voters in Black neighborhoods in Louisville with rural Appalachian voters, and whose surging Democratic primary campaign against McGrath came up short by 3 percentage points.\Some also felt resentful that McGrath, the moderate, was given a big advantage by the support of national Democrats early on.\""We built a movement across the state in support of a Green New Deal with the most progressive candidate Kentucky has ever seen,"" said Lily Gardner, a high school senior in Lexington who is active with the Sunrise Movement. ""We are left with a Democratic candidate who is completely unwilling to champion the solutions to the climate crisis that both science, and perhaps more importantly, justice demand.""\She said the youth climate movement will work to get out the vote this fall and support progressive candidates for local elections, but ""in no way will we be publicly endorsing McGrath or supporting her unless she makes a radical left turn.""\Despite McGrath's clear recognition of the problems of climate change — in stark contrast to McConnell — ""no one is fired up or excited,"" about her, said Wallace McMullen, a longtime clean energy and environmental advocate from Louisville, who is a Sierra Club leader in the state.\McGrath has not been endorsed by the Sierra Club in Kentucky, but she has also kept her distance from the group, said McMullen and Tom Morris, who chairs the Kentucky chapter's political committee.\""The sad fact is that sometimes statewide candidates don't want our endorsement in Kentucky,"" Morris said. ""We have not been able to get a response from her.""\As an alternative, the state chapter has issued a nonendorsement, of sorts, against McConnell.\""It basically says vote for anybody but Mitch,"" Morris said.\Morris, of Bowling Green, said he plans to vote for McGrath. He said he's pleased she recognizes that climate change is a problem and he was equally pleased to hear she has said good things about Biden's climate plans.\""McConnell's record speaks for itself,"" he added. ""He has blocked any kind of meaningful climate legislation. He supports Donald Trump and enabled Donald Trump, and that in itself has been sufficient reason to oppose him.""\McConnell is not popular in Kentucky, but Kentucky voters have shown repeatedly they prefer his clout to whatever competition he might have.\He has been favored in a state that hasn't voted for a Democratic president since the election of Bill Clinton 24 years ago and that gave Trump a 30-point victory in 2016.\One or two election cycles ago, a candidate with McGrath's understanding of the climate crisis would have been enough to elate the state's environmental community. That some are now saying ""meh"" is an indication of the growing sense of urgency among climate voters and represents a threat to her campaign.\Money is an equalizing influence in politics, and McGrath has been able to raise a lot of it. As more Republicans nationally endorse Biden amid questions about Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic and his character, there is a chance this could turn into a wave election against the president.\If that happens, all bets are off.\One thing, though, is for sure, if McGrath does win, it would be an upset of historical proportions.\InsideClimate News is a nonprofit, nonpartisan news outlet that covers climate, energy and the environment.

34,"Southern Baptists change course after BP spill, call for government regulation of environment\By Peter Smith\psmith@courier-journal.com\The Courier-Journal\As the BP oil disaster poisons the waters off the states where many of them live, Southern Baptists are issuing their most sweeping call ever for something they have long distrusted -- government regulation of the environment.\And a Louisville seminary dean who helped push through that resolution says the catastrophe has the potential to galvanize conservative evangelicals just like the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion.\""In many ways, this ecological catastrophe can provide the exact same awakening for evangelicals,"" said Russell Moore, dean of the School of Theology at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary and chairman of the resolutions committee at last week's meeting of the Southern Baptist Convention in Orlando, Fla.\In the resolution, passed overwhelmingly, the largest U.S. Protestant denomination, with 16 million members, called on ""governing authorities to act ... with undeterred resolve to end this crisis.""\It also called on those authorities ""to fortify our coastal defenses; to ensure full corporate accountability for damages, clean-up, and restoration; to ensure that government and private industry are not again caught without planning for such possibilities; and to promote future energy policies based on prudence, conservation, accountability, and safety.""\Catholic bishops and more moderate and liberal Protestant denominations have for years made strong calls for government environmental regulation.\Many evangelicals have joined them in recent years, including some individual Southern Baptists.\Past position\But as a group, the Southern Baptist denomination has emphasized good private stewardship of the environment, rather than government regulation.\In 2006, it charged that some unspecified government policy proposals were based on disputed claims of ""extremist"" and ""neo-pagan"" environmental groups.\Moore himself influenced a 2007 resolution that cast doubt on the ability of proposed carbon-emissions regulations to stop global warming.\Moore -- the top academic officer for the seminary under its president, Albert Mohler -- said that he stands by that view, adding that it's difficult to determine how such regulations will affect climate change.\But he acknowledges his thinking was profoundly changed during a recent trip to his native Biloxi, Miss.\And he said it's no coincidence that many Southern Baptists -- who live in large numbers along the Gulf Coast -- are taking the disaster personally.\Moore said that he saw an ""entire community numb"" in Biloxi, with family oyster-harvesting businesses in peril.\""When a hurricane comes through, everyone is apprehensive,"" but it's over soon enough and people can rebuild, he said. But the spill has no end in sight.\""There's simply this sense of waiting for apocalypse,"" he said.\Evangelicals who have called for more environmental activism say they are surprised and pleased with the Baptists' actions.\Moore has proven ""you don't have to compromise your core beliefs as a conservative or as a Christian to be an environmentalist,"" said Jonathan Merritt, a Southern Baptist author of the book ""Green Like God.""\""My hope is if this kind of transformation can happen with a conservative dean at one of the most conservative seminaries in the United States, then this type of experience can easily happen in the churches and pews and universities ... in even the most conservative places in the United States.""\Moore said that his argument is a conservative one -- that God ordained governments to restrain evil done by sinful humans. He denounced as ""outrageous"" the apology by U.S. Rep. Joe Barton to BP for the Obama administration's actions, and called talk-show titan Rush Limbaugh's defense of Barton ""reprehensible.""\""The Gulf of Mexico catastrophe shows us the failure of both private industry to do what it is right, and government to exercise oversight,"" he said. ""Regardless of what one thinks about the proper size of government, surely we can all agree that the law ought to ensure that corporations don't defraud or harm the populace.""\A pivotal change?\Robert Parham -- executive director of the Nashville-based Baptist Center for Ethics and longtime critic of the Southern Baptists' conservative leadership -- said the latest resolution marks a pivot away from the denomination's ""faithfulness to the political right.""\A Gallup survey in late May, a month after the Deepwater Horizon explosion, found 55 percent of Americans said they thought that environmental protection should take priority over energy production. That compared to 50 percent before the disaster.\A Pew Research Center survey in mid-June found more support for environmental protection than low gas prices among Americans overall and among Democrats and independents -- while more Republicans put a priority on low prices.\Richard Land, the Southern Baptists' chief lobbyist, said he agrees with the Southern Baptist resolution but cautioned against reading it as offering too much support for the government.\Land -- who in a radio broadcast emphasized the Obama administration and environmentalists' opposition to drilling in land reserves and shallower seas -- also faulted BP in a follow-up interview.\He said many Gulf residents are angry at government failures before and after the Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion.\""This is yet another blow to confidence in federal competence,"" said Land, president of the convention's Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission.\He added that any proposed support for a cap-and-trade policy on carbon fuels would have been ""smashed"" on the convention floor. ""This does not mean we've been converted to supporters of Al Gore,"" he said.\Even if Baptist leaders wanted to guide their members' environmental views, they're working in an era of declining denominational influence, said Mark Silk, director of the Leonard Greenberg Center for the Study of Religion in Public Life at Trinity College in Connecticut.\""It may be that they're following rather than leading"" a trend among their grassroots, Silk added.\Reporter Peter Smith can be reached at (502) 582-4469.\call for action\Read the full resolution at www.courier-journal.com.\Oil spill | Day 66\Robot mishap leads to cap removal, increasing flow of Gulf oil leak, A3."

Dan Mongiardo's campaign noted Attorney General Jack Conway's heavy investment in, and campaign money from, a big natural-gas company that has argued against huge taxpayer investment to capture the heat-trapping emissions that come from burning coal.\Conway countered that Kinder-Morgan Energy LP operates several coal terminals in Kentucky and circulated a story from the Hazard Herald (Mongiardo's hometown paper) in which the attorney general said he opposes the ""cap and trade"" emission-control system that the House and a Senate committee have passed to thwart climate change.\The issue has been Mongiardo's major attack point since July, when Conway said he favored cap-and-trade if it had provisions to protect businesses and consumers. Under attack, he soon abandoned that vague, have-cake-and-eat-it-too approach, but Mongiardo continues to run as the candidate of coal.\He follows conventional wisdom. Kentucky is the nation's No. 3 coal-producing state, and 91 percent of our electricity comes from burning the black rock to make steam that drives generators. That's just one kind of power.\The coal industry and its professional allies outside the state's two coalfields are big sources of campaign money, as most recently evidenced by Mongiardo's finance report last month and the big contributions of Alliance Coal, the underground-mine firm whose complaints apparently led to this month's dismissal of the state director of mine permits.\Yes, as the Kentucky Coal Association tells us in its radio commercials, ""Never underestimate the power of coal. Kentucky coal."" That's a double entendre, perhaps unintended, perhaps not. Given the history of this state, it's not bad advice. But times are changing, and it's time to ask ourselves and the candidates just how much coal means to us, to them and to our state. You might be surprised.\Kentucky's coal industry has shrunk. It employs about 19,000 people, only 0.9 percent of the state workforce. The industry says that for every mining job there are three other jobs, and many people work for companies that supply and service the industry. But calculating those multipliers can be tricky.\Coal jobs pay well, so they contribute more on average to Kentucky's economy, and the industry contributes through its sales and purchases. But the available data for mining in Kentucky (mostly coal, but also including limestone and more minor materials) show that its share of the gross state product isn't much greater than coal's share of jobs and has gone down in the last decade. Last year it was 1.45 percent.\At the same time, coal has never been more controversial. In addition to climate change, there is increasing concern about effects of the mercury and other pollutants it contains, and the impact of strip mining on the Cumberland-Allegheny Plateau. ""Mountaintop removal"" has become the generic if often inaccurate name for most surface mining in Central Appalachia, and it has become a catchphrase and rallying point.\Every five years, the Kentucky Environmental Education Council pays for a survey that asks Kentuckians to name the state's top environmental problems. Ten years ago and five years ago, the top three problems were water pollution, air pollution and waste management, in that order. This year, the top two were the same, but there was a new No. 3: mountaintop removal or strip mining in general.\Credit or blame for that, depending on your point of view, goes largely to heavy media coverage and commentary on the issue, and to the efforts of several Kentucky authors to make it a public concern. Many of them live outside the Appalachian coalfield, but the concern is just as great there. The poll, taken by the University of Kentucky's Survey Research Center, showed that in the 23 Appalachian counties that produce coal, mountaintop removal was rated probably the second-biggest problem or at least the third. (The error margin for the smaller sample makes it uncertain.)\The coal industry might argue that the big crowds it turned out for recent hearings on an Appalachian mining regulation show that it has coalfield opinion on its side. It may have a plurality, but probably not a majority, because many in the region want a middle ground.\In 2007, the Kellogg and Ford foundations commissioned polls in selected regions of rural America, and chose coal-rich Harlan and Letcher counties to represent Appalachia. The survey included this question: ""For the future of your community, do you think it is more important to use natural resources to create jobs, or to conserve natural resources for future generations?"" In the Kentucky counties, 37 percent said it was more important to create jobs, 33 percent said it was more important to conserve, and 30 percent volunteered that the two interests were equal or there should be a balance. If the middle ground had been offered as an option, it surely would have been the favorite.\Mongiardo defends mountaintop removal as a source of jobs and land for development. Conway, of Louisville, is somewhere in the middle. A year ago, he formally objected to the outgoing Bush administration's plan to all but repeal the regulation that prohibits mining activities within 100 feet of a stream. The change, which the Obama administration says it will reverse, removed a legal obstacle to the huge fills made up of blasted mountaintops.\Gov. Steve Beshear wrote a letter similar to Conway's. It may have been the first time since the federal strip-mine law passed that the governor of Kentucky had weighed in with the feds, publicly and formally, on the side of environmentalists and citizens' groups and against the coal industry.\Beshear appointed as his energy and environment secretary a highly respected chemical engineer, Len Peters, who seems to be steering a pragmatic and realistic course; he told a forum at UK last month, ""Coal is not a Kentucky problem, it's a national problem."" It's also unusual for a person in his position to refer to coal, generally, as a problem. But it is, and at least Conway acknowledges that.\Al Cross, former Courier-Journal political writer, is director of the Institute for Rural Journalism and Community Issues in the School of Journalism and Telecommunications at the University of Kentucky.

36,"but utility bills might rise\By James Bruggers\jbruggers@courier-journal.com\The Courier-Journal\The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency proposed the first national rules for curbing mercury and other toxic emissions from coal-fired power plants Wednesday, predicting they would save tens of thousands of lives but likely drive up utility rates.\If enacted as planned later this year, the rules would reduce mercury emissions from power plants by as much as 91 percent over the next three or four years, while costing the nation's utilities about $11billion annually, EPA officials said.\""But the benefits are 10 times as much,"" EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson said at a Washington, D.C., news conference. She said utility bills could increase ""about $3 or $4 a month"" for the typical household.\The new rules, which would replace Bush-era regulations thrown out by the federal courts, also seek to curb other toxic emissions such as arsenic, chromium and acid gases.\They are of particular importance in Kentucky and Indiana, where coal-fired power plants supply more than 90 percent of the states' electricity.\Environmentalists and some medical doctors have called the Louisville area a mercury ""hot spot"" because of its concentration of coal-fired plants. Two are within the city limits, and another is across the Ohio River in New Albany, Ind.\EPA data from 2009 show that Jefferson County ranks 81st among more than 3,000 counties in the nation for smokestack emissions of mercury. Jefferson County, Ind., ranks 69th, and Spencer County, Ind., ranks 18th.\""One hundred percent of Kentucky streams have fish-consumption advisories due to mercury, so I would characterize it as an area that needs to be addressed,"" said John Lyons, director of the Kentucky Division for Air Quality.\Indiana also has widespread mercury warnings on eating fish.\Health benefits touted\Jackson said the announcement was ""20 years in the making. ... With the help of existing technologies, we will be able to take reasonable steps that will provide dramatic protections to our children and loved ones, preventing premature deaths, heart attacks, and asthma attacks.""\Mercury is a potent neurotoxin that has been shown to cause neurological damage, including lower IQ in children exposed in the womb and during early development.\Power plants are responsible for half of mercury and more than half of acid gas emissions in the U.S., the EPA said. The rules also would affect industrial oil burners.\Together, the new rules would reduce the number of premature deaths by 2016 by as many as 17,000 per year, the EPA said.\EPA officials said they expect an annual decline of 120,000 cases of aggravated asthma; 12,200 emergency room visits; 11,000 nonfatal heart attacks; and 850,000 missed days of work.\Higher costs expected\Industry officials accused the EPA of exaggerating the benefits and underestimating the costs of the rules.\Jeff Holmstead, the assistant EPA administrator for air under President George W. Bush, said the rules, combined with pending ones, could also force the retirement of as many as a third of the nation's coal-fired power plants.\""What it means is you are going to have to replace that (coal) power with power that is significantly more expensive,"" he said.\Duke Energy is moving toward converting its Gallagher plant in New Albany to natural gas. ""We'll make a decision by the end of the year,"" said Erin Culbert, a Duke spokeswoman.\Culbert said her company is reviewing the proposed rules and expects they will cost the company money to comply. But she said Duke anticipated the rules and that most of its larger plants are already removing 70 percent to 90 percent of their mercury emissions.\LG&E and Kentucky Utilities officials have said they, too, are considering retiring some of their old coal-fired plants or replacing them with natural gas plants.\Wednesday, spokesman Brian Phillips said the utilities would comply with whatever new rules the EPA imposes.\""Our No. 1 concern is timing,"" he said, adding that it would be a challenge to comply by 2015.\""In the past five years, we have spent $1.1billion in environmental upgrades to reduce emissions at our facilities,"" he said. Although made to reduce other types of regulated pollutants, the efforts also have resulted in reducing mercury, he said.\The Louisville Metro Air Pollution Control District adopted its own toxic-air reduction program in 2005 because federal rules were found lacking, but mercury wasn't one of its main targets.\But city officials want to determine whether its program is more or less stringent than the proposed federal rules, district spokesman Matt Stull said.\Gary Revlett, environmental affairs director for LG&E and KU, said he expects the new rules would require additional pollution controls at its facilities throughout the state, potentially at significant cost.\'Cap and trade' out\In 2005, the EPA under President George W. Bush unveiled a rule that it said would reduce mercury pollution from coal-fired power plants 70 percent over 13 years -- the rule that was vacated by a federal court three years later.\It would have set up a ""cap-and-trade"" approach, where utilities that made cuts could sell credits to those that didn't.\The new approach proposed by the Obama administration requires all plants to meet emission limits.\Environmentalists praised the rules, which would require power companies to install the ""maximum achievable control technology"" on its plants within three or four years of their enactment.\Emission limits would be based on what the top-performing plants are already achieving, the agency said.\""This is historic,"" said Frank O'Donnell of Clean Air Watch. The EPA would bring the dirtiest and most toxic coal power plants up to the standards of today's cleanest plants. This would protect public health, clean up the environment and create jobs.""\Jackson said the rules would create 31,000 short-term construction jobs and 9,000 long-term utility jobs.\Tom FitzGerald, director of the Kentucky Resources Council, noted how mercury from power-plant emissions has gotten into Kentucky waterways, where it is taken up by fish.\""With the level of mercury in all the fisheries in this state, any step that the EPA is going to take to reduce mercury is a welcome move,"" he said.\Holmstead said the next move might be in Congress, where Republicans have become increasingly critical of the EPA and have sponsored legislation to curb its powers.\Sen.

38,"
WASHINGTON -- Of the two main American political parties, Republicans are now clearly distinguished by their driving desire to lose. Every faction seems determined to rule the kingdom of irrelevance.
\
Witness the reaction to the National Council for a New America - an anodyne ""listening tour"" by Republican officials recently kicked off at a pizza parlor in Northern Virginia. Social conservatives attacked this forum on education and the economy for the offense of not being a forum on abortion and the traditional family. Neo-Reaganites searched the transcript for nonexistent slights: How dare former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush criticize ""nostalgia"" for the ""good old days?"" Why didn't he just spit on Ronald Reagan's grave? Other conservatives criticized the very idea of a listening tour, asking, ""What's to hear?""
\
During a recent conversation, Bush described himself as ""dumfounded by the reaction."" He added: ""I don't think listening is a weakness. People are yearning to be heard. Perhaps we should begin with a little humility.""
\
There is much for Republicans to be humble about. The party, says Bush, faces ""dramatically changing demographics, especially Hispanics in swing states,"" the ""alienation of young voters"" and an unprecedented drop in support among college graduates.
\
""Trying to be all things to all people isn't going to work,"" Bush contends. The goal is ""not to redefine our beliefs, but to recognize challenges and adapt,"" particularly on the issues of national security, health care, education, the economy and the environment. Republicans need to ""focus on creating policies relevant to today - not things relevant 20, 30 or 40 years ago.""
\
Jeb Bush insists that this focus on creative policy can be unifying because ""conservatives have more in common than they disagree on."" And the Republican Party has been unified in opposition to President Obama's disturbing accumulation of federal debt and power. But on other issues, it seems to me that Republicans are likely to pass through a series of wrenching debates before they arrive at ""policies relevant to today.""
\
Take the environment. For many Americans, especially the young, concern about carbon emissions and climate disruption is no longer a conviction; it is a value. It is possible that climate change skeptics - the dominant Republican voices - have uncovered a vast scientific delusion, like the belief in phlogiston or phrenology. But given the compelling evidence from glaciology, botany and marine biology, this seems unlikely.
\
Republicans have distinctive contributions to make on climate policy.
\
They might support a carbon tax instead of a cumbersome cap-and-trade system. They should insist that all revenues gained from a carbon tax or the sale of pollution permits go back to the American people in lower taxes. But the main policy choice is binary: Should a cost be imposed on carbon emissions? If Republicans generally say no, they will not be viewed as belonging to an environmental party.
\
A similar argument can be made concerning health care. Obamacare, in its nascent form, seems deeply flawed - using a system of fines, new bureaucracies and subsides to push workers toward a plan resembling Medicare. Republicans have long supported alternatives that subsidize the individual ownership of private health insurance. But these proposals generally have been incremental, poorly explained and largely ignored.
\
A credible Republican alternative would employ a more generous refundable tax credit that enables the working poor to purchase basic health insurance - essentially creating an entitlement to health care through the private insurance system. This is perhaps the only real alternative to the slow socialization of American health care. It is also costly.
\
Or consider immigration. Immigrants hold diverse political views, but they also make a determination about parties and politicians: Do they welcome us? The answer from Republicans has often been equivocal. Some of this is a matter of tone. But it is difficult to imagine a remedy to this impression of resentment without Republican support for immigration reform that includes a legal status for temporary workers and a realistic path to citizenship.
\
Each of these policies - carbon restrictions, universal health insurance and immigration reform - could eventually be important to the Republican recovery. But would a candidate carrying these ideas transform the Republican Party, or be destroyed by it? The hostile reaction to the pizza parlor putsch provides one answer.
\
But this is a snapshot, not a prophecy. As the years pass, the kingdom of irrelevance seems less and less pleasant, even to its rulers. Policy shifts that seem incredible become inevitable. This is how a party prepares to win.

39,"The polls were encouraging for Kentucky Democrats in late July, showing Ben Chandler with a double-digit lead over challenger Andy Barr in the 6th Congressional District and Jack Conway running even with, or in striking distance of, Rand Paul in the U.S. Senate race. But a closer look at the numbers, and the media environment, should encourage Republicans.\The greatest challenge in election polling is getting a sample of respondents most likely to cast a ballot. When called by live or recorded interviewers, the vast majorities usually say they're certain to vote, but when the election is held, actual voter turnout is often less than half of what that threshold question indicates. That is especially true in a non-presidential election like this year's.\Many consider voting both a virtue and an obligation, something society expects, so they say they will vote. That may reflect their intentions, but when Election Day comes, they forget, or other things seem more important. The elections are often decided by those who are strongly motivated. Intensity of support can be crucial.\This year, Republicans have more motivation and intensity. National polls have shown GOP voters much more strongly motivated to cast ballots, and no wonder. For millions of Americans upset with the direction of the country, Nov. 2 will be their first clear chance to send a message, and messengers, to Washington and President Obama.\That is a big worry for Democrats in Kentucky, where Obama's job approval rating hovers around 40 percent and his disapproval is in the mid- to high 50s. More important (remember the intensity factor), 42 percent of voters in the Insight cable-TV company's cn|2 poll said they strongly disapproved of Obama's work. Only 15 percent strongly approved.\The President is so unpopular that few Kentucky Democrats speak up for him, and most of the party's candidates in the state keep their distance.\Asked by conservative WHAS Radio talk-show host Mandy Connell on Wednesday to give the Obama administration a grade, and say if it had overstepped its bounds or ""expanded government in way you are uncomfortable with,"" Conway said. ""I would give the Obama administration a B minus.""\Conway said the administration has, both with legislation and regulations, ""overreached in cap and trade,"" the issue that seems to trouble him most because of his early flirtation with the concept and Kentucky's dependence on coal for its electricity. He reflected the received wisdom of Democrats inside the Beltway, but still managed to attack Washington and temper his support for ""Obamacare,"" as he said, ""The thing that upset people about the health-care reform debate was that people were losing their jobs ... and here was this 14-month process where people were cutting backroom deals.""\Conway's a good talker in such situations, but it will take plenty of talking to overcome Republican efforts to make the elections a referendum on Obama. And the traditional pattern for a mid-term federal election is likely to be even stronger this year, because of a media environment that favors Republicans.\Yes, Republicans -- those folks who most often complain that ""the media is"" biased against them.\""Media"" is a plural, and media are more pluralistic than ever, thanks to the Internet and cable television. Not all media are news media, though some masquerade as journalists, like the blogger who briefly brought down Agriculture Department official Shirley Sherrod with a misleading video.\But it is such information sources, who have a partisan or philosophical agenda, that are driving coverage in mainstream media, and stealing audience from traditional news media that still adhere to journalistic ideals of fairness and verification.\The trend is partly a function of human nature. People are drawn to information sources that confirm their existing beliefs and do not challenge them. And as media outlets have proliferated, the audience has been fractionalized, making news outlets hungry for readers, listeners and viewers but short of the resources they once had to gather news. Some rely more on opinion; it's a lot cheaper to put a talking head on the air than it is to pay journalists to dig up facts.\The bottom line is that the market for opinion in our republic has increased, while the market for fact has decreased. ""There is only a small market for moderation and reason,"" John Harris, who moved from The Washington Post to edit the mainly online outlet Politico, wrote recently.\Those trends cannot be good for democracy. ""Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not to his own facts,"" said the late Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat who worked for Republicans before becoming a senator.\But facts on candidates in Kentucky Senate races can be hard to come by, especially on local television.\In the 2008 race between Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell and Democrat Bruce Lunsford, TV stations in Lexington (the only significant market entirely in Kentucky) got more than $3.8 million for 13,799 commercials -- about 115 hours of mostly misleading opinion. But the stations invested little of that largesse in news coverage; from Sept. 1 through Election Day, their news reports on the races totaled less than four hours -- a ratio of 30 to 1 -- and most of the reports were short and superficial, often focused on horse-race coverage.\Things are unlikely to be better this year. The Conway-Paul race has an even higher national profile, the Supreme Court has made it much easier for corporations and unions to spend on political campaigns, and interest groups on both sides are amassing millions that will be used mainly for attack ads -- which are likely to depress turnout among voters, mainly moderates, who aren't intensely motivated.\Conway has yet to demonstrate that he can develop intensity of support, so his main hope lies in developing intensity of opposition to Paul. As he tries to make the race a referendum on the controversial Republican, his hope rests mainly with moderates, but they seem to be a shrinking piece of the electoral pie. In the cn|2 poll, only 25 percent identified themselves as moderates, and 50 percent said they were conservatives, probably a record high.

And as media outlets have proliferated, the audience has been fractionalized, making news outlets hungry for readers, listeners and viewers but short of the resources they once had to gather news. Some rely more on opinion; it's a lot cheaper to put a talking head on the air than it is to pay journalists to dig up facts.\The bottom line is that the market for opinion in our republic has increased, while the market for fact has decreased. ""There is only a small market for moderation and reason,"" John Harris, who moved from The Washington Post to edit the mainly online outlet Politico , wrote recently.\Those trends cannot be good for democracy. ""Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not to his own facts,"" said the late Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat who worked for Republicans before becoming a senator.\But facts on candidates in Kentucky Senate races can be hard to come by, especially on local television.\In the 2008 race between Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell and Democrat Bruce Lunsford, TV stations in Lexington (the only significant market entirely in Kentucky) got more than $3.8 million for 13,799 commercials -- about 115 hours of mostly misleading opinion. But the stations invested little of that largesse in news coverage; from Sept. 1 through Election Day, their news reports on the races totaled less than four hours -- a ratio of 30 to 1 -- and most of the reports were short and superficial, often focused on horse-race coverage.\Things are unlikely to be better this year. The Conway-Paul race has an even higher national profile, the Supreme Court has made it much easier for corporations and unions to spend on political campaigns, and interest groups on both sides are amassing millions that will be used mainly for attack ads -- which are likely to depress turnout among voters, mainly moderates, who aren't intensely motivated.\Conway has yet to demonstrate that he can develop intensity of support, so his main hope lies in developing intensity of opposition to Paul. As he tries to make the race a referendum on the controversial Republican, his hope rests mainly with moderates, but they seem to be a shrinking piece of the electoral pie. In the cn|2 poll, only 25 percent identified themselves as moderates, and 50 percent said they were conservatives, probably a record high. The winds blow Paul's way.\Al Cross, former Courier-Journal political writer, is director of the Institute for Rural Journalism and Community Issues in the School of Journalism and Telecommunications at the University of Kentucky.

This country needs more nuclear power plants and soon if we are to reduce our national carbon footprint as environment groups have long urged.
\
On Wednesday, five environmental groups petitioned federal regulators to block the only commercial nuclear reactor now under construction in the U.S. - an unfinished 1970s-era reactor that Tennessee Valley Authority hopes to bring on-line in 2012.
\
The groups claim TVA failed to consider the impact on the Tennessee River, public health and safety and the utility's need for more electricity when it revived a 1976 application for an operating license for the Watts Bar Plant Unit 2 reactor near Spring City, Tenn.
\
These groups' arguments appear weak.
\
The irony of organizations that want to reduce carbon emissions opposing the licensing of a facility that would generate zero CO2 is simply delicious.
\
The cost of producing nuclear energy has decreased markedly. These plants are expensive to build, but they are relatively inexpensive to operate. This plant is already 25 percent complete.
\
As far as safety is concerned, can anyone recall any major disasters that have been caused by the six reactors that TVA already operates? The problems at Three Mile island are decades in the past.
\
Cap and trade legislation, which recently passed the U.S. House of Representatives, is designed in part to encourage clean energy by making sources such as coal-fired generating plants more expensive.
\
Since a high percentage of our state's electricity is generated from coal, the sticker shock of higher utility bills will impact our state more than most. This makes it even more important to the parts of our state that receive TVA power, including Bowling Green, that this plant be completed.
\
The U.S. created the technology to build nuclear, but in recent years we have lagged while many other nations have pressed ahead.
\
France, for example, provides nearly 70 percent of its power through nuclear energy.
\
This reactor and others which must be built can provide electricity at competitive prices without CO2 emissions.
\
Environmental groups can't have it both ways by advocating less carbon emissions while contesting the licenses of facilities that are a significant component of reaching that goal.

U.S. Rep. Brett Guthrie, R-Bowling Green, continues to fill his campaign coffers, having raised more than $1 million since the beginning of the year, about $100,000 of it since the first quarter of the year.
\
But his opponent in the 2nd Congressional District, Democrat Ed Marksberry, of Owensboro, has not yet raised the $5,000 that would have required him to file a report by midnight Thursday.
\
""We were waiting until after this ... report to begin fundraising,"" Marksberry said. ""First you strategize and organize and then you raise money.""
\
Marksberry said he has been busy garnering endorsements, some of which will be announced soon, before seeking contributions. He has several upcoming fundraisers scheduled, including some in Bowling Green.
\
The greatest percentage of Guthrie's money this year has come from political action committees. Nearly $600,000 came from those committees.
\
""In the tough economy, it's difficult to go back to the same people each time to ask for further contributions,"" Guthrie said.
\
Guthrie said he has had a few fundraising activities in Washington.
\
Still, many of the same Kentucky residents have willingly contributed, $409,000 in total since the beginning of the year.
\
Guthrie said the PACs that have contributed toward his campaign tend to be affiliated with business groups such as insurance agents or builders.
\
""For the most part, PACs align themselves with people because they believe in the same issues that they support, not the other way around,"" he said.
\
Even some of those PAC contributions have local ties because local residents have asked the PACs to which they belong to support Guthrie, he said.
\
Guthrie said he's not completely sure why one PAC, US Cuba Democracy PAC, contributed $1,000 toward his campaign.
\
""I know they are interested in (ultimately) seeing a change in Cuba's government,"" he said of the Miami-based group.
\
But the group also opposes opening U.S. trade with Cuba, upon which Guthrie said he is still deciding his position, since Kentucky's agriculture community would favor a lax in trade rules.
\
One individual campaign contribution was made over the Internet by a foreign national, so Guthrie had to send the $250 contribution back.
\
The woman was a Western Kentucky University master's of business administration candidate from China who was an intern at Trace Die Cast, Guthrie's family's company.
\
""She just made the contribution over the Internet one night,"" Guthrie said. ""When I was filling out my thank you cards for contributions, I saw the name and knew it was her, so I had to send it back.""
\
Guthrie said he is pleased with the amount of money raised thus far and doesn't know the impact of his opponent's lack of financing for the race.
\
""We still have to take running very seriously,"" Guthrie said. ""We are in a very different environment ... people are very in tune with what is going on in Washington.""
\
Guthrie said he continues to hold to his beliefs that government spending has to be stemmed, that cap-and-trade on energy carbons is bad for business and that health care reform won't do what it has promised.
\
In campaigning across the 21-county 2nd District, Marksberry said he has had ""fun"" meeting so many people.
\
""I'm a working guy and people seemed to be refreshed that they are speaking with someone who has a middle-class voice,"" he said. ""Kentucky is a working-class state.""

In a new Gallup Poll asking who is the national leader of the Republican Party, Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels didn't even rate an asterisk. That's unsurprising. The governor of the country's 16th most populous state won't normally garner much national attention, especially when he's an unassuming, old-school budget cutter.
\
It's also a shame, because more than any other Republican officeholder, Daniels points the way ahead for his bedraggled party. He's a Reaganite who's not trapped in 1980s nostalgia; he's a fiscal conservative who believes not just in limiting government, but in reforming it to address people's everyday concerns; he's a politician of principle who refuses to sell his program in off-puttingly partisan or ideological terms.
\
As they grapple with President Barack Obama, Republicans at the national level could do worse than ask themselves: What would Daniels do?
\
At a recent forum in Washington sponsored by the Bradley Foundation and Hudson Institute, Daniels noted that Ralph Waldo Emerson said every polity tends to have a party of memory and a party of hope. ""Hope"" has of late become a kind of swearword for conservatives, so Daniels could have been expected to be winding up for a jab at Obama. Instead, he said, ""We must be, as we have been in our better days, our more successful days, a party of hope.""
\
Daniels went on to give a plug for empathy as an animating attitude for the GOP: ""We must not only assert, but assert with credibility, that we understand what is going on in the lives of everyday people."" His pitch included a plug for Republicans directing themselves ""almost entirely to the young people of this country."" In Indiana, Daniels explained, the GOP is ""the party of purpose,"" arrayed against Democrats who are ""reactionary"" and ""negative"" - ""everything we must not be, as we address national events.""
\
If this sounds like a call for a mushy me-tooism, it isn't. When Daniels took office, the state had an $800 million deficit. He turned it into a $1.3 billion surplus (although it will be eaten into in the current downturn). Since 2005, he's saved roughly $450 million in the state's budget and reduced the state's rate of spending growth from 5.9 percent to 2.8 percent. ""I tell you with certainty,"" Daniels told his Washington audience, ""concern about the debt and deficit has not gone out of style.""
\
""Mitch the Knife,"" as he was nick-named when he headed George W. Bush's Office of Management and Budget, has matched his fiscal probity with the restless innovation of a devoted policy entrepreneur. He leased the state's faltering toll road to a European operator for nearly $4 billion. He created health savings accounts for Indiana's poor. He deregulated telecommunications. And he attracted business to the state, with Indiana winning more foreign investment than any other state during the past two years.
\
A populist outcry against the toll-road deal dragged Daniels' approval rating down to 37 percent at one point, and his tenure seemed a warning against putting a tightfisted technocrat in elected office. But opinion turned. He won re-election by 18 points last year. He won 20 percent of the black vote, and beat his Democratic opponent among voters under age 30 by 7 points.
\
Daniels counsels national Republicans to adopt a ""no, but"" approach. As he told an interviewer from National Journal, on cap-and-trade he'd say: ""No, let's not double the tax on poor people in the vain hope of moving the world's thermometer. Here's a way to conserve energy and protect the environment that doesn't impoverish the nation."" On health care, he'd say, ""Sure, let's get people covered with health insurance, but here's a much better way.""
\
His success has stoked speculation about a possible 2012 presidential run. Daniels has made Shermanesque disavowals of national ambitions, and expressed confidence that new national leaders will soon emerge. When they do, they should heed the lesson and message of Mitch Daniels, an exemplar of a winning conservatism.

No, this one measure will not halt or reverse human-induced warming of the atmosphere. But the rule is necessary in the context of seeking international consensus on solutions -- and also significant in its own right.\Before Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Gina McCarthy could announce the new rule Monday, critics were already bellowing about higher energy rates and lost jobs. They pretended not to see that President Barack Obama -- as with health care reform -- is taking what ought to be seen as a GOP-friendly approach.\The rule, which will not become final until next year, gives states great flexibility in how they reach the target. They are not forced to immediately begin shutting down the aging coal-fired power plants that constitute one of the biggest sources of carbon pollution. Rather, each state can take the path that best fits its circumstances -- ramping up the generation of energy from renewable sources such as wind and solar, for example, or entering regional cap-and-trade agreements.\Ultimately, however, hundreds of those aging, dirty, coal-fired plants will have to close. If the planet could speak, it would say good riddance.\Many of those who do not believe in climate change also reject the idea that carbon dioxide can be called a pollutant, since it is a natural and necessary component of the air we breathe. But direct measurement shows that the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased by an astounding 40 percent since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, when humankind began burning fossil fuels in earnest. As with any poison -- or pollutant -- it's the dose that counts.\This thickening pall of human-generated carbon dioxide -- which traps heat, according to universally accepted principles of physics and chemistry -- has coincided with a long-term rise in average temperatures that agrees with climate scientists' predictions. The big unanswered question isn't scientific, it's political: Will we continue to turn up the thermostat?\The question that some skeptics like to pose -- ""Why should the United States take such a big step on its own?"" -- is meaningless, when you think about it.\China is the world's largest emitter of carbon dioxide. Emissions are rising sharply in India and other rapidly industrializing countries. Nothing the United States does unilaterally, or even in concert with Europe and Japan, can solve the problem. What we really need is a global solution.\All this is true, but one fewer ton of carbon makes an incremental difference, however slight. Obama's major energy initiatives -- higher fuel economy standards for vehicles, plus the new power plant emissions rule -- will mean billions of tons less of carbon dioxide in the air. It is true that we cannot save the planet on our own. But it is also true that if warming-induced disaster is inevitable, it will arrive sooner if we fail to act.\Meanwhile, Chinese and Indian universities are full of scientists who are warning their own governments about the negative impacts of carbon emissions. China has already signaled its intention to move away from coal, and while this is easier said than done, Chinese officials have an added incentive: The noxious smog that shrouds major cities, most of it from coal-fired power plants, has stoked real anger among the country's burgeoning urban middle class. In other industrializing countries as well, as people get richer they will demand a cleaner environment.\Obama hopes that action by the United States, the richest country in the world, will make it possible for the other big carbon emitters to act. Some of the domestic critics who scoff at this notion also complain that Obama, in their view, does not sufficiently assert U.S. leadership around the globe. What do these people think leadership means, if not actually leading?\The bonus is that closing coal-fired power plants will encourage the development of cleaner energy sources. The power generation industry was already moving toward cheap, plentiful natural gas, which releases much less carbon. Gas should be seen as a bridge toward clean, renewable energy sources -- an industry that will be huge in the 21st century.\It's our choice. We can try our best to ensure that the next industrial revolution -- the one that ends dependence on fossil fuels -- happens here. Or we can watch it happen in China.\Write to Robinson at eugenerobinson@washpost.com.\Eugene Robinson\Columnist"

There may be a time when John Boehner becomes a hate figure. Say, after he loses a government-shutdown fight with the president and makes enough radioactive comments that he starts to glow - Newt Gingrich's path to notoriety in the 1990s.
\
Until then, the leader of a Republican House minority that's routinely been trampled by Democrats with their 70-vote margin is not going to make a deep impression, no matter how much President Barack Obama inveighs against his callous disregard for all that is right and good.
\
It must have been a sad, desultory meeting of White House strategists when they settled on an anti-Boehner campaign: ""Well, we could run on our economic record, except, well ... there's always ObamaCare, except, well ... the change we brought to Washington? I know, I know ... hey, how about that perpetually tanned Republican? Let's run against that guy!""
\
The Democratic firm Public Policy Polling recently found that 42 percent of voters in Boehner's home state of Ohio have no opinion of him. According to a Fox News poll earlier this year, 55 percent of people nationally had never heard of him. The White House figures people will hate Boehner with an unbridled passion - if only they could remember his name.
\
This is the very definition of sliding-off-a-cliff, grasping-at-saplings desperation. Obama traveled to Cleveland last week to give a speech responding to an economic address by Boehner there a couple of weeks prior. Boehner's speech had mostly been ignored by the press at the time, since it hadn't occurred to anyone that he was the pivot upon which the future of the nation would turn.
\
Obama excoriated Boehner for fighting against his economic policies. With a less hostile intent, this attack on Boehner could have been an advertisement for him. According to Gallup, the only major piece of Obama legislation that Boehner said ""no"" to that's popular is financial reform. A majority disapproves of everything else: the stimulus, auto bailout and health-care reform.
\
Never letting a White House attack line go to waste, The New York Times immediately ran a front-page article on Boehner, ""A G.O.P Leader Tightly Bound to Lobbyists."" It combined nonrevelations (a pro-business Republican works with business lobbyists) with incredible claims (one anonymous lobbyist implied that Boehner opposed cap-and-trade, a policy anathema to conservative Republicans, as a favor).
\
The Republicanism of John Boehner is not particularly inspiring, but neither is it threatening. You're likelier to see him at an outing at a fancy golf resort than leading a fanciful, ideological crusade. If he lacks the intellectual flair of the last Republican House minority leader who became speaker in an electoral rout, Newt Gingrich, he also lacks his manic grandiosity. He's perfectly suited as a solid, conservative check on the overly liberal, hubristic young man who's president of the United States.
\
The White House doesn't seem to care that in sending the president out after Boehner in attack-dog mode, it's diminishing him. Why waste the majesty of his teleprompter on the House minority leader? This is usually the demeaning work of a chairman of the Democratic National Committee, who no one expects to rise above partisan hackery.
\
Obama's political team thinks it can find some gimmicky way out of its predicament. A few months ago, it fastened on the gaffe of another Republican no one had heard of, the ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, who offered (an instantly retracted) apology to BP for its treatment at the hands of the government. Democrats had barely finished congratulating themselves on their brilliance than the entire episode was forgotten.
\
The election is about large things: The tectonic shift to the left undertaken by Democrats during the past two years, and the enormous public reaction against it. In this environment, John Boehner is but a dot on a vast electoral tide. Obama's focus on him speaks to a self-deluding lack of perspective. What else is new?

WASHINGTON -- Most people don't remember ObamaCare's notorious Section 1233, mandating government payments for end-of-life counseling. It aroused so much anxiety as a possible first slippery step on the road to state-mandated late-life rationing that the Senate never included it in the final health care law.
\
Well, it's back - by administrative fiat. A month ago, Medicare issued a regulation providing for end-of-life counseling during annual ""wellness"" visits. It was all nicely buried amid the simultaneous release of hundreds of new Medicare rules.
\
Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., author of Section 1233, was delighted. ""Mr. Blumenauer's office celebrated 'a quiet victory,' but urged supporters not to crow about it,"" reports The New York Times. Deathly quiet. In early November, his office sent an e-mail plea to supporters: ""We would ask that you not broadcast this accomplishment out to any of your lists ... e-mails can too easily be forwarded."" They had been lucky that ""thus far, it seems that no press or blogs have discovered it. ... The longer this (regulation) goes unnoticed, the better our chances of keeping it.""
\
So much for Democratic transparency - and for their repeated claim that the more people learn what is in the health care law, the more they will like it. Turns out ignorance is the Democrats' best hope.
\
And regulation is their perfect vehicle - so much quieter than legislation. Consider two other regulatory usurpations in just the last few days:
\
On Dec. 23, the Interior Department issued Secretarial Order 3310 reversing a 2003 decision and giving itself the authority to designate public lands as ""Wild Lands."" A clever twofer: (1) a bureaucratic power grab - for seven years up through Dec. 22, wilderness designation had been the exclusive province of Congress, and (2) a leftward lurch - more land to be ""protected"" from such nefarious uses as domestic oil exploration in a country disastrously dependent on foreign sources.
\
The very same day, the president's Environmental Protection Agency declared that in 2011 it would begin drawing up anti-carbon regulations on oil refineries and power plants, another power grab effectively enacting what Congress had firmly rejected when presented as cap-and-trade legislation.
\
For an Obama bureaucrat, however, the will of Congress is a mere speed bump. Hence this regulatory trifecta, each one moving smartly left - and nicely clarifying what the spirit of bipartisan compromise that President Obama heralded in his post-lame-duck Dec. 22 news conference was really about: a shift to the center for public consumption and political appearance only.
\
On that day, Obama finally embraced the tax-cut compromise he had initially excoriated, but only to avoid forfeiting its obvious political benefit - its appeal to independent voters who demand bipartisanship and are the key to Obama's re-election. But make no mistake: Obama's initial excoriation in his angry Dec. 7 news conference was the authentic Obama. He hated the deal.
\
Now as always, Obama's heart lies left. For those fooled into thinking otherwise by the new Obama of Dec. 22, his administration's defiantly liberal regulatory moves - on the environment, energy and health care - should disabuse even the most beguiled.
\
These regulatory power plays make political sense. Because Obama needs to appear to reclaim the center, he will stage his more ideological fights in yawn-inducing regulatory hearings rather than in the dramatic spotlight of congressional debate. How better to impose a liberal agenda on a center-right nation than regulatory stealth?
\
It's Obama's only way forward during the next two years. He will never get past the half-Republican 112th what he could not get past the overwhelmingly Democratic 111th. He doesn't have the votes and he surely doesn't want the publicity. Hence the quiet resurrection, as it were, of end-of-life counseling.
\
Obama knows he has only so many years to change the country. In his first two, he achieved much: the first stimulus, ObamaCare and financial regulation. For the next two, however, the Republican House will prevent any repetition of that. Obama's agenda will therefore have to be advanced by the more subterranean means of rule-by-regulation.
\
But this must simultaneously be mixed with ostentatious displays of legislative bipartisanship (e.g., the lame-duck tax-cut deal) in order to pull off the (apparent) centrist repositioning required for re-election. This, in turn, would grant Obama four more years when, freed from the need for pretense, he can reassert himself ideologically and complete the social-democratic transformation - begun Jan. 20, 2009; derailed Nov. 2 - that is the mission of his presidency.

WASHINGTON -- Last week, a draft memo surfaced from the Homeland Security Department suggesting ways to administratively circumvent existing law to allow several categories of illegal immigrants to avoid deportation and, indeed, for some to be granted permanent residency. Most disturbing was the stated rationale. This was being proposed ""in the absence of Comprehensive Immigration Reform."" In other words, because Congress refuses to do what these bureaucrats would like to see done, they will legislate it themselves.
\
Regardless of your feelings on the substance of the immigration issue, this is not how a constitutional democracy should operate. Administrators administer the law, they don't change it. That's the legislators' job.
\
When questioned, the White House downplayed the toxic memo, leaving the impression that it was nothing more than ruminations emanating from the bowels of Homeland Security. But the administration is engaged in an even more significant power play elsewhere.
\
A 2007 Supreme Court ruling gave the Environmental Protection Agency the authority to regulate carbon emissions if it could demonstrate that they threaten human health and the environment. The Obama EPA made precisely that finding, thereby granting itself a huge expansion of power and, noted The Washington Post, sending ""a message to Congress.""
\
It was not a terribly subtle message: Enact cap-and-trade legislation - taxing and heavily regulating carbon-based energy - or the EPA will do so unilaterally. As Frank O'Donnell of Clean Air Watch noted, such a finding ""is likely to help light a fire under Congress to get moving.""
\
Well, Congress didn't. Despite the ""regulatory cudgel"" (to again quote the Post) the administration has been waving, the Senate has repeatedly refused to acquiesce.
\
Good for the Senate. But what to do when the executive is passively aggressive rather than actively so? Take border security. Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., reports that President Obama told him about pressure from his political left and its concern that if the border is secured, Republicans will have no incentive to support comprehensive reform (i.e., amnesty). Indeed, Homeland Security's abandonment of the ""virtual fence"" on the southern border, combined with its lack of interest in completing the real fence that today covers only one-third of the border, gives the distinct impression that serious border enforcement is not a high administration priority absent some Republican quid pro quo on comprehensive reform.
\
But border enforcement is not something to be manipulated in return for legislative favors. It is, as the administration vociferously argued in court in the Arizona case, the federal executive's constitutional responsibility. Its job is to faithfully execute the laws. Non-execution is a dereliction of duty.
\
This contagion of executive willfulness is not confined to the federal government or to Democrats. In Virginia, the Republican attorney general has just issued a ruling allowing police to ask about one's immigration status when stopped for some other reason (e.g., a traffic violation). Heretofore, police could inquire only upon arrest and imprisonment.
\
Whatever your views about the result, the process is suspect. If police latitude regarding the interrogation of possible illegal immigrants is to be expanded, that's an issue for the legislature, not the executive.
\
How did we get here? I blame Henry Paulson. (Such a versatile sentence.) The gold standard of executive overreach was achieved the day he summoned the heads of the country's nine largest banks and informed them that henceforth the federal government was their business partner. The banks were under no legal obligation to obey. But they know the capacity of the federal government, when crossed, to cause you trouble, endless trouble. They complied.
\
So did BP when the president summoned its top executives to the White House to demand a $20 billion federally administered escrow fund for damages. Existing law capped damages at $75 million. BP, like the banks, understood the power of the U.S. government. Twenty billion it was.
\
Again, you can be pleased with the result (I was), and still be troubled by how we got there. Everyone wants energy in the executive (as Alexander Hamilton called it). But not lawlessness. In the modern welfare state, government has the power to regulate your life. That's bad enough. But at least there is one restraint on this bloated power: the separation of powers. Such constraints on your life must first be approved by both houses of Congress.
\
That's called the consent of the governed. The constitutional order is meant to subject you to the will of the people's representatives, not to the whim of a chief executive or the imagination of a loophole-seeking bureaucrat.

Let me say up front, I don't think President Barack Obama is to blame for the Fort Hood shootings, and I don't think it's fair to say otherwise.
\
But (you knew there had to be a ""but""), that doesn't mean Obama won't pay a political price for Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan's rampage.
\
At first blush, it seems distasteful to take a political yardstick to the pain suffered at Fort Hood. But if we are to consider this incident part of the bloody tapestry of the larger war on terror, there's no way to separate it from politics. After all, the war on terror has been driving politics in America for the better part of a decade now.
\
And that might offer insight into why so many are eager to make the massacre a story about the psychological breakdown of a man who just happened to be a Muslim.
\
If this is just another incident where a deranged man went ""postal"" at his office, then there's no reason to second-guess the Obama administration's fairly relentless effort to dismantle the war on terror.
\
That effort stems from what Obama believes to be a sweeping mandate to be Not George Bush. In pursuit of that mandate, the White House has already purged the phrase ""war on terror"" from its lexicon, preferring ""overseas contingency operations."" Obama is hell-bent on closing Guantanamo Bay, is making progress on the White House project to treat terrorists as mere criminals, and has kowtowed to the United Nations as no president has. Meanwhile, his secretary of homeland security, Janet Napolitano, says that Islamic terrorism like we saw on 9/11 should now be referred to as ""man-caused disasters."" But she adds that American right-wingers must be scrutinized as potential terrorists.
\
All of these moves seemed politically palatable for a war-weary country that felt, rightly or wrongly, as if we'd made it through the worst of it. It was time for a makeover of our political house. The problem is that, rather than merely throw on a fresh coat of paint and lay down some new carpeting, Obama is going after load-bearing walls and structural beams. And if the war on terror refuses to go away as easily as the phrase we use for it did, the whole edifice of the Obama administration could come crashing down.
\
For instance, it seems likely that Obama has already suffered a rhetorical defeat. Whatever his faults, President Bush got to say one thing that the American people always appreciated: After 9/11, he kept us safe from a terrorist attack on the homeland. If Hasan acted as a Jihadist terrorist and not a disgruntled psychiatrist, Obama can't even make the same claim about his first year in office.
\
More substantively, Obama has had the luxury of exploiting his predecessor's success. His actions on Guantanamo, his mea culpas for America to the Muslim world, etc., have only been possible in a political environment absent domestic terrorist attacks. As it stands, Hasan may have been a one-off, an isolated incident. Let's hope that's the case, but let's not delude ourselves that this is likely.
\
Yet, if we see more of this sort of thing, the underpinnings of Obama's national-security posture may well disintegrate. His reputation for flexibility notwithstanding, the record shows that he is, in fact, implacably ideological when it comes to his core beliefs. If terrorism drives the country rightward, he may well choose to stand his ground. That's what he's done with the domestic crisis. While the country has been screaming for Washington to concentrate on fixing the economy and the unemployment rate, Obama and his party have rigidly focused on their health care schemes and cap-and-trade - which, even if they work, will do nothing to fix joblessness in the near future.
\
Conversely, if the ""Hasanity defense"" prevails, and the left convinces the country - or even itself - that the shootings were a tragic byproduct of two unnecessary wars, the president will still be in a bind. Particularly among Obama's core supporters, the notion that violence only begets more violence is as popular as it is untrue.
\
Early reports suggested that Hasan was driven to his murder spree out of frustration with Obama's refusal to pull out of Iraq and Afghanistan fast enough. If Obama's base believes that line of argument - which is essentially a ""blame Bush"" argument - it will only intensify their opposition to escalation in Afghanistan. If Obama goes ahead with escalation anyway, the prospect of ""LBJ redux"" increases.
\
If the majority of Americans had thought in 2008 that the war on terror was a top priority, they wouldn't have voted for Obama. It only makes sense that if the war on terror once again becomes a top priority, they'll most likely regret their vote.

The Brits are upset that President Barack Obama has been referring to disgraced oil giant BP as ""British Petroleum,"" a name it shed long ago.
\
But what else should Obama call an enormous Britain-based petroleum company? To ask such an innocent question betrays ignorance of the ways of Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research. The marketing gurus at the firm - led by uber Democratic pollster Stanley Greenberg - helped conceive and execute one of the most perverse rebrandings of all time for BP.
\
British? So yesterday. Petroleum? Not very green. A logo of a shield emblazoned with ""BP""? Disturbingly martial. In 2000, newly christened BP ditched all these negative associations by adopting the slogan ""beyond petroleum"" and emblazoning itself with a sunflowerlike logo that could be mistaken for the symbol of the Green Party of Canada.
\
It worked so brilliantly a Theodore White of marketing should write a blow-by-blow account, ""The Selling of BP."" Greenberg Quinlan Rosner bragged that its work for BP ""included extensive testing of advertising and evaluating the global response toward pioneering positions on the environment, climate change, and energy efficiency."" The case study outlining this extraordinary marketing success has since been removed from the firm's website. (Greenberg et al. are image-conscious people, after all.)
\
BP knew how to play the game. It repeated all the environmentally correct platitudes that tickle the fancy of ""NGO leaders, journalists, political elites,"" in the words of the case study. It supported the fashionable reform of the day, cap-and-trade, knowing that the system would favor the big and connected, like itself. And it showered campaign contributions on the candidate of Hope and Change (its employees gave Obama about twice as much in donations as they did John McCain in 2008).
\
BP couldn't have been notionally greener if Al Gore were its CEO. The group chief executive of BP, Lord John Browne, warned of the dangers of hydrocarbons, a little like the city fathers of Newcastle in the 19th century inveighing against coal. In a speech at Stanford in 2007, Browne advocated an ""international climate agency"" that would entail ""a move beyond the limitations of national sovereignty.""
\
This green one-worldism was awfully rich coming from an executive of an oil company that couldn't even drill responsibly. Despite all the hokum, BP spent vastly more resources on fossil fuels than green energy. In so doing, it compiled an atrocious safety record that made the poor decision-making that led to the blowout in the Gulf unsurprising to industry insiders.
\
And now tens of thousands of barrels of petroleum a day are fouling the Gulf, courtesy of the corporation that spent so much convincing people it was ""beyond"" it.
\
Rep. Joe Barton's quickly retracted apology to BP for the administration's strong-arm tactics was horribly misconceived. Fundamentally, we don't want a free market and a system of laws to protect corporations, but to protect us from both government and corporations, especially in league with one another. Corporations like BP tend to be craven, unprincipled and willing to use government for their own ends - all qualities evident in its spectacular green marketing campaign.
\
The bigger and more complex government is, the more incentive corporations have to politicize themselves and get in bed with Washington. If they have resources to do it (not everyone can afford Stan Greenberg), they'll protect themselves from the worst while disadvantaging their competitors. This accounts for the corporatist paradox of the Obama administration. The president is so arbitrarily anti-business that The Economist dubs him ""Vladimir Obama,"" yet the same industries he demonizes support key elements of his ""reform"" agenda.
\
White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel argues that Barton's apology to BP is the sum total of Republican thought on the economy, and that the fall election is a choice between Obama-style hyperactive government, or the depredations of the execrable BP. To which the only rational answer can be, ""None of the above.""

One of the most important events of our lifetimes may have just transpired. A federal agency has decided that it has the power to regulate everything, including the air you breathe.
\
Nominally, the Environmental Protection Agency's announcement last Friday only applies to new-car emissions. But pretty much everyone agrees that the ruling opens the door to regulating, well, everything.
\
According to the EPA, greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide - the gas you exhale - as well as methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride. It is literally impossible to imagine a significant economic or human activity that does not involve the production of one of these gases. Don't think just of the gas and electricity bills. Cow flatulence is a serious concern of the EPA's already. What next? Perhaps an EPA mandarin will pick up a copy of ""The Greenpeace Guide to Environmentally Friendly Sex"" and go after the root causes of global warming.
\
Whether or not global warming is a crisis that warrants immediate, drastic action (I don't think it does), and whether or not such wholesale measures would be an economic calamity (they would be), the EPA's decision should be disturbing to people who believe in democratic, constitutional government.
\
Two years ago, the Supreme Court - the least democratic branch of our formal government - decided in Massachusetts v. EPA that the agency could regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. With this judicial green light, the EPA has launched its power grab over all that burns, breathes, burps, flies, drives and passes gas.
\
Yes, the head of the EPA reports to the president, which gives some patina of democratic accountability. Except the EPA is supposed to be politically autonomous, doing what it thinks best according to what President Obama calls ""sound science."" So the government bureaucracy is on its way to strong-arming the economy in ways Congress never imagined when it passed the Clean Air Act in 1970. Or the president has suddenly gained sweeping new powers over American life, in ways never imagined by Congress or the founders, and despite the fact that these new powers were never put before the voters.
\
This is not a sudden development. Vast swaths of the state have been on autopilot for years, effectively immune to democratic influence. The Federal Reserve, particularly of late, has been acting like the fourth branch of government. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, without congressional, presidential or court approval, has been committing trillions of dollars to fix the financial crisis. That may be warranted; only time will tell. But there's still something troubling about an institution so immune to democratic control.
\
In 2002, Congress created the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. It covers its expenses by taxing all publicly traded corporations. It alone determines the amount to tax, without approval of the White House or, more important, Congress, which, according to the Constitution, has the sole authority to levy taxes: ""All bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives"" (Article 1, Section 7). In 1999, the Federal Communications Commission raised the so-called Gore tax on long-distance phone calls by 73 percent without seeking congressional approval. Lord knows what the EPA could collect by extorting ""climate criminals.""
\
In fairness, the Obama administration and congressional Democrats reportedly don't want to cede authority to the EPA. Rather, they want to use the threat of an EPA takeover - and its presumably draconian impositions on business - to force reluctant moderate Democratic and Republican members of Congress to sign on to the president's cap-and-trade scheme (itself an enormous energy tax).
\
California's Barbara Boxer, who chairs the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, has said as much: ""EPA, through its scientists, has given us a warning that global warming pollution is a clear, present and future danger to America's families. If Congress does not act to pass legislation, then I will call on the EPA to take all steps authorized by law to protect our families.""
\
Translation: Either you vote our way or we'll render voting meaningless.
\
Other Democrats are delighted by the EPA decision because it allows them to have their preferred policy - carbon regulation - without actually having to vote for it.
\
Either way, it doesn't sound like these folks take their oaths of office very seriously.

55,"By Lesley Stedman Weidenbener\lstedman@courier-journal.com\The Courier-Journal\FORT WAYNE -- Republican Dan Coats and Democrat Brad Ellsworth clashed over their past records Friday night but offered few specifics about how they'd tackle issues in the future.\During the second of three U.S. Senate debates, the pair continued the sparring that marked their first meeting in Indianapolis earlier this month -- and has marked the political advertising flooding the airwaves.\Ellsworth attacked Coats for the years he spent lobbying in Washington D.C., saying the former senator took stands on issues -- including the bank bailout and stimulus funding -- based on who paid his law firm the most money.\""That's not right for Hoosiers,"" Ellsworth said. ""We need people who stand up for us, for Hoosiers, and base their decisions on what they hear only from the people back home.""\Coats battled back, saying it was his law firm -- not him personally -- who represented clients on those issues.\He also pointed at Ellsworth, saying the Democrat's votes for the bailout, health care law and stimulus bill put the country in almost insurmountable debt.\""I can understand that someone who went to Washington talking like a conservative here at home but followed the agenda of Nancy Pelosi and Barack Obama nearly 90 percent of the time ... would not want to come home and talk about that,"" Coats said. ""You want to deflect it and center your campaign around slinging mud.""\Libertarian Rebecca Sink-Burris chided the major party candidates for failing to focus on the issues.\""I'm not interested in slinging mud about who did what and when,"" she told an audience of 216 people at the Rhinehart Music Center at Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne. ""You can easily see the old parties are not the answer.""\That also seemed to be the sentiment of a voter invited to read a question. Andrew Simmons of Fort Wayne told the candidates he's frustrated with the partisan political environment in the country and said he's looking for candidates who will say where they stand on issues.\""Shouldn't campaigns be based on why you are the choice for Indiana and the tangible ideas you have to make Indiana a better place?"" he asked.\""Yes it should,"" Coats said. ""I think what we're trying to say here today is there are issues here in this state and nation that need to be addressed. I think Miss Sink-Burris and I were trying to do that without getting into a back and forth pingpong match about somebody's personal engagements.""\But Ellsworth, a former Vanderburgh County sheriff who has spent four years in the U.S. House, told the audience that the candidates' records do matter -- whether they are voting records or lobbying records.\""We can't just rewrite history,"" Ellsworth said. ""We can't just say, 'My last 20 or 30 years didn't exist.' So this isn't mudslinging. It is important. People are making an important decision about who they are going to send to the Senate. It's not personal. I'm not talking about Mr. Coats personally or his family. I'm talking about his resume.""\Despite the squabbles, the debate sometimes did focus on issues.\Viewers learned Ellsworth and his wife do their own taxes, but that the Democrat believes the tax code needs to be simpler. He said after the debate that Congress needs to consider taking away some of the hundreds of tax breaks, exemptions and other provisions that force small-business owners to hire accountants to determine what they owe the government.\Ellsworth said he'd met with advocates for the fair tax, a proposal to essentially wipe out all existing federal taxes and replace them with a 23 percent sales tax.\Individuals and businesses need ""to know what to expect for years"" from their tax bills, Ellsworth said.\Sink-Burris is an advocate of the fair tax, which she said would raise American incomes, lead to significant job creation and make it easier for people to understand how much they're paying to the government in taxes.\Coats said he's open to the fair tax -- but as just one idea among many to explore for making the tax code easier to understand.\The tax system needs to be ""fairer, flatter, simpler, and there a number of proposals out there that are sensible to take a look at."" But Coats said he could not support a value-added tax, a kind of tax common in Europe that taxes products and services at different stages of production.\Juli Digate, a college student from Fort Wayne, questioned the candidates about clean energy and whether they could support incentives for biofuels and wind energy.\Coats said the country needs to expand its use of natural gas and nuclear energy to become more independent and lower costs. ""If we want clean energy and low cost energy, we need to develop nuclear power,"" something he said can be done safely.\But Coats said governments must be careful not to choose the winning and losing technologies by subsidizing selected options. ""Government and subsidies and politics destroy the whole process,"" he said.\Ellsworth said the nation needs to invest in a whole range of energy options -- including nuclear power, wind and solar, and clean-coal technology.\But Ellsworth said he opposes President Barack Obama's cap-and-trade energy bill, which he fears will lead to higher rates for Hoosier households and businesses.\Sink-Burris said government should never try to pick energy winners and losers.\""Energy is like any other commodity.

56,"Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., will introduce legislation Monday that is intended to reduce American dependence on foreign oil and cut greenhouse gas emissions contributing to climate change.\Lugar's measure will become part of the debate over the final form of energy and climate-change legislation the Senate is considering, though prospects for passage of any bill this year are uncertain.\Sens. John Kerry, D-Mass., and Joseph Lieberman, I-Conn., introduced a climate bill last month.\With the massive oil spill disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, President Barack Obama is stepping up the push for congressional action on climate change.\At Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh last week, Obama said, ""The votes may not be there right now, but I intend to find them in the coming months.\""I will make the case for a clean energy future wherever I can, and I will work with anyone to get this done, and we will get it done,"" the president said.\But proponents of climate change legislation will need 60 votes in the Senate, so that means some bipartisan support will be necessary.\Lugar, known as a senator who works across the aisle, thinks his plan could alleviate a lot of the political conflict by not embracing the cap-and-trade approach on emissions.\A draft of Lugar's plan on his website said his proposal ""favors policies that will help Americans save money, help American businesses better compete, and minimize fiscal impact.""\Among the features of the Lugar package are increased fuel efficiency standards for motor vehicles, encouragement of flexible fuel technologies, establishment of building efficiency standards, promotion of building retrofit programs, acceleration of efficiency standards for appliances and equipment, and investment in diverse and cleaner energy sources.\Panel favors auto bill\With the Toyota recalls still reverberating on Capitol Hill, a House panel has passed a bill requiring crash recorders, or ""black boxes,"" on all cars; increasing fines on car manufacturers that violate laws; and giving more money to federal regulators.\The House Energy and Commerce Committee approved the legislation on May 26, and supporters hope to get the bill to the full House later this year. The measure is sponsored by Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., the committee's chairman. A similar bill is pending in the Senate.\The Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 2010 ""will push the auto industry to make safer cars,"" Waxman said.\Some Republican lawmakers, however, criticized the bill as too costly and punitive.\Money for mining backlog\You will recall that we have reported on the massive backlog of appeals filed by mining companies to contest citations for safety violations. At the moment, that backlog is around 16,000 cases.\Mine safety advocates say the backlog allows outlaw coal operators to keep mining while their appeals creep through the system. The mining industry says it is rightly using its legal options to challenge costly and questionable citations.\A key obstacle to clearing the backlog at the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission is money.\That may be addressed by a provision in a $58.8billion supplemental spending bill being considered by Congress.\Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., has included $22million to be used by the commission and the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration, which issues the citations and litigates the cases.\""These monies will help ensure that penalties are paid, and that violators are punished,"" Byrd said in a statement.\The Senate has approved the spending bill, which includes money for the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, oil spill relief operations in the Gulf of Mexico, aid to Haiti and other items.\The House is expected to take up its own spending measure after lawmakers return this week. That bill includes $48million to tackle the mining case backlog.\Rogers goes after EPA on coal\The Environmental Protection Agency has been reviewing coal mining permits to ensure that operations don't contribute to water pollution in the coalfields.\But Rep. Hal Rogers, R-5th District, is angry at the EPA's move, saying ""enough is enough.""\In remarks recently on the House floor, Rogers pointed to a report produced by Republicans on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee (though he didn't mention it was a GOP product) that discusses the economic impact of delays in mining permits.\The report said that 190 coal mining operations are being delayed by the EPA.\""These mines are expected to produce over 2 billion tons of coal, and 81 small businesses rely on these permits to keep their doors open,"" Rogers said. ""The EPA is jeopardizing 1 out of every 4 coal mining jobs, and over 162,000 indirect jobs in Appalachia.""\""With nearly double-digit unemployment throughout the Appalachian region, the Obama administration should tell the EPA to stop its political attacks on coal.""\EPA didn't respond to a request for comment.\He's on the A list\No special connection, no special reason, said Gov. Steve Beshear's press office, when asked how Kentucky's chief executive and first lady Jane Beshear scored an invite last week to a White House ceremony honoring Sir Paul McCartney.\Beshear was the only governor and one of only a small number of elected officials in attendance.\McCartney performed some of his endless playlist, as did other musicians, including Stevie Wonder, Elvis Costello and the Jonas Brothers.\One of the evening's highlights: McCartney singing ""Michelle"" to the nation's most famous Michelle, first lady Michelle Obama.\The proceedings will be broadcast on PBS stations on July 28.\Reporter James R.

57,"Kentucky's two U.S. Senators, Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul, show no signs of evolving on their contrarian views of climate change. But across America, new polling shows their fellow Republicans' opinions may be thawing along with the polar ice cap.\While just 47 percent of conservative Republicans think global warming is happening, that's up 19 percentage points over the past two years, according to a new survey by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication.\Still, the Yale program found that Democrats are more likely than Republicans to be convinced that people are causing the warming and are willing to support climate action -- with potential implications in this election year.\Some 75 percent of Democrats believe climate change is mostly caused by people, compared to 49 percent of liberal and moderate Republicans and just 26 percent of conservative Republicans, the survey found.\The liberal blog Climate Progress reports that the shift is enough to put pressure on some more moderate Republican senators with constituents that appear to be increasingly receptive to mainstream climate science, which warns of global dangers in the decades and centuries ahead. Specifically, it calls out Sens. Mark Kirk, R-Illinois, Kelly Ayotte, R-New Hampshire, and Rob Portman, R-Ohio, as vulnerable to Democratic challenges on the environment.\The blog went to Michelle Pautz, an associate professor of political science at the University of Dayton, for an explanation: ""By acknowledging climate change, a (Republican) candidate could appeal to voters who think it is ridiculous that a candidate does not agree with the overwhelming consensus of peer-reviewed scientific research that documents climate change is happening.""\The Yale survey is the second one I've seen this year that shows concern about climate change is increasing.\In March, Gallop found that Americans were taking global warming more seriously than at any time in the last eight years: Some 64 percent of adults in the country told the pollster they were worried ""a great deal"" or a ""fair amount"" about global warming. That was up from 51 percent in 2011. Gallop found that 40 percent of Republicans surveyed worry a great deal or fair amount about climate change, compared to 31 just last year.\Democrats' concerns jumped six percentage points, to 84 percent, over the previous year, illustrating the continued divide between political parties, Gallop found.\Republicans weren't always so resistant.\Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, joined in the early 2000s with former Sen. Joe Lieberman, a Democrat who later became an Independent, in supporting a cap-and-trade bill for heat-trapping gases, tapping into a market-based approach to environmental regulation previously supported by Republicans.\And who can forget that 2008 video of then-Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-California, and former Speaker and Georgia Republican Newt Gingrich sitting on a sofa and agreeing that the country needs to take action on climate change?\Gingrich later called it ""the dumbest thing I ever did.""\With the 2016 presidential election a few months away, it looks as if voters worried about climate change will have a clear choice.\Both Democratic candidates, front-runner and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, have supported President Barack Obama's efforts on climate change and have pledged to do more. GOP frontrunner Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, trailing second in the primary delegate count, have both pooh-poohed mainstream climate science.\The Yale survey found, however, that some 58 percent of registered voters are less likely or indifferent to voting for a candidate who strongly supports climate action.\On the flip side, the survey found that those who said they were more likely to vote for a candidate who supports taking action to reduce global warming significantly outnumbered those who said they would not -- 42 percent to 15 percent.\Bring on the campaign and the election and let's see what happens.\Reporter James Bruggers writes this Watchdog Earth blog.

58,"FORT WAYNE - Republican Dan Coats and Democrat Brad Ellsworth clashed over their past records Friday night but offered few specifics about how they'd tackle issues in the future.\During the second of three U.S. Senate debates, the pair continued the sparring that marked their first meeting in Indianapolis earlier this month -- and has marked the political advertising that has flooded the airwaves.\Ellsworth attacked Coats for the years he spent lobbying in Washington D.C., saying the former senator took stands on issues -- including the bank bailout and stimulus funding -- based on who paid his law firm the most money.\""That's not right for Hoosiers,"" Ellsworth said. ""We need people who stand up for us, for Hoosiers and base their decisions on what they hear only from the people back home.""\Coats battled back, saying that it was his law firm -- not him personally -- who represented clients on those issues.\He pointed instead at Ellsworth, saying that the Democrat's votes for the bailout, health care law and stimulus bill put the country in almost insurmountable debt.\""I can understand that someone who went to Washington talking like a conservative here at home but followed the agenda of Nancy Pelosi and Barack Obama nearly 90 percent of the time... would not want to come home and talk about that,"" Coats said. ""You want to deflect it and center your campaign around slinging mud.""\Libertarian Rebecca Sink Burris chided the major party candidates for failing to focus on the issues.\""I'm not interested in slinging mud about who did what and when,"" she told an audience of 216 people at the Rhinehart Music Center at Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne. ""You can easily see the old parties are not the answer.""\That also seemed to be the sentiment of a voter invited to read a question. Andrew Simmons of Fort Wayne told the candidates he's frustrated with the partisan political environment in the country and said he's looking for candidates who will say where they stand on issues.\""Shouldn't campaigns be based on why you are the choice for Indiana and the tangible ideas you have to make Indiana a better place?"" he asked.\""Yes it should,"" Coats said. ""I think what we're trying to say here today is there are issues here in this state and nation that need to be addressed. I think Miss Sink-Burris and I were trying to do that without getting into a back and forth ping-pong match about somebody's personal engagements.""\But Ellsworth, a former Vanderburgh County sheriff who has spent four years in the U.S. House, told the audience that the candidates' records do matter -- whether they are voting records or lobbying records.\""We can't just rewrite history,"" Ellsworth said. ""We can't just say, 'My last 20 or 30 years didn't exist.' So this isn't mudslinging. It is important. People are making an important decision about who they are going to send to the Senate. It's not personal. I'm not talking about Mr. Coats personally or his family. I'm talking about his resume.""\Despite the squabbles, the debate sometimes did focus on issues.\Viewers learned that Ellsworth and his wife do their own taxes, but that the Democrat believes the tax code needs to be simpler. He said after the debate that Congress needs to consider taking away some of the hundreds of tax breaks, exemptions and other provisions that force small business owners to hire accountants to determine what they owe the government.\Ellsworth said he'd met with advocates for the fair tax, a proposal to essentially wipe out all existing federal taxes and replace them with a 23 percent sales tax.\Individuals and businesses need ""to know what to expect for years"" from their tax bills, Ellsworth said.\Sink-Burris is an advocate of the fair tax, which she said would raise American incomes, lead to significant job creation and make it easier for people to understand how much they're paying to the government in taxes.\Coats said he's open to the fair tax -- but as just one idea among many to explore for making the tax code easier to understand.\The tax system needs to be ""fairer, flatter, simpler, and there a number of proposals out there that are sensible to take a look at.""

59,"Editor's note: This is one in a series of stories examining the candidates and issues in this year's general election.\LEXINGTON, Ky. -- The campaign for the 6th District congressional seat -- involving the grandson of a former Kentucky governor and a little-known but well-funded Lexington attorney -- is perhaps the most hotly contested House race in the state.\With less than two weeks to Election Day, many Republicans believe attorney Andy Barr gives the Kentucky GOP its best chance of knocking off a Democratic House incumbent -- Rep. Ben Chandler.\""This is bound to be one of the nastiest races in the country in the last ... weeks,"" said David Wasserman, House editor for the Cook Political Report.\Three weeks ago the independent, non-partisan newsletter shifted its assessment of the race from ""leans Democrat"" to ""toss-up"" -- the only such designation among the state's six congressional seats.\And on Friday the Lexington Herald-Leader published a poll showing Chandler leading Barr 48 to 44 percent among likely voters, with 8 percent undecided. That lead, the newspaper said, was within the poll's 4.5 percentage point margin of error.\Democratic and Republican outside groups and the candidates are spending tens of thousands of dollars on mostly negative ads as Chandler tries to resist an anti-incumbent sentiment among voters in Central Kentucky and across the country.\Barr has nearly kept pace with Chandler in fundraising, having raised nearly $1.3 million compared to Chandler's $1.4 million.\According to the most recent Federal Election Commission report, Chandler had $1.3 million on hand, versus Barr's $370,000. Political observers say they will watch the race closely on election night as a bellwether because the district is largely rural and is held by a Democrat with some tendencies to vote conservative.\If Chandler wins, it could be a sign that Democrats might be able to maintain their majority in Congress, said Republican strategist Scott Jennings, who isn't affiliated with the Barr campaign. If Barr wins, he said, big trouble likely is brewing for Democrats across the country.\""I think the last two weeks are a shootout,"" Jennings said.\Democratic strategist Dale Emmons, who isn't affiliated with Chandler's campaign, said the rural nature of the 6th District makes the race competitive.\""Those voters are independent-minded, and they don't follow political parties on either side of the aisle,"" he said.\Democrats outnumber Republicans -- 284,524 versus 170,678 -- in voter registration. But two Republicans -- Larry Hopkins and former Gov. Ernie Fletcher -- have held the seat within the past three decades.\Chandler, 51, former state auditor and attorney general and the grandson of former Gov. A.B. ""Happy"" Chandler, is generally well-liked in Kentucky, Jennings said.\He voted with Republicans to oppose health care and banking reform -- angering liberals -- but voted for cap-and-trade, a move that upset conservatives and coal interests in Kentucky.\""Ben has a strong record of independence that resonates with voters from all parts of the district,"" Chandler communications director Jennifer Krimm said in a statement.\Barr's campaign manager, John Connell, did not return several calls seeking comment, and neither candidate was made available for an interview.\The candidates' stark differences on the role of government were on display earlier this week during a debate on Kentucky Educational Television.\""Andy believes apparently that (the recession) was the government's fault,"" Chandler said during the debate. ""I think that we had some greedy people on Wall Street. It seemed to me the Wall Street bankers were a little bit involved with it.""\Barr said he believes the recession that began in 2008 was caused by bad government housing policies and was not solved by the federal economic stimulus package.\""It's clearly a breathtaking failure,"" Barr said of the stimulus.\Wasserman said outside groups, as well as the candidates themselves, have poured money into television ads, many of them negative.\He said the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee shelled out $64,000 for pro-Chandler ads two weeks ago and he expected that buy to increase dramatically before Election Day.\In addition, Americans for Tax Reform, a conservative organization, has spent at least $170,000 on ads attacking Chandler. The National Republican Committee also has bought ads for Barr.\Jennings said the ad buys are signs that both sides believe they have a shot.\""Everybody has stayed in the race, which tells me everybody on both sides of the ball sees it as a winnable seat,"" he said.\Emmons said ""the volume of media they are buying to attack Ben Chandler is unprecedented in Kentucky politics.""\Barr and Republican groups have attacked Chandler for voting for the stimulus package and for his ties to President Barack Obama and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\For his part, Chandler has taken several shots at Barr, including his role in the Fletcher administration, which was damaged by a merit-system hiring scandal.\During the summer, political observers say they were puzzled when Chandler began running ads and working hard to raise money despite polls showing that he had a double-digit lead and a relatively unknown opponent.\""I think it was a wise decision retrospectively,"" Emmons said of Chandler's aggressiveness.\Wasserman said Chandler is ahead in polls because of the attack ads he has run against Barr.\""It's going to get very personal, and it already has,"" he said. ""Chandler is going to continue to attack Barr as a malefactor in the Fletcher administration and Barr will continue to hammer Chandler for his votes and tie him to Washington.""\University of Kentucky political science professor Stephen Voss said he also was surprised that Chandler was so aggressive early on but doesn't think it was a mistake.\""The overall political environment is so favorable to Republicans right now that sitting back and waiting for trouble may not have been wise,"" he said.\Still, Voss thinks Chandler will pull through on Election Day.\""It's (Republicans') best shot. I still think it's unlikely,"" he said.

WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama's considerable political capital, earned on Election Day 2008, is spent. Well spent, mind you, on the enactment of a highly ideological agenda of Obamacare, financial reform and a near trillion-dollar stimulus that will significantly transform the country.
\
But spent nonetheless. There's nothing left with which to complete his social-democratic ambitions. This would have to await the renewed mandate that would come with a second inaugural.
\
That's why, as I suggested last week, nothing of major legislative consequence is likely to occur for the next two and a half years. Except, as columnist Irwin Stelzer points out, for one constitutional loophole: a lame-duck Congress called back into session between the elections this November and the swearing-in of the 112th Congress next January.
\
Leading Democrats are already considering this as a way to achieve even more liberal measures that many of their members dare not even talk about, let alone enact, on the eve of an election in which they face a widespread popular backlash to the already enacted elements of the Obama-Pelosi-Reid agenda.
\
That backlash will express itself on Election Day and result, as most Democrats and Republicans currently expect, in major Democratic losses. It is still possible for the gaffe-happy Republicans to blow it. When the ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee publicly apologizes to the corporation that unleashed the worst oil spill in American history, you know the Republicans are capable of just about anything.
\
But assuming the elections go as currently projected, Obama's follow-on reforms are dead. Except for the fact that a lame-duck session, freezing in place the lopsided Democratic majorities of November 2008, would be populated by dozens of Democratic members who had lost re-election (in addition to those retiring). They could then vote for anything - including measures they today shun as the midterms approach and their seats are threatened - because they would have nothing to lose.
\
They would be unemployed. And playing along with Obama might even brighten the prospects for, say, an ambassadorship to a sunny Caribbean isle.
\
As John Fund reports in The Wall Street Journal, Sens. Jay Rockefeller, Kent Conrad and Tom Harkin are already looking forward to what they might get passed in a lame-duck session.
\
Among the major items being considered are card check, budget-balancing through major tax hikes, and climate-change legislation involving heavy carbon taxes and regulation.
\
Card check, which effectively abolishes the secret ballot in the workplace, is the fondest wish of a union movement to which Obama is highly beholden. Major tax hikes, possibly including a value-added tax, will undoubtedly be included in the recommendations of the president's debt commission, which conveniently reports by Dec. 1. And carbon taxes would be the newest version of the cap-and-trade legislation that has repeatedly failed to pass the current Congress - but enough dead men walking in a lame-duck session might switch and vote to put it over the top.
\
It's a target-rich environment. The only thing holding the Democrats back would be shame, a Washington commodity in chronically short supply. To pass in a lame-duck session major legislation so unpopular that Democrats had no chance of passing it in regular session - after major Democratic losses signifying a withdrawal of the mandate implicitly granted in 2008 - would be an egregious violation of elementary democratic norms.
\
Perhaps shame will constrain the Democrats. But that is not to be counted on. It didn't stop them from pushing through a health-care reform the public didn't want by means of ""reconciliation"" maneuvers and without a single Republican vote in either chamber - something unprecedented in American history for a reform of such scope and magnitude.
\
How then to prevent a runaway lame-duck Congress?
\
Bring the issue up now - applying the check-and-balance of the people's will before it disappears the morning after Election Day. Every current member should be publicly asked: In the event you lose in November - a remote and deeply deplorable eventuality, but still not inconceivable - do you pledge to adhere to the will of the electorate and, in any lame-duck session of Congress, refuse to approve anything but the most routine legislation required to keep the government functioning?
\
The Democrats could, of course, make the pledge today and break it tomorrow.
\
Call me naive, but I can't believe anyone would be that dishonorable.

61,"Last week, the White House issued a new and alarming edition of its national report on climate change. How did leading Republicans respond?\Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the GOP's leader in the Senate, scoffed at President Obama for ""talking about the weather,"" dismissing the issue as a hobbyhorse of ""liberal elites ... who leave a giant carbon footprint and then lecture everybody else about low-flow toilets.""\After pointing out that the president is ""not a meteorologist,"" Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., argued that Obama's proposals to regulate carbon emissions ""would have a devastating effect on our economy"" without solving the problem.\And Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., said the central issue wasn't climate change but cost-benefit analysis. Asked whether he thought global warming had been caused by human activity, Thune said: ""I'm not denying that. I'm simply saying that the debate ought to be: What are we going to do about it, and at what cost?""\Perhaps this counts as progress. They weren't calling climate change a hoax, as many conservatives once did (and some still do). They're not even challenging the scientific consensus that human activity has contributed to the warming of the Earth (although some still contest that finding too).\Why the shift?\Polls have found that most Americans are worried about global warming, except for one group -- tea party conservatives. A Pew Research Poll conducted last year found that only 25 percent of tea party adherents believe climate change is real, against 61 percent of non-tea party Republicans (and 84 percent of Democrats).\That puts the GOP in a bind, caught between its most zealous conservative supporters and the broader majorities it'll need to win elections.\More worrisome for the GOP, younger voters are even more convinced that climate change is a big problem -- and they're going to be around longer than their grandparents.\And, remarkably, almost two-thirds of Americans, including about half of Republicans, favor stricter limits on emissions from power plants, the centerpiece of Obama's regulatory agenda.\""In the short term, it's politically smart for Republican politicians to express doubts about climate change because that responds to what their base wants,"" said Sherwood Boehlert, a moderate former GOP congressman from upstate New York who chaired the House Science and Technology Committee for six years until 2007. ""But public opinion is moving forward, and that won't be good for the deniers.""\In the not-too-distant past, the Republican Party's platform listed global warming as a national problem and cited ""human activity"" among its causes. But that was 2008, when Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., was the nominee; even Sarah Palin, his running mate, agreed. ""It's real,"" she said then. ""We need to do something about it.""\But that was before the tea party insurgency of 2010, and before Democratic proposals for cap-and-trade legislation made climate change a forbidden zone for most Republican politicians -- including McCain, who abandoned his earlier positions and fell in line. Last year, when Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., proposed an amendment to ban any new federal regulation of greenhouse gases, only one Republican voted against it: Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine.\Now only a few defiant Republican moderates still argue for policies to counter climate change, including former Gov. Jon Huntsman of Utah and former Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine. Except for Collins, they're all out of office.\Some current GOP members of Congress still deny that the problem exists, including Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., who has called global warming ""a total fraud"" designed by ""liberals who ... want to create global government.""\Others agree that climate change is real but say they aren't certain that it's man-made -- and, as a result, they feel no need to fix it.\""People like me who support hydrocarbon development don't deny that climate is changing,"" Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, said last year. ""If you're a believer in the Bible, one would have to say the great flood is an example of climate change, and that certainly isn't because mankind had overdeveloped hydrocarbon energy.""\That argument has always struck me as odd: If climate change isn't man-made, does that mean there's no reason to try to counter its effects? Noah's flood wasn't man-made, but he still spent the money (or at least the timber) to build an ark.\But increasingly, the most popular argument among leading Republicans in Congress is a mix of all of the above -- maybe it's a problem, maybe it isn't -- plus a new talking point designed for tough economic times: Whatever the problem, it's too expensive to fix.\""There has to be a cost-benefit analysis,"" Rubio said last year. ""The benefit, I think, is difficult to justify. ... Is there anything government can do about it that will actually make a difference?""\It sounds as if Rubio is criticizing Obama for being too timid in his regulatory proposals. But it's really just another argument for doing nothing.\That position would carry more weight if Rubio and other Republicans had actually done the cost-benefit analysis they ask for, one that includes the costs of flooding in Miami and droughts in the Southwest as well as the price of regulating coal-burning power plants. But they haven't.\To borrow a word from a different public debate, the GOP appears to be evolving, but only in its rhetoric, not its policies. But evolution is a slow process, and if the environment changes as quickly as the scientists expect, some political species could soon become endangered.\Doyle McManus is a columnist for The Los Angeles Times.

62,"An Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis study has found mercury contamination in soil downwind from a coal-fired power plant in Indianapolis, supporting the notion of localized mercury hot spots.\The research examined soil near several plants across Central Indiana but zeroed in on an Indianapolis Power & Light plant on the city's southwest side. That's where scientists mapped a plume of soil contamination likely from the plant, which is the city's largest source of mercury emissions.\""Mercury from coal-fired power plants has been found in the ice at the north and the south poles, so the fact that these noxious emissions are swept far away to other areas or even continents, with global environmental impact, is well known,"" said lead author Gabriel M. Filippelli, an IUPUI professor of earth sciences.\He said the new research is among the first to document mercury's impact on soils and the environment near specific coal-burning power plants.\He also said the study, published this month in the journal Water, Air & Soil Pollution, has important implications for other cities with coal-fired power plants, including the Louisville metro area, which has three.\""I would suspect you might have the same situation that we have here in Indianapolis,"" he said of Louisville and Southern Indiana.\Louisville Gas & Electric operates the Mill Creek and Cane Run coal-fired plants in southwestern and western Louisville. Duke Energy operates the Gallagher plant in New Albany, immediately west of Louisville.\The three together emit more than twice as much mercury annually as the IPL plant, according to the most recent U.S. Environmental Protection Agency data.\All three are also generally upwind from Louisville population centers.\An LG&E spokesman, Chip Keeling, said company officials have not reviewed the study, but still questioned its findings.\""Mercury is a naturally occurring element and a global pollutant that originates from sources as far away as power plants in China,"" he said in a statement, adding that ""little mercury is deposited in areas immediately adjacent to a power plant.""\Filippelli said mercury in soil is not a direct health concern.\But he said it gets washed into waterways, where it contaminates fish. Because cities have many hard surfaces like roads and parking lots, mercury falling out on a city can enter waterways rapidly during storms, he said.\All Kentucky streams carry fish consumption warnings for mercury, as do many in Indiana.

63,"Indy power plant\By James Bruggers\jbruggers@courier-journal.com\The Courier-Journal\An Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis study has found mercury contamination in soil downwind from a coal-fired power plant in Indianapolis, supporting the notion of localized mercury hot spots.\The research examined soil near several plants across Central Indiana but zeroed in on an Indianapolis Power & Light plant on the city's southwest side. That's where scientists mapped a plume of soil contamination likely from the plant, which is the city's largest source of mercury emissions.\""Mercury from coal-fired power plants has been found in the ice at the north and the south poles, so the fact that these noxious emissions are swept far away to other areas or even continents, with global environmental impact, is well known,"" said lead author Gabriel M. Filippelli, an IUPUI professor of earth sciences.\He said the new research is among the first to document mercury's impact on soils and the environment near specific coal-burning power plants.\He also said the study, published this month in the journal Water, Air & Soil Pollution, has important implications for other cities with coal-fired power plants, including the Louisville metro area, which has three.\""I would suspect you might have the same situation that we have here in Indianapolis,"" he said of Louisville and Southern Indiana.\Louisville Gas & Electric operates the Mill Creek and Cane Run coal-fired plants in southwestern and western Louisville. Duke Energy operates the Gallagher plant in New Albany, immediately west of Louisville.\The three together emit more than twice as much mercury annually as the IPL plant, according to the most recent U.S. Environmental Protection Agency data.\All three are also generally upwind from Louisville population centers.\An LG&E spokesman, Chip Keeling, said company officials have not reviewed the study, but still questioned its findings.\""Mercury is a naturally occurring element and a global pollutant that originates from sources as far away as power plants in China,"" he said in a statement, adding that ""little mercury is deposited in areas immediately adjacent to a power plant.""\Filippelli said mercury in soil is not a direct health concern.\But he said it gets washed into waterways, where it contaminates fish. Because cities have many hard surfaces like roads and parking lots, mercury falling out on a city can enter waterways rapidly during storms, he said.\All Kentucky streams carry fish consumption warnings for mercury, as do many in Indiana.

64,"Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., will formally introduce legislation Monday that is intended to reduce American dependence on foreign oil and cut greenhouse gas emissions contributing to climate change.\Lugar's measure will become part of the debate over the final form of energy and climate-change legislation the Senate is considering, though prospects for passage of any bill this year are uncertain.\Sens. John Kerry, D-Mass., and Joseph Lieberman, I-Conn., introduced a climate bill last month.\With the massive oil spill disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, President Barack Obama is stepping up the push for congressional action on climate change.\At Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh last week, Obama said ""the votes may not be there right now, but I intend to find them in the coming months.""\""I will make the case for a clean energy future wherever I can, and I will work with anyone to get this done, and we will get it done,"" the president said.\But proponents of climate change legislation will need 60 votes in the Senate, so that means some bipartisan support will be necessary.\Lugar, known as a senator who works across the aisle, thinks his plan could alleviate a lot of the political conflict by not embracing the cap-and-trade approach on emissions.\A draft of Lugar's plan on his website said his proposal ""favors policies that will help Americans save money, help American businesses better compete, and minimize fiscal impact.""\Among the features of the Lugar package are increased fuel efficiency standards for motor vehicles, encouragement of flexible fuel technologies, establishment of building efficiency standards, promotion of building retrofit programs, acceleration of efficiency standards for appliances and equipment and investment in diverse and cleaner energy sources.\Panel clears auto bill\With the Toyota recalls still reverberating on Capitol Hill, a House panel has passed a bill requiring crash recorders, or ""black boxes,"" on all cars; increasing fines on car manufacturers who violate laws; and giving more money to federal regulators.\The House Energy and Commerce Committee approved the legislation on May 26, and supporters hope to get the bill to the full House later this year. The measure is sponsored by Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., the committee's chairman. A similar bill is pending in the Senate.\The Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 2010 ""will push the auto industry to make safer cars,"" Waxman said.\Some Republican lawmakers, however, criticized the bill as too costly and punitive.\Money for mining backlog\You will recall that we have reported on the massive backlog of appeals filed by mining companies to contest citations for safety violations. At the moment, that backlog is around 16,000 cases.\Mine safety advocates say the backlog allows outlaw coal operators to keep mining while their appeals creep slowly through the system. The mining industry says it is rightly using its legal options to challenge costly and questionable citations.\A key obstacle to clearing the backlog at the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission is money.\That may be addressed by a provision in a $58.8 billion supplemental spending bill now being considered by Congress.\Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., has included $22 million to be used by the commission and the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration, which issues the citations and litigates the cases.\""These monies will help ensure that penalties are paid, and that violators are punished,"" Byrd said in a statement.\The Senate has approved the spending bill, which includes money for the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, oil spill relief operations in the Gulf of Mexico, aid to Haiti and other items.\The House is expected to take up its own spending measure after lawmakers return this week. That bill includes $48 million to tackle the mining case backlog.\Rogers goes after EPA on coal\The Environmental Protection Agency has been reviewing coal mining permits to ensure that operations don't contribute to water pollution in the coalfields.\But Rep. Hal Rogers, R-5th District, is angry at the EPA's move, saying ""enough is enough.""\In remarks recently on the House floor, Rogers pointed to a report produced by Republicans on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee (though he didn't mention it was a GOP product) that discusses the economic impact of delays in mining permits.\The report said that 190 coal mining operations are being delayed by the EPA.\""These mines are expected to produce over 2 billion tons of coal, and 81 small businesses rely on these permits to keep their doors open,"" Rogers said. ""The EPA is jeopardizing 1 out of every 4 coal mining jobs, and over 162,000 indirect jobs in Appalachia.""\""With nearly double-digit unemployment throughout the Appalachian region, the Obama administration should tell the EPA to stop its political attacks on coal.""\EPA didn't respond to a request for comment.\""The one and only Steve Beshear...""\No special connection, no special reason, said Gov. Steve Beshear's press office, when asked how Kentucky's chief executive and First Lady scored an invite last week to a White House ceremony honoring Sir Paul McCartney.\Beshear was the only governor and one of only a small number of elected officials in attendance.\McCartney performed some of his endless playlist, as did other musicians, including Stevie Wonder, Elvis Costello and the Jonas Brothers.\One of the evening's highlights: McCartney singing ""Michelle"" to the nation's most famous Michelle, First Lady Michelle Obama.\The proceedings will be broadcast on PBS stations on July 28.\Reporter James R.

65,"key to U.S. House contest in 6th District\By Stephenie Steitzer\ssteitzer@courier-journal.com\The Courier-Journal\Editor's note: This is one in a series of stories examining the candidates and issues in this year's general election.\LEXINGTON, Ky. -- The campaign for the 6th District congressional seat -- involving the grandson of a former Kentucky governor and a little-known but well-funded Lexington attorney -- is perhaps the most hotly contested House race in the state.\With less than two weeks to Election Day, many Republicans believe attorney Andy Barr gives the Kentucky GOP its best chance of knocking off a Democratic House incumbent -- Rep. Ben Chandler.\""This is bound to be one of the nastiest races in the country in the last ... weeks,"" said David Wasserman, House editor for the Cook Political Report.\Three weeks ago the independent, non-partisan newsletter shifted its assessment of the race from ""leans Democrat"" to ""toss-up"" -- the only such designation among the state's six congressional seats.\And on Friday, the Lexington Herald-Leader published a poll showing Chandler leading Barr 48 to 44 percent among likely voters, with 8 percent undecided. That lead, the newspaper said, was within the poll's 4.5 percentage point margin of error.\Democratic and Republican outside groups and the candidates are spending tens of thousands of dollars on mostly negative ads as Chandler tries to resist an anti-incumbent sentiment among voters in Central Kentucky and across the country.\Barr has nearly kept pace with Chandler in fundraising, having raised nearly $1.3million to Chandler's $1.4million.\According to the most recent Federal Election Commission report, Chandler had $1.3million on hand, versus Barr's $370,000. Political observers say they will watch the race closely on Election Night as a bellwether because the district is largely rural and is held by a Democrat with some tendencies to vote conservative.\If Chandler wins, it could be a sign that Democrats might be able to maintain their majority in Congress, said Republican strategist Scott Jennings, who isn't affiliated with the Barr campaign. If Barr wins, he said, big trouble likely is brewing for Democrats across the country.\""I think the last two weeks are a shootout,"" Jennings said.\Democratic strategist Dale Emmons, who isn't affiliated with Chandler's campaign, said the rural nature of the 6th District makes the race competitive.\""Those voters are independent-minded, and they don't follow political parties on either side of the aisle,"" he said.\Democrats outnumber Republicans -- 284,524 versus 170,678 -- in voter registration. But two Republicans -- Larry Hopkins and former Gov. Ernie Fletcher -- have held the seat within the past three decades.\Chandler, 51, former state auditor and attorney general and the grandson of former Gov. A.B. ""Happy"" Chandler, is generally well-liked in Kentucky, Jennings said.\He voted with Republicans to oppose health care and banking reform -- angering liberals -- but voted for cap-and-trade, a move that upset conservatives and coal interests in Kentucky.\""Ben has a strong record of independence that resonates with voters from all parts of the district,"" Chandler communications director Jennifer Krimm said in a statement.\Barr's campaign manager, John Connell, did not return several calls seeking comment, and neither candidate was made available for an interview.\Views on government\The candidates' stark differences on the role of government were on display last week during a debate on Kentucky Educational Television.\""Andy believes apparently that (the recession) was the government's fault,"" Chandler said during the debate. ""I think that we had some greedy people on Wall Street. It seemed to me the Wall Street bankers were a little bit involved with it.""\Barr said he believes the recession that began in 2008 was caused by bad government housing policies and was not solved by the federal economic stimulus package.\""It's clearly a breathtaking failure,"" Barr said of the stimulus.\Ads 'unprecedented'\Wasserman said outside groups, as well as the candidates themselves, have poured money into television ads, many of them negative.\He said the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee shelled out $64,000 for pro-Chandler ads two weeks ago and he expected that buy to increase dramatically before Election Day.\Americans for Tax Reform, a conservative organization, has spent at least $170,000 on ads attacking Chandler. The National Republican Committee also has bought ads for Barr.\Jennings said the ad buys are signs that both sides believe they have a shot.\""Everybody has stayed in the race, which tells me everybody on both sides of the ball sees it as a winnable seat,"" he said.\Emmons said ""the volume of media they are buying to attack Ben Chandler is unprecedented in Kentucky politics.""\Barr and Republican groups have attacked Chandler for voting for the stimulus package and for his ties to President Barack Obama and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\For his part, Chandler has taken several shots at Barr, including his role in the Fletcher administration, which was damaged by a merit-system hiring scandal.\During the summer, political observers were puzzled when Chandler began running ads and working hard to raise money despite polls showing a double-digit lead against a relatively unknown opponent.\""I think it was a wise decision retrospectively,"" Emmons said of Chandler's aggressiveness.\Wasserman said Chandler is ahead in polls because of the attack ads he has run against Barr.\""It's going to get very personal, and it already has,"" he said. ""Chandler is going to continue to attack Barr as a malefactor in the Fletcher administration and Barr will continue to hammer Chandler for his votes and tie him to Washington.""\University of Kentucky political science professor Stephen Voss was surprised that Chandler was so aggressive early on but doesn't think it was a mistake.\""The overall political environment is so favorable to Republicans right now that sitting back and waiting for trouble may not have been wise,"" he said.\Still, Voss thinks Chandler will pull through on Election Day.\""It's (Republicans') best shot. I still think it's unlikely,"" he said. ""I think it would take a larger-than-expected national swing for Republicans.""\Reporter Stephenie Steitzer can be reached at (502) 875-5136.\LOCATION MAP OF KENTUCKY'S 6TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT IS NOT AVAILABLE (SEE LIBRARY MICROFILM OR LIBRARY PDF PAGES)"
66,"FRANKFORT, Ky. -- To hear Kentucky politicians of both parties tell it, the Environmental Protection Agency should be renamed the Economic Destruction Agency. But their recent rhetoric has gone far beyond reality and obscured it.\At issue are EPA's tougher enforcement of the Clean Water Act against strip mines, particularly those on Eastern Kentucky mountaintops, and its new regulations under the Clean Air Act, which will force utilities to rely less on coal and charge more for electricity.\That's a double squeeze on the coal industry, involving significant issues for the state as a whole, not just in its two coalfields. Low electric rates allowed by handy coal reserves have helped Kentucky's economy, and the Appalachian forest, biologically unique to this continent, is where our rivers and water supplies begin.\Those issues deserve rational, fact-based discussion. But when the coal industry is squeezed, its political friends often squeal loudly, generating more noise than sense, more heat than light.\Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell did that June 1 in a red-meat speech to the Kentucky Coal Association, in which he declared, ""The EPA's real goal here is not to see the Kentucky coal industry comply with its boatload of regulations and red tape. It is to see the Kentucky coal industry driven out of business altogether.""\There's no probative evidence of that. Under President Obama, who made clear in his campaign that he would get tougher on coal, mainly because of its contribution to global warming, EPA is enforcing laws and regulations that have long been on the books but circumvented by the industry and friendly regulators.\EPA's approach is open to some questions, because it created an uncertain regulatory environment during a recession, and its tough, new water-quality standard may encourage mining of Eastern Kentucky forest that has only been timbered, never strip-mined, thus discouraging re-mining and better reclamation of old mine sites.\But such significant details are usually obscured in the debate over mountaintop removal and other coal-related issues such as human-caused climate change (a scientific reality, we were told again last week, this time by three groups of agricultural scientists). That was most recently illustrated by nominally Democratic state Rep. Jim Gooch of Providence, in the state's western coalfield.\After McConnell told the coal group that Washington Democrats ""have declared war - war on Kentucky's coal industry,"" Gooch declared at a legislative committee meeting, ""No, this is a war on Kentucky, because what we're talking about here is totally destroying our economy, changing the way of life for millions or at least hundreds of thousands of Kentuckians all across this state.""\Totally destroying our economy? Hardly. Mining and its support activities accounted for less than 3 percent of Kentucky's gross state product in 2009, the last year for which such detail is available, according to the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis.\Most of Kentucky's coal production is from underground, not surface mines, and EPA's stricter enforcement of the Clean Water Act does not mean an end to mountaintop-removal mining. Coal companies are redesigning the valley fills created by the rock and dirt excavated from the hilltops. As they usually have, mining engineers are figuring out ways to satisfy regulators in most cases.\That, of course, will not satisfy mountaintop-removal opponents, whose struggle is described in a new documentary, ""The Last Mountain,"" to be shown at 3:30 today at the Speed Art Museum in Louisville as part of the Flyover Film Festival.\But Gooch was approaching the vicinity of the facts when he suggested that EPA's stance has a broader impact. Part of the meeting he chaired was about new regulations the agency has issued under the Clean Air Act, including new limits on emission of mercury (one of the elements in coal) and disposal of coal ash.\The effect of those rules is becoming clear, as utilities announce rate increases to cover the added costs and other moves to limit the impact. Louisville Gas & Electric Co. and Kentucky Utilities have asked for a 19 percent rate increase, and the Tennessee Valley Authority recently reached a settlement with EPA in which it will close 18 old, coal-fired power plants. American Electric Power, which serves part of Eastern Kentucky, said last week that it would shut five and switch others to natural gas.\A recent national study for the coal and electric industries concluded that Kentucky, Tennessee and some adjoining areas (mainly in TVA's service region) will see a greater impact on electric rates than any of the other 22 regions identified by the study: an estimated 23.5 percent increase. That's because the two states are among the most dependent on coal for their electricity.\Other regions with projected heavy impact include several states with U.S. Senate elections and Democratic incumbents in 2012, so McConnell's speech was probably aimed at helping lay a political predicate.\The GOP-controlled House will probably pass legislation, likely to be sponsored by Rep. Ed Whitfield of Kentucky's 1st District, to delay the regulations' effect. The Senate will be a much tougher hurdle, but allowing electric rates to rise when unemployment is high could seem like political poison to vulnerable incumbents, perhaps even the president.\They could look at the example of Rep. Ben Chandler of Kentucky's 6th District, whose vote for a cap-and-trade system to limit greenhouse-gas emissions was clearly a factor in his very narrow victory last year over Republican Andy Barr -- who announced last week that he is running again.\And the issues could figure in this fall's race for governor, as Republicans try to federalize it. McConnell referred to the GOP nominee in his speech: ""People in Washington are always looking for alternatives to coal. What they don't seem to realize, as my friend David Williams has said, is that the alternative to coal is darkness.""\We will have to keep using coal, and try to make it cleaner. But spare us the simplistic poppycock.\Al Cross, former Courier-Journal political writer, is director of the Institute for Rural Journalism and Community Issues in the School of Journalism and Telecommunications at the University of Kentucky.

So readers should not be surprised that Susan Stokes, a registered Democrat, is out tearing down a Republican again, just before Election Day. This time her outcry is gender discrimination -- an important issue, but in this case an attempt to divert attention from what most voters -- women and men -- are focused on: jobs, deficits, takeovers and ObamaCare.\Here are the simple facts: Todd Lally knows that lower taxes and fewer onerous regulations will create an environment where small businesses can grow and create jobs.\Todd Lally knows the government cannot continue to spend money it doesn't have. As with a family budget, sometimes you have to tighten your belt.\Todd Lally will say no to more government takeovers. The government should not be running banks, car companies and insurance companies or bailing out Wall Street.\And for sure, Todd Lally knows the government should not be in charge of our entire health care system.\Here's something else as predictable as the sunrise: If you vote for John Yarmuth, you will get more of the same.\I hope you will vote for Todd Lally for Congress on Tuesday. He is the change we need.\ANNE NORTHUP\Louisville 40206\Anne M. Northup, a Republican, represented the 3rd District in the U.S. Congress from 1997-2007. -- Editor.\We need Yarmuth\America's manufacturing base needs strengthening. Manufacturing and exports are key to overcoming our trade deficits and ensuring our future economic prosperity.\Todd Lally's contention that this can be done through tax cuts and deregulation of American business while our government stands aloof is foolish and naive. The story of American manufacturing and foreign trade is extraordinarily complex. The crises both face have little to do with high taxes, the EPA, OSHA or unions. The fact is that today's international corporations bear no loyalty to the United States. The deregulation and tax cuts they favor are those that encourage offshore investment at the expense of re-investment in American manufacturing.\Lally believes we should emulate China -- where industrial pollution has reached dangerously unhealthy levels, poisoning both air and water; abuses, including the use of unpaid, forced labor, regularly violate both Chinese and international law; and American products are pirated in China's state-owned factories. Is Lally unaware that China is a communist dictatorship which strictly controls both business and the economy? Should America be forced to accept Lally's Third World vision of our future?\John Yarmuth understands the difference between corporate profit and national prosperity. We need Yarmuth.\MARK HUMPHREY\Louisville 40220\No-bull Lally\Congressman John Yarmuth is what soldiers call a big bull shooter (lots of talk; insults common sense). He is a ""baffle 'em with BS"" phony (flying under radar with C-J help). Yarmuth has a Washington politician's ability to talk so much about everything until the listener soon understands everything about nothing. He can talk at length about why he has voted for the destructive health care and cap and trade bills but can't justify the insanity. He is a dangerous progressive who will be an Obama foot-soldier as long as he is allowed to stay in Washington.\I hope Todd Lally will call him out as the bull-shooting artist he is. No one wants to vote for a dishonest politician.\WINDLE SHELTON\Louisville 40299\Lally off-base\While Todd Lally and I served in different branches, he in the Air Force and I in the Marines, believe me when I say I respect his service. However, I feel compelled to say his recent statements about our nation and military are profoundly and, in some cases, dangerously off-base.\His claim that the President Obama, the commander in chief of the United States, would be denied a security clearance has already been universally dismissed as inflammatory campaign rhetoric meant to rally the most extreme elements of his party -- and rightfully so. More recently, he questioned the honor of Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, by accusing him of participating in a ""political quid pro quo"" with the President by supporting the repeal of ""don't ask, don't tell.""\But perhaps his most disquieting claim is his assertion that no gender discrimination exists in either the military or civilian workplace. Unfortunately, I can tell you that as in the civilian world, servicewomen are all too frequently victims of harassment and sometimes even rape. There are statistics that say half of all women who serve have been subjected to some types of abuse.\I have a deep respect for our armed forces, and I am not claiming that our military is the only arena for discrimination. Far from it. Women face harassment and unnecessary barriers in every realm. John Yarmuth knows this. I am confident the women and men of Louisville know it.

""as the siren song of more government regulation is sounded.\The wacky ""cap and trade"" (a.k.a. cap and tax) bill passed by the House is, we're told, our only salvation. If America doesn't destroy its industrial base and economy the Earth will become a cinder. I guess the emission of so-called ""greenhouse gases"" by China and India and other developing Third World economies don't trap heat. Only those emitted by the evil, irresponsible U.S.A. cause this so-called ""global warming.""\It is impossible to predict what conditions will be like in 90 years. Sure, a computer program can be written and used but does anyone know of a perfect computer program? Is it possible to include every conceivable variable and do so perfectly? I think not.\If you're really interested in helping the environment, stop buying trendy, designer bottled water. Ceasing production of bottled water will save approximately 50 million barrels of oil a year and reduce the pollution from manufacturing and transporting this largely unneeded product.\EDWIN HURT\Clarksville, Ind. 47129\Is Yarmuth true rep?\Just the other day I was listening to a local radio station talk show. Congressman Yarmuth was the guest and responding to listeners' questions about the proposed Democratic health care bill. One gentleman called and asked a rather direct question: ""If the majority of your constituents in the 3rd District did not want the proposed government health care option how would you vote?""\That seemed to call for a rather direct answer. If a person truly represented a district should they not vote the way the people want? However, Mr. Yarmuth said he would use his best judgment and vote the way that would be best for his constituents and the nation. His answer made it clear to me that what they really intend is to try and give Americans what his party wants them to have, rather than what the people want, like it or not. This is a frightening prospect.\I believe that Mr. Yarmuth has long been a proponent of a single-payer health system much like England and Canada. That is the next logical (in their minds) step after getting a national health insurance option.\Mr. Yarmuth is a congressional representative of this district and its people. The dictionary defines the word ""represent,"" in part, as ""to set forth a likeness or image of...""\I would contend that he does not truly ""represent"" us, but rather represents the goals of his party and his own personal ideas. In all fairness it should be noted that this happens on the Republican side, as well. When are citizens going to say enough is enough and elect people who don't bow down to partisan politics, but rather will listen and act on the basis of the will of the majority of the people they represent?\FRED COOK\Louisville 40224\Not like Bush event\John Yarmuth's town hall meeting was so different from George W. Bush's appearance here in 2005.\Yarmuth's meeting was open to everyone, first come, first seated. Bush's event was available by ticket only, most of which were distributed only to his supporters.\I counted a couple people of color at Bush's affair, while the town hall was far more representative of our diverse community.\Bush's entire show was staged. There was no Q&A from the audience. When one of my Democratic friends stood up to speak, he was roughly escorted out of the building. Freedom of speech was alive and well at Yarmuth's town hall. Well, mostly. If you spoke in support of single-payer health care you were shouted at and had to fight to be heard. But health care reform opponents could ask their questions uninterrupted.\I was most struck by the contrast of the two officials. Yarmuth was courageous, genuine, articulate and respectful. Bush, in contrast, was aloof, staged, and permitted no dissent.\I think our democracy needs more leaders like Yarmuth. I hope that he helps pass single-payer health care, as outlined in HB 676, which he co-sponsors.\AMY SHIR\Director\Raise KY\Louisville 40241\Curb gun violence\Many Kentuckians feel they need guns to protect themselves and their families. Actually, firearms in the home increase the risk for suicide, homicide, domestic violence and accidental shootings. Paradoxically, something obtained for self-protection results in self-killing and shooting of household members much more often than intruders.\Among 541 gun-related deaths during 2005 in Kentucky, 375 (nearly 70 percent) were suicides. In homes with firearms, women die from homicide five times as often and commit suicide three times more frequently than in homes without firearms. Violent deaths in children also rise. Despite firearms being acquired for security, 70 percent of gunshot deaths are suicides and homicides.\Gun-related violence overwhelms our medical facilities. Approximately 83 percent of the cost is paid by taxpayers. University Hospital spends more for gun injuries than is allotted for all of Louisville's indigent medical care. When rehabilitation, disability and loss of productivity are added, the burden is staggering. Shootings also raise criminal justice expenses. Both result in much higher taxes and insurance premiums.\We are in charge of our legislature. Kentuckians should decide if we wish to maintain our current status and its costs or to consider ways of curbing gun violence.\STEVEN LIPPMANN\Louisville 40207"
69,"The nation's first-ever limits on carbon pollution from power plants would give coal-dependent states such as Kentucky and Indiana flexibility to continue burning the fossil fuel, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Monday.\But they probably won't be able to burn quite as much of it.\Under the EPA's proposed Clean Power Plan -- designed to cut America's carbon-dioxide emissions from power plants by 30 percent in the next 16 years -- coal-dependent states would need to burn the fuel more efficiently and demonstrate they are working toward reducing the heat-trapping pollution blamed for global warming.\States also can achieve their goals by embracing alternative energy -- such as solar, wind or hydro power. They can develop better programs to help homes and businesses use electricity more efficiently; or can join regional ""cap-and-trade"" programs, in which utilities that cut pollution sell credits to those that do not.\""The glue that holds this plan together, and the key to making it work, is that each state's goal is tailored to its own circumstances, and states have the flexibility to reach their goal in whatever way works best for them,"" EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy said. ""Each state is different, so each goal, and each path, can be different.""\Kentucky, for example, has one of the nation's highest rates of carbon-dioxide emissions per megawatt hour, a product of its reliance on coal-burning electrical plants, and would need to reduce its carbon-dioxide emission rate by 18 percent by 2030.

But Arkansas is looking at a reduction of 44 percent, according to the EPA.\Environmental advocates praised the announcement, which marks the first time any U.S. president has sought to curb carbon-dioxide emissions from the approximately 1,000 fossil-fuel power plants that supply electricity to American homes and businesses.

71,"On the eve of a Republican Unity Rally in Frankfort to bring together the party for November's election, U.S. Senate nominee Rand Paul made more controversial statements-- this time when he told Good Morning America that President Obama sounded ""un-American"" for criticizing BP for the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.\""What I don't like from the president's administration is this sort of, 'I'll put my boot heel on the throat of BP,""' Paul said in an interview Friday morning with host George Stephanopoulos. ""I think that sounds really un-American in his criticism of business.""\Click here to watch today's unity rally starting at 11:30 a.m.\In that interview, Paul talked about the April 29 Dotiki mine collapse that killed two workers in Western Kentucky, saying ""sometimes accidents happen.""\The statements brought rebukes from a labor organization and from Kentucky Democratic Attorney General Jack Conway, Paul's opponent in the November election.\And they may cause ripples at the Unity Rally, where Paul will come face to face with the party establishment he spent months criticizing on the campaign trail and in his victory speech Tuesday.\At the same time, Kentucky's most powerful Republican, U.S. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, must decide how he will embrace the outsider who beat his endorsed candidate, Secretary of State Trey Grayson, by a blistering 23 points in Tuesday's primary election.\The unity rally at the GOP headquarters in Frankfort -- named the Mitch McConnell Building -- will feature two uneasy allies trying to come together to defeat Conway.\""The marching orders from Republican voters is: Republican leaders get your act together and let's win this thing in November,"" said Jack Richardson IV, former Jefferson County Republican Party chairman and a member of the GOP state central committee.\Adding to the intrigue is a slew of controversial statements made by Paul in the media this week regarding his stance on civil rights, followed by his remarks on the Gulf of Mexico oil spill and last month's deadly coal mining disaster in Kentucky.\Paul came under fire for saying this week that while he abhors racism and doesn't want to see the Civil Rights Act repealed, he believes it went too far in prohibiting private businesses from being able to discriminate. It was during an interview to defend his statements about civil rights that Paul broached the subjects of the oil spill and the mine collapse.\Oil Spill\Stephanopoulos asked Paul if the U.S. government had authority to tell BP that it had to use a less-toxic dispersant in its efforts to clean up the spill, which occurred after a BP oil rig collapsed last month following an explosion that killed 11 workers.\In defending the oil company and saying that we don't yet know if BP is to blame for the environmental disaster, Paul said: ""What I don't like from the president's administration is this sort of, 'I'll put my boot heel on the throat of BP.' I think that sounds really un-American in his criticism of business.""\Conway replied later Friday with a statement, saying: ""Rand Paul apparently has a deeply held conviction that corporations should be allowed to do what they see fit without oversight or accountability.""\Paul defended his statement, saying he was only talking about the tone of a statement from Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, who said administration officials would keep their ""boot on the throat"" of the oil giant until it stops the flow of millions of gallons of oil into the gulf.\""No one is saying BP did it purposeful, sabotage so they could pollute the ocean,"" Paul said. ""The thing about the statement about a boot on the throat, it sounds like something a tyrant would do to people that they are, you know, assaulting in the street. ... I think that has a tenor that is inappropriate.""\Other Republicans have criticized the government's handling of the oil spill, but few have been so vocal in defending BP.\Mine collapse\It was during his discussion of the oil spill that Paul brought up the Dotiki mine collapse, saying the accident was tragic but that ""we come in and it's always someone's fault. Maybe sometimes accidents happen.""\Such a statement could be troublesome for a candidate in the nation's third-largest coal-producing state.\Mine-safety advocate Tony Oppegard said it's premature to make such comments because the federal investigation of the Dotiki mine cave-in is not finished.\""It's easy for him to say we look for someone to blame,"" Oppegard said, ""but the fact is, this company had a horrible safety record.""\Webster Coal, which owns the mine, has been cited 840 times since January 2009 -- 323 of the citations for ""significant and substantial"" violations. The Dotiki mine has been cited 17 times in the past year and a half for failing to secure roofs and walls against falling rock and coal.\In a statement, Kimberly Freeman Brown, the executive director of the pro-labor American Rights at Work, called Paul's comment ""simply bizarre. Obviously he hasn't read the published reports about the mine disaster in his own state.""\In an interview with The Courier-Journal Friday, Paul said he was trying to make the point that ""there are tragedies that occur in all walks of our life and it's not always somebody who intentionally wanted to harm someone or was negligent, sometimes you do everything right.""\Paul said he needs to learn more about the mine and its safety record.\""I think they said there were 300 safety violations, but I think a good fact would be to find out how many safety violations do each of them get every week or every month. Was that a disproportionate amount?"" he said.\Paul said in an interview that he understands that miners want a safe working environment ""but I think the owners do too, and a lot of times ... are made out to appear that they don't care about their workers,"" he said. ""And I think that's not true.""\No GOP boycott expected\Republicans are downplaying Paul's statements while at the same time pushing him to get back on his message of reducing the federal deficit, cutting spending and minimal government intrusion.\""I don't think any Republicans will not show up because of his comments,"" said former Jefferson County Republican Party Chairman Bill Stone, who supported Grayson in the primary.\But he said Paul needs to get back on message.\""I think he showed his inexperience as a national candidate in the last couple days, which is correctable because he's highly intelligent,"" Stone said.\On Friday Paul canceled a scheduled Sunday appearance on NBC's Meet the Press, according to show host David Gregory.\Paul campaign manager David Adams said earlier Friday that he wasn't sure whether Paul would appear.\University of Kentucky political science professor Stephen Voss said that some Republicans privately have to be worried about associating with Paul after his comments this week.\""The Rand Paul fracas over the Civil Rights Act is going to encourage some of these Republicans to keep some distance from him until they see how it plays out,"" Voss said.\Officials say they plan to keep the focus of the unity rally on attacking Conway.\""The issues at hand are stopping cap and trade, the Washington liberal war on coal, balancing the federal budget and getting our nation back on the right track,"" Adams said.\Still, party leaders remain divided whether it is up to Paul or McConnell to extend an olive branch?\""It behooves (Paul) to be a good winner and understand that the reason the Senate seat from Kentucky means so much is in many ways because of what Mitch McConnell built,"" Stone said.\Paul hasn't said whether he would support McConnell's bid to remain minority leader in the Senate if elected. And, Paul made a sarcastic comment Wednesday on MSNBC's Morning Joe show when asked whether he and McConnell would campaign together in the fall.\He responded: ""We are going to be best friends now. I'm putting him on a short list on my cell phone.""\Others in the party think McConnell must reach out and welcome Paul.\""Hopefully he will do that and put this very negative campaign of Grayson's behind us,"" Richardson said.\McConnell spokesman Robert Steurer on Friday referred questions to Republican Party of Kentucky officials.\""There is no onus,"" Republican Party Chairman Steve Robertson said. ""We are one family and we are moving forward.""\Grayson spokesman Les Fugate said Grayson plans to attend as well. Grayson declined to comment through Fugate Friday.\At his concession speech Tuesday, Grayson vowed to do whatever Paul requests of him.\But J. Todd Inman, a Grayson supporter and member of the GOP state central committee, said he won't attend Saturday's rally.\""I don't really know what to expect tomorrow, because after a very long campaign sometimes people want to sit back and rest and evaluate where they are,"" he said.\Reporter Stephenie Steitzer can be reached at (502) 875-5136."
72,"The Matel family moved from Toronto to Louisville three years ago, arriving during a smoggy August summer.\At the time, Sandy Metel said, son Aydin, now 15, had mild asthma. ""But within the first year, he was hospitalized five times ... with asthma-related issues,"" she said.\Welcome to the Louisville area, she said her doctors told them.\The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says help may be on the way in the form of the controversial new carbon dioxide regulations that were proposed for power plants June 2. They have fomented opposition in coal country over fears of economic doom but found support from others who say the government is overdue in trying to curb the heat-trapping gases blamed for causing climate change.\Although the proposed regulations are designed to start a battle against rising seas, supercharged storms, epic droughts and other consequences of global warming, EPA and academic researchers say the cleaner energy they promote will have another benefit. Millions of people could breathe easier, especially those in the Ohio River Valley, where coal has long been king, and where Louisville has battled soot and smog for decades.\EPA estimates that the rules, when in full force in 2030, will prevent 2,700 to 6,600 premature deaths and 140,000 to 150,000 asthma attacks nationally.\""People have a hard time relating to climate benefits (and to) carbon dioxide,"" which is not a pollutant in the traditional sense, said Charles Driscoll, professor of environmental systems engineering at Syracuse University. He's the co-author of a May 27 report that assessed the potential co-benefits of curbing carbon dioxide emissions on a scale proposed by the EPA.\""The advantage of this analysis is that it tries to focus on local benefits that would impact people and their lives,"" he said.\With co-authors from Harvard University, the team found air quality in the Ohio River Valley potentially stands to gain the most from the proposed EPA action. That's because some of the region's coal-fired power plants could be replaced by natural gas or other cleaner sources, Driscoll said.\Kentucky ranked first for potential decreases in average annual and summer peak ozone levels, and ninth in potential reduction in fine particle pollution, or soot, while Indiana ranked 5th and 12th, respectively.\""The areas that have the poorest air quality derive the highest benefits,"" Driscoll said.\Political opposition\The proposed rules have been seriously questioned by Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear, a Democrat. There also has been an outcry from Kentucky Republicans in Congress; Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, a Republican; Senate hopeful Alison Lundergan Grimes, a Democrat; and Kentucky coal interests. They all are worried about the loss of jobs, higher electric rates and other damage to the economy.\The Electric Reliability Coordinating Council, a lobbying firm in Washington, D.C., that represents energy company and utilities, argues that the EPA may be double counting health benefits of existing rules, such as those to curb mercury emissions, and any from the proposed carbon regulations, calling it a ""public health bait and switch.""\Kentucky Coal Association President Bill Bissett said coal burning already has become much cleaner, as utilities have invested in scrubbers and other pollution controls.\He argued that, if the regulations cause a shift away from coal, electricity won't be as reliable, and that could imperil public health more than air pollution. Blackouts or brownouts could make air conditioning fail, putting people at risk from sweltering summer heat, he said.\Further, he said, people just won't want to pay more for electricity.\""If you are a person in Louisville,"" he asked, ""is your concern air quality, or paying your electric bill on the other side of these regulations?""\Greater Louisville Inc., the metro chamber of commerce, has formed a working group to review the proposed regulations and their potential costs and benefits, but is not ready to comment on them, said GLI spokeswoman Susan Overton.\""We do believe that a balance can be achieved between pro-business growth policy and environmental responsibility,"" she said.\The EPA counters that its proposal is affordable. Nationally, average monthly electricity bills are anticipated to increase by roughly 3 percent by 2020, but decline by roughly 9 percent by 2030 because increased energy efficiency will lead to reduced usage, it said.\EPA officials also deny its Clean Energy Plan will make electricity unreliable. And the rules in it will help improve overall air quality, even as they seek to lead the world in a global solution to climate change.\EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy touted those health benefits when she unveiled the proposal earlier this month:\""As a bonus, we'll cut pollution that causes smog and soot 25 percent more than if we didn't have this plan in place. The first year these standards go into effect, we will avoid 100,000 asthma attacks and 2,100 heart attacks, and the numbers go up from there.""\Existing rules and cheaper natural gas pricing already are driving some utilities to convert from coal to natural gas.\The Tennessee Valley Authority's large coal-burning Paradise plant in Muhlenberg County is one example. Louisville officials have said for years that the pollution from Paradise blows into the metro area, and have welcomed previous moves by TVA to lower its emissions.\TVA intends to replace two coal-burning units with a 1,000-megawatt cleaner-burning natural gas plant in 2017, spokesman Duncan Mansfield said.\TVA also is weighing the future of its 10-unit Shawnee plant near Paducah. One of those units already has been idled, Mansfield said.\The authors of the academic study said they did not count health benefits from power plant conversions that were triggered by any existing regulations.\""For our analysis, all of the results represent additional benefits beyond what would be achieved by existing regulations,"" said co-author Kathy Fallon Lambert, senior investigator at Harvard Forest.\Making progress\Air regulators said it's too soon to predict how the new rules might affect air quality.\EPA could change its proposal, and Kentucky is a long way from developing its plan on how to comply with EPA's carbon dioxide goals, said John Lyons, assistant secretary for climate policy in the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet.\Because the rules give states some flexibility, it's not certain that Kentucky's power plants, so dominated by coal, may change much more than is already happening, Lyons said.\""Will there be a co-benefit? I don't know,"" he said. ""That would be a real look at the crystal ball.""\To meet their carbon dioxide goals, states can embrace alternative energy -- such as solar, wind or hydro power. They also can develop better programs to help homes and businesses use electricity more efficiently; and they can join regional ""cap-and-trade"" programs, in which utilities that cut pollution sell credits to those that do not.\Driscoll said his team's study used an economic model that allowed for such trading and energy efficiency to occur. ""We don't really know how it will play out,"" he said. ""Different states could chose to implement things differently.""\The American Lung Association gave Louisville failing grades for ozone and fine particle pollution in its 2014 State of the Air Report. At risk in Jefferson County alone, the association says, are 17,500 children and 64,000 adults with asthma, and tens of thousands more with cardiovascular diseases.\Pollution makes it hard for many people to breathe, Louisville asthma patient Evangeline Smith said.\""If (city officials) have air quality alerts, you really shouldn't go outside,"" she said. ""I have a great-grandson with asthma problems, and we have to watch him a lot.""\Because children breathe more quickly than adults, they are especially at risk, said Dr. Julia Richerson, interim medical director at Family Health Centers of Louisville, a nonprofit agency that offers services regardless of insurance or ability to pay.\She also said low-income and minority communities often are in areas with more pollution, such as along busy roads or near industrial plants, putting them at extra risk.\Air quality in Louisville has steadily improved as EPA's standards have been tightened, said Rachael Hamilton, assistant director of the Louisville Metro Air Pollution Control District.\Cleaner air not only helps people breathe easier, it gives the city more room for economic development, she said.\But the city still has challenges, even though it's been on a cleaner-air streak since last year. With mild summer weather, all ozone readings in 2013 and so far this year have met federal smog standards, according to district records.\Still, Louisville violated the ozone standard due to poor air quality in 2012's summer, and EPA is looking at further tightening that standard.\""The ozone standard is in all likelihood going to be lower,"" Hamilton said. ""We will have some work to do there.""\Louisville has made a case that it now meets federal soot standards but is waiting for agreement from EPA. And the city fails to meet the federal standard for sulfur dioxide in the area around the Mill Creek power plant in southwestern Jefferson County.\So any less pollution that results from the carbon dioxide regulations would help the city's efforts to improve air quality, Hamilton said.\Hamilton said the EPA has put forward a ""good supporting argument"" that its carbon dioxide rules also will reduce other pollutants, while noting that ""there are significant benefits already underway.\""This (the carbon rules) will help capitalize on those.""\Reach reporter James Bruggers at (502) 582-4645 or on Twitter @jbruggers.\ozone & soot\Number of days each year where Louisville metro area had ozone levels that were higher than the federal standard:\19\2010\23\2011\23\2012\0\2013\0\2014\Months\exceeding the annual standard of fine particle pollution:\4\2010\3\2011\0\2012\1\2013\1\2014\Source:\Louisville Metro Air Pollution Control District.\Why high ozone is bad\Makes it more difficult to breathe deeply and vigorously\Causes shortness of breath\Inflames and damages the airways\Aggravates lung diseases such as asthma, emphysema and chronic bronchitis\Why fine particle\pollution is bad\Sometimes called soot, or PM 2.5, it describes very tiny particulate matter that is 2.5 micrometers in diameter or smaller, or one-thirtieth the diameter of a human hair.

WASHINGTON -- Of the two main American political parties, Republicans are now clearly distinguished by their driving desire to lose. Every faction seems determined to rule the kingdom of irrelevance.
\
Witness the reaction to the National Council for a New America - an anodyne ""listening tour"" by Republican officials recently kicked off at a pizza parlor in Northern Virginia. Social conservatives attacked this forum on education and the economy for the offense of not being a forum on abortion and the traditional family. Neo-Reaganites searched the transcript for nonexistent slights: How dare former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush criticize ""nostalgia"" for the ""good old days?"" Why didn't he just spit on Ronald Reagan's grave? Other conservatives criticized the very idea of a listening tour, asking, ""What's to hear?""
\
During a recent conversation, Bush described himself as ""dumfounded by the reaction."" He added: ""I don't think listening is a weakness. People are yearning to be heard. Perhaps we should begin with a little humility.""
\
There is much for Republicans to be humble about. The party, says Bush, faces ""dramatically changing demographics, especially Hispanics in swing states,"" the ""alienation of young voters"" and an unprecedented drop in support among college graduates.
\
""Trying to be all things to all people isn't going to work,"" Bush contends. The goal is ""not to redefine our beliefs, but to recognize challenges and adapt,"" particularly on the issues of national security, health care, education, the economy and the environment. Republicans need to ""focus on creating policies relevant to today - not things relevant 20, 30 or 40 years ago.""
\
Jeb Bush insists that this focus on creative policy can be unifying because ""conservatives have more in common than they disagree on."" And the Republican Party has been unified in opposition to President Obama's disturbing accumulation of federal debt and power. But on other issues, it seems to me that Republicans are likely to pass through a series of wrenching debates before they arrive at ""policies relevant to today.""
\
Take the environment. For many Americans, especially the young, concern about carbon emissions and climate disruption is no longer a conviction; it is a value. It is possible that climate change skeptics - the dominant Republican voices - have uncovered a vast scientific delusion, like the belief in phlogiston or phrenology. But given the compelling evidence from glaciology, botany and marine biology, this seems unlikely.
\
Republicans have distinctive contributions to make on climate policy.
\
They might support a carbon tax instead of a cumbersome cap-and-trade system. They should insist that all revenues gained from a carbon tax or the sale of pollution permits go back to the American people in lower taxes. But the main policy choice is binary: Should a cost be imposed on carbon emissions? If Republicans generally say no, they will not be viewed as belonging to an environmental party.
\
A similar argument can be made concerning health care. Obamacare, in its nascent form, seems deeply flawed - using a system of fines, new bureaucracies and subsides to push workers toward a plan resembling Medicare. Republicans have long supported alternatives that subsidize the individual ownership of private health insurance. But these proposals generally have been incremental, poorly explained and largely ignored.
\
A credible Republican alternative would employ a more generous refundable tax credit that enables the working poor to purchase basic health insurance - essentially creating an entitlement to health care through the private insurance system. This is perhaps the only real alternative to the slow socialization of American health care. It is also costly.
\
Or consider immigration. Immigrants hold diverse political views, but they also make a determination about parties and politicians: Do they welcome us? The answer from Republicans has often been equivocal. Some of this is a matter of tone. But it is difficult to imagine a remedy to this impression of resentment without Republican support for immigration reform that includes a legal status for temporary workers and a realistic path to citizenship.
\
Each of these policies - carbon restrictions, universal health insurance and immigration reform - could eventually be important to the Republican recovery. But would a candidate carrying these ideas transform the Republican Party, or be destroyed by it? The hostile reaction to the pizza parlor putsch provides one answer.
\
But this is a snapshot, not a prophecy. As the years pass, the kingdom of irrelevance seems less and less pleasant, even to its rulers. Policy shifts that seem incredible become inevitable. This is how a party prepares to win.

Switching Kentucky's allegiance from coal to natural gas can't be the only energy solution for the state to meet federal environmental mandates.
\
To meet likely regulations to reduce greenhouse emissions, Kentucky needs to further diversify its energy base, which means looking at the possibility of nuclear power and lifting the moratorium on construction of such power plants in the state, according to Len Peters, secretary of the state's Energy and Environment Cabinet.
\
""And some of us believe we have to keep the possibility of nuclear energy alive because we can't do everything with renewables,"" Peters said.
\
Gov. Steve Beshear's energy plan in 2008 included the possibility of looking at nuclear power.
\
""He has voiced that on a couple of occasions, but not as clearly as he has recently,"" Peters said. ""He clearly sees the advantage of diversified energy sources ... and nuclear would be one of those options. He feels strongly that by lifting that moratorium, we could have conversations with companies that might be interested in having a nuclear plant here.""
\
Sen. Bob Leeper, I-Paducah, has persistently tried to get that moratorium lifted and plans to do so again this year. There might be more impetus for it this year after plans to stop the enrichment of uranium at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant were announced in March.
\
The plant is operated by the United States Enrichment Corp. but is owned by the Department of Energy. When USEC, which has had financial difficulties, and the U.S. Department of Energy could not reach a lease agreement, USEC said it would halt production, leaving up to 1,000 people out of work - people who have knowledge about the nuclear energy business and its safety protocols.
\
""Just because we would lift the moratorium doesn't mean we would build a nuclear plant, but we could have serious discussions about it,"" Peters said. ""And if we were to build a (plant), would Paducah be a likely place? Yes, but it wouldn't be the only place we would consider one.""
\
Peters said the state has had what it calls ""high-level"" conversations with Tennessee Valley Authority and other power companies - something to the effect of, ""Would you be interested"" in a small modular reactor approach?
\
A small modular reactor would be able to generate in the range of 300 megawatts of power at any given time, considerably less than the giant plants known to produce up to 2,000 megawatts at any given time.
\
The smaller size would mean they would cost less to construct - potentially under the $1 billion mark - instead of the multi-billions spent on construction of larger plants. It still would be able to power thousands of households.
\
A plant under construction in Augusta, Ga., has had cost overruns and is more than a year behind schedule. The New York Times recently reported that the project would now cost about $14 billion, and the first reactor is not scheduled to begin producing power until sometime in 2017.
\
There are actually no small modular reactors in operation yet. Peters expects it will be seven to 10 years before that occurs, but there are companies taking a look at them.
\
Once the first one or two are built, they should be easier to replicate elsewhere, he said.
\
The federal Department of Energy is behind the small reactor effort and has created the Small Modular Reactor Licensing Technical Support program to help with licensing and commercialization of those types of reactors.
\
Westinghouse expects to have its U.S. small modular reactor up and running in 2022. The company began design of its small modular reactor in 2011. The company, in a news release, said that it is using already licensed and tested technology. It will use Robust Fuel Technology that is in use in four Westinghouse plants under construction in China and plants under construction in Georgia and South Carolina.
\
Westinghouse touts that its small modular reactor will produce the most power, using the least amount of material, leaving behind a small carbon footprint. The standalone facility will need just 15 acres and could be ideal to replace aging fossil fuel plants.
\
Nuclear is not the answer, groups say
\
Environmental group The Sierra Club does not favor lifting the moratorium on building nuclear power plants in Kentucky.
\
""We are opposed to that on several fronts,"" said Aloma Dew of the Western Kentucky chapter. ""We are on several earthquake faults, with a major one, the New Madrid Fault, being centered near Paducah. And Kentucky is woven with underground caves and water. We just don't think it would be a very good place for nuclear power.""
\
Kentucky Resources Council also opposes lifting the ban.
\
""We have opposed lifting the moratorium every time it has come up,"" director Tom FitzGerald said. ""Lifting the moratorium is not going to result in construction of a reactor. The nuclear power industry has priced itself out of the market even before the explosion of shale gas extraction.""
\
It's the council's position that it would be irresponsible to even consider building the next generation of reactors, small or large, until there is a long-term plan for the disposal and management for waste generation.
\
""Plants are generating waste for which we have no strategy for disposal,"" FitzGerald said. ""So there are signficiant waste fuel rods managed at 104 plants around the country in either dry casks or wet pools. Years ago, the commonwealth decided that each county had to be responsible for identifying a waste disposal strategy for its garbage. ... I don't think it's too much to ask for the nuclear power industry ... in conjunction with the Department of Energy to come up with a solution for its waste. Yucca Mountain was supposed to be that solution, but now that is off the table.""
\
The Department of Energy in 2010 withdrew its support - because of political pressure - of the deep storage that would have been provided in Nevada's Yucca Mountain, and no other solutions have come forward. Kentucky just closed its Maxie Flats nuclear disposal site and doesn't need to face that possibility again, FitzGerald said. The 900-acre property in Fleming County accepted nuclear waste in the 1960s and 1970s, and in 1986, it was listed on Environmental Protection Agency's National Priority List for cleanup. The site has been cleaned up but requires constant monitoring.
\
FitzGerald said that the small modular reactors discussed by Peters would generate less nuclear waste, ""but that still has to be managed.""
\
The council in 2012 did support a legislative amendment to the moratorium that would have allowed Kentucky to be considered for a small reactor that would have powered the conversion of gas or coal into energy.
\
""The design of the nuclear-assisted conversion process results in a 97 percent reduction of waste over conventional nuclear power plants, and allows for in-ground storage, significantly reducing homeland security concerns and risks of accidental releases of spent fuel into the environment,"" FitzGerald said in a letter to House energy committee members at the time.
\
That project hasn't happened, he said.
\
The group Kentuckians for the Commonwealth has similar concerns.
\
""Clean air, water and land are every Kentuckian's right. Nuclear power may be very efficient, but it's also incredibly risky,"" Bowling Green member Alan Smith said in an email to the Daily News. ""We need energy solutions that give us the power we need without harming the people and the land. Nuclear plants have the potential for catastrophic, long-term damage. We have proximity to the New Madrid fault line in Kentucky. We also have karst topography all over the state, which would mean any leaks or waste spills would be extremely difficult to clean up. It could take hundreds of years to fix the problem.
\
""We don't need that kind of risk for our water, our land and our great-grandchildren. Solar, wind, efficiency updates, and other renewable solutions offer the energy we need without such awful risks.""
\
Coal's future not bright
\
Peters doubts that we will see the construction of any new coal plants.
\
""The climate plan released by the president in late June is pushing for more controls on new power plants,"" Peters said. ""If ... they are built today ... we will not get coal plants, they would be gas fired because of the considerably lower (carbon dioxide) emissions.""
\
Coal plants just can't meet the new emissions standards, and the cost of carbon capture and storage would make such a plant ""cost at least as much as what a new nuclear plant might be.""
\
And while Kentucky's Republican federal lawmakers cry foul when the Obama administration and the Environmental Protection Agency lay out regulations for coal-fired plants, a July report by a coalition of environmental groups including the Sierra Club says not enough is being done. Most of today's regulations deal with air emissions; this group also wants stiffer controls on what is being discharged into streams either from runoff through combustion waste called ash or from pollution control scrubbers.
\
The report contends that coal-fired plants are the largest source of water pollution in the U.S., releasing such pollutants as arsenic, boron, cadmium, lead, mercury and other heavy metals from plants. Regulations that are three decades old need to be updated, the report says.
\
Kentucky has 20 coal-fired plants, and the report notes that six of them are discharging into an impaired waterway, although not necessarily impaired by coal plant pollution alone. The plants are in Hancock, Mercer, Pulaski, Woodford, Clark and Daviess counties. Owensboro Municipal Utilities, for instance, discharges into the Ohio River, where there is a fish consumption advisory because of the mercury levels in the fish.
\
The report urges that plants move to dry ash handling and use biological treatments or other methods to eliminate tons of toxic pollutions, measures it said the EPA estimates would cost consumers about ""two pennies a day.""
\
But part of the proposal ""includes illegal and weak options inserted by political operatives, rather than EPA scientists. These options would preserve the status quo or do little to control dangerous pollution dumping,"" the report said.
\
Coal production falls over the years
\
As a sign reflecting the times, production of coal in eastern Kentucky has significantly declined, while western Kentucky coal production has been somewhat stable.
\
""We have seen a substantial decline over the past several years in the production of coal,"" Peters said. ""Last year we produced 92 million tons. In 1990 there was 180 million tons. All of the decline has been in the eastern Kentucky coalfields where production costs are higher.
\
""People have suggested that international exports of coal are going to be a major factor in keeping coal alive. It will be somewhat of a factor, but not all of it. In Kentucky we use 30 million to 25 million tons of coal a year to keep the electricity fleet going. The rest has always been exported outside the state.""
\
Many of those states are already switching to natural gas.
\
It's unlikely that the state can export as much coal to places such as China and India as it has previously to states in the Southeast and Midwest, Peters said.
\
In fact, a deal made nearly a year ago to ship 6 million to 9 million tons of coal a year to India has yet to come to fruition. An official from Booth Energy told Louisville-based National Public Radio station WFPL last month that regulators in India are trying to solve certain issues there before the country can receive the first shipment.
\
As eastern Kentucky coal production has declined, so has the coal severance money that goes to those counties where it is mined. The severance tax is a way to compensate counties for the wear and tear on their infrastructure from mining operations. Half of the money goes to the state to use as it sees fit, and the other half goes to those counties directly where coal is mined. Late last month, eastern Kentucky lawmakers pre-filed legislation that would try to grab all of that funding for themselves.
\
The significant decline in severance funds for those eastern Kentucky counties began in April 2012, according to the Kentucky Center for Economic Policy. From April 2012 to March 2012, eastern Kentucky generated $154 million in severance funds, compared to $228 million for the year before. The group is calling for one fifth of the severance tax funds to be placed in an endowment that could grow to $735 million by 2020. Funds in the endowment would be used to help diversify the area's economy.
\
What's the status of other renewables?
\
There still is no commercial application in use here to produce biofuels from such things as switch grass or even algae.
\
""Eastern Kentucky Power in Maysville co-fired switchgrass and the technology works,"" said Tim Hughes, director of biofuels for Kentucky's Department of Energy Development and Independence. ""It is just that the economics are not there without being able to have some type of carbon tax on coal.""
\
A carbon tax would dramatically increase the cost of using coal, making other alternatives more competitive.
\
Switchgrass, while not difficult to grow, is difficult and could be expensive to transport long distances. The University of Kentucky determined that until a stable biomass market developed, switchgrass could be used for forage.
\
Duke Energy and the University of Kentucky are experimenting with using carbon dioxide and heat emissions from coal plants to grow algae. The algae reduces carbon emissions and in turn may be able to generate power.
\
A coal boiler in Louisville that provided steam for the chemical production process at Lubrizol and Zeon manufacturing companies was converted to a biomass boiler, according to Mathew Markee, president and chief operating officer of Recast Energy. Recast Energy, which is based in Richmond, Va., did the conversion project and now owns the physical plant. It gets some of its biomass from Louisville metro parks when trees have been trimmed or downed by storms. Markee said the company gets its waste wood within a 50- to 60-mile radius.
\
Recast has projects in Mississippi and the Dominican Republic, both are steam production projects, but energy production is under consideration in the Dominican Republic, according to the company's website.
\
Hughes said that ecoPower Generation is proposing a wood-based electrical generation plant in Hazard. Kentucky Power in April filed with the Public Service Commission its intention to purchase power from the company, which uses sawmill waste as its biomass. Biomass would supply a portion of Kentucky Power's needs. The PSC has not yet made a decision on the request.
\
Dominion Power in Virginia earlier this month started up the first of three power plants it is converting from coal to biomass. The company says the change will mean lower emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter and mercury. The addition of the three biomass power stations will help Virginia meet a voluntary renewable energy goal of 15 percent by 2025.
\
Beshear's 2008 plan called on Kentucky to reduce its use of standard energy sources by 25 percent through a combination of improving efficiency and using renewables by 2025.
\
""But nuclear is not the answer for Kentucky,"" Dew said. ""We need to explore how we can find more renewable, sustainable kinds of energy.""

There is no denying it: Climate-change deniers are in retreat.
\
What began as a subtle shift away from the claim that man-made global warming is not a threat to the planet has lately turned into a stampede. The latest attempt to deny denial comes from the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council, a powerful group that pushes for states to pass laws that are often drafted by industry. As my Washington Post colleagues Tom Hamburger, Joby Warrick and Chris Mooney report, ALEC is not only insisting that it doesn't deny climate change -- it's threatening to sue those who suggest otherwise.
\
The group, which suffered the highly visible defection of Google because of its global-warming stance and an exodus of other top corporate members, sent letters to Common Cause and the League of Conservation Voters instructing them to ""remove all false or misleading material"" alleging ALEC questions global-warming theory.
\
The problem for ALEC is that as recently as 2013, it was still reaffirming ""model legislation"" calling on states to consider ""legitimate and scientifically defensible alternative hypotheses"" to the ""mainstream scientific positions"" on climate. The proposed legislation stated that there is ""a great deal of scientific uncertainty"" about the matter and suggested that states treat possible beneficial effects of carbon ""in an evenhanded manner.""
\
The turnabout at ALEC follows an about-face at the Heartland Institute, a libertarian outfit that embraces a description of it as ""the world's most prominent think tank promoting skepticism about man-made climate change.""
\
But on Christmas Eve, Justin Haskins, a blogger and editor at Heartland, penned an article for the conservative journal Human Events declaring: ""The real debate is not whether man is, in some way, contributing to climate change; it's true that the science is settled on that point in favor of the alarmists.""
\
Haskins called it ""a rather extreme position to say that we ought to allow dangerous pollutants to destroy the only planet we know of that can completely sustain human life,"" and he suggested work on ""technologies that can reduce CO2 emissions without destroying whole economies.""
\
To be sure, this is a tactical retreat, and you shouldn't expect conservative groups to start lining up in favor of a carbon tax. Rather, they're resorting to more defensible arguments that don't make them sound like flat-earthers. My Post colleagues quoted energy lobbyist Scott Segal saying that ""the science issue just isn't as salient as it once was."" Instead, Segal talks about the cost and viability of proposed regulations.
\
It's likely no coincidence that the shift is occurring as the Obama administration approaches a June target to finalize rules on power-plant emissions. Those who oppose regulation are wise to abandon a position that holds little public appeal; a healthy majority of Americans accept that global warming is real, and a New York Times poll earlier this year found that even half of Republicans support government action to address it.
\
More and more conservative officeholders are embracing the ""I am not a scientist"" agnosticism on climate change rather than skepticism. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Speaker John Boehner and potential presidential candidates Bobby Jindal and Marco Rubio have adopted this response, and Rubio has joined Mitt Romney and Chuck Grassley in embracing the less assailable position that U.S. efforts to restrict carbon are pointless without similar efforts across the globe.
\
Certainly, figures such as Senate Environment Committee Chairman Jim Inhofe (who calls man-made warming a ""hoax"") and presidential candidate Ted Cruz (who fancies himself a modern-day Galileo opposing the ""global-warming alarmists"") are not about to change. But as corporations abandon the untenable position of denial, ideologues will be forced to do the same.
\
As my Post colleagues noted, Southern Co., an operator of coal-fired power plants, decided to drop funding for a Smithsonian scientist who challenged climate-change theory but failed to disclose that his work was funded by fossil-fuel interests. ALEC's declining skepticism also comes as even oil companies such as Occidental Petroleum and BP quit the group.
\
At ALEC's December meeting, a climate-change contrarian got applause for declaring in his presentation that ""carbon dioxide is not a pollutant. It is a benefit. It is the very elixir of life.""
\
For politicians and climate-denial groups, the elixir of life is money. Now that corporations are becoming reluctant to bankroll crazy theories, the surrender of climate-change deniers will follow.
"
76,"Special to The Courier-Journal\Late this summer, Billy and Eileen Tussy of Floyd County, Kentucky, returned home to find a boulder the size of a large SUV sitting in their bedroom. A year ago, the Austin Power company asked to lease the Tussys' land for strip mining. The couple refused, but last month, blasting on an adjacent strip mine dislodged the boulder that tore through the Tussys' home, knocking it from the foundation.\Around that time, the U.S. Supreme Court was pushing forward a case that might give American corporations the right to make direct, perhaps unlimited contributions to political campaigns. The right-leaning Court seems likely to approve of such financial ""free speech"" under the doctrine that corporations should have the same rights as individual ""persons.""\These two events have become linked in my mind because of something the Austin Power's Corporate Risk Manager, Constantine Toscidis, said when asked if his company would at least apologize to the Tussys: ""We don't really go there.""\""There"" would be a place of regret and responsibility, and though that is exactly the place any person of conscience would go, it isn't the moral terrain into which a corporation is willing to venture. And that, fundamentally, is the danger of granting corporations the rights of people.\If a person, or a corporation, cannot be depended on to act out of conscience, the next lever of coercion, historically, has been guilt. Most people can be shamed, through an unwritten social contract, into refraining from destructive behavior that might harm others in their community.\But the unfortunate reality is that some people have no shame. Consider a recent front page photograph in the New York Times of 7-year-old Ryan Massey, whose deteriorating teeth have almost all been capped. Reporter Charles Duhigg discovered that the Massey family's drinking water contains high levels of barium, lead and manganese. Since 2004, coal operators around the Masseys' home have injected 1.9 billion gallons of coal waste into abandoned underground mine shafts. Three of the larger operators even reported to state officials that 93 percent of what they injected into the ground contained illegal concentrations of the heavy metals that scoured the enamel off Ryan Massey's teeth and caused lesions to appear on the skin of his 6-year-old brother.\The reason the companies reported their own violations is because they knew the Environmental Protection Agency would not hold them accountable for their crimes.\Last summer, I visited Prenter Hollow, a coal mining community in West Virginia where residents are suffering from abnormally high levels of kidney failure. An 8-year-old child there developed a kidney stone and a 16-year-old girl died of cancer. West Virginia's Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) denied any underground injections of mine waste around Prenter Hollow until resident Bobbie Mitchell produced a document to the contrary. When someone from the DEP asked Mitchell where he found such a document, Mitchell replied, ""Your office.""\Still the EPA denies that any of this mine waste is seeping into the community's drinking water, even while admitting it has done no research into the matter.\So an industry with no shame poisons a community and the agencies that are supposed to regulate such abuse either abet it or look the other way. Meanwhile, the highest court in the land seems poised to grant these very corporations even more power to influence government and its regulatory agencies.\This is no way to run a country. Much less a democracy.\Forty years ago, Garrett Hardin gave this sociopathic behavior a name -- the tragedy of the commons. Individuals, that is corporations, with no concern for the common good pollute and destroy the environments we all share. They roll boulders off the sides of strip mines, they dump carcinogens into the water, they pump dangerous particulate mater and carbon dioxide into the air.\At such times, wrote Hardin, cries of corporate rights and freedom start to resound. ""But what does 'freedom' mean?"" he asked. ""When men mutually agreed to pass laws against robbing, mankind became more free, not less so."" From Wall Street to the back roads of Appalachia, unprincipled corporations have raided the commons, making us far less free from their usury, toxicity, chicanery and violence.\How then do we stop these agents that have no conscience or shame? One way to coerce them into more socially responsible behavior is to tax their harmful actions. A carbon tax, for instance, would force the energy industry to stop pillaring the mountains of Appalachia and pursue instead sources of energy that won't cause a climate crisis or poison drinking water.\Another way is to truly regulate and eliminate harmful behavior. Next week, the Senate committee on Energy and Natural Resources will vote on whether to confirm Jospeh Pizarchik as the head of the Office of Surface Mining (OSM).

77,"Trey Hollingsworth and Liz Watson\are vying in\Indiana's 9th Congressional District\U.S. Rep. Trey Hollingsworth, a Republican and challenger Liz Watson, a Democrat, are vying in Indiana's 9th Congressional District, which includes Jeffersonville and New Albany. To help readers get a feel for where they stand on issues like the economy, health care and the environment, we posed five questions to them. Here are their responses:\Do the new tax cuts favor corporations or the wealthy over the middle class, and should they be made permanent for the middle class?\Hollingsworth: Ninety-seven percent of Hoosiers benefited from the tax cuts, and the economy is stronger than it has been in decades with low unemployment and growing wages. Hoosiers deserve to keep more of their paychecks to spend on their family, not higher taxes to support the Washington bureaucracy.\Watson: Here's what the new tax law does: By 2027, 53 percent of us will see a tax increase, and 83 percent of the gains will go to the top 1 percent. I want a permanent tax cut for the middle class and small businesses, not for millionaires like Trey Hollingsworth.\Would you support abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement arm of the Homeland Security Department?\Hollingsworth: Absolutely not. Criminals, drugs and human traffickers have come across our border for too long. In 2017, ICE apprehended 4,800 gang members; 7,000 pounds of heroin; and over 100,000 criminal illegal aliens. I stand behind ICE and our law enforcement that keep our country and communities safe.\Watson: We can secure our borders and enforce our laws without locking kids in cages or bankrupting Hoosier farmers. I don't support abolishing ICE, but I do support reforms to make sure it's doing its job humanely and effectively.\Should Congress move to abolish or improve the Affordable Care Act? Is a single-payer system an option?\Hollingsworth: Even doubling the taxes of every single family and business, Americans still couldn't afford the $32 trillion government takeover of health care being proposed by liberal politicians. Health care companies should compete to deliver you better options at cheaper prices, not put government bureaucrats in charge of your health care.\Watson: Three-hundred thousand Hoosiers got health care through the Affordable Care Act. Abolishing it is not an option. But we do need to improve it, and every option for bringing down health care prices should be considered — from letting the government negotiate prescription drug prices, to expanding Medicare to cover everyone.\Should Congress pass further restrictions on guns or should there be additional security at schools to prevent mass shootings?\Hollingsworth: Students should never feel unsafe at school. Earlier this year, I joined with a bipartisan majority in the House to pass a bill to improve school security. In addition to funding deterrent measures, it finally improves training on handling mental health crises and sets up a system for reporting threats.\Watson: I grew up in a home with guns. I support the Second Amendment. But I'm also a mom, and I want commonsense gun laws to keep my kids safe. Research on gun violence, universal background checks — we can fight for these, and for school safety, and for the Constitution too.\Is the nation headed in the right direction on carbon emissions?\Hollingsworth: U.S. carbon emissions per GDP dollar have been declining for decades while China's emissions continue to be the highest in the world. Yet, liberal politicians want to kill our economic growth and prevent businesses from investing with more red-tape. I want Hoosiers, not bureaucrats, in charge of Hoosiers' futures.\Watson: In some ways, the country has made real progress on carbon emissions. Indiana has 44,000 clean energy jobs. But we can do more, for the environment and our economy, by passing a carbon tax that will incentivize companies to invest in clean energy. For our children's sake, we'll keep working.\Trey Hollingsworth and Liz Watson\are vying in\Indiana's 9th Congressional District\CREDIT: Phillip M. Bailey"
78,"Late this summer, Billy and Eileen Tussy of Floyd County, Kentucky, returned home to find a boulder the size of a large SUV sitting in their bedroom. A year ago, the Austin Power company asked to lease the Tussys' land for strip mining. The couple refused, but last month, blasting on an adjacent strip mine dislodged the boulder that tore through the Tussys' home, knocking it from the foundation.\Around that time, the U.S. Supreme Court was pushing forward a case that might give American corporations the right to make direct, perhaps unlimited contributions to political campaigns. The right-leaning Court seems likely to approve of such financial ""free speech"" under the doctrine that corporations should have the same rights as individual ""persons.""\These two events have become linked in my mind because of something the Austin Power's Corporate Risk Manager, Constantine Toscidis, said when asked if his company would at least apologize to the Tussys: ""We don't really go there.""\""There"" would be a place of regret and responsibility, and though that is exactly the place any person of conscience would go, it isn't the moral terrain into which a corporation is willing to venture. And that, fundamentally, is the danger of granting corporations the rights of people.\If a person, or a corporation, cannot be depended on to act out of conscience, the next lever of coercion, historically, has been guilt. Most people can be shamed, through an unwritten social contract, into refraining from destructive behavior that might harm others in their community.\But the unfortunate reality is that some people have no shame. Consider a recent front page photograph in the New York Times of 7-year-old Ryan Massey, whose deteriorating teeth have almost all been capped. Reporter Charles Duhigg discovered that the Massey family's drinking water contains high levels of barium, lead and manganese. Since 2004, coal operators around the Masseys' home have injected 1.9 billion gallons of coal waste into abandoned underground mine shafts. Three of the larger operators even reported to state officials that 93 percent of what they injected into the ground contained illegal concentrations of the heavy metals that scoured the enamel off Ryan Massey's teeth and caused lesions to appear on the skin of his 6-year-old brother.\The reason the companies reported their own violations is because they knew the Environmental Protection Agency would not hold them accountable for their crimes.\Last summer, I visited Prenter Hollow, a coal mining community in West Virginia where residents are suffering from abnormally high levels of kidney failure. An 8-year-old child there developed a kidney stone and a 16-year-old girl died of cancer. West Virginia's Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) denied any underground injections of mine waste around Prenter Hollow until resident Bobbie Mitchell produced a document to the contrary. When someone from the DEP asked Mitchell where he found such a document, Mitchell replied, ""Your office.""\Still the EPA denies that any of this mine waste is seeping into the community's drinking water, even while admitting it has done no research into the matter.\So an industry with no shame poisons a community and the agencies that are supposed to regulate such abuse either abet it or look the other way. Meanwhile, the highest court in the land seems poised to grant these very corporations even more power to influence government and its regulatory agencies.\This is no way to run a country. Much less a democracy.\Forty years ago, Garrett Hardin gave this sociopathic behavior a name -- the tragedy of the commons. Individuals, that is corporations, with no concern for the common good pollute and destroy the environments we all share. They roll boulders off the sides of strip mines, they dump carcinogens into the water, they pump dangerous particulate mater and carbon dioxide into the air.\At such times, wrote Hardin, cries of corporate rights and freedom start to resound. ""But what does 'freedom' mean?"" he asked. ""When men mutually agreed to pass laws against robbing, mankind became more free, not less so."" From Wall Street to the back roads of Appalachia, unprincipled corporations have raided the commons, making us far less free from their usury, toxicity, chicanery and violence.\How then do we stop these agents that have no conscience or shame? One way to coerce them into more socially responsible behavior is to tax their harmful actions. A carbon tax, for instance, would force the energy industry to stop pillaring the mountains of Appalachia and pursue instead sources of energy that won't cause a climate crisis or poison drinking water.\Another way is to truly regulate and eliminate harmful behavior. Next week, the Senate committee on Energy and Natural Resources will vote on whether to confirm Jospeh Pizarchik as the head of the Office of Surface Mining (OSM). While overseeing Pennsylvania's bureau of mining, Pizarchik approved the burying of coal ash in underground mine sites and lobbied EPA to weaken discharge limits on manganese.\Given that record, I suspect President Obama would have a hard time explaining his nomination of Pizarchik to Ryan Massey's mother.\Clearly this country has a long way to go in finding a balance between the rights of industry and social responsibility. One step would be to reject Joseph Pizarchik's appointment to head OSM and instead name someone, such as Kentucky environmental lawyer Joe Childers, who has a true concern for the commons, a real empathy for those who share it.\Erik Reece is the author of ""American Gospel: On History, Family and the Kingdom of God.""

79,"goal of rewards plan\By Patrick Howington\phowington@courier-journal.com\The Courier-Journal\Seeking to slow the growth in energy consumption, LG&E and Kentucky Utilities have proposed giving customers rewards for energy-efficient purchases and practices.\They would include rebate checks of $50 to $300 for buying Energy Star-rated appliances, replacing residential heating or cooling equipment, or applying window film; and incentives of $500 to $1,000 for installing measures recommended by a home energy audit.\The proposed rewards are part of a broad set of new or expanded conservation programs that the utilities proposed in a recent filing with the Kentucky Public Service Commission, whose approval would be needed.\The estimated $159.4 million proposal would be paid for by raising a small monthly fee that customers now pay to finance conservation programs -- called the DSM fee, for demand side management.\Chris Whelan, spokeswoman for the two utilities, said the goal of the proposed seven-year program is to cut power demand by 500 megawatts, or enough to delay the need for a typical coal-fired power plant.\The measures also could lower participating customers' gas and electric bills, ""and it's good for the environment,"" Whelan said.\In addition to the rebates, proposed new measures include paying customers $30 to remove and recycle their working secondary refrigerators and freezers -- for example, an extra fridge kept in the garage.\Whelan said that's because such extra appliances are usually older and waste energy.\Typical LG&E residential electric customers would see an increase of 6 cents in their monthly DSM fee, to $2.06, while gas customers' fee would rise 45 cents to $1.68. Those figures are based on usage of 1,000 kilowatt hours and 7,000 cubic feet of natural gas.\A typical Kentucky Utilities customer's DSM fee would rise 24 cents to $2.41, Whelan said.\In some cases there would be a condition on the incentives. Whelan said that a customer who installs equipment recommended by a home energy audit would have to get another audit later to confirm that energy use went down. If not, the customer wouldn't get an incentive payment, she said.\So, for example, a customer who installed new siding recommended by an audit, but then cranked up the furnace, might not qualify.\Residential customers who request an audit would pay the same $25 charge as now.\Another proposed program, the Smart Energy Profile, would give customers a report comparing their energy use to that of similar customers.\The new and expanded programs would apply to businesses as well as residences, although the details are different.\LG&E and KU filed the proposal with the Public Service Commission on Thursday.

Finally, I want metro government to be a leader in demand side management and energy efficiency. The more energy efficient our facilities are, the fewer emissions we will see from the power plants that keep our lights on. ...\Jerry T. Mills (I)\No answer given.\No answer given.\No answer given.\No answer given."
85,"Forty-nine years ago, 20 million Americans came together on the first Earth Day and launched another first: putting environmental issues front and center on the national political agenda. The message: policymakers at all levels of government will be held accountable by voters for their records on environmental stewardship and protection.\No matter what any of us might think about the key players or their politics, the elected leaders across the 1970 political spectrum – from Gaylord Nelson to Richard Nixon – ultimately ensured a cleaner environment with a strong economy and improved health. We are all beneficiaries of the National Environmental Policy Act, the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts, establishment of the EPA, and more.\Fast forward five decades. Sixty-nine percent of Americans say that they are ""worried"" about climate change. The scientific and national security communities warn us about its destabilizing impacts and enormous costs. In a burst of activism wonderfully similar to the original Earth Day, thousands of young people are walking out of their classrooms to protest inaction on climate change.\While reminiscent of the earlier grassroots groundswell, there is today far less political accountability for finding solutions to the widely recognized challenge of global warming and climate change.\We need to unite America's ""grassroots"" with its ""grasstops"" – to awaken a broad climate change voting majority that not only includes young people with passion, but businesses, the military, labor, farmers, energy providers, and subject matter experts alike. Only by linking these disparate groups – then broadening the coalition further to include global leaders and citizens everywhere – can we galvanize action, command accountability, and unleash a clean energy transformation that will mitigate climate change and assure economic progress at the same time.\We must act together to secure the one planet we have – because there is No Planet B. We must act because, in the very near future, the costs of inaction will far exceed those of acting.\And we can act because, since 2009, the cost of solar energy is down 88%, and wind is down 69%. These cost reductions are reflected in our choices for power generation: wind and solar made up more than half of new generating capacity in recent years.\But we must also be pragmatic. We must guarantee the reliability and resilience of the electricity system, at the same time we are working on its transformation. This means that efficiency, natural gas, advanced nuclear, carbon capture, smart grids and negative carbon technologies will all play important roles in our future grid, enabling the continued rapid growth of renewables. And, of course, other sectors beyond electricity that are more difficult to decarbonize – transportation, industry, buildings, agriculture – will need practical, low-carbon technology options.\The poorest Americans and the world's developing countries – will be economically hit worst and first. They will continue to pay the steepest price for climate change unless low-carbon technology innovation is accelerated and accompanied by policy innovation for a just transition. We must minimize stranded physical assets and stranded workers and communities.\Magical thinking is both self-indulgent and dilatory, at a time when we need accelerated action and a pragmatic roadmap to a low carbon/no net carbon global economy by mid-century, when scientists tell us the planet must approach carbon neutrality. There are no ""silver bullet solutions"" for which one-sized policies and technologies are supposed to fit all.\Instead, we need to support a range of solutions that respect regional and local economies with their energy resource mixes and associated infrastructures. If we do so, we can move more rapidly toward a low carbon/no net carbon economy, while creating millions of good jobs, growing our manufacturing base and modernizing our infrastructures.\To achieve all of this, we must build as big and broad a coalition as possible. Unlikely partners must be united and moved from the sidelines into the solution space, joining today's environmental organizations, energy experts, and grassroots activists. Military leaders have described climate change as ""a threat multiplier for instability."" Former Republican secretaries of state have joined with conservative Bush administration economists to advocate for a carbon emissions tax with a progressive dividend to all Americans. Major fossil fuel companies have endorsed the Paris Climate Agreement and the nuclear industry offers zero-emissions energy with next generation technologies. And this month the US Chamber of Commerce issued a policy position that ""inaction is not an option."" They must all be part of this coalition.\Our collective job is to analyze, measure, define and help make practical all those policies and technologies that will enable us to meet the 2050 target for deep decarbonization. We will be successful if we also spend time forging a new, broad and deep political coalition to come together to demand political accountability at the ballot box in 2020.\John Kerry served as secretary of state and Ernest Moniz as energy secretary under Barack Obama.

86,"Back on that day in 2006 when a little-known Illinois senator but rising Democratic Party star named Barack Obama visited Louisville, who could have predicted what was ahead?\Obama was in town to campaign for John Yarmuth, then making his bid for the House seat held by Republican Anne Northup. The Louisville mayor who rode with Obama and Yarmuth was Jerry Abramson. That night, Obama would have dinner with Louisville businessman Matthew Barzun.\Yarmuth would win his race, Obama would be elected president two years later, Barzun served Obama first as ambassador to Sweden and is now ambassador to the United Kingdom, and Abramson would go on to be Kentucky's lieutenant governor. And then, last week, Abramson began his job as deputy assistant to the president and director of intergovernmental affairs.\""It's been incredibly exciting,"" Abramson said in a short interview Friday with The Courier-Journal as he worked through Day 5 on his White House job. ""Seven o'clock in the West Wing reminds me of 2 o'clock in Louisville -- there's so much activity.""\""Sometimes it's a little overwhelming in terms of all briefings I'm receiving, on climate change, trade policy, immigration to health care to workforce development,"" the ex-mayor said.\Abramson's schedule last week included flying to Austin, Texas, for a speech Thursday to the National League of Cities, where he discussed the new enrollment period for the Affordable Care Act, immigration and other issues.\So far in Washington, Abramson said ""there's not much time to sit and relax.""\But he did see the president his first week on the job: they chatted in the Oval Office.\Abramson said they talked about Obama's 2006 Louisville visit: ""I didn't know at the time whether he was interested in basketball and I said to the president, 'Do you remember I pointed out (the University of Louisville's) Freedom Hall?' and the president remembered and what he said to me: 'Hall of Famer (Coach) Denny Crum and (former player) Darrell Griffith with a 45-inch vertical leap.' He remembered it exactly!""\Gas tax blame game: Back in 2008, Sen. Mitch McConnell blamed Democrat Bruce Lunsford, his opponent in that year's election, for the increase in Kentucky's gas tax.\See, Lunsford, when he worked in the administration of Gov. John Y. Brown, lobbied for legislation that indexed the state's gas tax to the wholesale price of gasoline, which, as gas prices rose, increased the tax people paid.\The reason behind it was that the tax funds road construction projects and the cost of many those projects increase at times of high gas prices because asphalt is made of petroleum products.\Last week, the state Transportation Cabinet announced that because of the dip in gas prices, the state's road fund would be short some $129 million next year, causing the state to have to cut back on projects and prompting legislators to say the formula for determining the tax rate must change.\And no one is giving Lunsford credit for reducing your gas tax.\Paul and Maher: Perhaps political talk show host Bill Maher is Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul's best liberal friend.\Maher previously has said he was open to voting for Paul for president in 2016, and now he's had the Republican lawmaker on his HBO program ""Real Time.""\The appearance seemed to go pretty well.\Maher opened by noting Paul was on a recent cover of TIME magazine as ""the most interesting man in politics."" The Kentuckian joked that it was ""a low bar"" to meet that praise in Washington.\The senator, who is considering a run for the White House, discussed race, prisons, the war on drugs, foreign policy and the environment during a nearly 11-minute long segment.\Maher told Paul ""you could get an independent like me.""\But Paul's opinions on climate change could be a hang-up for Maher.\""I am available to the Rand Paul campaign but not if I don't think you're seeing this issue realistically. What is your view on it?"" Maher asked Paul, referring to global climate change.\The Kentuckian first used a bit of humor: ""I think best way to do this is to say, 'Bill, you're fading out here. I'm not sure I can hear the question...'""\But then Paul discussed what he hoped could be a ""balanced solution"" to climate change.\Nominated: Obama has nominated Jeffrey Hall, of Louisville, to be a member the Farm Credit Administration Board. Hall is president of The Capstone Group, which he co-founded in 2009. He formerly served as Kentucky executive director of U.S. Department of Agriculture's Farm Service Agency from 2001 to 2009. He is a former legislative assistant to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.\Two transitions at once: Yarmuth's spokesman Stephen George, is leaving the post he has held since 2011 to become news editor at Insider Louisville.\George returns to his hometown with additional duties: he and his wife, Erin, are the proud parents of Lucy Magnolia George, born on Monday.\Reporter James R.

87,"CINCINNATI -- When the $2.6billion Brent Spence Bridge replacement project suffered two major setbacks in Frankfort last week, supporters were troubled, its opponents cheered, and outside observers wondered, ""What the heck is going on in Kentucky?""\To some in Northern Kentucky, the path forward seems obvious: The bridge is outdated, overcrowded and unsafe, and it needs to be replaced as soon as possible. Federal transportation officials and members of Congress have said the federal government won't foot the entire bill, so the region has to pick up some of the tab in the form of tolls.\But the issue seems equally clear to others: The bridge carries an interstate critical to national commerce and drivers already pay the federal gas tax, so Congress should be forced to replace it -- and we can afford to wait until they do.\When the Kentucky House yanked $37million in state money and allowed a ban on Brent Spence tolls to pass the chamber last week, legislative leaders were essentially telling Northern Kentucky, ""You need to figure this out, and then get back to us.""\""One of the ways you judge a region is its ability to develop and execute strategies on behalf of its future. And we're just not demonstrating our ability to get behind a strategy and work it in the competitive environment of Frankfort,"" said Dr. Jim Votruba, chairman of the Northern Kentucky CEO Roundtable, which came out in support of tolls for the project last month.\The Northern Kentucky Tea Party has been the loudest voice against tolls, mobilizing its members and working to persuade others to oppose tolls. Local lawmakers say their offices in Frankfort are flooded with messages to that effect.\Northern Kentucky is also a politically fractured community with no clear leader. With more than three dozen cities spread across three counties, no one person or group speaks for the entire region.\At least 10 cities have passed anti-toll resolutions since 2012,\along with both Boone and Kenton counties. Fort Mitchell Mayor Chris Wiest has led the charge to persuade local governments to sign on to the resolutions. Some, like Covington, are concerned tolls will divert a large amount of local traffic through their cities.\For many, the issue is one of fairness: we pay federal gas taxes, so why should we pay tolls for a federal interstate bridge? Federal officials have said the money is simply not there, but toll opponents disagree. ""As soon as you accept that as an answer, you give the federal government a free pass on it,"" Wiest said.\And so the divide between supporters and opponents continues to grow.\Advocates for the project hope to buy some time to bridge that divide by persuading the state Senate to restore the $37million needed to keep the project moving forward.\The $2.6 billion cost includes construction of a new span over the Ohio River and the reconfiguration of a 7.8-mile stretch of Interstate 75. About $100 million has already been spent on planning and design work. The project needs $60 million to keep it from stalling; it's currently slated to receive $23 million earmarked years ago by former U.S. Rep. Geoff Davis of Hebron.\If the legislature restores the other $37 million, the next challenge is getting both sides to find some common ground.\Chamber leaders are trying to get that conversation started.\For several weeks, they've met with toll opponents. They're also trying to dispel myths about the project: there are no plans for $6.50 tolls, as the tea party's website claims.\It's unclear whether that's working. Wiest said toll advocates should come around to opponents' way of thinking and apply more pressure on Congress.\In the end, lawmakers who oppose tolls are only doing ""what the average citizen wants,"" said Brent Cooper, Northern Kentucky Chamber of Commerce interim president. ""But I don't think the average citizen realizes what they're saying: No tolling at all means no bridge. What we're saying to people is, 'What if the toll is 50 cents? Are you still against it? What if there were no tolls at all between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.?'"" Cooper said. ""Just saying no is not a way to work through this problem."""
88,"The Ditch Mitch dead-enders and their journalistic fellow travelers must be despondent. Not only did the foremost Republican in Kentucky history win a fifth U. S. Senate term, but he overcame a national Democratic landslide, a multi-millionaire opponent, and scurrilous outside ads to do it in convincing fashion.\McConnell gives some credit to his critics. When anti-war groups ran ads against him and demonstrators descended on his home last year, it convinced him the '08 campaign would be nationally significant and extraordinarily expensive. So he started fundraising at a pace ferocious even for him.\As GOP Senate leader, McConnell wanted to carry his own financial weight so the national campaign committee could use its resources elsewhere. He would need every nickel of the $20 million he raised to counter the $14 million spent against him on TV alone.\McConnell polled early to learn whether voters considered his leadership status an asset despite his close association with the extremely unpopular President Bush. He found that his clout trumped their desire for change. The campaign's theme was set.\Initial ads informed proud Kentuckians that McConnell was only the state's second son to be a Senate party leader. Other spots emphasized the plethora of pork he had procured for the commonwealth and the jobs it produced.\McConnell named a bright young Northern Kentuckian, Justin Brasell, as campaign manager. Brasell had run U. S. Rep. Geoff Davis' impressive races. His forte was the volunteer-based ""ground game,"" which he implemented as never before in a McConnell campaign. Veteran staffers Kyle Simmons and Billy Piper added their considerable expertise.\Surveys showed more people viewed McConnell favorably than unfavorably. It stayed that way through Election Day. Not so with his foe, Bruce Lunsford, who began the race with high negatives. Ads stressing Lunsford's role in raising a gas tax, questionable business practices and lavish lifestyle kept his favorability ""upside down.""\McConnell debated Lunsford, but not on live statewide television. He insisted on formats that minimized moderator or reporter involvement. He was correctly confident he could win such encounters decisively, but since the press would not report it that way he loathed giving Lunsford equal status on platforms.\The race tightened during the financial crisis, but McConnell maintained his lead. He backed the controversial bailout, but Lunsford could not exploit it because so many Democrats did, too. McConnell's team was relieved that Lunsford did much less with the troublesome Bush connection than they feared he would.\Even as national Democrats and outside groups got involved - the former to the tune of $2 million in the campaign's last week alone - McConnell continued hammering home the pivotal point that he was too valuable to Kentucky to replace with a rookie. The Clintons visited the commonwealth for Lunsford, but had no noticeable effect.\McConnell hails from the big city, but has spent countless hours criss-crossing the state's backroads, especially in his early campaigns. Returning to these roots on a late campaign bus tour garnered him good publicity while bolstering both his vote totals and his spirits.\State Senate President David Williams warmed up the crowds with his old-fashioned oratory. Giving the same speech 62 times, McConnell told audiences he shared their rural values before urging them to help him not for his sake, but for theirs and their children's. He ended these pep rallies with exhortations to ""pulverize"" Lunsford or ""beat him like a drum.""\The campaign ended with unprecedented media saturation. McConnell was airing 5,000 points-worth of ads on broadcast television in Louisville and Lexington; 1,000 points means an average viewer sees the ad 10 times.\In an awful environment for Republicans, McConnell won by 6 percent - 106,835 votes. His carefully crafted statewide GOP structure also emerged intact. In many ways this was the most impressive performance yet by a politician of historic proportions who is near, but perhaps still not yet at, the peak of his formidable powers.\John David Dyche is a Louisville attorney who writes a political column on alternate Tuesdays in Forum.

89,"
1: What do you expect to accomplish during your first year in office?
\
The first year in office, I'll vote yes on the State Child Health Insurance Program, which was passed last year in Congress but overturned by presidential veto. It was not supported by our local representative, but I'll vote ""yes"" on that and hopefully be able to extend health care to thousands more children.
\
The first focus of the term has to be with the economy, addressing the severe challenge middle-class working families, millions of middle-class working families, are having these days, trying to deal with lower wages and skyrocketing costs in groceries and utilities, gasoline in particular. To try to reverse the trend of focusing on the well-to-do and the very wealthy and focus my attention on issues such as health care, the economy, education. To help average Americans look forward to a better life for themselves and our children, and I think we're at a critical point today where that is not the case.
\
I think that anybody who looks back at their situation from eight years ago, many of them would state they are in worse shape today than eight years ago, and that's not right. I would like to work to try and change that.
\
2. Regarding the issue of congressional earmarks, how would you balance the desire to bring home money to the 2nd District with the desire to be economically responsible?
\
That is a real challenge. With my experience as county judge I realized the importance of having our house in order, our financial house in order.
\
Eight years ago, we had a balanced (federal) budget, a surplus and the economy was booming. Today, there is a budget deficit, the debt is quickly approaching $10 trillion and the economy is sluggish. The challenge with earmarks is that all too often, congressmen and senators want to reassure their re-election and they begin spending money they don't have. I would strongly support a freeze on earmarks until we get our budget balanced.
\
That being said, I know there are needs that not only this community has but communities throughout the 2nd District, and if there are dollars available for earmarks, I will work tirelessly to make sure this district gets its fair share of the dollars we've paid in to the federal government, get them returned to this district for the use of the citizens of the 2nd District.
\
3. What should our country's long-term goals be in Iraq and the Middle East?
\
All too often we look at our short-term goals. In fact, we solve too many problems in the short term without looking for long-term solutions. Israel will celebrate its 60th year of statehood (this month), and in those 60 years we have seen challenges with the Palestinians, with Israel, with the terrorists of Hamas, with Lebanon. The Middle East is a crucial area in the international scene. It is home to the rise of many terrorist groups. We must continue to focus on ... substantive diplomatic relations with all of those countries in the Middle East, and working with Israel and Palestine to create that Palestinian state, and to continue as Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, George Bush the father and Bill Clinton (did) as presidents to try to bring a lasting peace to the Middle East.
\
With regard to Iraq ... it is difficult when you are in the midst of a war to try and focus on the long-term goal for Iraq when you have our young men and women being in harm's way. We have lost more than 4,000 soldiers, tens of thousands have been wounded, hundreds of thousands of Iraqis killed, and yet they are still in civil strife there. General Petraeus expresses uncertainty of what the eventual outcome would be.
\
It would be my plan in the short term to ask the military to devise - and I would support congressional action in that regard - to ask the military to devise a 24-month exit strategy to bring our thousands of soldiers home and to turn over that conflict to the Iraqi government, to try to bring peace to that region.
\
Now, that's a 24-month goal, that's not what I would consider a long-term goal. In the long term, it would certainly be beneficial if Iraq achieved a democracy and stability and peace in that region. But when you have Afghanistan ... with terrorist activity, Iran to the east with the upheaval that happens there, Turkey to the north with the different tribes and segments, it's going to be a challenge for many years to come.
\
I differ from John McCain, who believes we need to be there for the next 100 years. I agree there may be a need because of the unrest that may continue there in that whole region for the next few decades. My position is we have been there for five years, and two more will make seven. I believe we have exhausted our commitment to that area, and it's time to come home.
\
4. What are the top three specific issues in the 2nd District, and how would you address them?
\
The first would be one that branches out across the boundaries of the 2nd District, and that is to restore the economy to a healthier state than it is now, and at the heart of that has to be addressing the energy crisis and the high cost of gasoline. When you have the wages falling and the median income is less than it was in 2001, and you have increases in grocery costs and utility costs and gasoline costs, the burden that is putting on the residents on of 2nd District, as well as many throughout the country, is the first priority I think needs to be addressed.
\
The second ... doesn't have to be a crisis, it could be a positive thing. The second emphasis I think a representative should do is to bolster and support the economic development opportunities the Radcliff and Elizabethtown area has with the BRAC (Base Realignment and Closure) realignment and expansion. That initiative (was) supported by Congressman Ron Lewis to his credit - he has done a very good job of ensuring the sustainability and viability of that project. That has such powerful economic positives for many years to come, that I think it certainly is my responsibility as congressman to stay on top of that and ensure that is as successful as it can be.
\
The third area ... if we focus on the economy, if we focus on the economic engine that BRAC brings, I think the third issue that I would like to see us focus on which again impacts so many individuals - not more so in the 2nd District, but equally in the 2nd District - and that is the cost of health care. The cost of health care, not just for those who are uninsured or underinsured, is a heavy burden, but the cost of health care is an issue which the medical community talks about with the burden they have on malpractice insurance. Small businesses talk about (it) when they want to provide health care for their employees and they are continually strapped with a profit margin that is less and less and doesn't enable them to provide the coverage they need to. (The) increase and spiraling cost of health care which takes up more and more of our Medicaid and Medicare dollars. That's an issue that's national in scope, but it certainly has a tremendous impact on the citizens of the 2nd District.
\
One of the things that was mentioned earlier, I would support expansion of the SCHIP program for increasing children to get health care. From my perspective, we cannot deal with an issue as broad in scope and as national in scope as health care on a piece-by-piece basis. That's what we've tried to do for the past several years, with George Bush's Medicare plan for prescription drugs, and even with the SCHIP program and with so many other programs that we try and deal with as the bubbles come up.
\
We must bring together small business, insurance companies, pharmaceuticals - not only the companies but the pharmacy owners - the American Medical Association, hospitals, anyone involved in health care. You know, the American Medical Association, they state that they believe that health care should be accessible and affordable to all individuals. Now, if the American Medical Association says that, I believe you would probably find a consensus among all those groups with that very thought - health care should be affordable and accessible to all Americans.
\
Now the issue is: How do we achieve that? It's not something that can't be done. Two things have gotten in the way: The first is I believe having the will to do it, and the second is wondering and worrying whether Republicans are suggesting it or Democrats are suggesting it. It is my belief when you go to Congress as a representative, you happen to be a Democrat, but ... the priorities of everyone up there should be first your family, then your country, then your district and then your party.
\
But what all too often happens is your political party seems to rise up right below your family, and in some instances, it's even greater than the family. There is no reason why we can't address the issue of health care from a global perspective where there is sacrifice, negotiated sacrifice on all sides, but the end result ... is we have a comprehensive health care plan that is affordable and accessible to all Americans.
\
One of the things that I think we've slipped into the habit of is thinking that some things should be free, that health care should be free. Health care is not free. There is a cost to that. It is a valuable asset. If you don't have your health, you'll take whatever dollars you have to ensure you have good health. So it is an asset, and we can't just think it will be given freely. Someone has to pay. I think we all should pay.
\
That would be the way I would approach it: To bring as many players to the table with the resolve that we're going to achieve what the AMA says, make health care affordable and accessible to all Americans.
\
5. What would make you the better Democratic candidate?
\
I guess I would approach it from the standpoint of not comparing myself to the other individual, but by stating I believe I'm a well-qualified Democratic candidate for two fundamental reasons. No. 1 is I have a record of getting things accomplished here in Daviess County, whether it's in the arena of health care, education or transportation.
\
When you're in local government, that's where the rubber meets the road, as they often say, but it's absolutely true. You're expected to deliver, and you're held accountable if you don't deliver. And you know, I don't mind that that level of accountability. I complain about it some, we all complain about it, but if I don't get the job done, if I don't deliver to people, to the citizens, then perhaps I don't deserve to be holding the trust that I do with them to serve as county judge. So I think the first issue is having a track record of being able to deliver, whether it's public safety, health care of education.
\
The second area where I believe I'm well-qualified to serve in Congress and be the Democratic candidate is that I've got the will and the commitment and the resources to win in November. I know people discount this notion of resources and having to have the money, but to run ads on television, to pay for all the costs associated with the campaign and districtwide to get the message out, you must have the necessary resources, and that's what I've been working hard over the last several months to achieve and I've been so very grateful of the level of support I've received from well over 300 individuals.
\
6. How would you balance being from a coal-dependent state with concerns about pollution and global warming?
\
I share the Democratic commitment to clean air, clean water as long as there are sensible environmental policies that are enforced. There have been significant cuts under the Bush-Cheney administration in the recommendations for clean water and clean waste-water treatment and even clean air initiatives. I think we need to ensure we do use common sense policies to protect our environment.
\
I'm not a scientist, but I believe there are certainly threats to our environment from the global warming perspective. ... The more I read, the more I realize how little I know about that issue. However, I believe there is sufficient evidence out there to demonstrate there that we do have an environmental crisis, that we do need to do things to try to protect our environment.
\
With regard to the fact that we are what you called a coal-dependent state ... coal is a natural resource that certainly can and will be used to produce energy. It fires many of our plants that produce electricity. So we have not only a dependence on coal, we have an abundance on coal and a reliance on coal. As long as we can ensure the emissions that come from those smokestacks do not do anything to damage our air or the runoff from that damages our water, I strongly support those.
\
But I do not believe we need to be relaxing common sense environmental standards for the benefit of a coal-fired plant.
\
7. Gas taxes help fund federal transportation projects, but the federal Highway Trust Fund is running out of money. How do you balance the need for federal transportation funds against consumer concerns about high gas prices?
\
That's not unlike issues we face in local government. In so many discussions we have, people want services, and there is a price tag attached to those services. If individuals are willing to pay the price, the services can be delivered. I think it's a very fair system set up.
\
We have some significant and severe infrastructure problems throughout our country. The plan Eisenhower developed on the interstate highways was wonderful in the late 1950s, but those dollars, as a result in the increase in the cost of oil, those same dollars don't go nearly as far as they did a few years ago. I know even in local government, we can't pave as many roads as we used to with the same amount of dollars because of that increase in oil.
\
I'm certainly not for raising the gas tax, particularly in a situation now where individuals are struggling to put a few dollars of gas in their car. But there has got to be a realization on the part of citizens if they want an interstate system that is safe and well taken care of, if they want a road system that is not deteriorated, there are insufficient funds to get that done. So you have two choices: Either you live with what you have, or you look at paying the increased cost.
\
The cost of oil has had such a reverberating effect on everything we do - from infrastructure to roads to groceries to so many things. It has gone from $28 a barrel in 2001 to $117 a barrel now. That is almost better than a four-fold increase. The accompanying increases in oil-related products put such a burden on individuals and governments.
\
We're doing the (county) budget now, and I see at least a 25 percent to 40 percent increase in the cost of fuel for the sheriff's office, the landfill and for every operation we have. That means those dollars that are going to pay for fuel are less dollars we have to provide services.
\
Unless and until we get our arms around and can deal effectively with our dependence on oil, our reliance on oil and the cost of that oil, I believe we're going to continue to see that further stress, that inability to deal effectively with our infrastructure.
\
As a side note, I see a couple of the presidential candidates talk about a moratorium on the gas tax from Memorial Day to Labor Day - John McCain talks about it and Hillary Clinton talks about it. That's an 18-cent moratorium. That's going to do several things: That's going to further aggravate the problem of the shortage of funds with the Department of Transportation. I think it's a ""Band-Aid"" approach, where the federal government, which is already operating at a deficit, takes an additional hit while the oil companies continue to have record billions of dollars in profits. I'm not sure if it would make a lot of difference to me if I paid $3.60 a gallon or $3.42 a gallon. Both are equally bad.
\
8. How would you handle a split state congressional delegation during a time when partisanship on the federal and state level is high?
\
I'm sure there will be times when I agree with my Democratic counterparts in Congress, but I'm sure there will be times when I agree with my Republican counterparts in Congress. I think the crucial issue is: What is the sense of the citizens of the 2nd District?
\
You know, when the founding fathers drew up the Constitution, the first branch of government they addressed was the House of Representatives - not the president, the Senate or the judiciary but the House of Representatives, because they felt so strongly that it should be the people's house.

90,"June costs put state\ninth worst in U.S.\By Marcus Green\magreen@courier-journal.com\The Courier-Journal\People from Kentucky are spending more of their paychecks on gasoline than residents of all but eight states, according to a Courier-Journal analysis of data from the Oil Price Information Service.\Kentuckians' average monthly gas bill was $211 at the end of June, or nearly 8 percent of their income, and up from $158 during 2007, the analysis shows.\Hoosiers paid out an average of $221, or about 6 percent of their median monthly income. Nationwide, drivers spent nearly 7 percent of their earnings on gas.\A study of 2007 data released this week by the Natural Resources Defense Council, a nonprofit environmental action group, shows similar trends, ranking both Kentucky and Indiana among the 10 states where gas prices eat up the largest chunks of income.\With lower incomes and few public transportation choices, Kentucky's rural counties were very vulnerable to high gasoline prices, according to the Oil Price Information Service, a petroleum news group that tracks costs.\For example, on average, drivers in Owsley County in Eastern Kentucky spent more than 15 percent of their income on fuel - the highest in the state, and fourth-highest nationwide.\Paul L. Sizemore, an Owsley County agricultural extension agent, said some farmers say rising gas prices have tripled their fuel costs. Many other residents are hit hard because they must leave the county to work, he said, adding that even running errands has gotten expensive.\""For something as simple as Wal-Mart, you're looking at a 15-minute drive to get to the closest one,"" Sizemore said.\Gas prices already are the focus of review in Kentucky - Attorney General Jack Conway joined Louisville and state officials earlier this month in announcing an investigation into why prices in Louisville are higher than in other cities.\And the burden worsened slightly on July 1, when the state's automatic gas tax increase of 1.5 cents went into effect, bringing the tax to 21.1 cents for a gallon of unleaded gasoline.\The newspaper analysis of the recent Oil Price data found that Louisville drivers paid at least 15 cents more for a gallon of gas - $4.27 on average in late June - than drivers in Cincinnati, Nashville and Indianapolis. That translated into $226 a month, up $62 from last year, or 6.4 percent of income.\In 2002, when the retail average cost of gas was $1.41 a gallon in Louisville, the typical driver paid $75 a month, or about 2 percent of income, the data shows.\The Defense Council report, meanwhile, ranks how states are faring in their efforts to change their dependence on oil. Kentucky ranked 38th out of 50. Indiana was 29th.\Several factors are to blame, said Deron Lovaas , the council's transportation policy director, including sprawl, underinvestment in public transit and relatively low average income.\The best score went to California, which has passed statewide restrictions on vehicle idling, offers incentives for hybrid and plug-in vehicles and requires greenhouse gas emission standards on vehicles.\Lovaas said officials in Kentucky and Indiana ""need to get on the ball. They need to provide protection for drivers in those states by adopting more of these policies.""\He stressed however, that enacting the policies won't immediately lead to lower gas prices.\""What they'll do is they will in the future allow consumers to take fewer trips to the gas station and every trip they do take (will be) less painful because they'll be pumping a lot less gas into their tanks. ... The whole point of it is to reduce consumer fuel bills over time,"" he said.\The council evaluated states on 11 criteria, with the most weight given to state policies for fuels that limit carbon output and for tougher greenhouse gas emission standards.\Kentucky met two criteria, for policies requiring greater fuel efficiency for state vehicle fleets and for state-sponsored grants for research and development on clean fuels and automobiles.\Len Peters, Energy and Environment Cabinet Secretary, said he believes Kentucky soon will do better, noting that a comprehensive energy plan set to be submitted to Gov. Steve Beshear in September is expected to include incentives for drivers to use less gasoline, and other areas of focus will be renewable fuels, hybrid cars and plug-in vehicles.\Indiana met three criteria on the council report, including incentives for gas stations to retrofit their pumps for alternative fuels.\Kellie Walsh, executive director of the Central Indiana Clean Cities Alliance, said 106 stations in Indiana have added pumps capable of dispensing ethanol-based fuel. About 70 of those have tapped a state tax credit, available to cover up to $20,000, to offset the cost.\""Our grant has been a huge driver because at first, the retailers were concerned about whether they were going to sell it,"" she said.\Reporter Marcus Green can be reached at (502) 582-4675.\ON THE WEB\Go to www.courier-journal.com to see how gas prices eat into incomes in your county.\(SEE LIBRARY MICROFILM OR LIBRARY PDF PAGES); INFORMATIONAL GRAPHIC; STAFF CHART BY STEVE DURBIN; WHO'S PAYING THE BIGGEST SHARE?"

Reid Haire was first elected to public office in 1998, when he became Daviess County's judge-executive.
\
Now in his third term as county judge, Haire has set his sights on Washington, D.C.
\
Haire is competing against state Sen. David Boswell - also a Daviess County resident - for the Democratic nomination to run for the 2nd Congressional District seat.
\
That seat will be vacated this year when Republican Ron Lewis, who was first elected in 1994, retires. The winner of the May 20 Democratic primary will face Republican state Sen. Brett Guthrie in November.
\
Although Boswell and Haire have appeared together at several forums in the past two weeks, both have taken pains not to criticize the other. But Haire said his experience as judge-executive sets him apart as a candidate.
\
"" ... I believe I'm a well-qualified Democratic candidate for two fundamental reasons,"" Haire said during an interview last week. ""No. 1 is I have a record of getting things accomplished here in Daviess County, whether it's in the arena of health care, education or transportation.
\
""When you're in local government, that's where the rubber meets the road, as they often say, but it's absolutely true,"" Haire said. ""You're expected to deliver, and you're held accountable if you don't deliver. And you know, I don't mind that level of accountability.""
\
As the county's chief executive officer, Haire administers an annual budget that totaled $47.8 million in fiscal year 2007-08.
\
During his time in office, Haire proposed the creation of an Owensboro campus for Western Kentucky University as a way to increase the number of community residents with bachelor's degrees. Fiscal Court plans to start construction of the first classroom for the WKU campus this summer, and Western officials have pledged to provide faculty and degree programs when the building is ready of occupancy in early 2010.
\
During Haire's three terms, Fiscal Court also passed a countywide ban on smoking in public places open to people under the age of 18, has partnered with Owensboro city commissioners to create and finance a downtown development authority, built Horse Fork Creek Park and soccer complex, worked to improve drainage, provided funding for social service and arts organizations and provided funds to shore up the historic Smith-Werner building on Second Street.
\
At a campaign stop in Leitchfield, Haire told a group of Democrats that during his term as county judge, ""there have been clinics built, colleges built and fire stations built.
\
""But that was the past,"" Haire told the crowd. ""That was yesterday. This election is about our future ... the future of our state and the future of our country.""
\
""The second area where I believe I'm well-qualified ... is that I've got the will and the commitment and the resources to win in November,"" Haire told the Messenger-Inquirer.
\
In the first quarter of this year, Haire raised over $200,000 in campaign contributions, while Boswell raised slightly over $34,000.
\
""I know people discount this notion of resources and having to have the money, but to run ads on television, to pay for all the costs associated with the campaign and districtwide to get the message out, you must have the necessary resources,"" Haire said. ""(That's) what I've been working hard over the last several months to achieve, and I've been so very grateful of the level of support I've received from well over 300 individuals.""
\
Haire said his first priority, if elected, would be the economy and ""addressing the severe challenge middle-class working families ... are having these days trying to deal with lower wages and skyrocketing costs in groceries and utilities, gasoline in particular.
\
"" ... I think that anybody who looks back at their situation from eight years ago, many of them would state they are in worse shape today than eight years ago, and that's not right,"" Haire said. ""I would like to work to try and change that.""
\
Haire said during his first year in office, he would support expanding the State Children's Health Insurance Program. Democrats in Congress tried to expand the program last year but failed.
\
""The first year in office, I'll vote `yes' on the (SCHIP) program, which was passed last year in Congress but overturned by presidential veto,"" Haire said. ""It was not supported by (Lewis) but I'll vote `yes' on that and hopefully be able to extend health care to thousands more children.""
\
Haire said he favors diplomatic efforts to bring stability to the Middle East.
\
""In May of this year, Israel will celebrate its 60th year of statehood, and in those 60 years we have seen challenges with the Palestinians, with Israel, with the terrorists of Hamas, with Lebanon,"" Haire said.
\
""... We must continue to focus on ... substantive diplomatic relations with all of those countries in the Middle East, and working with Israel and Palestine to create that Palestinian state, and to continue as Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, George Bush the father and Bill Clinton (did) as presidents to try to bring a lasting peace to the Middle East.""
\
Haire said he supports the United States withdrawing its forces from Iraq within 24 months of his being elected to Congress.
\
""We have lost over 4,000 soldiers, tens of thousands have been wounded, hundreds of thousands of Iraqis killed, and yet they are still in civil strife there,"" he said. ""General (David) Petraeus expresses uncertainty of what the eventual outcome would be.
\
""It would be my plan ... and I would support congressional action in that regard - to ask the military to devise a 24-month exit strategy to bring our thousands of soldiers home and to turn over that conflict to the Iraqi government, to try to bring peace to that region,"" Haire said.
\
Presidential candidates John McCain and Hillary Clinton recently floated proposals to suspend the 18-cent federal gasoline tax through the summer driving season. When asked how to balance concern public concern over gasoline prices with the need for highway transportation funds - which are generated by gasoline taxes - Haire said suspending the gas tax would bring tradeoffs.
\
""That's not unlike issues we face in local government. In so many discussions we have, people want services, and there is a price tag attached to those services,"" Haire said.
\
""We have some significant and severe infrastructure problems throughout our country,"" Haire said. "" ... I'm certainly not for raising the gas tax, particularly in a situation now where individuals are struggling to put a few dollars of gas in their car. But there has got to be a realization on the part of citizens if they want an interstate system that is safe and well taken care of, if they want a road system that is not deteriorated, there are insufficient funds to get that done. So you have two choices: Either you live with what you have or you look at paying the increased cost.""
\
Of McCain and Clinton's proposals, Haire said: "" I think it's a Band-Aid approach, where the federal government, which is already operating at a deficit, takes an additional hit while the oil companies continue to have record billions of dollars in profits. I'm not sure if it would make a lot of difference to me if I paid $3.60 a gallon or $3.42 a gallon. Both are equally bad.""
\
Haire said he is for creating wider access to health care but said the effort will take compromises from everyone involved in the discussion.
\
""We must bring together small business, insurance companies, pharmaceuticals ... the American Medical Association, hospitals, anyone involved in health care,"" Haire said. "" ... There is no reason why we can't address the issue of health care from a global perspective where there is sacrifice, negotiated sacrifice on all sides, but the end result ... is we have a comprehensive health care plan that is affordable and accessible to all Americans.""
\
Haire said he supports the use of coal in energy production as long as the country maintains ""common-sense"" environmental regulations.
\
""I'm not a scientist, but I believe there are certainly threats to our environment from the global-warming perspective,"" he said. "" ... The more I read, the more I realize how little I know about that issue. However, I believe there is sufficient evidence out there to demonstrate there that we do have an environmental crisis, that we do need to do things to try to protect our environment.
\
""... (Coal) fires many of our plants that produce electricity. So we have not only a dependence on coal; we have an abundance on coal and a reliance on coal,"" Haire said. ""As long as we can insure the emissions that come from those smokestacks do not do anything to damage our air or the runoff from (power plants) damages our water, I strongly support those.""
\
Haire said he would attempt to find money for projects in the 2nd District when funds are available but said he favors fiscal responsibility.
\
""The challenge with earmarks is that all too often, congressmen and senators want to reassure their re-election, and they begin spending money they don't have,"" Haire said. ""I would strongly support a freeze on earmarks until we get our budget balanced.
\
""That being said, I know there are needs ... throughout the 2nd District, and if there are dollars available for earmarks, I will work tirelessly to make sure this district gets its fair share of the dollars we've paid in to the federal government,"" he said.
\
Haire said he would focus on representing the opinion of the residents of the 2nd District and would not vote on party lines.
\
""I'm sure there will be times when I agree with my Democratic counterparts in Congress, but I'm sure there will be times when I agree with my Republican counterparts in Congress. I think the crucial issue is: What is the sense of the citizens of the 2nd District?""

92,"After three straight legislative sessions working with – and sometimes fighting with – former Gov. Matt Bevin, the Republican supermajority of the Kentucky General Assembly will now labor over an extremely tight budget with a Democratic governor wielding the final pen.\The 2020 legislative session of the Kentucky General Assembly kicks off Tuesday, the fourth consecutive session with Republicans holding over 60% of the seats in each chamber.\What's new this year is the occupant in the Governor's Mansion: Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear is set to present a two-year budget proposal to the legislature in late January.\What remains constant in this 60-day session is the extremely tight nature of the biennial budget. While only modest revenue growth is projected in the coming years, obligations to cover public pensions, Medicaid and other costs will sharply increase.\Beshear wants to find common ground and civility amid disagreement with the Republican-dominated legislature, but that will be put to the test as he attempts to make good on campaign promises of increased spending for education with new sources of tax revenue.\Talk has been civil between Beshear and Republican leadership in the legislature since the November election, but Republican Senate President Robert Stivers maintains that the governor's main plan for new tax revenue – legalizing casinos – has no chance in that chamber.\Stivers has told The Courier Journal that while his Republican colleagues aren't opposed to increasing teachers' salaries and funding for K-12 and postsecondary education, money will be hard to find in this budget, and promises made during elections ""sometimes can't be fulfilled by the realities of the environment and the economics of that environment.""\Here's a look at some of the big issues likely to dominate discussion in the 2020 session of the Kentucky General Assembly:\Three weeks after Bevin conceded defeat, his administration's budget director laid a grim document at the feet of the new governor's transition team: a memo estimating a $1.1 billion state budget shortfall over the next two fiscal years.\Though the Beshear administration and the nonpartisan Legislative Research Commission haven't yet signed off on the accuracy of those estimates, Jason Bailey – the executive director of the progressive Kentucky Center for Economic Policy – has conceded that the coming two-year budget will be ""a real train wreck"" and require the most cuts over the past decade if significant new tax revenue isn't created.\State economists have projected revenue to increase by $146 million and $207 million in the next two fiscal years, but this is expected to be quickly eaten up by the rising costs of shoring up the state pension systems, expanded Medicaid, payments for state employees' health insurance and housing the state's 24,000 prison inmates.\On the pension front, the largest plan for state workers is set to have its employer contribution rate increase from 83% to 93% next year.\Kentucky's portion of covering the expanded Medicaid population will increase from 8.5% to the maximum of 10% in 2021 and 2022, which is expected to increase costs by nearly $50 million next year.\According to the Kentucky Association of School Boards, the unfunded mandate of the school safety bill passed in the 2019 session will cost $121 million annually to implement, requiring new resource officers and counselors to be hired.\Additional funds that may have to be identified include a loan of $50 million to assist the University of Louisville's acquisition of Jewish Hospital and $23 million annually to lease, staff and operate a privately owned prison in Floyd County.\Adding to these known costs are the projected costs of several Beshear campaign promises to increase spending on public education – the exact figures of which won't be known until Beshear presents his budget proposal.\However, the memo from Bevin's budget director last month stated that Beshear's pledge to raise public K-12 teachers' salaries by $2,000 each would cost $97 million annually, while increasing funding for postsecondary education and the K-12 per-student SEEK amount by 1% would add an additional $42 million annually. Increasing funding for the Teachers' Retirement System above the required contribution was listed as costing an additional $110 million per year.\The last two-year budget continued to slash funding for most agencies to make way for a dramatic increase in pension contributions. The number of state employees has fallen by about 30% over the past decade as agencies work with less money.\Just how deep the cuts are in the next two-year budget, and how many of the aforementioned budget priorities get funded, depends largely on how much new tax revenue is created by the legislature – if any.\Beshear campaigned on funding most of his new education spending through new tax revenue generated by legalizing casinos through a constitutional amendment. With much of that tax revenue directed toward pensions, Beshear said it would free up $550 million annually for spending on public education, though others have estimated the figure could be as low as $175 million and take years before such revenue is realized.\But if that doesn't happen, as Stivers predicted, the new governor would have to look elsewhere for new revenue.\One of those places may stem from a bill by Rep. Adam Koenig, R-Erlanger, to legalize sports betting in Kentucky. It passed unanimously out of a House committee in 2019 but never made it to a vote on the floor.\Koenig has prefiled a similar bill this year to allow Kentuckians to legally bet on sports, online poker and fantasy sports contests, with one study estimating it would create anywhere from $20 million to $48 million annually in revenue from new taxes, registration fees and licensing fees. He says he is ""extremely optimistic"" his bill will pass the House this year. In the Senate, Stivers says he is ""ambivalent"" to sports wagering.\Advocacy groups for city and county local governments are also looking to Frankfort for budget relief through new methods of revenue, hoping state government provides them with new taxing authorities.\The Kentucky League of Cities and Kentucky Association of Counties is making a renewed push for a constitutional amendment to allow a local option sales tax, in which voters via referendum could approve a 1% sales tax increase with revenue directed to a specific project.\Faced with increased pension obligations and corrections costs, medium and large cities will also push for legislation to raise their restaurant tax, which could create an additional $31 million annually for Louisville Metro Government.\A 50-cent tax increase on packs of cigarettes in 2018 has generated over $100 million in tax revenue, and legislators may return to that well this year. A bill prefiled by Rep. Jerry Miller, R-Louisville, would also add an excise tax on the sale of e-cigarettes, which is estimated to raise $35 million a year in new revenue.\The Kentucky Chamber of Commerce and local governments have also endorsed modernizing the revenue model for the Kentucky Road Fund, supporting a bill that would include raising the state gas tax by 10 cents per gallon, imposing new fees on electric vehicles, and raising existing annual fees on all vehicles.\While this proposal would direct more road funding to local governments, it also faces stiff opposition from conservative groups like Americans for Prosperity-Kentucky, which argues that current funding is sufficient and mismanaged by the Transportation Cabinet.\In addition to new tax revenue, there is always a chance the Republican-dominated legislature will pass additional tax cuts that decrease revenue, such as the 2019 bill that cut taxes for banks by $105 million.\While many Republicans still favor new public funding for charter schools and legislation creating tax credits for those who donate to private K-12 scholarship funds, such conservative education policies now have an active opponent in the new governor.\Proposals to increase spending on public schools, expand kindergarten and pre-K, increase teacher salaries and fund the 2019 student safety bill are likely to fill much of the budget and revenue debate.\Education groups may also throw their weight behind efforts to curb the rising use of e-cigarettes among teens, with Miller prefiling a bill to reduce youth access to flavored e-cigarettes and a bill from Rep. Buddy Wheatley, D-Covington, seeking to ban the sale of flavored vape products entirely.\Rep. David Hale, R-Wellington, also prefiled a bill to ban transgender students from using restrooms that align with their gender identities, which he says could save non-transgender students from ""potential embarrassment, shame and psychological injury."" Past bills instituting such a ban have failed in the General Assembly, and North Carolina, the only state to pass such a law, has since repealed it.\Rep. Jason Nemes, R-Louisville, has once again prefiled his bill to legalize and regulate medical marijuana in Kentucky. The bill received a House committee vote for the first time in 2019, passing nearly unanimously.\But it never came to a vote on the House floor, despite nearly half of the chamber's members co-sponsoring it. Nemes is optimistic the House will pass it this year – although the Senate appears more skeptical.\Also in the House, Rep. Cluster Howard, D-Jackson, has gone a step further to prefile a bill legalizing and taxing recreational marijuana, which he estimates could create up to $800 million of annual revenue.\Howard's bill would decriminalize the possession of less than 1 ounce of marijuana and allow those previously convicted of a marijuana-related misdemeanors to have their offense expunged for free. Permits to grow cannabis plants at home also could be purchased for $250 per year under the bill.\Four Republican members of the House from the Louisville region have prefiled a resolution asking the Beshear administration and a Louisville pollution agency to examine doing away with the federally mandated use of reformulated gasoline in the city and parts of Oldham and Bullitt counties. The legislators claim it could save motorists $73 million annually at the pumps at no cost to the environment.\As LG&E moves forward with its controversial plan to build a natural gas pipeline through a section of Bernheim Arboretum and Research Forest, Rep. Jim Gooch, R-Providence, has prefiled a bill to crack down on civil disobedience protests to block natural gas pipelines.\Rep. Angie Hatton, D-Whitesburg, has prefiled a bill to require the state Public Service Commission to include rate affordability when determining utility rates.\Beshear already signed an executive order restoring the voting rights of 140,000 Kentuckians previous convicted of certain nonviolent felonies who had finished serving their sentence. But the movement to make this effort permanent with a constitutional amendment is continuing.\Three Democrats have once again prefiled bills to allow voters to approve such a move through a statewide referendum, which has failed to advance through the Republican Senate over the past decade.\In response to former Gov. Bevin's controversial pardonsduring his final days in office, Sen. Chris McDaniel, R-Taylor Mill, has said he will file a constitutional amendment to limit a governor's power to pardon at the very end of his or her term.\Other efforts may come forward to limit the executive powers of Beshear, such as a bill sponsored by Stivers that would take the power to appoint the secretary of the Transportation Cabinet away from the governor. Republicans prefiled the bill before Beshear was victorious, saying it was not specifically targeting Beshear.\Critical of Beshear's restructuring of the state Board of Education, Stivers has also floated the idea of the legislature preventing governors from completely replacing boards.\Beshear\CREDIT: Joe Sonka"
93,"Fletcher, Beshear oppose gas-tax hike, tolls to pay for projects\By Marcus Green\magreen@courier-journal.com\The Courier-Journal\Editor's note: This is the first story in a series examining the major issues in Kentucky's race for governor. To read more about what the candidates say about transportation, go to www.courier-\journal.com/\election2007races\Supporters of a $4.1 billion effort to redo Spaghetti Junction and build two new Ohio River bridges between Louisville and Southern Indiana shouldn't worry that the winner of Kentucky's gubernatorial race will upset that plan.\Incumbent Gov. Ernie Fletcher and challenger Steve Beshear both say the project is important to Louisville and the state.\""I absolutely support these projects moving forward and I have worked hard to move them beyond a concept to beginning stages of the project, with funding in the budget and the six-year road plan,"" Fletcher said.\Beshear said, ""Growing the Louisville economy grows the entire state. Improving the transportation system of Louisville improves the entire state.""\The candidates are largely in agreement on the other major transportation concerns facing the area, according to responses from transportation questions submitted by The Courier-Journal.\For example, both oppose raising Kentucky's gasoline tax to help pay for building and maintaining the state's roads and bridges. They also are against tolls as a potential method of financing the Ohio River bridges project, although they would consider state Sen. David Williams' recent proposal to possibly give greater control of major transportation projects to local officials.\Fletcher cites his record to distinguish himself from Beshear, saying he has delivered funding for road projects and helped keep the bridges on track.\Beshear says that to ensure that money meant for transportation is spent on roads, state government must stop shifting Road Fund dollars to other uses - and he has a plan to generate greater tax revenue, including through possible casino gambling.\Spaghetti Junction\Construction on the Spaghetti Junction interchange, where interstates 64, 65 and 71 meet near downtown, is scheduled to start next year, with work on the entire plan done by 2024.\Still looming is the question of how to pay for the project.\The General Assembly will be asked next year to consider funding the project for the first time since state transportation officials raised the cost estimate by 60 percent last year.\In 2006, some legislators disagreed with Fletcher's proposed $185 million allocation for the bridges in the two-year state budget.\The House spending plan cut $55 million from Fletcher's request in order to fund construction projects elsewhere in Kentucky, but budget negotiators eventually restored the governor's request.\Kentucky receives state and federal gasoline-tax revenue and also issues bonds to fund transportation needs.\But the federal trust fund that provides the bulk of the state's highway money is expected to start running a deficit as early as 2009, according to government estimates.\With costs rising and future federal funding in doubt, states are increasingly contemplating how to pay for massive road projects. Among the options are collecting tolls from drivers who routinely use roads and bridges.\The Build the Bridges Coalition, a group of business and labor organizations and local governments in favor of the project, is surveying people to gauge the support for tolls and other funding methods.\Williams, the Senate president, has pre-filed a bill for the 2008 session that would give local agencies the power to issue bonds, levy tolls, lease roadways to private companies and consider other methods of raising money for expensive projects such as the bridges.\But neither Fletcher nor Beshear supports tolls as a funding option.\""I have worked hard to eliminate tolls in Kentucky, and am committed to do everything I can to fund those bridges without tolls,"" Fletcher said, although he added that because the state's share of major bridge projects exceeds $7 billion, lawmakers are interested in all means of funding.\Beshear also said he's against tolls, yet acknowledged that the size and cost of the Louisville bridges venture and other ""megaprojects"" - roads or bridges that typically cost at least $1 billion - will require innovative approaches.\""We must bring state government, the federal government and the Jefferson County community together to look at our options and find an answer which will work,"" Beshear said. He did not elaborate.\One option neither candidate is willing to consider: Raising Kentucky's tax of 21 cents per gallon on gasoline.\Jack Fish, president of Kentuckians for Better Transportation, which supports increasing the gas tax, said he's not discouraged that the candidates oppose such an increase because both have proposed ways to increase transportation funding.\Some favor alternatives\Several groups favor alternatives to the federally sanctioned bridges plan, including 8664.org, which backs an eastern Jefferson County bridge to Southern Indiana and turning I-64 along the Ohio River into a street-level parkway, and River Fields, a conservation group that opposes an eastern bridge.\J.C. Stites, a co-founder of 8664.org, said it's understandable for a candidate to support the bridges project now, ""but what will our future governor do when it becomes clear that there is not enough money to build two bridges?""\""Will they have an open mind and work to move Louisville and Kentucky forward? Louisville's talked about building a bridge for decades. 8664 supporters want to get something accomplished and are working on an alternative that will save billions of dollars, improve livability and restore Louisville's historic connection to the Ohio River.""\Leslie Barras, associate director of River Fields, said her group takes no position at any time on any political candidate. But with the bridges project expected to eat up more of the state's budget - it will cost more than $250 million annually during the three heaviest construction years in 2011-13 - Kentucky's governor will be in ""a difficult position"" in the coming years, she said.\""It is River Fields' position that faced with these staggering budget impacts, a governor of the commonwealth should promote and prioritize the downtown project, which does the greatest good for the greatest number of Kentuckians. Currently that project is being built last - if at all - because of funding issues.""\On the issue of mass transit, Beshear said he's committed to increasing public transportation in the state as a means of connecting residents to jobs and protecting the environment.\""I will make it a priority to work with local governments, especially in our urban transit centers, to expand our public transit system,"" he said.\Fletcher said he supports public transportation because it is energy efficient and supports economic development and tourism.\""It is especially critical that we ensure our public transportation systems can effectively address major events being held in Kentucky in the coming years.""\Reporter Marcus Green can be reached at (502) 582-4675.\INFORMATIONAL GRAPHIC; THE ISSUE: TRANSPORATION FUNDING QUESTION AND ANSWERS (SEE LIBRARY MICROFILM OR LIBRARY PDF PAGES)"
94,"washington -- Congress returns Tuesday for a four-week legislative sprint to confront a number of domestic and foreign policy matters before lawmakers adjourn for the annual August break.\A long-delayed transportation bill will take top billing with a July 31 deadline looming on how to keep funding flowing to the nation's highways and other infrastructure projects.\The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee recently approved a six-year highway bill, but how to pay for it remains a significant hurdle. Many lawmakers, mostly Democrats, want to pay for it in part by raising the gas tax, which has remained at 18.4 cents per gallon since 1993. But that's a non-starter for the GOP-controlled Congress. There is also a bipartisan effort afoot to raise revenues by raising taxes on profits U.S. companies earn overseas.\The highway bill is also expected to become a vehicle for a fight over whether to reauthorize the Export Import Bank of the United States, the nation's official export credit agency, whose charter expired on July 1.\The House and Senate are scheduled to take up a six-year reauthorization of the federal education law overseeing elementary and secondary education.\The Senate may try again to take up legislation overhauling the nation's cyber-security laws after an attempt to add it to a defense bill last month failed.\Congress may also be thrust into the ongoing international talks to get Iran to abandon its nuclear ambitions if the six world powers negotiating the deal strike a final agreement this month.\Then, of course, there are the 12 annual spending bills that fund the federal government. The House is nearing completion of its work, but Senate Democrats are blocking appropriations bills from moving in the Senate in order to force larger budget talks to set new spending levels for defense and domestic programs."

\
But The Atlantic had a good article the other day about Oregon's experiment with taxing drivers based on the miles they travel rather than how much gas they use.
\
Kentucky, like most states and the federal government, finances its highways and bridges with a tax on gas and diesel.
\
And when gas prices plummeted last fall, those states saw a major hole develop in their transportation funds.
\
As electric cars and hybrids begin to appear on highways, there's talk in state capitals about recouping money from those drivers who are also using the highways and bridges, but buying less petroleum-based fuel.
\
The Atlantic article says, ""The increased popularity of fuel-efficient cars may be good for the environment and the cause of energy independence, but it means that states like Oregon are collecting less money in the gas taxes that fund the upkeep of roads and bridges.

""And because hybrid, plug-in, and electric cars consume less fuel (or none at all), it's the people still driving clunkers that are bearing a bigger burden for infrastructure""
\
Oregon is experimenting with a ""road usage charge"" with 5,000 drivers who have volunteered for the test.
\
Those who enroll starting July 1 can choose one of three devices to track their mileage and charge them a 1.5 cent fee for each mile they drive on public roads in the state.
\
The gas tax they pay at the pump will be deducted so they don't get double-taxed.
\
You can bet the other 49 states, D.C. and Congress will watch this closely.
\
But, the article says, ""The easiest way to implement and enforce a mileage tax is by outfitting cars with GPS devices, but people are understandably leery of having the government track where and when they drive.""
\
Yeah, that could be a concern.
\
Especially if you're not going where you told your boss or your significant other you were going.
\
But the Oregon plan doesn't tell where you went, just how far you went.
\
It's an idea worth considering in Kentucky too.

96,"INDIANA LEGISLATURE\More for schools;\tax refunds possible\By Lesley Stedman Weidenbener\lstedman@courier-journal.com\The Courier-Journal\INDIANAPOLIS -- Majority Republicans in the Indiana House and Senate have a deal on a $28 billion, two-year state budget that offers modestly more money for schools and includes Gov. Mitch Daniels' plan that eventually could pay refunds for taxpayers.\Lawmakers are expected to vote today on the agreement, a vote that might come just hours before a midnight deadline for action.\Senate Appropriations Chairman Luke Kenley, R-Noblesville, one of the plan's two main architects, said it is most significant in that it doesn't raise taxes and should leave the state in good financial standing. If tax revenue comes in as expected, the budget would leave the state with more than $1billion in reserves on June 30, 2013.\""That will help us stimulate our economy,"" Kenley said. ""We're producing a good business environment and we're moving forward with a focus on education, good management, good stewardship in trying to produce a vibrant, healthy economy. We can win the race among our peers in being a state where people want to be.""\But Democrats said Thursday they don't like the plan and warned it would hurt Hoosier families and public schools. They had pushed Republicans -- unsuccessfully -- to use the state's reserves to temporarily suspend the gas tax or boost tax credits for low-income families.\""There's a person behind every single number in this budget,"" said Rep. Scott Pelath, D-Michigan City. ""We cannot overlook the pain, the pain that's in this document.""\Sen. John Broden, D-South Bend, urged Republicans not to be satisfied with the agreement they made Thursday and reconsider the funding formula that will determine how education money is distributed among schools.\Although total dollars for schools will increase 0.5 percent in 2012 and 1 percent in 2013, many districts will still suffer cuts, Broden said. That's in part because those districts are losing students, but also because Republicans rewrote the formula so the dollars fund only students actually in the classroom.\The budget eliminates a phase-out of funding for students who move out of districts as well as other provisions used in past budgets to boost spending at many urban and rural schools. That means growing districts -- typically located in suburbs and getting fewer dollars per student -- would benefit most from the budget.\""There's a little time left"" to make changes, Broden said. ""I hope some things are still on the table.""\Republicans, though, seemed pleased with the plan, which would balance the state's budget in fiscal years 2012 and 2013 -- the first time that's happened since 2009.\The budget includes a taxpayer refund program that Daniels has been pushing for months, although it's not quite as he originally designed it. Instead, taxpayers will have to share with the state's underfunded pension liability.\Any time the state's reserves exceed 10 percent of the next year's budgeted spending, the governor would be required to put half the excess money into the pension program and give half back to taxpayers through income tax credits. An individual's credit would be based on how much tax he or she paid the previous year.\If the program had been in place when fiscal 2008 ended, the state would have had $40million available for the program, according to information the governor's office released when he first proposed the idea. Of that, $20million would have been dedicated to the pension program.\The other half would have been used for tax credits averaging roughly $4.50 for an individual taxpayer and $9 for a couple.\The rebates would have been higher in other years. About $289 million would have been returned to taxpayers in 1995 if this program had been in place, or about $72 for an individual and $144 for a married couple, based on information from the governor's office.\The budget plan also:\Freezes spending on higher education operating budgets but reduces dollars for building maintenance.\Continues most of the $60million in slot machine revenue now dedicated to horse racing purses, but transfers a small amount to anti-smoking programs and race track improvements at the Indiana State Fairgrounds. The House had proposed cutting the purse money significantly.\Maintains current funding for the state's CHOICE home health care program. The House had proposed cutting the program.\Includes Medicaid funding for podiatry, chiropractic and dentistry services for adults. The original House and Senate budgets would either have cut those programs or restricted them.\Creates the Mitch Daniels Early Graduation Scholarship that would offer $4,000 scholarships to students who graduate from high school in three years rather than four.\Prohibits collective bargaining by state employees.\Boosts full-day kindergarten funding and programs that help students who don't speak English.\Reporter Lesley Stedman Weidenbener can be reached at (317) 444-2780."
97,"Everyone seems to have an opinion on how to lower the cost ""at the pump.""\Some believe that an increase in drilling and oil exploration, followed by an increase in refinery capacity, will solve the problem. Others believe that increasing the gas tax will lead to lower consumption, which, in turn, will lead to lower prices. Both sound feasible, but each would require intervention from external entities.\As individuals, we can take measures that will reduce consumption, and we do not have to rely on others to ""save us from ourselves."" Many of the individual ideas I present below can reduce gasoline consumption, but if we all changed our practices and attitudes, we can make a difference not only in our ""carbon footprint"" but in our rate of consumption.\To effectively lower fuel prices, here is what we can do:\Drop the NASCAR mentality. Simple physics dictates as cars travel faster, they consume more fuel (a 10-mile-per-hour increase in speed boosts consumption by 15 per cent or more, depending on the vehicle). In addition, frequent ""speeding up/slowing down"" decreases fuel efficiency. Just because one owns a car that goes ""0 to 60 in five seconds"" does not mean that one should drive it that way. Drive the speed limits posted on our roadways. The limit may be 70, but that does not mean one should drive 75 because ""the police will not cite me for JUST 5 over."" Maintain a constant speed when conditions allow. Use the cruise control feature if the vehicle has it.\If the engine is running, MOVE! When one lets the engine idle, all that is accomplished is increased fuel consumption. In this community, too many people leave their vehicles running when ""out on errands."" Contrary to popular belief, idling is NOT an effective way to warm a car's engine, even in cold weather. The most effective method to warm the engine is to drive. In addition, idling is NOT better than frequently turning off/restarting the engine. If a car is left to idle more than 10 seconds, then that vehicle is using more fuel than if its engine were turned off and restarted. A warm engine stays warm for a long time, so turn it off when going into the store to ""just buy a couple of items.""\A healthy car is a better car. Keeping up with the maintenance schedule will sustain peak efficiency. Make sure tires are inflated at their proper levels (and one does NOT have to use nitrogen, but that explanation is for another story). A drop of one pound per square inch can lead to an almost 1 percent increase in consumption. Keep the filters clean (dirty filters can increase consumption by as much as 10 percent). If the engine uses gasoline, replace the plugs regularly. Make sure your gas cap is secure, and replace if a drop in gas mileage is noticed during the summer months (gas can be lost to evaporation if the cap does not properly seal the system).\Go on a diet. Excess weight leads to more fuel consumption. This not only applies to our physical appearance but also to the ""junk"" we haul around with us. Keep the interior of the car clean and free of unnecessary items. In addition, decreasing the ""junk in the trunk"" (both literally and figuratively) can improve a vehicle's fuel efficiency.\Extras are just that - EXTRA. Features like a sunroof and air conditioning, if improperly used, increase fuel consumption. Even windows can add to the problem. A simple rule - ventilate with outside air below 30 miles per hour; use the AC at highway speeds.\Increase the E.M.P.G. The E stands for EFFECTIVE. If two people are in the same vehicle, and the fuel efficiency is 30 miles per gallon, this is effectively doubling that rate because two people benefited from using only one vehicle. In addition, group errands on the same trip, and follow a pre-determined route. ""Shotgun"" driving is very inefficient. Consider completing errands on the way to/from work.\The people of this nation have more power than they realize. Changing habits and changing attitudes can change consumption. Decreasing demand leads to decreasing prices, which leads to healthier budgets and a healthy environment. If we all ""do our part"" then we can make a difference, not only in energy but also in environmental costs. For once, instead of being part of the problem, be part of the solution. That's your challenge.\TODD TOEPFER\Louisville 40201"
98,"Board will seek public comment\on proposed aviation fuel surcharge\By Ben Zion Hershberg\bhershberg@courier-journal.com\The Courier-Journal\A public hearing on a move aimed at easing the fiscal crisis at the Clark Regional Airport is set for tomorrow , but questions about its future may not be put to rest.\The 5 p.m. hearing will allow public comment on whether the board that oversees the airport should adopt a fuel surcharge.\The surcharge, estimated at 10 cents a gallon, would help make up the $30,000 to $50,000 annual deficit the airport has been experiencing recently.\""I think we're making progress,"" said Dan Gregory, a member of the airport board.\After the airport institutes the fuel surcharge, Gregory said, he hopes the Clark County Council will help the board reform its operations by providing money to hire an independent airport manager rather than relying on Hap Happel, who operates a business at the airport and also runs the airport part-time.\But council member Chuck Moore said he would like to see a few other changes before providing any assistance. Those include higher charges on new lease agreements, cost reductions and other steps to make the airport self-supporting, Moore said.\A dispute has raged since late last year between county officials who, like Moore, want major changes quickly to make the airport self-sufficient, and others, including some county commissioners and airport board members, who see the airport as an important economic development tool that deserves county financial support.\The dispute led to the appointment of a new board member earlier this year - accountant Ron Barnes - and a $20,000 consultant's study that analyzed the airport's operations and compared them to similar airports in the state.\Partly as a result of the study, the board voted unanimously last month to institute a surcharge on aviation fuel sold at the airport and said it probably should be in the range of 10 cents to 12 cents a gallon . The exact charge and other details are to be worked out after tomorrow's hearing.\Pilot William A. Kramer, the representative of the national Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association at the airport, said the group believes "" the gas tax is a poorly considered reaction to a problem that has much better solutions.""\In an analysis submitted to the C ounty C ouncil, Kramer noted that five of the 10 general aviation airports compared by a consultant to the Clark airport would have lost money last year if they didn't get at least $400,000 a year from their county governments, either through a separate tax levy or direct funding.\The Clark airport has received no money for operating expenses from county government for the last four years.\""I cannot think of any business leader who believes a price increase will attract customers in a competitive environment,"" Kramer said of the proposed fuel surcharge.\Mike Jones, a partner in Aircraft Specialists, which repairs and maintains airplanes at the airport and also provides charters and rentals, agreed that the fuel-price increase is likely to cost the airport some business as pilots look elsewhere for competitive fuel prices.\He also thinks instituting the fuel surcharge could violate the terms of his company's 31-year contract for space at the airport.\Aircrafts Specialists' quarterly payments under the contract used to be based partly on a charge that started at 3 cents a gallon for fuel that his company sold to pilots, Jones said, plus 5 percent of other sales.\To provide a more stable payment and eliminate difficult calculations, Jones said his company and the airport agreed to a contract with a flat fee in 1993. He said he believes putting a fuel surcharge into effect on top of that flat fee would violate the contract.\Gregory said he doesn't believe a surcharge for fuel sold to pilots at the airport would violate the contract with Aircraft Specialists or prompt pilots to buy fuel elsewhere. Most airports have such a charge, he said.\""The only competition the airport has is Bowman Field (in Louisville),"" Gregory said.\Calls to flight services yesterday found the lowest price for aviation gasoline, the fuel generally used by the pilots of smaller private planes, was $4.25 at Bowman Field and $3.92 a gallon at the Clark airport.\Based on fuel sales at the Clark airport last year, Gregory estimated, a 10-cent-a-gallon surcharge might generate about $64,500 in additional revenue - enough to cover recent annual deficits but little else.\Bill Halter, president of the airport board, said he hopes the C ounty C ouncil will help by providing money to hire a manager to put changes into effect.\""People have to understand,"" he said, ""the airport doesn't come free.""\The hearing will be in the second-floor meeting room of Hap's Aerial Enterprises, 7001Airport Drive.\Reporter Ben Zion Hershberg can be reached at (812) 949-4032."
99,"INDIANAPOLIS – An Indiana lawmaker filed a bill Tuesday that would completely ban abortions in Indiana — a measure that threatens to deepen a nasty rift between Republican leaders and social conservatives on the far right.\The ongoing feud has already led conservative activists to protest at the churches of House Republican leadership, question leaders' morals and attack House Speaker Brian Bosma on a recent Facebook post about his mother's death.\In response, Bosma called for civility on the ceremonial start of session, saying he refuses to ""participate in the long spiral to uncivil comment in political life.""\However, the recent social media attacks could signify what's to come during the upcoming legislative session.\""The signs would suggest that things are going to get worse before they get better, even if there has been a call for civility,"" said Robert Dion, a political scientist at the University of Evansville.\An increasingly vocal faction of social conservatives say they feel abandoned by their party's leaders, and upset that more hasn't been done after five years with Republican super majorities in both chambers of the General Assembly.\""I believe a super majority is one of the most dangerous things you can have,"" said Monica Boyer, tea party activist and leader of the Indiana Liberty Coalition. ""Once you have a super majority that doesn't have to be held accountable to their constituents, then the big money, the chamber money, controls and the constituents are forgotten.""\Resistance to the proposed abortion ban is just the latest issue to rile social conservatives.\Last legislative session Republicans passed a 10-cent gas tax increase in order to fund road construction and maintenance. Conservative groups saw the plan as a massive tax hike.\In previous years, social conservatives have watched in disappointment as lawmakers rejected a same-sex marriage ban and scaled back Indiana's controversial Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\The angst has led to the creation of several groups, including Hoosiers for Life, the primary organization leading the charge for a total abortion ban. The group has grown 300 percent since its inception about a year ago, according to Executive Director Amy Schlichter.\But the group's uncompromising approach and some of its tactics have divided Indiana's anti-abortion movement, which has traditionally taken a slower, piece-meal approach.\""It does bring about a rift in the life movement and the Republican caucus as well. It puts them in an awkward position,"" said Micah Clark, executive director of the socially conservative American Family Association of Indiana. ""I'm not sure what the pro-life movement can do within the boundaries of the courts that we haven't already done.""\Hoosiers for Life routinely criticizes Bosma and House Public Policy Chairman Ben Smaltz, R-Auburn, and last year even distributed Smaltz's personal cell phone number in an email encouraging supporters to call him.\But Schlichter said her group is now being blamed for the actions of others, including protests at Bosma's and Smaltz's churches and the comments on Bosma's Facebook post about his mother's death.\""Saying that I have a responsibility for every person in Indiana that is pro-life is asinine,"" she said. ""They have used these different things to try to discredit us. That was not me. I would never do that to anyone. I am the only spokesperson for our organization.""\One of the comments on Bosma's Facebook post about his mother's death called into question the authenticity of his religious beliefs.\""You want to bury pro-life bills because you think raising taxes is more important. With 'Republicans' like you, who needs Democrats?"" one Facebook user said. ""And stop the religious nonsense. God wants to know what you're going to do about the babies!""\Another user posted a link to the Hoosiers for Life website.\When asked if such behavior from other activists was appropriate, Schlichter declined to say.\""That's not for me to say,"" she said. ""I don't know what God is doing in their life.""\State lawmakers have routinely passed laws in recent years to further restrict abortions. Those restrictions are routinely challenged in federal courts and sometimes struck down as unconstitutional.\""Indiana already leads the way in piloting the ideas of the pro-life movement,"" Dion said. ""Sometimes you wonder how many more restrictions Indiana can pass. But there's always something they dream up.""\The total abortion ban introduced Tuesday by Rep. Curt Nisly, R-Goshen, would almost certainly be found unconstitutional.\The measure, House Bill 1097, is nearly identical to the bill Smaltz refused to hear last year. The proposal would criminalize all forms of abortion and allow prosecutors to file charges against those who participate in the procedure.\The U.S. Supreme Court's 1973 ruling in Roe v. Wade and subsequent decisions have effectively established a woman's right to an abortion before viability of the fetus.\Just last year, for example, a U.S. district court struck down an Indiana law that would have prohibited abortions sought solely because a fetus had been potentially diagnosed with a disability such as Down syndrome.\But with a Republican in the White House and new appointments to federal courts, many conservatives believe now is the time to test Roe v. Wade again.\""Republicans say we're pro-life, but there's not been a lot of movement,"" Nisly said. ""There's been small things, for sure. But we're in an environment now where something like this could and should pass.""\Bosma, however, has defended his anti-abortion credentials, calling himself the most ""pro-life speaker"" in decades.\But even if people disagree about how to tackle an issue, they need to avoid personal attacks, he said during his recent speech.\""Some of you, here in the building, encourage incivility, you encourage misrepresentation, you participate in the vilification of others,"" he said.

100,"SubHead: Single-bid contracts cost state millions, firm says\Byline: TOM LOFTUS\tloftus@courier-journal.com\Source: The Courier-Journal\Dateline: FRANKFORT, Ky.\The state could have saved nearly $54 million over the past two years if at least two bidders had competed for all highway construction contracts, according to a transportation consultant's report released yesterday .\""There are significant cost savings to be realized by making the construction procurement environment more competitive,"" the consulting firm, Dye Management Group, said in its report to the Legislative Research Commission.\Suggestions for reducing single-bid contracts were among 55 recommendations made by the Bellevue, Wash.-based consultant hired by the LRC last summer at a cost of $349,000 to study the Transportation Cabinet, which was buffeted by scandal during former Gov. Paul Patton's administration.\The report also said that the current Six-Year Highway Plan is packed with $2 billion more in projects than the state can afford; that the cabinet is top- heavy with ""multiple layers of senior management ""; and that selection of projects must be done with more consideration for how they fit into the state's overall transportation system.\Clay Bailey, the newly appointed secretary of the Transportation Cabinet, said he plans to use the report as he reorganizes the cabinet in ""a rather major"" way. He said reducing layers of upper management will be among the changes he'll implement.\Senate Republican Leader Dan Kelly of Springfield said the report ""included a lot of helpful recommendations"" that can be used by the cabinet and the legislature.\Charles Lovorn, executive director of the Kentucky Highway Contractors Association, said there are logical reasons for lack of competition in highway contracting, including that it's impractical for a contractor to bid for work that is far away from his sources of rock and asphalt .\""Is there any difference between that and single candidates who run unopposed?"" Lovorn asked. ""There simply are geographical limitations and reasons for there being single bids.""\But House Speaker Jody Richards said the money paid to Dye was a good investment . ""It can save millions and tens of millions of dollars if these practices are put into place,"" Richards said.\The issue of lack of competition for highway contracts - particularly for highway paving work - has plagued Kentucky for decades. In 1994, The Courier-Journal examined state paving contracts between 1988 and '94 and found that nearly 60 percent drew only a single bidder. The newspaper found that the state was paying about 30 percent more for blacktop in contracts that had no competition.\Dye reported yesterday that the problem persists.\During the two-year period the consultant examined, 49 projects costing $300 million - just more than a quarter of all money spent for construction during the period - were awarded to the only company that submitted a bid. Another 39 projects drew only two bidders.\Dye said its analysis of bid prices on all contracts ""supports the basic economic theory that the consistent absence of competition results in the cabinet's not getting a fair price on many construction projects.""\IN ITS ANALYSIS, Dye noted that the average cost for a single-bid contract was about 1 percent below the cabinet's cost estimate for the project. But the cost of contracts that dre w two bids was 18 percent below the cabinet estimate, and contracts with three bids were 21 percent below estimate.\The cabinet's cost estimate is made before bi ds are submitted and is kept confidential.\Assuming those bid patterns remain consistent, the state would have saved $53.8 million if two bidders had competed for the 49 single-bid projects, Dye reported, and the savings would have been $61.4 million if those projects had drawn three bidders.\""The data dramatically indicate the financial impact of the lack of competition on many projects,"" the report said.\The report found that the majority of single-bid contracts we re found in four of the state's 12 highway districts: Pikeville, Flemingsburg, Lexington and Madisonville.\Dye recommended that the cabinet set firm rules and thresholds for rejecting bids that go above the cabinet's estimated cost. It also said the cabinet should implement a strategy to adjust the timing and size of projects to lure more bidders. And it said the state should consider establishing its own quarries to introduce competition.\Bailey said it will be a challenge to find ways to attract competition, ""but we've got a mandate to do better and we'll be working on it.""\On the selection of projects, the report said, ""There is a strong perception that the process through which projects are identified and prioritized is highly politicized.""\Dye found that the selection and setting of priorities for projects ca me from a variety of sources: the governor, legislature, local officials, 15 area development districts, and the cabinet officials' evaluation of need based on a highway's safety and capacity.\Although input from such ""stakeholders"" is important, Dye found that it can produce long-range problems.\""There is little business-based analysis that answers such questions as, 'What does this project buy me?' in terms of cost savings or other benefits to highway users,"" the report said.\And it said there is insufficient consideration of the type of overall, statewide transportation system produced by a conglomeration of locally recommended projects.\""There is no mechanism for ensuring that individual projects are programmed and prioritized ... to fit together to make the overall highway system as efficient and effective as it can be,"" the report said.\Demands from so many sources, meantime, have produced a Six-Y ear Highway Plan that contains $6.92 billion of scheduled work with only $4.98 billion in anticipated revenue.\THE REPORT NOTED that in 2000, Patton recommended a 7-cent increase in the gasoline tax, which would have produced hundreds of millions of dollars in annual revenue to enhance road construction plans. However, the legislature rejected the tax increase, even though it approved a six-year plan that anticipated the extra revenue from the higher gas tax.\To meet anticipated funding of the bigger construction plan, lawmakers instead decided to spend down the cabinet's cash reserves - money set aside to assure full funding of each project that is started. As a result the cabinet's cash balance of about $650 million in 2000 fell to $144 million late last year and will be less than $100 million this year, Dye concluded.\The consultant also found that layers of upper management make Kentucky's cost of administering transportation high compared to other states. Its analysis of the cabinet's administrative expenses between 1997 and 2001 showed that the expenses were higher than nine states examined, about the same as one and lower than four.\Among its recommendations are that the cabinet reorganize to reduce layers of top management and establish an ""annual business planning process that sets strategic objectives and business improvement priorities.""\KEY FINDINGS\A report on the Transportation Cabinet concluded:\The cabinet is top- heavy. It should be reorganized by eliminating extra ""layers of management"" and by consolidating offices that work independently of the rest of the cabinet.\Most contracts are awarded with one or two bids. The cabinet could save millions of dollars by making a priority of increasing competition for its contracts.\The Six-Year Highway Plan has nearly $2 billion more in projects than the state can realistically finance.\Selection of individual projects lacks an overall vision to ensure the projects fit together in a cost-effective transportation system.\""There is a strong perception that the process through which projects are identified and prioritized is highly politicized.""\Dye Management Group, which conducted a study of the Transportation Cabinet"
101,"Rep. Hal Rogers funneling millions to keep interstate route alive, putting other priorities at risk\By R. G. Dunlop\rdunlop@courier-journal.com\The Courier-Journal\SOMERSET, Ky. - U.S. Rep. Hal Rogers has funneled nearly $90million in federal funds toward a proposed interstate highway in Kentucky that likely will never cross the state, much less stretch beyond its borders.\Despite the substantial expenditure of funds, not a single shovelful of dirt has been turned on Interstate 66, conceived nearly two decades ago as a coast-to-coast corridor that would run through Southern Kentucky. Since then, it has been abandoned by every other state as unnecessary or too expensive.\""We try not to build roads that don't lead anywhere,"" said Brent Walker of the West Virginia Department of Transportation, which has never seriously pursued I-66.\Nevertheless, Kentucky continues to push forward, urged on by I-66 supporters, including local politicians and economic-development officials, and driven by Rogers' powerful influence as a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee.\That influence - accumulated over the 27 years Rogers has represented Southern and Eastern Kentucky's 5th Congressional District - combined with Congress' general reluctance to oppose a member's pet projects, helps explain I-66's staying power.\""Why is Kentucky the only state to find the road worthy of pursuit?"" asked Dr. Hilary Lambert, a longtime I-66 opponent who has taught geography and environmental studies at several universities and who is a former associate director of the Kentucky Waterways Alliance.\""Because Hal loves it so much. He's a guy who brings roads to his district.""\Many critics, including environmentalists, government-spending watchdogs and some affected landowners, say I-66 is a bad investment and a poor use of scarce transportation funds.\Only two short, widely separated segments of I-66 have even reached the planning stages - one in Pike County, the other in Laurel and Pulaski counties. Yet the estimated cost of those sections alone is $3.5billion or more, and building them would deplete limited transportation funds that could finance other major projects, such as the Ohio River bridges at Louisville.\The project's critics also contend that optimistic projections of economic-development windfalls resulting from I-66 in some of Kentucky's most depressed counties - new industry, thousands of jobs, an influx of tourism - are unrealistic.\They also question whether road-building - rather than, say, investment in education - is the best way to stimulate economic activity.\Critics cite a host of other reasons why Kentucky should abandon I-66, including these:\The sole economic analysis of the project a decade ago showed that, at best, I-66 would have only a marginal net benefit for drivers, compared with the estimated cost of construction. For the most likely locations and speed limits, the analysis found, every dollar spent would only yield benefits ranging from $1.16 to $1.43.\Traffic counts don't appear to support the need for the project. Daily volumes on existing roads in Pike, Laurel and Pulaski counties that would be supplanted by I-66 generally are far below those typically seen on interstates, even in rural areas of Kentucky.\Counts on Ky. 80 in Laurel and Pulaski counties are 30,000 or less, and are even lower on most Pike County roads. By comparison, an average of 61,000 vehicles per day travel I-75 near Richmond and 58,000 per day pass through Oldham County on I-71.\The environmental impact of I-66 would be significant, taking nearly 200 acres of the Daniel Boone National Forest, mostly in Laurel County, and requiring a second bridge across a protected area of the Rockcastle River where construction is prohibited by the state's wild-rivers law.\The road also would traverse unstable cave and sinkhole areas of Pulaski County that are vulnerable to groundwater pollution, flooding, destruction of wildlife and habitat and, possibly, catastrophic collapse.\""What exactly is the problem they're trying to solve?"" said Karyn Moskowitz of the GreenFire Consulting Group in Bloomington, Ind., which has been involved in the fight against I-66. ""Is it a lack of economic development, safety, unemployment? They (supporters) throw everything into the mix. I haven't seen that they've really proved a basis for the road.""\Rogers, a Somerset Republican who has championed I-66 since the early 1990s, turns aside questions about the wisdom of building it, saying they reflect a bias against rural Kentucky, including his district.\""I didn't hear these arguments when we were talking about building I-75 through the Bluegrass, the charming, beautiful part of our state,"" he said in a recent interview. ""... But when we start building ... a highway through the most impoverished part of the state ... we hear all of this noise about, 'Oh, it's not needed.' Well, we could have made that same argument in all of these highways that we've built over the years.""\N O 'PRESSING NEED'\Kentucky only state\that's moving ahead\While I-66 was once projected as a coast-to-coast highway, a 1994 national study ultimately concluded that it was not worth the cost. Individual states then were given the option of considering its merits.\But only Kentucky is aggressively moving ahead, thanks to Rogers' efforts to secure between $1.8million and $24million a year since 1998 for planning, engineering and design work.\""It's nothing that has been identified as a pressing need, either by us or by any community groups we work with,"" said Jeff Briggs, a spokesman for the Missouri Department of Transportation.\Illinois is the only other state even considering the idea, and officials there said the lack of commitment in Missouri and Western Kentucky would almost certainly doom the project.\Yet in Southern Kentucky, red-and-blue signs proclaiming the ""Future Route of I-66"" dot the proposed corridor.\One of the two sections of I-66 currently under active consideration, a 33-mile segment from Pikeville to the West Virginia border, would roughly parallel a newly upgraded $400million four-lane highway, U.S. 119, and would serve a relative handful of people in one of the most remote areas of the state.\The presence of the improved U.S. 119 has led some to question the need to spend $2billion or more to build the section of I-66 just a few miles away, especially because most roads in the area of Pike County that would be served by I-66 generally are lightly traveled.\Pike County is in Rogers' district and also is the home of Paul Patton, Kentucky's governor from 1995-2003 and another prominent supporter of the highway.\""One of the fundamental problems with Appalachia is that the interstates avoided it,"" Patton said in a recent interview. ""If you work in economic development, as I have, almost everybody wants to be in the proximity of an interstate. It's almost magical.""\In Laurel and Pulaski counties, the 28-mile segment of I-66 would supersede a serviceable highway, Ky. 80, which consists of three and four lanes for all but a few miles between London and Somerset. Moreover, Ky. 80 would remain in use.\The two proposed segments of I-66, which are five counties and 120 miles apart, would be linked by existing roads. One of them, the Hal Rogers Parkway between London and Hazard, is largely two-lane and has several stoplights - hardly the seamless, high-speed corridor once envisioned.\The Kentucky Transportation Cabinet has issued conflicting estimates for the cost of building just those two portions of I-66.\Pike County residents, for example, were told at a meeting last March that the cost of the segment from Pikeville to West Virginia would be $800million. But a brochure distributed at the same meeting put the cost at ""over one billion."" And the cabinet's six-year road plan says the cost is likely ""more than $2billion.""\After the preferred route for the proposed London-to-Somerset portion of I-66 was announced last August, the state said it would cost $331million. But Transportation Cabinet officials said in subsequent interviews that the road likely would cost at least twice that amount, and perhaps as much as $1billion. The six-year road plan puts the cost at $1.5billion.\David Kratt, the Transportation Cabinet's coordinator for the I-66 project, said the higher estimates were ""a way for the cabinet to demonstrate that the 'mega projects' are very expensive, and we wanted to encourage a dialogue with the legislature.""\The cabinet's Web site for I-66 includes 25 ""frequently asked questions"" about the London-Somerset segment, along with answers to them. Not one mentions the cost of the project.\Asked where the money would come from to pay for I-66, Kratt said: ""You've asked a very good question, and no one has a good answer for it.""\During an I-66 public hearing last August, Laurel County resident Jane Sparkman stood outside the London Community Center wearing a hand-painted sandwich board asking, ""Who Will Benefit?"" The sign also contained Sparkman's answer: ""Road-builders, land speculators and politicians,"" who were portrayed holding wads of cash or gold coins.\Sparkman, who is 58 and a retired pharmacist, said she was protesting because she considers I-66 a waste of money and a threat to the environment.\""We have a perfectly good road in place, and it's not busy,"" she said. ""There's no need for a parallel road.""\'LONG-TERM PROJECT'\Rogers, state officials\stress road's importance\Despite such sentiments, I-66 has generated little sustained criticism, except from environmentalists and a few national organizations. Sparkman thinks that's partly the result of apathy, both locally and in major metropolitan areas, because most people don't see themselves as directly affected.\In 2004 Friends of the Earth and Taxpayers for Common Sense designated I-66 as the fifth most wasteful and environmentally destructive highway project in America.\In a report titled ""Road to Ruin,"" the groups concluded that claims of a jobs, industry and a tourism bonanza resulting from I-66 were based on ""flawed premises and outdated economic models,"" and that the Transportation Cabinet had underestimated the project's costs and exaggerated its benefits.\""I-66 would impact undeveloped green space, scenic beauty, ... local businesses, and the general quality of life in rural Southern Kentucky,"" the report concluded. ""It is these qualities that make the region an attractive place to live, work, recreate, and visit, and underlie its greatest economic value as a tourist destination.""\Tom FitzGerald, head of the Kentucky Resources Council and an I-66 opponent, said he thinks the money being spent on the I-66 project should instead be used for existing roads and bridges ""in dire need of repair.""\""To divert money from that to build a road that can't be justified is highly questionable,"" he said.\FitzGerald added that the project's continued existence ""is closely tied to the seniority and status of the congressman from that area.""\Lee Florea, a geologist and a former Pulaski County resident who now lives and works in Florida, said a growing number of citizens in the area agree.\Rogers has ""been dead set on getting this highway through his part of Kentucky since 1994,"" Florea said. ""It's been deemed infeasible in most of the rest of the country. Why it's feasible in Southern Kentucky kind of escapes me.""\Rogers and Transportation Cabinet officials, however, continue to stress the highway's importance, and to express optimism about getting it built.\Rogers' congressional Web site proclaims that I-66 ""will provide Kentuckians with a new east-west highway stretching from the coalfields of Eastern Kentucky to the cornfields of Western Kentucky.""\Mike Hancock, the Transportation Cabinet's chief of staff, said officials ""still believe that, in time, I-66 can be constructed, not only in Kentucky but also in Virginia and West Virginia, making a positive contribution to Appalachia.""\Jack Fish, president of Kentuckians for Better Transportation, an advocacy group that supports I-66, said he believes the project will continue to be funded as long as Rogers is in Congress.\Rogers, however, was cautious when asked about the prospects for funding to get just the two segments of I-66 off the drawing board and under construction. He said he did not know when that might occur, or who would pay the bill.\""Well, that's a big question. It will be up to the Congress to decide that,"" Rogers said. ""This is a long-term project ... and I have no illusions that we can do this in a matter of months, or even years.""\FUNDING OPTIONS\Demand for dollars\sparks search for options\I-66's opponents hope that, as more time elapses with no road being built, the project will quietly fade.\""We are not flush with money for road projects,"" FitzGerald said.\But they also worry that at some point their concerns about the project will be trumped by the argument that too much has been invested not to proceed. The federal transportation bill for the current fiscal year, still before Congress, contains $2.5million for additional I-66 planning.\""A million here, a million there, no one objects,"" said Deb Bledsoe, executive director of Appalachia-Science in the Public Interest, a nonprofit resource center based in Rockcastle County.\But federal funding, historically the primary source for major road and bridge projects nationwide, is uncertain at best, especially for so-called ""mega-projects"" such as I-66 and the Louisville bridges.\""From every piece of information I get, there's no chance there's going to be additional federal funding for any of them,"" said U.S. Rep. John Yarmuth, a Democrat whose 3rd District would include the bridges. "" ... We're going to have to find ways to finance them other than tax revenues.""\It's unclear what other funding sources might be tapped.\Gov. Steve Beshear and legislative leaders have flatly ruled out a gas-tax increase. Beshear also said in a recent interview that he is ""not a fan of"" tolls, although he intends to explore various funding options for road projects, including public-private partnerships of the sort proposed earlier this year by state Senate President David Williams.\Williams, a Burkesville Republican, has pre-filed a bill for the 2008 session that would give local agencies the authority to issue bonds, levy tolls, lease roadways to private companies and consider other methods of raising money for expensive projects, such as the Louisville bridges or I-66.\The only economic analysis of I-66 in Kentucky concluded that revenue from tolls would not be enough to cover most of the construction and maintenance costs, and that building the road would require a ""massive increase"" in highway-related spending.\House Speaker Jody Richards, D-Bowling Green, said he hadn't considered the possibility of I-66 as a toll road and does not intend to propose it. Williams thinks tolls are an option at least for the Louisville bridges and for a proposed new interstate bridge at Cincinnati.\""If people are going to use those bridges to drive from Detroit to Biloxi, why should Kentuckians or Hoosiers bear the total cost?"" Williams said.\Rogers declined to discuss specific funding options for I-66, saying, ""That's for wiser heads than mine.""\Complicating the possibility of major federal or state financial support for I-66 is the competition it would pose for the Louisville bridges.\Williams and Richards noted that the state's current Six-Year Highway Plan includes approximately $789million for the Louisville bridges but no money for I-66 - a clear indication that the bridges are a higher priority for the state.\The bridges project is ""certainly the most prominent in our six-year highway plan and, by that measure, our top priority,"" Hancock, of the Transportation Cabinet, said.\""I wouldn't want to say to someone from southeast Kentucky that we don't value their accessibility as much as we value the accessibility of someone in Louisville or in Northern Kentucky,"" he said.

She is nothing but a rank politician who will walk away from any previous position, stand she has taken or made in order to win an election.\Case in point, the pathetic actions she took in her election bid for the Senate versus McConnell.

Kopacz\Prospect, Ky. 40059\Net-metering bill a positive\Your readers should know that there is misinformation being discussed about the Kentucky Senate Net-Metering Bill, or SB 214, which would significantly increase solar options for residents and businesses in Kentucky.\Under the legislation, the current cap on net-metering systems would be greatly expanded, from 30 kilowatts to 1,000 kilowatts -- benefiting both companies looking to expand and residential customers. Existing net-metering participants will be grandfathered in under the current program.\It would also create a process with the Public Service Commission to ensure the costs of people who choose to net meter are not being subsidized by others. This is a matter of fairness, since net metering customers use the grid, wires and distribution services we all pay for in our bills, just in a different way.\The Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkley National Laboratory recently confirmed this cost-shifting problem. For example, they found that rates in Arizona could increase by 5 percent on 90 percent of its customers, so that the other 10 percent could enjoy the financial incentives of existing net-metering policies.\Brydon Ross\Lexington\Ross is the Vice President of State Affairs for Consumer Energy Alliance (CEA).\Let kids have fun and learn\After watching another season of youth sports, I am so ashamed of these adults who call themselves coaches, umpires and referees.

103,"When the wintry clouds cleared over Janice and David Isaacs' home in Georgetown, Ind., this month, their new solar panels soaked up the rays of the sun and converted the energy to electricity.\The power is reducing the utility bills at the couple's home -- and better yet, they say, helping the environment by trimming the amount of coal burned to heat and cool their home.\""The other day I got home from work and saw the meter running backwards,"" David Isaacs said. ""That's just a neat feeling.""\The Isaacses have joined a tiny but growing movement among Indiana and Kentucky homeowners, farmers and schools to plug wind and solar panel systems into the power grid -- conserving energy, while also saving money, because they're credited for the excess energy they send back to the utility.\The process is known as net metering, where homeowners who produce more electricity than they consume -- often during daytime hours when they're away -- can see their electric meter spin in reverse.\At night, when the family is home with lights and appliances running, electricity flows into the home, spinning the meter forward to record the consumption. Their meter registers the net amount of energy produced or consumed during the billing period.\Some 30 states, including Kentucky, have enacted net metering laws in recent years. Indiana legislators, however, have for the second year in a row failed to pass that state's first such statute.\State Sen. Jim Merritt, an Indianapolis Republican who authored the Indiana bill, said Tuesday he had asked Gov. Mitch Daniels to request that state regulators begin writing rules to update the state's net metering regulations.\Reducing dependence\Legislation allowing residential and commercial energy producers to get credit for what they generate is a step that environmentalists and renewable-energy advocates insist is crucial to spurring solar, wind and other green energy forms that can cut dependence on coal and other fossil fuels.\Without such a benefit, ""it's kind of like encouraging people to get a driver's license, and making cars cost $1 million,"" said Andy McDonald, director of the Kentucky Solar Partnership that promotes increased use of solar power. ""Net metering is a way for people to connect in a fair and efficient way"" to the grid.\Utility customers with net metering realize savings based on how much power they produce.\At Tim Darst's home in the Louisville Highlands, for example, he and his wife received credit for 1,335 kilowatt-hours supplied to LG&E last year from their solar panels. They paid the difference between the electricity their home used and what their system sent to the grid, saving about $91.\That annual savings will slowly allow them to repay their $20,000 investment, but the top priority wasn't money, Darst said. Because nearly 90percent of Kentucky's electricity comes from burning coal, he and his wife believe finding another way to power their home makes sense.\Doing so would have been even more costly without net metering, which would force them to store the extra power in batteries, Darst said, noting that ""not net metering would be a real hurdle.""\The Kentucky Public Service Commission does not track how many customers of the utilities under its jurisdiction produce their own power and use net metering. But E.On, parent of LG&E, has 28 of them, including nine homeowners in the Louisville area, according to Chip Keeling, the utility's spokesman.\In Indiana, Duke Energy, Indianapolis Power and Light Co. and Vectren have begun allowing more than 100 customers to use net metering, despite the lack of a statewide policy.\The legislation that was considered in Indianapolis would have expanded administrative rules to allow customers of investor-owned utilities to credit excess power that their customers generate from wind, hydroelectric generators, solar and other types of renewable energy systems, something that utilities like Duke already are doing.\""We think it's important to try and provide customers with a way"" to benefit from renewable energy, said Lew Middleton, a spokesman for Duke in Indiana, which had 74 net metering customers last year. They included 47 homes, 14 schools and 13 businesses that generated a combined 279 kilowatts last year, most of it from solar power, according to a Duke report.\Fine-tuning the law\Advocates of renewable energy also are seeking flexibility for farmers and businesses to avoid caps on generating large amounts of power or having to pay excessive charges for multiple meters. They also want customers to be allowed to produce power from multiple sources -- biogas and windmills, for instance.\Indiana supporters also wanted to remove any exemption for municipalities and rural membership cooperatives from participation in net metering practices. Solar and wind vendors and other industry advocates oppose such exemptions because they believe a uniform policy that applies to all utilities is best, said Laura Arnold, a lobbyist for Indiana Distributed Energy Advocates.\In Kentucky, the legislature passed a net metering law about six years ago and broadened it in 2008 in a bill widely supported by Gov. Steve Beshear, top legislators and industry groups. The new law expanded the types of electrical power eligible for net metering and doubled limits on alternative power generation. It also extended the use of net-meter credits to the life of a customer's account.\Earned in '09; used now\That provision is bound to help lower the bills at Louisville dentist Don Feeney Jr.'s modest home in the Germantown neighborhood. His 10 solar panels supply the home with power to spare, so he racks up credits that can be applied to future bills.\Because of the number of cloudy days in January and February, Feeney said, LG&E dipped into the 300 credits -- worth about $60 -- that he had accumulated last year. That left him with 175 by late February. Although it may take 10 to 15 years for him to recoup the $18,000 investment in the panels, that wasn't the point, Feeney said.\""The reason I got them is the little I could do for the environment,"" he said.\Jay Shoaf, a farmer from Hope, Ind., who has a wind turbine, figures he saves about 10 percent each month on his electric bill -- hardly denting the power needs of his home and a 1,100-head swine operation. But like Feeney, he said the payback on his $12,000 turbine is secondary.\His epiphany about alternative energy came a few years ago while he was watching a Discovery Channel program about a Saudi Arabian prince who had made so much money in oil profits that he bought an Airbus jetliner and customized it to carry his Learjet. It was during a stretch when $4-a-gallon gas prices boosted the diesel bill on Shoaf's farm from $10,000 to $25,000 a year.\""I thought, 'That's my money,'"" Shoaf recalled. ""It just kind of made me mad. I got on the Internet and started researching.""\Isaacs, a retired science and math teacher, also began researching alternative energy years ago. He said he was pleasantly surprised at how quickly Duke responded to an e-mail asking to hook up his system to the grid and install a meter that could record the energy generated at the home.\Even though it could take 20 to 25 years to recover the $40,000 that he and his wife spent, Isaacs figures they're positioned to weather future energy price increases. They're also doing their part for the environment.\""The main thing was lowering our carbon imprint and saving some money,"" he said.\Reporter Grace Schneider can be reached at (812) 949-4040."
104,"""Utilities are titanics, and they don't shift their business model well. Their entire model is based on the idea that the more energy that is demanded, the more they need to build things and the more that increases their bottom line. From our per-spective, 309 is another way of keeping the barriers to self-sufficiency and self-reliance in place.""\Allyson Mitchell\Director of sustainability with Prosperity Indiana, a group that fosters economic development at the community level\INDIANAPOLIS - Indianapolis Colts games. Cigar bars. Cocktail lounges and dinners at Indy's top spots.\It may sound like the life of a top CEO or a major celebrity. But in fact, it's all in a day's work for some Indiana legislators. An IndyStar review has found that as the General Assembly was considering crucial energy legislation, utilities and their political action committees poured millions into the legislative body in the form of gifts, entertainment, campaign contributions and lobbying.\Gifts and entertainment? Check. During the 2015, 2016 and 2017 reporting periods, investor-owned utilities and the organization that represents them spent more than $109,000 entertaining Indiana General Assembly legislators. More than $32,000 was spent entertaining members of the Senate and House committees focused on utility legislation.\Campaign contributions? Check. Since the latest net metering policies were enacted in Indiana in 2011, political action committees representing Indiana's five investor-owned utilities have poured nearly $1.7million into state candidates.\Lobbying? A big check. From 2014 to the first half of 2017, utilities spent $2.78million on lobbying. More than $530,000 was spent in the first reporting period of 2017 alone, which included the 2017 legislative session and the months leading to it. But if money played any role in the passage of a crucial solar energy bill, so did words. One word in particular. Mimicking what has become a national strategy, utility leaders in Indiana, with the support of some Republican lawmakers, strategically rebranded net metering from an ""incentive"" to a ""subsidy.""\The issue at hand was a bill whose most controversial provision was to phase out net metering — the practice of requiring utilities to compensate customers who produce more energy than they consume, usually from rooftop solar panels. The passage of that bill, Senate Bill 309, has thrown Indiana's burgeoning solar installation industry into a pit of uncertainty.\""In the hallways, the lobbyists for the energy supply and utilities were telling legislators, 'Oh, it's a huge subsidy and all we're doing is subsidizing these wealthy people who can install,' which is far from the truth,"" said Sen. Mark Stoops, D-Bloomington, who voted against SB 309. ""That whole question of whether it was subsidized was blown out of proportion and was not accurately represented.""\Some would argue that net metering reflects Hoosier values, given it is a state founded on the pioneer principle of self-sufficiency. For the private homeowner who can make the investment, rooftop solar can mean relying less on the utility's grid for electricity, saving money on bills and earning tax credits from the federal government. It also helps the environment by producing clean energy.\But while some view rooftop solar as an innovative technology that is revolutionizing the electric industry, others fear it could change the way customers rely on the grid, inviting the end of the era of utilities' hold on how homeowners get their electricity. The disruption that energy self-generation could cause to the industry is not likely to materialize instantaneously, but utilities are taking the long view. In each of their SEC filings, Indiana's investor-owned utilities — Duke, Indiana Michigan, Indianapolis Power & Light, NIPSCO and Vectren — list a form of self-generation or distributed generation among the ways that the companies could lose revenue.\For several years, Indiana believed in the value of incentivizing rooftop solar. The state implemented net metering in 2005, and in 2011, under Republican Gov. Mitch Daniels, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission moved to make more solar customers eligible for the credit.\But then things changed. A 2013 report written for the Edison Electric Institute, a national organization representing investor-owned utilities, called distributed solar generation one prominent example of a ""threat to the utility model."" A year later, the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council used information from the EEI to craft model legislation to phase out net metering.\In 2015, Indiana legislators took their first shot at doing away with the program.\""I knew this was a push nationwide through the American Legislative Exchange Council, and energy companies and utilities were framing this as a subsidization issue,"" Stoops said. ""Pretty much a cut-and-paste ALEC bill with cut-and-paste ALEC arguments going on across the country, and Indiana was happy to play along.""\It would have allowed utilities to set their own rates and apply charges to customers who generate their own power. As in the case of SB 309, critics called that bill premature, and said that getting rid of net metering when Indiana's solar industry was in its infancy was like ""killing a fly with a sledgehammer.""\At least 50 people appeared at a February 2015 committee hearing to speak out against HB 1320, far outnumbering those who came in favor of the bill. Yet only eight opponents to the bill were allowed to speak before Rep. Heath VanNatter, then vice chairman of the committee, cut public comment short.\VanNatter's treatment of the public comment process presented a procedural problem for the bill. According to those familiar with the process, Indiana House Speaker Brian Bosma, R-Indianapolis, declined to bring it to the floor for fear of a procedural boondoggle. So they left the bill where it was.\It would be two years before the next fight over net metering. In the meantime, Indiana utilities and the organization that represents them, the Indiana Energy Association, targeted lawmakers.\VanNatter, who still serves on the House Committee on Utilities, Energy and Telecommunications, was the top recipient of gifts and entertainment furnished by utilities. During the 2015, 2016 and 2017 reporting periods, he was treated to roughly $5,300 worth of meals, Colts games and other entertainment including at least one WWE match, which he and his son attended in March. Members of his family also were top recipients. In all, he and his family were recipients to nearly $8,500 in treats in a two-and-a-half year period. VanNatter, R-Kokomo, declined a request to be interviewed about gifts he received.\VanNatter also was a top recipient of campaign contributions. Since 2011, his campaigns received about $42,000 from PACs representing Indiana utilities. Other top recipients are also notable to the net metering process: Koch, author of the first anti-net metering bill, received more than $34,000 from utility PACs, as did Sen. James Merritt, R-Indianapolis, the current chairman of the Senate Utilities Committees. Sen. Brandt Hershman, R-Wheatfield, author of SB 309 and former member of the Senate Utilities Committee, received at least $61,000.\The heavy presence of lobbyists was felt in the state house.\""(There's) no question, the utility lobby greatly overstated the potential impact that customer generators were having on the grid from an electricity rate perspective,"" said Jesse Kharbanda, executive director of the Hoosier Environmental Council. ""Secondly, you have much greater access by the utility lobby to key decision makers than any other stakeholder groups — we were outnumbered.""\That said, lobbying is commonplace on any number of issues before lawmakers. So, too, are gift-giving and donating to lawmaker campaigns. Also, net metering certainly wasn't the only issue of consequence for the energy industry from 2015-17, though it was a significant one.\""From a lobbying standpoint, I would tell you that it's really important for people to engage in the legislative process,"" said Mark Maassel, president of the utility lobby group Indiana Energy Association, who testified in favor of the solar bill earlier this year. ""We saw this as an important issue so the answer is yes, we did engage.""\Still, it was hardly a slam dunk for proponents of the bill. Homeowners, small business owners and environmental advocates staunchly opposed the bill, testifying at hearings that went on for as long as six hours. When the bill was finally brought to a vote, it won in the House by only 13 votes — a slim margin for Indiana's Republican-ruled House of Representatives.\At the same time that investor-owned utilities were sinking money into politicians, they and their allies were testifying against net metering in the name of protecting customers from cost-shifts — an issue they framed as preventing lower income consumers from subsidizing wealthier ratepayers who can afford solar panels. ""It becomes inherent in the calculations that people without solar are paying more than people who do have solar, in terms of really paying for the cost of the grid,"" said Maassel.\It's true that people who don't generate their own energy pay for some of the immediate costs that net metering customers don't. But studies suggest that when a market isn't overly saturated, the cost shifts are in fact minimal.\""Whether net metering really accounts to cost-shifting will depend on the rate structure and the high levels of penetration,"" said Kerwin Olson, executive director of consumer advocacy group Citizens Action Coalition. ""But in the state of Indiana we are nowhere near that — not even close.""\In Arizona, a favorite example cited by Maassel, Hershman and other proponents of the bill, the solar industry is much more developed. There were 84,750 net metering customers in that sunny state at the end of 2016, compared with Indiana's 1,116.\Hershman and Massel concede that Indiana isn't in the same boat as other states, and they emphasize that it was the rate of growth that makes them believe now was the time to act.\While the argument over cost-shifting and subsidies took center stage last March, it became apparent that there was another issue backers were advocating for: certainty in the utility market.\In March, Maassel told the general assembly, ""Our industry is in the midst of a very significant transition.""\Rep. Matt Pierce put it another way. ""This bill is a classic example of an entrenched old industry trying to do all it can to hobble a new and emerging industry,"" the Bloomington Democrat said, ""because the new industry will mess up its business model.""\That business model is slow to change course, according to Allyson Mitchell, director of sustainability with Prosperity Indiana, a group that fosters economic development at the community level.\""Utilities are titanics, and they don't shift their business model well. Their entire model is based on the idea that the more energy that is demanded, the more they need to build things and the more that increases their bottom line,"" Mitchell said. ""From our perspective, 309 is another way of keeping the barriers to self-sufficiency and self-reliance in place.""\According to a study by the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab's Electricity Markets & Policy Group, the real drivers of changes in electric retail prices are capital expenditures — which can include investments in new power plants or even solar farms. Even when the Lab projects a 10 percent penetration rate for net-metered solar power (Indiana's penetration rate is less that 1 percent), it accounts for less of a cost-shift than capital expenditures.\Utilities can reclaim the cost of capital expenditures through rate increase requests put in front of the IURC. In 2015, the IURC approved a rate case for one Indiana utility to recover $38 million for solar investments. Capital expenditures tend to be how utilities make their profits. Even before the first anti-net metering bill was brought into consideration in 2015, the IURC had a built-in mechanism for revisiting and reviewing the credit offered.\They did this once before, in 2011. At the time, the commission traveled across the state to gather information about net metering. They concluded that it was in the state's interests to expand the program and allow more people to take advantage of the incentive.\In many states, the regulatory body is the one that sets the rate for net metering. In Indiana, the commission is set up like a court of law. Utilities or customers submit briefs to the agency, providing testimony and evidence. It's based on this evidence that the IURC will make a decision to, for example, allow a utility to raise its rates in order to cover the costs of a capital investment or settle a dispute.\Net metering would not have its day in court — and the fact that no study was done on the status of net metering in Indiana concerned some lawmakers and opponents of the bill.\""A study is necessary when there are questions around a particular issue. In my particular viewpoint, if you look at the economics of net metering, it is very clear that there is a subsidy,"" Maassel said. ""The general assembly is in the ideal spot to say that this the kind of signal we want to send, this is the kind of encouragement we want to send. It's not based strictly on economics, it's based on the policy of Indiana and that's fine.""\Hershman said lawmakers did study a range of resources when crafting the policy, including news articles and a Government Accountability Office report on net metering, materials he provided to IndyStar upon request. But when asked about certain components of the bill, like how he reached the rate structure for net metering that will be in effect after the grandfathering period comes to a close, he responded with a verbal shrug.\""It was entirely arbitrary,"" he said. ""It's a public policy decision, as is everything else.""\""Utilities are titanics, and they don't shift their business model well. Their entire model is based on the idea that the more energy that is demanded, the more they need to build things and the more that increases their bottom line. From our per-spective, 309 is another way of keeping the barriers to self-sufficiency and self-reliance in place.""\Allyson Mitchell\Director of sustainability with Prosperity Indiana, a group that fosters economic development at the community level\CAPTION: \Solar panels are installed on a house.

105,"""People were interested in doing something toward an energy transformation in Kentucky."" Steve boyce\Berea college mathematics professor\BEREA, Ky. - The 4-year-old solar farm here isn't modest. It's tiny. Just 246 panels. Enough to power six or seven homes.\But it was the first in Kentucky of what insiders call ""community shared solar"" -- solar-electric systems that provide power or financial benefits to their members or participants. They're especially useful to people who cannot or do not want to put solar panels on their roofs but still want to offset their energy use with clean power from the sun.\More than 150 people have leased the solar panels in Berea. They paid a one-time leasing fee of $750 at an array built and run by Berea Municipal Utilities. In turn, the customers get a few bucks off their electricity bills each month for 25 years. Their return on investment will take two decades. But that wasn't really the point.\""People were interested in doing something toward an energy transformation in Kentucky,"" recalled retired Berea College mathematics professor Steve Boyce, a driving force behind the project. Participation was, he said, ""out of an urge to be able to do something when we were not getting any leadership on sustainability nationally nor in Kentucky.""\Kentucky still ranks near the bottom of all states -- 45th out of 50 -- for all renewable energy production, at 2.4 percent, and solar is barely noticeable at less than 1 percent of all electricity consumed, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. Indiana ranks much better for renewable energy production -- 29th -- but most of that is from biomass energy including ethanol production.\Cheap electricity rates from burning coal and now even cheaper natural gas -- and state energy policy -- still make it hard in states like Kentucky and Indiana for solar to compete on the bottom line. But that seems to be changing as the cost of solar falls and is expected to decline up to 12 percent per year through 2020, according to the Energy Department.\Despite its small size, the Berea example is stirring the imagination of the organizers of the new Solar Over Louisville push backed by Mayor Greg Fischer. It calls for 2 megawatts of solar capacity to be installed in Louisville this year. Community solar is one option those organizers are examining.\""It opens the doorway to what we could have,"" said Nancy Givens, a Solar Over Louisville volunteer, on a tour of the Berea facility in March. ""We're looking at how we can take baby steps. We still don't have policies in place, but we have a lot of interest.""\Indiana touts its sunshine, and Indianapolis was recently ranked second in the nation for solar panel capacity per capita behind Honolulu in the Environment America 2016 Shining Cities report. By contrast, Louisville was dubbed a ""solar beginner.""\Kentucky's 2008 energy plan found that the Bluegrass state has ample amounts of sun for solar power.\""People think we don't have enough sun, but we do,"" said Joshua Bills, an energy expert with the Mountain Association for Community Economic Development in Berea.\In states long dominated by coal, even utilities are starting to notice the sun.\Utilities explore solar\As grassroots solar power advocates press for state legislation to loosen utilities' grip on energy production and encourage more solar power including community solar farms, two big Kentucky Public Service Commission-regulated utilities are planning ways to join Berea and offer community solar options for their customers.\They are part of a national trend, according to a recent report by the Deloitte Center for Energy Solutions. Deloitte found that there was one such solar project in 2010 in the United States.\Now, 77 utilities administer 11 projects in 26 states, offering a combined capacity of 106 megawatts, the study found.\""Utilities are finding that shared solar allows them to grow their solar generation portfolios, developers are seizing the opportunity to expand their business offerings, and more customers have the chance to buy solar power,"" the study says. ""By unlocking value in each segment of the supply chain, community solar is evolving into a growth engine for distributed solar resources.""\East Kentucky Power Cooperative has 16 member-owned distribution co-ops with 527,000 customers in 87 counties. It plans to take a proposal for community solar to the PSC this spring. The idea is to construct an 8.5-megawatt solar farm on 60 acres near its headquarters in Winchester, then license solar panels to the cooperatives' members, who would then get credit on their bills for energy produced by the sun.\Important details such as how much the licenses would cost and how participation would affect members' bills are still being worked out, said Nick Comer, East Kentucky Power spokesman.\The solar farm would generate enough electricity to power about 1,000 homes, he said.\""We have members who are interested in doing this,"" Comer added.\Louisville-based LG&E and KU Energy officials said their customers have asked for something similar, so they are developing their own community solar vision. They believe customers are ready to help them invest in that vision.\Those solar panels could be ""on the lot next door or 50 miles away,"" or located on buildings or in parking lots, said John Malloy, vice president of customer service for LG&E and KU Energy.\In a program they also hope to get through the PCS this year, customers would pay a sign-up fee and subscription fees to help cover costs for the construction and operation of what they also call community solar.\LG&E's David Huff, director of customer energy efficiency, said participants would then get a pro-rated share of the electricity produced, similar to net-metering arrangements for customers who install their own solar panels on their homes or businesses.\Net metering credits customers owning solar panels with the electricity they add to the grid.\It's doubtful that the arrangement would result in smaller electricity bills at today's energy pricing, Huff said. Solar is still more expensive than coal or natural gas, LG&E officials said. But customers could find their investment a hedge against future rate increases, Huff added.\It's not community solar, but LG&E and KU Energy is preparing to dedicate its first solar array on April 19, just in time for Earth Day on April 22.\Crews have been erecting 45,000 solar panels on 50 acres in Mercer County adjacent to the company's E.W. Brown power plant. Those 10 megawatts should generate enough electricity for about 1,750 homes.\""It was put in at that size so we can get better experiences how solar is going to work in our company,"" said Scott Straight, LG&E and KU Energy's director of project engineering. He said it's expected to cost about 10 percent less than the budgeted $35 million, in part because the cost of solar panels fell rapidly during the project.\Electricity generated from that array will flow into the grid, just as at any other of the company's power plants.\LG&E and KU Energy is also this year developing a new program for large-scale industrial or commercial businesses that want to tap the sun while ensuring those costs won't be subsidized by other customers, Malloy said.\The Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission last year approved Duke Energy's 20-year agreements with two solar developers to purchase up to 20 megawatts of solar power for its Indiana customers. In January, Duke also proposed to construct a 17-megawatt solar facility at Naval Support Activity Crane, a Naval installation southwest of Bloomington.\Community solar obstacles\Indiana has a handful of utility-run community solar projects largely run by electric cooperatives, but the concept has not taken off because of legislative obstacles in Indiana similar to those in Kentucky, said solar advocate Laura Arnold, president of the Indiana Distributed Energy Alliance.\When she and other solar advocates discuss community solar, they describe an entirely different model from one put forward by LG&E and East Kentucky Power, where the utility is at the center.\They see regulated utilities' efforts to create more community-based solar projects as an alternative to supporting better, more open net metering policies and to keep control, Arnold said. That utilities have adopted the community solar name for their efforts even bothers some, said Bills.\Arnold said that different vision places a neighborhood at the center. Residents, businesses and churches come together to establish their own solar installation. And using net metering, the electricity it generates offsets each participant's bills.\But neither Indiana nor Kentucky allows what's called virtual or remote net metering, where customers share benefits of electricity output from a single solar power project.\And to really encourage community solar, Kentucky lawmakers would also need to raise the individual system size cap to require net metering above 30 kilowatt systems, so more than only a few efficient homes could be on one system, Bills added.\Indiana's net metering limit is larger, set at 1 MW systems.\Nationally, there's been tension between solar advocates and utilities, with utilities fighting to make sure all their fixed administration and power line maintenance costs are shared among all their customers, as many customers seek to lower their bills by generating solar power. That played out in a rate increase dispute last year with LG&E and KU.\Berea Municipal Utilities has more freedom because, as a city-owned utility, it doesn't fall under the regulation of the PSC. But it also has limits on its solar generation because of terms of its contract with Kentucky Utilities, said Ed Fortner Jr., the city's utilities director.\Still, he said, the small array has ""got a lot of publicity. But this is the future -- renewables, along with energy efficiency.""\Reach reporter James Bruggers at (502) 582-4645.\James Bruggers\Environment\By the numbers\Crews have been erecting 45,000 solar panels\on 50 acres\in Mercer County adjacent to the\company's E.W.

LOUISVILLE
\
Imagine a solar city in a leading coal state.
\
Increasingly, advocates and some public officials are doing just that in Louisville, as the price of using the sun to keep the lights on continues to fall.
\
While solar power is still a tiny fraction of the region's energy mix, solar panels on rooftops are no longer an extreme rarity. More people are calculating a solar bottom line in the black, for their household or business finances, as well as for Mother Nature. LG& E shows a 70 percent increase in homes and small businesses hooked up to solar since 2012, from 111 homes to 189. There were no such hook-ups prior to seven years ago.
\
""We'd been thinking about it for a while,"" said Louisville resident and musician Tom Cunningham, who had a solar power system installed by the Louisville business Avery and Sun last week. The panels were bolted down to a back roof on the Clifton home he shares with his wife, Lorraine Venberg. ""It's worth it economically, and it's something we wanted to do for the environment.""
\
The time it takes to recover the costs from solar investments has been dropping, helped out by federal and state tax credits and improved technology, according to solar installers and their customers. But while Louisville and Kentucky lag far behind the rest of the country in solar, advocates are seeing signs of change in a state that gets about 90 percent of its electricity from coal.
\
Solar farms have popped up in Bowling Green and Berea. Tennessee Valley Authority policies are making solar more affordable in western Kentucky communities it serves.
\
Kentucky is going to get its first utility-scale and largest solar array, a 10-megawatt facility to be constructed with tens of thousands of solar panels in Mercer County, owned and operated by Kentucky Utilities and LG& E.
\
And the Louisville Metro Council on Aug. 27 passed a strongly worded resolution in support of solar power, led by council members Rick Blackwell and Bill Hollander.
\
""It encourages the discussion and promotion of solar use on public and private buildings,"" Hollander said.
\
Dixie Do-Over
\
Metro Council is now turning its attention toward a possible ordinance that would increase financing options to businesses that want to invest in solar power, or other energy efficiency measures, while Blackwell is promoting a vision for solar-powered street lighting on Dixie Highway.
\
The ordinance would allow for Louisville to have what are called Energy Project Assessment Districts, which open up financing that can be paid back over as many as 20 years as part of property tax assessments. It would not involve public subsidies, Hollander said. ""Over 30 states have done this, and progressive states and communities have made this work, and I think we should, too.""
\
Blackwell envisions an Interstate 264-Dixie Highway interchange filled with wildflowers and dozens of solar panels, enough to power hundreds of streetlights along a corridor he said is illuminated now only by lights in business parking lots.
\
It's part of a Dixie Do-Over to make part of Dixie Highway more attractive and safer. He said the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet and the city's public works department have been pushing back, citing cost and safety concerns.
\
But the lack of streetlights is also a safety matter, Blackwell said.
\
Chris Poynter, the spokesman for Mayor Greg Fischer, said city officials are trying to work through the issues.
\
At the same time, the nonprofit Louisville Sustainability Council with a membership that cuts across business, government and nonprofit groups, is preparing a ""Solar Over Louisville"" campaign.
\
Organizers have tentatively set a goal of adding 2 megawatts of solar power by the end of 2016, when a 30 percent federal tax break on solar power is due to expire.
\
That could add a few hundred new residential solar power systems, supporters said. Currently, LG& E counts a little less than 1 megawatt of solar power from residential and small commercial customers. By comparison, LG& E and KU Energy's new Cane Run natural gas power plant in Louisville produces 650 megawatts of electricity.
\
As envisioned, Solar Over Louisville would be a ""strategic, focused, collective effort"" to integrate solar thinking across the city, said Colleen Crum, co-chair of a council committee that is coordinating the campaign.
\
A solar push is important for public health and economic development, making Louisville more attractive to young people and others seeking a cleaner environment.
\
""I think it's kind of sexy to be able to create your own energy on your own property,"" she added. ""There is a personal pride to say you are doing the right thing.""
\
But Louisville has a long way to go.
\
A recent report out of North Carolina State University ranked the city 50th of the 50 biggest cities for solar's value to consumers, in part because of a history of having cheap electricity powered by coal, and also because state, local and utility policies supporting solar power have lagged behind other parts of the country.
\
""We figure we have nowhere to go but up,"" Crum said.
\
How it works
\
Customers who have solar power systems installed on their homes sign up for ""net metering."" In effect, as panels collect energy from the sun, they run the home or businesses' electricity meter backward. When the sun sets, the meter goes the other direction, and for many homes, systems supply all the electricity needed, essentially wiping out electricity bills.
\
That's what LG& E customer attorney Robert Klein, who had a solar power system installed on his Louisville home earlier this month, said he's counting on. He said he expects a payback in about nine or 10 years, down from as many as 14 years just a few years ago. And, he said, he's convinced the solar power will boost the value of his home. Installers say the panels typically have 25-year warranties and are expected to last even longer.
\
The system was expensive, Klein said. But he added that in addition to being a good financial investment, he said he feels better about not relying on coal and helping to reduce his family's contribution to climate change.
\
Jeremy Coxon's SunWind Power Systems of Floyd County, Ind., did the work. Coxon said the economics varies according to the size of a home, its location and its efficiency. Typical systems can cost as much as a car, ranging from $10,000 to $30,000, and with good credit, financing can be found, Coxon said.
\
In addition to the federal tax credit, there is also a $500 state tax credit through Dec. 31.
\
Installing solar in Indiana can be even more complex, he said, as there is no state law requiring uniform net-metering policies. ""You can be neighbors and one person can be net-metered and other won't (be allowed) to connect.""
\
New power plant rules unveiled in early August could also boost the solar industry.
\
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Power plan set a goal of cutting carbon pollution from power plants by 32 percent by the year 2030, compared with 2005 levels. It is expected to reward states and utility companies that move quickly to expand their investment in solar and wind power, while facing a legal and political challenge from Kentucky and Indiana by political leaders who argue President Barack Obama is carrying out a ""war on coal.""
\
Still, some cities and states have been working to develop solar power for years, and those that rank better for solar have stronger renewable energy policies, and they often have utilities that provide more incentives for people to use solar.
\
State officials say there is plenty of sunshine. But they also note how solar energy can be politically polarizing in Kentucky, the nation's third largest coal producing state. In the most current Energy and Environment Cabinet's Land, Air & Water magazine, they explain some of that tension that exists between the state's utilities and solar advocates.
\
People who install their own panels tout the benefits of cleaner power for their communities and the utility. For their part, utilities see more solar panels on customers' homes as less electricity they can sell, while they still need to provide power lines and other overhead.
\
Balancing act
\
LG& E spokeswoman Natasha Collins described a balancing act to make sure all customers are treated fairly while the utility provides low-cost electricity. Her company sees net-metering as a subsidy to customers with solar panels because those customers are, she said, getting credits valued at the higher retail price of electricity as opposed to the actual cost to produce it, which is lower.
\
One battleground is over Kentucky's 30-kilowatt limit to residential and commercial solar power systems for participation in net metering. Nancy Givens, marketing director for Avery and Sun Solar Installations, said that shuts out most commercial businesses, which need more power.
\
Collins said LG& E will work with any business that wants to install solar panels, but acknowledges the financial incentives for systems larger than 30-kilowatts are not as great.
\
Solar advocates also point to something as ""community solar"" as another way to boost its use. It allows people to invest in solar panels in their community and get credit on their bills, as if the panels were on their rooftops. It's helpful for people whose homes may not be suited for solar power, because of shade, structural issues or historic preservation policies, installers said.
\
That could become more important as Louisville also pushes to restore a depleted tree canopy.
\
Berea has such a project, allowed by its locally controlled municipal power provider. LG& E is evaluating community solar, but also has fairness concerns, Collins said.
\
""We're committed to maintaining the most affordable energy supply for all customers and working to ensure that costs do not shift between customers and do not harm those who cannot afford solar panels,"" she said.
\
For her part, Givens argued that solar systems installed by homeowners and businesses actually help the utilities by avoiding costs of buying coal or other fuels.
\
""It puts energy on the grid they don't have to purchase,"" she said. ""It really helps with peak demand, which is the most expensive electricity. It also reduces transmission costs by putting electricity on the grid closer to where it's used.""
\
Givens and others, including Wallace McMullen of the Sierra Club, were celebrating Metro Council's solar power resolution recently adopted as a milestone and a way to push Louisville energy policies in a greener direction.
\
Fischer's sustainability plan calls for establishing citywide renewable energy goals and strategies. But that plan is more than two years old and those goals have yet to be worked out.
\
""At the end of the day, it's all about the math, and getting the math to add up,"" said Maria Koetter, the city's sustainability director. ""That's harder due to our historically cheap energy.
\
Citizens need to keep making requests, she said, adding the she welcomes a robust community discussion about renewable energy. ""We are going to get there. We can't be at the back of the pack forever.""

108,"Aide to Daniels cites\his accomplishments\By Lesley Stedman Weidenbener\lstedman@courier-journal.com\The Courier-Journal\INDIANAPOLIS - Democratic gubernatorial nominee Jill Long Thompson pledged yesterday to boost investment in so-called ""green jobs"" if elected and to make it easier for people to benefit from installing solar and wind technology at home.\Speaking at the Statehouse, the former congresswoman said incumbent Republican Gov. Mitch Daniels hasn't done enough to spur development in environmentally friendly businesses.\Thompson said the state needs to ""take a different approach to creating green jobs that will be good paying and that will help our economy and just as significantly will be of help to our environment.""\""I believe with the right leadership we can turn Indiana green,"" she said.\After reviewing Thompson's proposals, Daniels campaign spokesman Cam Savage said that ""all ideas are welcome."" He then ticked off environmental highlights from Daniels' first term.\""Indiana has made tremendous progress, including developing the world's first clean-coal power plant in Edwardsport, the nation's second-largest wind farm in Benton County and the world's largest soy-diesel plant in Claypool,"" Savage said.\Thompson's announcement was the first in what her running mate for lieutenant governor, state Rep. Dennie Oxley of English, said would be a series leading up to the Nov. 4 election.\Thompson, like Daniels, promised to emphasize buying state vehicles that can use alternative fuels and on requiring new state buildings to be more environmentally friendly.\She also said she wants to build on one of her earlier economic-development proposals, which would categorize counties in one of three tiers based on their economies. Firms locating in counties struggling with unemployment, growth and other measures would get higher incentives.\Thompson said yesterday that she would implement a ""green boost"" to that plan, giving eligible companies an additional one-time $500 tax credit for any environmentally friendly job created. And businesses that buy equipment to lessen their firm's environmental impact would get a new tax credit as well.\But her campaign has not defined what constitutes green jobs or investments. Thompson said some jobs -such as at wind farms - would obviously qualify . Others, such as at a factory producing fuel-efficient cars, would require more thought.\""You know a green job if you see it,"" she said. Then she added, ""We'll have to work to develop a good operational definition.""\Thompson proposed using half of the $35 million in annual funding for the state's 21st Century Research and Technology Fund to provide grants for startup businesses that are developing environmentally friendly technologies and energy.\She also promised to create a $10 million Clean Energy Fund to provide incentives for investment in clean-energy technology and renewable-energy projects. She did not identify a source for that funding, saying she would likely piece it together from several unnamed places.\Thompson additionally proposed to expand the rules for what's called net-metering, which lets homeowners and businesses using alternative energy sources - such as wind or solar power - get a break on their bills when they provide power to the electric grid.\That happens, for example, when solar panels produce more energy than a home needs, which means some of that power goes on the grid for use by others.\Thompson provided few details but said she would expand who is eligible for net-metering and what alternative energy sources qualify. Also, she said she would increase the amount of credit to customers for putting power on the grid.\Daniels has not yet unveiled any new policy proposals in his campaign. But even before Thompson's announcement yesterday, state Republicans were touting some of the governor's accomplishments with green technology.\According to the state GOP, Indiana is now home to nearly 20 biofuel plants producing ethanol and biodiesel. Those companies have made Indiana a top-five producer of biofuels in the nation.\The state's fleet of automobiles includes 941 vehicles than can run on E85, an ethanol-gasoline mix, and 1,881 vehicles that can use biodiesel. Also, Indiana now has 100 E85 pumps - the third-highest number in the nation.\In 2005, there were no E85 gas pumps in the state, Republican officials said.\Reporter Lesley Stedman Weidenbener can be reached at (317) 444-2780."
109,"A double whammy by Republicans threatens to decimate solar power in Kentucky, just as it's gaining a tiny toehold in the state, the industry and solar advocates fear.\President Donald Trump's new 30 percent tax on cheaper, imported solar panels announced this past week is bad enough for the growing businesses that have been installing solar panels across the state, said Steve Ricketts, co-owner and general manager of Solar Energy Solutions, with offices in Louisville and Lexington.\Now a bill introduced this past week by Kentucky state Rep. Jim Gooch, R-Providence, could be the death knell for hundreds of jobs and some small businesses, said Ricketts, a past board member of the Kentucky Solar Energy Society. The bill threatens to slash by more than two-thirds the amount of money residential solar customers can get back from utilities for producing electricity the homeowners don't need, adding several more years to the time needed for solar investments to pay for themselves, he added.\""It's a real one-two punch,"" Ricketts said of the Trump tax and the Kentucky bill.\Gooch, a longtime coal advocate and utility ally, did not immediately return requests for comment. But state utilities back his bill, and Chris Whelan, a spokeswoman for LG&E and KU Energy, said Gooch's House Bill 227 is a matter of fairness.\She said the bill ""protects all Kentuckians who do not want, or cannot afford, private solar energy by removing the unfair subsidy for private solar customers.""\It would also make sure ""future solar customers more fairly share in the costs necessary to maintain the energy grid.""\The national, industry-backed Consumer Energy Alliance is also weighing in, saying the bill will ""help make sure your energy costs are affordable.""\Solar advocates say they expect the bill to go before the Natural Resources and Energy Committee, which next meets on Feb. 1.\People already participating in what's called ""net metering"" in Kentucky would see no change for 25 years, according to the bill, which would go into effect almost immediately — on July 15 of this year.\But Ricketts said the Kentucky bill's language is vague enough to raise questions even about the grandfather clause that protects existing solar customers.\He argues that utilities underestimate the value of residential solar and called for an independent study before lawmakers act. Solar power in Kentucky is just a ten-thousandth of Kentucky's electricity mix, he said.\""This,"" he said of Gooch's bill, ""is a sledgehammer to kill an ant.""\The Frankfort fight is part of a national battle.\Solar power has been on a roll as the cost of solar panels has dropped and as they have become more efficient. But there's also tension between solar advocates and utilities, with utilities fighting to make sure all their fixed administration and power line maintenance costs are shared among all their customers.\In Indiana, a new law last year phases out net metering over five years, and Ohio just reduced how much utilities must pay for electricity generated on people's homes and businesses.\It's part of a national attack on solar by utilities, said Sarah Lynn Cunningham, a Louisville engineer and president of the Kentucky Conservation Committee, which advocates for environmental issues in Frankfort.\""They are trying to extend their monopolies into competing technology,"" she said.\Environmental advocates and solar businesses defeated a similar bill in Kentucky last year. ""But this one is worse,"" she added.\Not only would it reduce credits to customers with solar panels from a rate of about 10 cents per kilowatt-hour to about 3 cents per kilowatt-hour, it would also end the practice of rolling over savings from season to season.\Some people who spent thousands of dollars on solar systems for their homes do so because they're concerned about the environment and prefer to support a clean, renewable energy instead of dirtier, fossil fuels. Many, however, look at the bottom line, and that calculation could now change significantly.\As solar has improved, those investments can now be paid off in about a decade, he said. Gooch's bill could extend that to as much as two decades, he added.\The Trump move could add at least 10 percent more to the cost, he said.\Cunningham said she'd been conflicted about Trump's tax on cheaper foreign-made solar panels because it could encourage domestic production of solar panels. She said she bought solar panels made in the United States for her home, even at somewhat higher cost. But, she said she's been convinced that the president's move will also damage the rise of clean, solar energy.\Trump had long promised to boost manufacturing by cracking down on Chinese imports, and the solar case gave him his first big chance to do so, USA TODAY reported. Supporters say the tariffs will create U.S. manufacturing jobs.\But the Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group, said Monday that Trump's decision eliminate 23,000 solar industry jobs this year nationally.\James Bruggers: 502-582-4645; jbruggers@ courier-journal.com; Twitter: @jbruggers; Support strong local journalism by subscribing today: www.courier- journal.com/jamesb.\How to comment\The Kentucky General Assembly's toll-free message line to leave a comment for a legislator or an entire committee is 800-372-7181.\Solar in Kentucky 2017\National ranking: 41st (43rd in 2016)\Homes powered by solar: 2,177\Solar companies in state: 49 (15 manufacturers, 21 installers/developers, 13 others)\Total solar investment in state: $38.91 million\Prices: Down 55 percent in five years\Source: Solar Energy Industries Association\CAPTION: \Steve Ricketts, left, of solar-installation company Solar Energy Solutions, talks with Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer atop the Oxmoor Center.

111,"Louisville Metro Councilman Bill Hollander last summer featured those now-controversial solar panels on Mark Frazar's Clifton home, celebrating them as an inspiration of sustainability.\""Mark installed the panels for both environmental and financial reasons,"" reported the District 9 Democrat's June 25 newsletter. ""One way he is benefitting is net metering. Pursuant to state law, if an LG&E customer generates more electricity than a home or business uses, the excess electricity can be fed through the customer's meter and onto the electric grid and LG&E applies a credit toward future power needs.""\It was on that same day -- June 25, 2015 -- that the city Department of Codes and Violations cited Frazar for installing both a new roof and solar panels without first securing a Certificate of Appropriateness, according to documents obtained under the Kentucky Open Records law. The case goes to a review board on April 13.\On Friday, Hollander took to Facebook recall that same newsletter and to offer a defense of solar power in historic districts like Clifton, where there are extra limits on what people can do with their properties.\The newsletter features a weekly ""Sustainability Story,"" the councilman's Facebook post said, adding that it features ""someone doing a good thing for the environment.""\Hollander wrote that ""historic preservation is important,"" then quoted Henry David Thoreau: ""What is the use of a house if you haven't got a tolerable planet to put it on?""\Friday's front page of the Courier-Journal featured the conflict in a story that began like this: A Louisville resident's rooftop solar installation has collided with one neighborhood's historic preservation requirements, setting what city officials described as a first-of-its-kind architectural design battle.\Frazar installed them without first getting permission, and city officials have wanted him to move them to the back of his house so they are not visible from the street. But there, they won't be as efficient because of the angle of the sun, extending the number of years for cost recovery, he argues.\The reaction I've seen on social media been mixed, but generally supportive of Frazar.\""Our city officials keep trying to act like we're some bastion of progress, but yet they keep sticking to antiquated policies and stale ideas.

Owensboro Municipal Utilities' customers desiring to generate their own electricity and providing what they don't use to OMU will be able to do so if changes to a city ordinance are approved by the City Commission.
\
Last week, the City Utility Commission approved revisions to the ordinance that governs its electric rates. A new provision of the ordinance is entitled ""Net energy metering for renewable generation,"" which will open the door to OMU customers connecting their own wind- and solar-powered generation systems to the OMU system. The City Commission must approve the changes as well and is expected to consider them in November.
\
The utility commission previously approved a policy allowing customers to interconnect with OMU's grid. The net metering language contained in the rate ordinance sets out how the exchange of electricity between customer and utility will be measured and bill credits created. The language also sets out the responsibilities customers will have and the regulations that will cover customer-generated power.
\
Only wind- or solar-powered generation, or a combination of those renewable sources, will be allowed for connection to OMU. Customers will pay all costs of creating such generation and also pay for upgrades OMU will have to make to accept their power. Customers will not receive money for the electricity they provide to OMU, only a credit on their bill based on rates determined by OMU. All generation equipment and systems will have to be approved in advance by OMU for connection to its system. The amount of power OMU will accept from a single customer (no more than 100 kilowatts) and the total amount of nonutility generation (no more than 1 percent of OMU peak power) is included in the ordinance.
\
OMU spokeswoman Sonya Dixon said the utility has received requests from customers wanting to generate electricity.
\
""We've had interest from customers, and we wanted to respond to it and continue our dedication to the environment and the community,"" Dixon said. ""It seemed like a natural fit. ... We see it as a unique way to partner with our customers.""
\
Tim Lyons, OMU director of engineering and operations, said a customer of any classification would begin by filing an application with OMU describing what they have in mind for electrical generation. OMU would then perform a system impact study to evaluate the proposal and to determine if OMU would have to install upgrades to its system to accommodate the additional electrical generation.
\
Ben Hill, OMU manager of customer service, said two types of metering could be used to measure the two-way flow of electricity. The first would be the use of two separate meters, one measuring the use of OMU power and the other measuring power going from the customer's system to OMU. The second would be a single meter capable of measuring the flow of electricity in both directions. Customers will not be billed for OMU metering costs above the cost billed to all customers.
\
If the amount of electricity supplied by the customer to OMU is greater than the amount delivered by OMU to the customer, the customer would receive a credit for the difference on their next bill, based on the cost OMU incurs for energy it produces.
\
""Electricity will never go in both directions at once,"" Lyons said. ""We will either be sending or receiving.""
\
Electricity received by OMU from a customer will be distributed to other OMU customers, freeing up more of OMU's power to be sent to the open wholesale market, Lyons said.
\
The cost of home generation is still high, although falling, and OMU is not expecting to be flooded with applications, Hill said. Some customers have been given applications, Lyons said, but so far none have been returned.
\
""We're not required to do this, but it's something we wanted to do,"" Dixon said.
\
Customer installed generation systems must pass National Electric Safety Code standards, Lyons said.
\
""Of utmost importance to the safety of our employees and OMU customers is that these facilities be installed property,"" Lyons said.
\
""Before customers get too far down the road and buy something, it will be important to call our engineering and operations group and go over it,"" Dixon said.
